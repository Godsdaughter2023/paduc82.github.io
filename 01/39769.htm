            Hi Saito.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> I'll give you everything possible to try for sign-in failure so that at least something will work:
<br />
<br />First see the various troubleshooting steps here: 
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-10-account-password-from-login-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security/troubleshooting-log-in-issues-in-windows-10/e7f397aa-417c-4479-80cb-d69d20ef18cc">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-windows-password/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-w...</a>
<br />
<br />This could also be due to account corruption so see the fixes here:
<br /><a href="https://www.techbout.com/fix-corrupt-user-profile-windows-10-9139/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techbout.com/fix-corrupt-user-profi...</a>
<br /> 
<br />To access another account to try to fix corruption, or create a new Admin account to replace a corrupted account, see these steps enable the hidden Built-in Administrator used for emergencies like this. First try whichever method works here: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable</a>...
<br />
<br />If it blocks these by requiring a password, then see this tutorial for enabling Built-in Admin from Log-in Screen.  <a href="https://www.isumsoft.com/it/enable-hidden-administrator-account-in-windows-10-without-login/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.isumsoft.com/it/enable-hidden-admin...</a>
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m</a>.... Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only.
<br />
<br />Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor</a>...
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first.
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, on first screen press Shift + F10 to open a Command Prompt, or on second screen choose Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options, then Command Prompt.
<br />
<br />Restart PC, Sign into new Admin account, elevate the desired account by typing netplwiz in Start Search, opening the wizard, highlight desired account (tick box if necessary first), then under Properties &gt; Group Membership, change to Administrator. Save that and then if desired highlight and remove the old Admin account.
<br />
<br />If these fail then create a new Admin Account: <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a</a>...
<br />
<br />If that fails go back to Troubleshoot Options to try a Reset.
<br />
<br />If that fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. Everything needed to get the best possible Clean Install is here: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki</a>.... It is a better install than any amount of money can buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn what works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />There is a step included to rescue your files first if they are not backed up using the bootable media here:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            You will need to reinstall Windows 10 at this point. I know its a chore, but its the best option you have right now.
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<p><strong>original title: NO SOUND on a Windows Vista 32bit computer OS - What does "THE REQUESTED DEVICE REGISTRY KEY DOES NOT EXIST" mean? This is the message I get when trying to install a new sound driver.</strong></p>
<p><strong>NO SOUND on a Windows Vista 32 bit computer OS.</strong></p>
<p>What does <strong>"THE REQUESTED DEVICE REGISTRY KEY DOES NOT EXIST"</strong> mean? This is the message I get when trying to install a new sound driver.</p>
<p>I'm trying to fix this computer for my mom...&nbsp;it has no sound and I've been through endless hours&nbsp;with Microsoft technicians on the phone and on email... 15 hours on the phone and 70 or so emails sent and the same number received.</p>
<p><strong>Windows auto update did a Realtek HD Audio driver update installation&nbsp;on this computer on August 28th in the background while my mom was using her computer. The next day after the next restart the sound stopped working and the sound driver showed
 the yellow sign with the exclamation point saying it is corrupt.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This corruption may have been also caused by a Windows failed auto update installation of Vista Service Pack 1... there was a note showing that auto install failed in the auto update history log... needless to say I have the auto update turned off
 now.</strong></p>
<p>I've been through everything trying to re-install that driver with MS technicians and nothing works. I always get, "THE REQUESTED DEVICE REGISTRY KEY DOES NOT EXIST"&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the case with the sound driver installer downloaded from Realtek, Dell, and trying the one through the update panel... nothing works... I always get that same failure message.</p>
<p><strong>One of the MS&nbsp;technicians uninstalled the Realtek sound driver while connected to my desktop through MS Teamviewer and when he did that, the whole "Sound Video and Game Controllers" category in the device manager disappeared completely.</strong></p>
<p><strong>After that, the "Audio Device on High Definition Audio Bus" driver turned up under "Other Devices" and the "Sound Video and Game Controllers" category was gone. I'm not sure what that means.</strong></p>
<p>The "Audio Device on High Definition Audio Bus" driver still shows up as corrupt with the yellow triangle and the exclamation point, so it has to be disabled or the computer will not boot. This is also the case with 2 other drivers that have to be disabled
 but they are not being used by my mom on this computer.</p>
<p><strong>I've been through 2 attempts at In-place upgrade installations that have both failed,&nbsp;many many&nbsp;"start-up fixes" and "restore points" after all of this troubleshooting and failure... had to go into advance boot options, safe mode, etc.</strong></p>
<p>The Microsoft tech that I had been dealing with on the phone for 15 hours over the course of 10 business days finally gave up and just refered me to the MS Installations department to do a clean install and wipe out everything on my mom's computer and install
 all programs and internet set-up fresh... this is not a solution, but a cop out.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I've been writing a lot of emails and appealed to a Microsoft&nbsp;Manager who called me and told me that Windows update will NEVER send 3rd party software installations, but yet another Realtek Audio update is in the update panel right now being
 held at bay because I have update turned off.</p>
<p><strong>Has anyone ran the Microsoft "Fix-It" program successfully on their computer? I found it on the sound troubleshooting section of the Microsoft website, but it says it will install "Windows Powershell" and "Windows MSXML 6.0" to troubleshoot and fix
 problems,&nbsp;and I'm afraid what those will do.</strong></p>
<p>What does <strong>"THE REQUESTED DEVICE REGISTRY KEY DOES NOT EXIST"</strong> mean? This is the message I get when trying to install a new sound driver.</p>
<p><strong>HELP! My mom just wants the sound back on her computer?</strong></p>

<p>You can either repost or a mod can move it there. Anyway, since you know when the problems started, Aug. 28, have you gone to System Restore and see if there is a restore point prior to the 28th that you can restore the system to? Windows Update usually
 creates a restore point prior to updating. That is usually the easiest thing to do when an update goes bad.</p>

<p><span>Hi numetro,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Do you receive any error messages while performing in-place upgrade?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to re-install the motherboard chipset drivers and check if you get the sound back.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: To install chipset drivers</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Insert the drivers and utilities disc or download the chipset drivers for your motherboard from the computer manufacturer website and then install
 the drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: Perform a system restore</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform a system restore to the point when you had sound on your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>System restore</span></strong></p>

<p>Thanks for your suggestion Resourceful,</p>
<p>But the restore point options only go back to 9/4/2010, and my problem started on 8/29/2010... I clicked the "show restore points older than 5 days." box, but 9/4 is the oldest one it will show.</p>
<p>Is there any way to get further back?</p>
<p>I didn't even know about the restore point option until I was so far along on this safari with MS technicians that it was too late to go back that far.</p>
<p>Any other suggestions?</p>

<p><strong>Is there any way to get further back in restore point?</strong></p>
<p>I didn't even know about the restore point option until I was so far along on this safari with MS technicians that it was too late to go back that far.</p>
<p>I'm actually a Mac user and I'm just trying to fix this PC for my mom.</p>
<p>Any other suggestions?</p>
<p><strong>I have the origianl Dell drivers disk that my mom kept from this computer purchase, but Alok Das, the Microsoft technician that I spent so much time on the phone with, told me that installing the drivers from the original disk would not work and
 could cause other problems.</strong></p>
<p>I thought of that option myself and had the drivers disk in the computer and was asking&nbsp;Alok about doing that when he was mounted to my desktop through Teamviewer and talking with me on the phone, but he told me not to install all the drivers... now I'm
 afraid to do big installations for fear of it bringing down the whole computer, which has happened a few times already.</p>
<p><strong>The first attempt at In-place upgrade, it stopped early on in the second stage and just stopped... the second attempt seemed to finish and was in the fourth "completeing" stage and then just went to the black boot menu screen. I had a terrible time
 just getting back to being able to boot after that with doing "fix my computer" from the Vista installation disk, doing multiple start-up fixes and restore points, it almost did not come back.</strong></p>
<p>Oh, I have this post on several different threads.</p>
<p><strong>Do you know anything about&nbsp;the Microsoft "Fix-It" program offered on the MS website? I found it on the sound troubleshooting section, but it says it will install "Windows Powershell" and "Windows MSXML 6.0" to troubleshoot and fix problems,&nbsp;and I'm
 afraid what those will do. Do you know about those?</strong></p>
<p>One is offered at this URL:&nbsp; <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/gp/no_sound" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/gp/no_sound</a></p>
<p>And the other is offered at this URL: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/gp/no_audio_playback_windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/gp/no_audio_playback_windows</a>&nbsp; you click at the bottom on this page where it says "No, this did not fix my problem" and it takes you to "Run the diagnostic". I'm not sure if this is the same thing as the first one called "Fix-It",
 but they both say they will install "Windows Powershell"... what is that and what is "Windows MSXML 6.0"?</p>
<p><strong>I see you are with Microsoft support, and Alok Das who I was dealing with on the phone so much was a level 4 technician, I think... I see you have 5 medals by your name... does that mean you are level 5?</strong></p>
<p><strong>You seem to be more knowledgable based on what you are suggesting.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I sent one of the technicians, I think his name was Pankha, a "CBS.log" file and a "System Info Request" "MSINFO32" file that he instructed me to gather and send to him... I still have them.</strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Pankha&nbsp;said he could tell my sound board was ok but said the mother board is not recognizing the sound board... then I was transfered back to Alok for many many days of trying and failure with install attempts
 and In-place Upgrade failures.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Does this tell you anything?</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for your reply, any answers are greatly appreciated.</p>

<p><strong>NO SOUND on a Windows Vista 32 bit computer OS.</strong></p>
<p>What does <strong>"THE REQUESTED DEVICE REGISTRY KEY DOES NOT EXIST"</strong> mean? This is the message I get when trying to install a new sound driver.</p>
<p>I'm trying to fix this computer for my mom...&nbsp;it has no sound and I've been through endless hours&nbsp;with Microsoft technicians on the phone and on email... 15 hours on the phone and 70 or so emails sent and the same number received.</p>

<p><strong>This corruption may have been also caused by a Windows failed auto update installation of Vista Service Pack 1... there was a note showing that auto install failed in the auto update history log... needless to say I have the auto update turned off

<p><strong>NO SOUND on a Windows Vista 32 bit computer OS.</strong></p>
<p>What does <strong>"THE REQUESTED DEVICE REGISTRY KEY DOES NOT EXIST"</strong> mean? This is the message I get when trying to install a new sound driver.</p>
<p>I'm trying to fix this computer for my mom...&nbsp;it has no sound and I've been through endless hours&nbsp;with Microsoft technicians on the phone and on email... 15 hours on the phone and 70 or so emails sent and the same number received.</p>
<p><strong>Windows auto update did a Realtek HD Audio driver update installation&nbsp;on this computer on August 28th in the background while my mom was using her computer. The next day after the next restart the sound stopped working and the sound driver showed
 the yellow sign with the exclamation point saying it is corrupt.</strong></p>
<p><strong>This corruption may have been also caused by a Windows failed auto update installation of Vista Service Pack 1... there was a note showing that auto install failed in the auto update history log... needless to say I have the auto update turned off
 now.</strong></p>

            Have you tried simply&nbsp;rolling back the Realtek driver. I have had problems with their updates in the past and am very wary of them. Broke an ethernet port once and the only fix was to roll back the driver. As far as Microsoft "Fix-it" is concerned it is
 a super little program, install away.

            Hello. OK. Didn't catch that you tried the restore point. I didn't see that you tried to roll back the Realtek driver. In Device Manager, expand the appropriate device category. Right-click the device that has the bad update and select<em>Properties</em>
 . In the next dialog box, click the <em>Driver</em> tab, and then the<em>Roll Back Driver</em> button. Follow the prompts from there.&nbsp; I'm not understanding why the SP1 update is failing and with Vista you should be at SP2. It didn't seem like automatic updates
 were on if you didn't get SP2 yet the Realtek driver automatically installed. Weird. Another thing, when you install the drivers, do you right click and "Run as Administrator"? I'm really thinking a clean install would save you time and grief.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I know there must be a problem with the driver, so I've downloaded the Driver from Asus Support website. But... when I tried to install there is this error window that said:<br />
<br />
"Another version of this product is already installed." and apparently I cant install the new driver because there are still some old drivers in my laptop. what should I do? I cant Uninstall the driver from control panel.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Does Minecraft for the 360 have horses&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>My Daughter has asked for horses on on Minecfaft xbox 360 but I have told her I don't think they have them. &nbsp; She has mentioned they have them on the PC version but not 360.</p>

<p>Does anybody know if xbox 360 does have this option or if there are plans to do an online update etc?</p>

<p>Updates arrive every now and then. Rumours suggest horses will be added at some stage but you can never be sure. 4j are just finishing up the Xbox1, PS4, and PSVita versions. Everyone was talking about the 'Pretty Scary' update equivalent being released
 then - I presume in October sometime. Don't be surprised if they add horses then.</p>

<h2>            Where are my DLC Cars&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all I've searched ALL over and I cannot seem to find my purchased DLC cards from the LaFerrari or VIP DLC purchases?&nbsp; I finally found that I had to go into the Show All Add-Ons for Forza 5 and install each.&nbsp; I have logged into my XB1 and go into Free
 Play but I don't see ANY o my cars, except for a Ferrari.&nbsp; All the DLC cars have been installed, but I'm trying to use them in Free Play/Free Drive and NONE of them are displayed. Can you please point me to how I can use these DLS cars that I paid for, but
 don't show up anywhere?</p>

<p>Thanks as I am GOING INSANE!</p>

<p>Purchasing DLC cars does not automatically put them in your garage. You still need to purchase the cars with in-game credits. Turn10 has adopted a policy so far in FM5 where they gift one car from each pack into your garage. This is why you see the LaFerrari
 in Free Play. You should also see that the DLC Maserati in your garage. The rest of the cars need to be purchased with in-game credits before you can use them in free play, rivals, online, single player, etc...</p>

<p>Makes no sense to me why T10 changed the way Free Play works. &nbsp;You used to be able to take ANY car in the game (whether you've paid in-game credits for it or not) and race wherever, whenever you want...of course you couldn't customize anything, but it was
 a good way to test drive something if you were unsure whether you wanted to buy it or not. &nbsp;I don't understand how they are still calling it "Free Play" when it's really anything but that.</p>

<p>Thanks Crunch! &nbsp;I paid $10 for a bunch of stuff and I HAVE to purchase them again? &nbsp;I don't understand. &nbsp;So based on what you said, does that mean that my cars are available, but only in Career Mode? &nbsp;I've looked all around my garage and I can't find them
 anywhere and not sure HOW I can drive them, so hoping you can help me understand WHERE I go to find my purchased cars? &nbsp;This is a Train Wreck. &nbsp;I've been an XBoxer since 06 and never seen such a Train Wreck as this :-( &nbsp;Thanks for the response, appreciate
 your support :-) &nbsp;I guess the main point is "Why did I buy these DLC cars if I cannot use them in Free Play/Drive and WHY do I have to buy them again?" &nbsp;I spent ~$20 on a bunch of stuff and so far I cannot find JACK :-(</p>

<p>Sorry should have been more cool with my comments. &nbsp;Are you saying that I buy a DLC pack and THEN have to buy the cars again via Career Mode? &nbsp;I had thought I purchase the cars and could use them immediately but the only cars I see are the gifted cars, which
 make me buy them. &nbsp;I would have thought when I buy cars I can use them in the game, Free Play and Career, but none of them show up in My Garage and not sure how to find or use them?</p>

<p>MysticalRy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;You are buying eligibility to use 9 cars and gifted 1 car for each car pack but still have to purchase the cars with your in-game credits. No other players can purchase those cars unless they have the pack.

<p>Thanks guys, I appreciate all the input. &nbsp;I guess I'm just dense, I had thought when I bought the cars/packs that I would have the cars for use, like how Forza used to do it. &nbsp;I guess that has changed and I'm sure I'll get my head around what you guys are
 saying, I guess right now it just doesn't make any sense to me. &nbsp;Buying Eligibility makes NO SENSE to me at all, but I can't fight The Man, so I guess I'll just not spend any more $$ on cars/packs and just use whatever is in the game. &nbsp;I spent 1.5 days trying
 to figure out why I couldn't see what I bought, who knew I had to think about buying eligibility :-)</p>
<p>Forza Guys - PLEASE make this easier to understand. &nbsp;I'm very tech savvy and KNEW I could figure this out myself, I was just missing a button somewhere. &nbsp;Turns out this is a change in how Purchasing Cars/Packs works and I have NO DOUBT others will be as
 confused as me...signed Forza Idiot :-(</p>
<p>Thanks guys!</p>

<p>Am I the ONLY ONE who sees this methodology for playing additions to Forza 5 as a problem. &nbsp;Buy a Season Pass just to be eligible to purchase in-game vehicles IF I have enough credits. &nbsp;Forza's $49.99 Season Pass should include the very vehicles you've downloaded
 at no additional credit costs to the person buying the pass. &nbsp;</p>

<p>If you ask me it's BS. If you pay real money for the DLC you should have access without any restrictions. So glad I didn't buy DLC and I'm glad this was a free launch title.</p>

<h2>            Laptop screen tinted blue&#47;green</h2>
                    I have an ASUS G751, a little less than a year old, running Windows 8, and the screen suddenly developed a blue/green tint. I tried calibrating the color, but while adjusting the color sliders, it would seem to work for a moment but then it would flicker
 and the tint would come back with no apparent regard to the slider positions.

<p>... I have been updating Skype in the usual and regular way. However, I have since trashed my current version of Skype and downloaded the newest version and found my sound working fine. Thank you for your interest and reply.</p>

<h2>            updates KB3045999 and kb3046269 keeps installing successfully</h2>
                    <p>Windows 7 sp 1 home premium, 64 bit version. After last Tuesday (14/03/2015), updates KB3045999 and KB3046269 keeps installing successfully, but each day I am asked to instal them again. Several others on the same day failed to instal - KB2446710, KB2478662
 and KB2990214. I have tried many times to instal the failed ones too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see that KB2990214 is meant to be as part of a preview of a later version of Windows and only requested if you have visited their site (which I never have), but I keep getting offered it. KB2446710 and KB2478662 look a few years old, so I am perplexed
 why I am getting them now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking back at the update history, it has all been successful except that KB2990214 was the first to fail, on the 15/04/2015, then there were lots of successful instals, then KB2990214 failed again and I got into the situation described at the start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At one point Hotfix KB947821 helped (Update had stopped doing anything - cant remember the details now) but it did not solve the above problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have made no changes to the system in recent weeks. I have tried all the troubleshooters listed that I have found in MS helps which did not find any problems.&nbsp; I have not tried any registry fix (which is beyond me).</p>

There is no other system available in my home.&nbsp; It is very important to find the problem because my work depends on the system . . . and I am in the middle of a Major Project!&nbsp;

Paulette Embody Guess I need to print and study the forum methodology! The above is not an answer! However, a solution happened. While not suggesting any type of 3rd party clean-up software without being very careful and well backed up, System Mechanic 9.5
 is on my system. It is set to work in certain areas when my system is not in use. When starting this system, much trepidation was experienced. In my mind's eye, after printing suggestions from the KB's for a couple of hours at the office (since going on line
 on the "sick" guy at home was impossible), a defense attack was ready.&nbsp;The defense&nbsp;did not involve System Mechanic. However, after starting my system, I always give time for all the hungry virus/malware updates to finish. In the process, manual files need
 to be checked for followup, etc. Guess it took me longer than normal, because System Mechanic had a notice my Hard Drive and Registry had been checked for errors and a restart was required. I used the utility to back up the registry and set it to restart once
 the registry was "backed up". To my surprise, everything is working! Amazing! Paulette Embody (This is a most interesting forum. I have read several threads! Fantastic to know help is really available!)

            I was able to kind of circumvent this problem by creating another user account and I login with the new user and I was able to get to my important saved files through windows explorer and move them over to my new users document files same with pics and
 just about everything else the problem you have sounds exactly like mine I have never&nbsp;logged back into&nbsp;the old user account again but I have not deleted it either but that was over a month ago and my computer seems to be completly back to normal. Try going
 to the control panel and create a new user account and see if it will work for you as well.

 Here's what happened on my system&nbsp;(pasted from above).<br />

            While I thought the solution was solved, problems still remained.&nbsp; In early Feb., experienced a strange event when entering att email.&nbsp; A terrible screen appeared indicating my system was full of viruses and every time an attempt to get rid of the screen
 . .&nbsp; . it looped into an attempt to force me to buy virus software!&nbsp; This seemed a hoax and the fact the loop would not go away was irritating.&nbsp; In task manager, I finally killed the process and all seemed OK.&nbsp; This happened a second time a couple of weeks
 later.<br />
<br />
Somewhere in the process of all this, my system starting doing the items we have been mentioning!&nbsp; I have now read an extensive article from Panda, after A-Squared suggested my system was infected with Rogueware . . . and Defender found infected files, files
 which had been on my systems for years.<br />
<br />
Different systems have different problems, but many completely crash.&nbsp; This Rogueware is very sophisticated and seems to hide very easily from your defenses.&nbsp; You may wish to try running HiJackFree or visiting the A-Squared forum regarding this matter.&nbsp; Panda
 indicated they have started introducing methods to locate the problem as well.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
System Mechanic apparently cleared enough of the problems to allow me to start feeling OK . . . but now the rest of the story.<br />
<br />
Good luck<br />

<h2>            XBox 360 dvd drive won&#39;t read some discs</h2>
                    Pretty sure the discs are scratch-free... I suspect the drive is going bad. Is there any way to diagnose if that is indeed the problem?

                    So, I have Windows XP Home SP2. I had to format my computer, and reinstall windows. After completing the reinstall, windows wont even recognize that I have a LAN plugged in. I have a home network set up, but my computer wont show me any difference whether
 or not it even realizes that its plugged into it.<br />
The problem is, I cannot connect to my network, How can I fix this problem.

<h3> maxsverdlove  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Update 1 killed Advanced Startup &#34;Startup Settings&#34; Screen</h2>
                    <p>I only noticed this after installing Win 8.1 Update 1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sometimes need to boot with unsigned drivers support due to a custom hardware duplicator.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I usually shift-click restart and go to advanced startup and then navigate to the startup options screen. Click restart and then it gives me the choice to press 1-9 (option 7 is what I need).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it's not giving me the 1-9 options anymore. No matter what it does a normal boot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found WinAero's Boot UI tool which lets me enable it. But I don't always want to have to click enter to boot. I can't do an unattended reboot anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            <p>Hi Bennet,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your prompt response... but I think you misunderstood....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do understand the safety issues with running WIndows without driver signing checks.&nbsp; That's why I want an option to be able to reboot without the driver signing specifically for when I'm using my device.&nbsp; Which, btw, is a Microboards G3 Publisher (I spent
 well over $2000 for this machine, which worked perfectly on Windows XP and Windows 7, and even Mac OS X!!!&nbsp; But, the only way to get it to run using Windows 8 (after I paid and upgraded to it!) was to reboot into Option 7.&nbsp; But it's not allowing me to do that
 anymore!&nbsp; And although, I wish it would work normally, there really aren't any other options for this type of hardware out there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See https://support.microsoft.com/kb/2812822</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Which I tried applying, but the installer tells me it isn't applicable to my system!)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a similar problem.&nbsp; After I get to the screen which says "Restart", it then normallyrestarts and comes back up with the "Choose the option" "Startup Options" menu, so that I can press F1-F9.&nbsp; But it doesn't give me that screen and just does a normal
 reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I can run those bcdedit commands, but that will make it permanently work that way... I want a temp solution so I can reboot, use my machine (which I just spent $360 to repair - stupid driver belt dried out and refused to move) and then when I'm done.&nbsp;
 Reboot back to normal mode.&nbsp; This only started happening after installing Windows Win 8.1 Update 1 (which I did while my machine was back at Microboards) and now that I finally have my machine back, I can't reboot as necessary without a third-party app which
 sets the Advanced Startup options menu (that won't appear otherwise) to show on EVERY boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Btw, the program I'm referring to is: http://winaero.com/comment.php?comment.news.191 Boot UI Tuner .&nbsp; The only way I've been able to get the screen to come up is by ticking the Always display Advanced boot options instead of boot menu.&nbsp; Which although painless
 to hit enter during the boot process, still shouldn't have to.&nbsp; Btw, if I just show the boot menu, even pressing F8 to enter advanced option immediately starts a normal boot without bringing up those options first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I suggested the compatibility mode since you said that it worked fine in Windows 7. If you are not able to see the 1-9 advanced startup options, then most probably some system files are corrupt.
 In this case, I would suggest you to run a system file check to fix these corrupt files.

<p>Hi everybody,</p>
<p>I need help to fix this error.</p>
<p>My laptop always starts normally and works perfectly fine after it has crashed.</p>
<p>I am running XP/service pack3 on my laptop. Any suggestions what I should do or what is causing the problem?</p>
<p>Thanks so much!</p>

<p>That is a good start, but there are a lot of reasons for the 0X0000007E message.</p>
<p>To avoid trying things and guessing, do this:</p>
<p>Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation: &nbsp;McAfee, Norton, Spybot,&nbsp;AVG, Avira!, MSE, Defender, ZoneAlarm, PC Tools, Comodo, etc.</p>
<p>Have any recent hardware/software changes been made to your system since it last worked properly (including updates)?</p>
<div>Does the error occur at any particular time or activities - like playing games, watching videos, listening to music, etc.</div>
<p>Please provide additional information about your system:</p>
<p>Click Start, Run and in the box enter:</p>
<p>msinfo32</p>
<p>Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste&nbsp;the information back here.</p>
<p>There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to&nbsp;be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.</p>
<p>This will minimize back and forth Q&amp;A and eliminate guesswork.</p>
<p>For video driver information, expand the Components, click Display, click Edit, Select All,&nbsp;Copy and then paste the information back here.</p>
<p>For audio information, expand the Components, click Sound Device, click Edit, Select All,&nbsp;Copy and then paste the information back here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Download BlueScreenView from here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html</a></p>
<p>Unzip and run it (BSV installs nothing) and let it finish scanning all your dump files. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you double click on of the dumps, you will get some information about it (including the&nbsp;Caused By Driver field) and you may be able to spot the problem right away - especially if&nbsp;you see a pattern in the dumps where the Caused by Driver field is the same
 (start with that&nbsp;driver).</p>
<p>Select (highlight) one or more of the most recent dump files by clicking them and holding&nbsp;down the Ctrl key to select multiples files. &nbsp;Try to select just the most recent ones that&nbsp;relate to your issue (maybe five or so dump files to get started).</p>
<p>Click File, Save Selected Items and save the information from the dumps to a text file on&nbsp;your desktop called BSOD.txt. &nbsp;Open BSOD.txt with a text editor, copy all the text and&nbsp;paste it into your next reply.</p>
<p>Here is an example of the BSV report from a single BSOD that I initiated on purpose that&nbsp;shows the cause of the crash as the i8042prt.sys driver belonging to Microsoft Corporation:</p>

<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>It is a little time consuming,but there is no guessing about or trying things when you are done.</p>
<p>Take a look at your dump reports from BSV - they all three point to the same culprit:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Caused By Driver<span>&nbsp; </span>: mfehidk.sys</strong></p>
<p><strong>Caused By Address : mfehidk.sys+39fd2</strong></p>
<p><strong>File Description</strong><span><strong>&nbsp; </strong></span><strong>: McAfee Link Driver</strong></p>
<p><strong>Product Name</strong><span><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></span><strong>: SYSCORE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Company</strong><span><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></span><strong>: McAfee, Inc.</strong></p>
<p><strong>File Version</strong><span><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></span><strong>: SYSCORE.14.2.0.903.x86</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p>Your McAfee appears to be broken and contributing to your issue.</p>
<p>...and you mentioned a new McAfee update with a new interface, so I would conclude that McAfee has something to do with your issue since they are somehow present in every crash you have (it is not normal).</p>
<p>If you paid for McAfee, I would contact their support to see what they are going to do about it.&nbsp; They may have an answer, they may deny it or they may suggest your only solution is to reinstall your XP - or just live with it, but you can give them at least
 give them a chance if you like your McAfee. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Reinstalling XP is never an option for me, but it is easy for them since they don't have to actually figure anything out (like you are). &nbsp;Maybe something went haywire in the McAfee upgrade. &nbsp;Don't let them convince you to reinstall, repair or restore your
 XP.</p>
<p>You also could have some conflicts with your other antiwhatever softwares you have going - sometimes too much protection is a bad thing.</p>
<p>If it was me, I would uninstall McAfee completely being sure to use their special uninstall instructions here:</p>
<p><a href="http://service.mcafee.com/FAQDocument.aspx?id=TS100507" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://service.mcafee.com/FAQDocument.aspx?id=TS100507</a></p>
<p>Reboot and see how things look for a while without McAfee - see if you can run longer than usual without a BSOD.</p>
<p>I don't like McAfee anyway in the way it consumes system resources and it's mediocre protection so I will never use it, even if you give it to me for free. &nbsp;However, some people find it adorable. &nbsp;If your system works better without it, you can decide what
 is best for you - keep it and crash, or get rid of it and don't crash.</p>
<p>If you have more BSODs after uninstalling McAfee, we need to repeat just the BlueScreenView stuff again with the new crashes and fix what it says until you have no crashes at all.</p>

<p><span>I’ve just contacted McAfee and hope to get some help there (you can always hope, right).</span></p>
<p><span>Otherwise I will uninstall the program and see what happens.</span></p>
<p><span>Which Antivirus program would you recommend? McAfee came with the computer and the subscription is free for another year.</span></p>

<p>I hope they treat you right - don't let them give you that reinstall XP business.&nbsp; I have never reinstalled XP to fix any problem.</p>
<p>I like to run lean and risky so I have no real time malicious software protection.&nbsp; Then if I get infected (and I like to) , I can learn how to fix it.</p>
<p>I like to start fixing suspicious systems with MBAM and SAS, then I can get to a known starting point when I get started fixing things:</p>
<p>Download, install, update and do a full scan with these free malware detection programs:</p>
<p>Malwarebytes (MBAM): &nbsp;<a href="http://malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://malwarebytes.org/</a><br />
SUPERAntiSpyware: (SAS): &nbsp;<a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.superantispyware.com/</a></p>
<p>It would behoove your system to get MBAM and SAS and run them anyway while you are waiting.&nbsp; They only run on demand so it won't bog your system down during your day to day operations.<br />
<br />
I alternate between those two every couple of days and they update their definitions several times a day usually.&nbsp; The free stuff is a manual update/scan but you can pay for them to get more features and some people do.&nbsp; No single program knows about everything
 so you need a couple good ones and you need to stick with companies where malware prevention, detection and removal is their business.&nbsp; Therefore, that immediately excludes any Microsoft antiwhatever products - malicious software is NOT their business.&nbsp; Weak,
 weak, weak...</p>
<p>Some other popular ones that don't seem to cause too many performance problems are Avira! and NOD32 (Google for links).</p>
<p>I am not a McAfee or Norton fan for their performance issues and I have fixed a lot of "my system won't boot anymore" issues where somehow they may be involved in the picture...&nbsp; AVG is okay if you don't let it install all the options, but AVG is also weak.</p>
<p>I pretty much have some problem with just about everything ;).</p>

<p>Hi again,</p>
<p>I got rid of McAfee, they never responded to my e-mails and the online chat didn't work either. They have the worst customer service I ever ran into.</p>
<p>I installed Avira AntiVir and everything works fine, no more blue screens so far.</p>

            <p>Straight forward:&nbsp; Your account is toast possibly because you did not follow some straight forward rules about accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Always setup any recovery options available for online accounts.&nbsp; Alternative email accounts,&nbsp;text messaging, questions &amp; answer reset options, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Utilize different passwords for accounts - otherwise if ONE account gets compromised, then they all do.&nbsp; Probably your house key is/was different than your office key is/was different than your car key is/was different than your lock box key - and for
 good reason.&nbsp; Security is/always has been a layered thing because it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Straight forward: This is a peer-to-peer forum - means we are the same as you.&nbsp; No special access, no special powers.&nbsp; All we can do is give you advice *if* there is any to give.&nbsp; While some of the people here might have more knowledge on a given subject
 than others - most of them (there are a few Microsoft employees that frequent these groups - none that could likely *actually* fix anything directly -but they are here) are just volunteers that do something else for a living and happen to know a lot and are
 willing to give their time to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Straight forward: "old timers", I think you will find that some of the people who help out the most here have been doing it for a long time and are, quite possibly, older than you.&nbsp; It's not an "age" thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people helping here are septuagenarians and
 octogenarians.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Straight forward: Just like everything else in life - if there is something you cannot do, you either have to teach yourself, find some way of learning it and/or pay someone else to do it for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your email account (no idea which one because you gave your full email address and these forums will hide that because it can be farmed and used to spam you (for one thing)) has been 'lost' to you somehow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You haven't really given much to go on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everyone here assumes it was a Hotmail, MSN or Windows Live account because you have made the assumption these peer-to-peer forums about the Windows operating system (nothing to do with your email - you could likely get your email on an iPhone, iPad, Macintosh,
 Android phone, some "smart" television sets, etc and so on; so the Operating System doesn't matter in most cases)&nbsp; would 'have someone who controlled your email' on them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So - straight forward - if you want assistance, you have to be willing to provide information in the best manner you can and ask for further assistance when you do not understand what is being asked of you.&nbsp; Just like the rest of life.&nbsp; ;-)</p>

            Hi Mary, 
<br />
<br />Is Sage requiring that .NET 3.5 be installed? One of my apps kept bombing out, and it was because of this. 
<br />
<br />Is this a personal PC, or part of a domain where updates are managed by WSUS? 
<br />
<br />Let me know, and I’ll do whatever I can to help!
<br />- C

    <title>Windows 10 Crashing Multiple Ways - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> will kaufmann  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Crashing Multiple Ways</h2>
                    <p>Hi all:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I experienced a few different "crash" issues with my computer as of late. </p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) I received error messages "Microsoft Windows is not responding" with the option "end task" or "cancel." When I hit "end task," the background Windows goes black (literally) but the programs running remain active, though un-navigable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(2) Green screen (see attached image). I ran a full Windows Defender scan last night and this is what I saw this morning.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4604d6f5-d273-4044-ba67-d8a96d328dcd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4604d6f5-d273-4044-ba67-d8a96d328dcd" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>(3) "Reboot and select proper boot device." Pretty straight forward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my system - home built about three years ago. This is the first time I encountered issues like this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-ASRock Z87 Xtreme ATX MB</p>
<p>-Intel core i5 4700</p>
<p>-NVIDIA geforce GTX 560 Ti</p>
<p>-Samsung 120GB 840EVO SSD</p>
<p>-Crucial 16GB RAM&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps taken thus far:</p>
<p>(1) Updated MB BIOS using instant flash. This may have solved above issue (3), I believe.</p>
<p>(2) Started computer in "Clean Boot" and determined there was a conflict with Webroot Security; uninstalled Webroot. Did not solve any issues.</p>
<p>(3) Ran spybot search and destroy: the scan got caught up on "Win32.Kolweb," a potential trojan virus. After stopping the scan, I restarted the PC and ran the Windows Defender full scan with the intention of removing the possible threat. That gave rise to
 above issue (2).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that I built the PC with Windows 8 and I have updated the Windows platform continuously thereafter. Also, I recently enrolled in a Microsoft Office subscription, which is about the time when these problems arose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help! Thank you in advance for the assistance with this matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I will not be able to access this PC for 12 hours from the time of this post, so I apologize for my delayed response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>I am still experiencing issues with my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I started the computer in safe mode and ran Spybot Search and Destroy malware scan. I also disabled a number of startup programs and did not determine there were any conflicts. I restarted the PC and ran Windows Defender's offline scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC booted quickly and fine thereafter, and Google Chrome ran very well. I still encountered crash issues soon thereafter (maybe 2 minutes after booting), as can be seen in the attached pictures. Also, the picture shows another issue I am encountering
 with the WNDA3100 adapter, but I believe that issue derives from Netgear's software, not the crashing issue at hand.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/42b77d8e-82c3-47c8-8793-31dab112f214" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/42b77d8e-82c3-47c8-8793-31dab112f214" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that when I click "end process" here, nothing happens. The computer is frozen such that I can "click" the button, but there is no result. Eventually, the PC may revert to a black screen as shown in the following picture:</p>

<p>Thank you for the update, Will. As we can see your computer is already having multiple corrupted system files. What we can do to resolve this is to perform a repair upgrade using the Windows 10 ISO file, here's an

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the assistance. I performed the repair upgrade per your recommendation but that did not resolve the issue. Furthermore, I did a complete clean installation of Windows 10 (wiping all programs, but retaining all files) which also did not resolve
 the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The continued error of Microsoft Windows: The application is not responding. The program may respond if you wait. Do you want to end this process now? Will pop up within a few minutes of booting. Additionally, the computer never responds regardless of how
 long I wait. If I hit end process, it freezes the computer indefinitely until I have to hard-reset the system. I believe I traced the issue to the Windows 10 update from August 2017, near when this problem began. Unfortunately, Windows 10 does not create system
 restore points by default; therefore, I do not have a restore point prior to the August 2017 update to which I can roll back the system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I am out of ideas. Any further recommendations short of wiping my data/hard drives are appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Considering that I built the PC myself, that would require contacting each hardware manufacturer individually and it is also unclear which component may be at issue.

<p>I took the computer to an IT consultant and he troubleshot the errors. We suspect the Windows 1703 build was the issue but did not confirm by wiping the hard drive. Instead, I elected to replace the booting hard drive as it was four years old and out of
 warranty. Including the cost to switch from the Samsung 840 EVO 120GB to a Kingston A400 240GB, the repair was $180 for anyone who may be curious.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a side note, the IT consultant commented that my build was the fastest computer he ever worked on, so for anyone wondering about the above-listed component combination, it works!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you all for the help on this error. For reference, we confirmed the error by just letting the computer sit after boot up. Eventually (typically within 10 minutes), this error would appear:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The application is not responding. The program may respond if you wait. Do you want to end this process now? Will pop up within a few minutes of booting.&nbsp;</span><span>Furthermore, the
 computer would freeze in its "rest mode" and not awake, requiring a hard power cycle.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>John Sarc,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe you are misunderstanding the question in this thread. &nbsp;The error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">"we are still trying to determine the feature capabilities"</span></p>
<p>is appearing on the potential receiving Windows 10 PC - not a transmitting mobile device.</p>
<p>Additionally, please understand that this is not a "Continuum" question. &nbsp;This is a question regarding Windows 10 Miracast reception.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, part of the problem is that the error message is nonsensical. &nbsp;Someone with better English language skills needs to re-write the error message so that it provides an explanation of what error is occurring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*************************************************************************************</p>
<p>Below are steps recommended by AirServer to de-bug Miracast problems on a Windows 10 PC. &nbsp;I would think Microsoft would have similar suggestions somewhere:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you are unable to start Miracast services on a <a href="http://support.airserver.com/customer/portal/articles/1746310-airserver-universal-system-requirements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
compatible Windows 8.1 or Windows 10 computer</a>: </p>
<ol>
<li>Try disabling the WiFi adapter and then re-enabling it again.</li><li>If Cisco VPN client is installed on the PC, make sure that <a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security/vpn-client/45102-vpnclientfaq.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
"stateful firewall" is turned off</a>. Also ensure that "Deterministic Network Enhancer" which gets installed with Cisco VPN client is disabled.</li><li>If VirtualBox is installed on the PC, disable the "VirtualBox Bridged Network Driver".</li></ol>
<br />
If the steps described above does not resolve the issue, follow these advance troubleshooting steps:<br />
Warning: This procedure will delete all WiFi settings, including passwords remembered for known Wireless networks.
<ol>
<li>Obtain the latest NDIS 6.4 WiFi driver/software for the WiFi adapter on your machine.</li><li>Quit AirServer Universal.</li><li>Open Device Manager and locate the WiFi adapter which can be found under Network Adapters.</li><li>Right-click the WiFi adapter and choose Uninstall.</li><li>When promoted to confirm, also enable "Delete the driver software for this device" and proceed.</li><li>Restart your computer.</li><li>Install the latest WiFi driver/software from Step 1.</li><li>Launch AirServer Universal.</li></ol>

</p><p>Thanks for the tip - but, Wi-Fi Direct is functional on my PC and works perfectly with Apple AirPlay and Google Cast.&nbsp; It is only Microsoft Windows Miracast that is not working.&nbsp; This is not a hardware or network problem.&nbsp; This is a problem with Microsoft
 Windows Miracast not working on a generic Windows 10 PC.</p>
<p>***********************************************************************************************************</p>
<p>UPDATE 3/24/2017:</p>
<p>Miracast has now started working when I upgraded to Windows 10 build 15063.0</p>
<p>Either 15063.0 fixed a bug in an earlier version of Windows 10 or a corruption of my wireless LAN adapter driver or some other Windows 10 component corruption&nbsp;was repaired by installing Windows 10 15063.0</p>
<p>My problem has been solved.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still experiencing this problem after reinstalling windows 10. I have tried following all of the steps above. The connect feature worked on my laptop before the creators update, but I am receiving the same error as sgonazalezp90 (see above). Please
 can you identify the drivers/instructions required so I am able to cast to my TV? I also seem to be missing the "Microsoft Wi-Fi Direct Virtual Adapter" driver in the screenshot above, can I please have some information on how to obtain this driver. Here is
 a screenshot of the drivers I have already -</p>
<p>

</p><p>I had 2 of these "Microsoft Wi-Fi Direct Virtual Adapters"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I right clicked and uninstalled both of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then Right clicked and did "scan for hardware changes" which installed only 1 back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then checked back in "projecting to this pc" and the error message was gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.</p>
<p>For those saying they can't find the adapter you need to do as shown in the image to "show hidden devices" first</p>
