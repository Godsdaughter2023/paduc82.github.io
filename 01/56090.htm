<h2>            F8 not working on license agreement page on WIndows XP installation</h2>
                    <p>I've formatted the drive and in the process of installing Windows XP on my desktop using the supplied Dell CD. When I get in to the the License Agreement page, i scrolled all the way down the screen and saw options ' ESC and F8 ' . I hit ' F8 ' on my keyboard
 and seems the ssytem was not responding until I tried to hit ' ESC ' wher it just aborted the install process. I've re-tried the sam eprocess where I hit ' F12' and boot from CD dirve and got the same results.</p>
<p>Does &nbsp;anyone have an &nbsp;idea what I need to do or did I missed any step?</p>
<p>Your kind attention to this inquiry is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Insignia headphones ns-cshbte02</h2>
                    <p>My headphones will only connect to my cell phone (Samsung galxay s7) and none of my other (windows 10) devices (2017 Dell Laptop w/built in bluetooth, 2016 Dell desktop w/bluetooth adapter, 2018 Surface Pro). All 3 can "see" the headphones, just not connect.
 The headphones had actually connected to my surface pro the first few weeks I had it, but now when I hit connect, nothing happens. So I suspect it is a windows 10 issue. Is there some way to run a diagnostic to make sure my bluetooth is working?</p>

            Hi,  
<br /> 
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />
<br />You can try the following procedures below:
<br />
<br />I suggest you to follow the troubleshooting methods listed below:
<br />Try to run the Apps troubleshooter to fix issues that may prevent app from working properly in the link below:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402749...</a>

<br />Go to Hardware and Sounds
<br />Click on Sounds
<br />Go to the Playback tab
<br />Select your headphones and click on properties

<br />Let the update download automatically
<br />Once this is complete, plug in your headphones to check if it works
<br />

            Where exactly in Windows 10 did you copy the photos: Pictures folder, desktop, Documents folder?
<br />
<br />Did you look in the OneDrive folder in File Explorer if they are there?
<br />
<br />Can you open the Photos app, right click on a picture, then click File Info? It should tell you the path of the photos (if they there).

            You couldn't have copied the pictures into the correct place if you did it before you set up your Account.  They must be in another Account that was set up by the store, so check now at C:\Users for other accounts and go through their folders, copy into your own User Account folders.
<br />
<br />Here's how to copy groups of files:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br />Otherwise use the backup to copy the files into your own Account.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            unable to install hp 3600dn 3600n 3600 colour color printer</h2>
                    <p>Reference to mmagda post</p>
<p>
</p><p>After calling HP Business support where they told me the print drivers for Windows 8 / 8.1 64 bit would not work on an operating system higher than Vista (I refused to throw out and give up on a perfectly good printer) I
 did the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to download the drivers on my lap top that has Windows 7. It worked perfect. Then I decided to try the same method on my Windows 8.1 64 bit.&nbsp;<span>Installation was fast, easy, and works perfect.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This is what I did</span>:</p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Uninstalled the hp driver for 8.1 in the control panel.</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Uninstalled the dot4 driver in the control panel.</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Uninstalled HP help and assistant from the control panel.</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Downloaded the Windows 7 64 bit driver from www.hp.com.</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Plugged in the 3600n printer with a usb port to my computer.</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Went to Device manager selected add a printer.</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Selected "printer not listed".</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Selected add a local printer and changed lpt1 to usb virtual printer.</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Selected have disk.</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Selected browse and found the HP installer 3600 folder in the c directory.</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Selected driver folder.</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; Selected x64 (64 bit - xp_s2003_vista).</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; hpc3600w.inf appeared in the window and selected open</li><li>&nbsp; &nbsp; C:\HP_CLJ_3600_Installer_WW\Drivers\x64(64 bit - XP_S2003_Vista) appeared in t
<p>
</p><p>Was extremely helpful, and was able to install the HP 3600 printer on Windows 10 system</p>
<p>The trick was to remove Dot4 and all 3600 drivers installed earlier. Then go to hp site and select you operating system as a Windows 7</p>
<p>and install the 147mb size file for 3600 printer, install it manually as described my mmagda&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
This 2006 model printer is still going strong and is better than many of the latest printers, and with the help of people like mmagda
</p>
<p>we are able to get more juice out of this fine piece of technology, which otherwise is rendered obsolete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot</p>

<p>I want to use the Xbox controller as a gamepad to play games on my PC, but I cant find a list of all such games which can accept the Xbox controller as a gamepad. Is there a central list I can check to see if the PC game supports the Xbox controller?</p>

<p>It will usually say on the store page if the game supports a controller, or on the back of the box.</p>
<p>However this list seems fairly comprehensive <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_games_with_XInput_support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>I maybe VERY wrong but, &nbsp;A Xbox console contoller is different from an Xbox PC controller.</p>
<p>If you purchase an Xbox Pc Controller it will work with PC games that support the configuration.</p>
<p>A normal Console controller is not usable on a PC without the right cable and drivers.........</p>

<p>A wired 360 controller will work regardless of whether it's "for pc" or the 360 however for wireless controllers you need to buy an adapter. Play and charge kits wont work.
</p>
<p>Anyways, probably at least 75% of the games that are on steam have controller support available. Votes list is good if you're looking for big titles but you'll probably have a very hard time of finding a list of every pc game with support.

<p>Thanks Bon3zz1001, I have the Xbox controller and the adapter (USB on PC) all setup and working fine.</p>
<p>The steam list seems to be the best bet. An interim way to search on a windows 8 PC is to actually search for Xbox 360 controller support in the store. That popped up a few names too.</p>

<h2>            I cant get halo to recognize my old xbox 360 and join network to play multiplayer 8 people</h2>
                    I have added a xbox one to our consoles since we have enjoyed our 360 so much. I know you can play Halo up to 8 people by setting up system link. The game can recognize my 360 that is trying to join but when I hit x to join players on other system it says
 "Unable to Join The Party may have an incompatible network setup. Your setting OPEN NAT, is usually compatible. Visit halo.xbox.com from more information.

<p>Are you trying to system link between Xbox ones that are playing the Halo: Master Chief Collection and Xbox 360s that are playing the Xbox 360/Xbox Original versions of those games? I'm pretty sure that cross-play between Xbox One and Xbox 360 versions of
 the games will not work. You can cross-play with the Xbox 360 version of the games on both consoles, for example, Halo 3, Halo 3: ODST and Halo 4 are backwards compatible on Xbox one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will either need all Xbox ones playing the Halo: Master Chief Collection or all Xbox 360s running the Xbox 360 Halo game of your choice.</p>

            To add to what ChiefJoboo said, all Xbox 360 era Halo games are backwards compatible.&nbsp; This includes Halo: Reach, Halo 4, and Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary.&nbsp; You would need to be running Xbox 360 copies of all games to be compatible.

<h2>            Windows Vista Workgroup, Where do I put the password</h2>
                    I have 4 computers, 3 are windows 7 and 1 is windows Vista. We have a workgroup and everything set up, all the computers can see each other, there is a &nbsp;password, the windows 7 computers can all use the workgroup fine but the windows vista for some reason
 doesn't let me put the password in. It can see the other computers and has all the settings right, but when I try to access another computer is says that it does not have the privileges required, the computer does not accept blank passwords. Where do I put
 the password into the Windows Vista Computer, no matter where I search I can't find it.

            I am experiencing the same problem. It does not show any error messages. The problem started a few days ago, and I do not believe that I made any changes prior. I have tried restarting the computer using shell commands such as ms-settings-Bluetooth: and
 it does the same thing. I am unable to check if there are updates available either.

            <p>I, too, am having this issue. My computer was blue screening on me, so I updated it. The blue screening stopped for a few days, then started again, and suddenly I could no longer access settings. Tried making another account per the instructions I found
 on this site. Didn't work. Tried sfc&nbsp;/scannow, got an error. It basically said it couldn't complete the operation. Tried safe mode. Nope. Tried resetting Windows 10 to factory settings while keeping my personal files. Nope, again. Got an error. I bought an
 external hard drive and backed up all my personal files. Going to try a fresh install of Windows 10 probably tomorrow. Hopefully, it will work.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Fallout 4 and Xbox One error code&#58; 0x80830003</h2>
                    
<p>Greetings!</p>
<p>One word: Help!</p>
<p>I get this message with 750GB free space on my local machine. The number of saves I can have for the game (Fallout 4) keeps getting smaller. I am down to four. From what I have read on other forums, it seems people are blaming Microsoft and cloud storage.
</p>
<p>I have tried playing off line. That worked for a little bit, but the message came back. There are a lot of other suggestions. What I have&nbsp;not seen yet is any "official" comment about this error code.</p>
<p>I paid a lot of money for my Xbox One just so I can play Fallout 4. It appears at the rate that my allowed saves are falling, in a few days I will not be able to save at all.
</p>
<p>My next step is going to be to delete the save from local storage and hope the console re-syncs to the cloud.</p>
<p>Does anybody out there have any official word on the root cause of this problem and if not when it will be fixed, at least a work around?
</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I don't know if you have read any of my messages about that issue. But I posted a lot about it. and I'm as frustrated as you are. there could be many issues causeing that, and so far Bethesda has not responded about it. But in my case I found it is a cloud
 issue. And so I try to keep my game save about 230 megs. you can see the game saves when you go to the dashboard highlight the game Icon and select manage game. on the right hand side you will see how big your actual game save is.I have a slow internet connection
 basic DSL. So when I exit the game I leave the machine on for it to upload to the cloud. that takes about an hour then I can turn my Xbox off. I know that's not the issue you're having but if the cloud system is out which has happened during game play before,
 it can not upload to the cloud, making your game saves broken. I have noticed that everytime I go to a new place in the game fast travel or what not, like sleep, it does an autosave, automatically tries to reupload the game to the cloud as soon as it does
 a save to the hard drive. if there's an internet connection issue like any lag in your internet that can also cause an issue. also I've noticed that if you do play offline it seems to work smoothly but going back online with your Xbox any time will automatically
 try to sync up your getting to the cloud and you'll lose all your game play that you've been offline. that's happened to me more than once so I don't play offline anymore. it still could be a problem with your hard drive also because when I first experience
 the issue back in January, I had to delete a lot of game saves because each one of them were getting corrupted as I was trying to save. I was down to 3 like you. getting scared &nbsp;I was going to lose my game progress. what also doesn't help is that you can't
 back up your game saves to a flash drive like you could on the 360 with Fallout 3 or Vegas. that made it easier to keep track of your game and not have a fear of losing it. :-)</p>

<p>Dear fellow gamer,</p>
<p>1.<span>First let's try clearing your persistent storage. Make sure there is no disc inside the console.
<span>Please go to Settings &gt;&gt; All Settings &gt;&gt;Disc &amp; Blu-Ray &gt;&gt; Blu-Ray&gt;&gt; Persistent Storage &gt;&gt; Clear Persistent Storage.<br />
<br />
</span>2.<span>Next, we will go ahead and remove your profile from the console. Before you do that, make sure you know the email address and the password of your account.<span>Please go to Settings &gt;&gt; All Settings &gt;&gt; Remove Accounts &gt;&gt; Select your account and
 remove it.</span></span></span><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.<span>Next, let's try to reset your console settings by clearing your alternate mac address. Please go to Settings &gt; All Settings &gt; Network &gt; Network Settings &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; IP Settings &gt; Automatic &gt; DNS Settings &gt; Automatic &gt;
 Alternate MAC Address &gt; Clear &gt; Restart</span><br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>4.A<span>dd the profile back on the console. Go to Sign-In &gt; Add and Manage &gt; Add New /it means -&nbsp;your usual or the same&nbsp;real profile removed before/<br />
<br />
</span><br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>5.T<span>ry to launch the Fallout 4 game now and see if the issue persist. The most important thing is Synchronization - if You ll get 100% You will get solution!!!</span><br />
</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>Mentioned steps are the complete steps that would resolve issues with the game saves. I did it all&nbsp;with help of Xbox Support Operator
<span><span><b><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Jerick J.</span></b></span></span>...at the end of chat session he said:
<span><span><b><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Jerick J.:</span></b></span></span><span> I will go home with a smile on my face because I know I was able to help you even in my own little way.</span> /...!!!.../ My advise is do not wait do not loose one save after
 another until you will have one last save!!! and do not hesitate to contact Xbox Support Operators like Jerick will asist You step by step, trust me. I will not speculate what causes this issue, maybe i pushed this game too hard, or did too many Far Harbor
 endings, I reloaded previos save just because of one bloody part of Legendary Recon Marine Armor so i had to blow out Nucleus once again, watch judgment of DIMA again and&nbsp; bring Katsumi back home again&nbsp;etc etc....I do not know what i did wrong -/ i&nbsp;use no
 mods no cheats - nothing!/ -&nbsp;it just happened... but i couldnt sit back and wait for next patch or fix or another improvement of improvements. I still think that it is duty of Bethesda to fix this issue, but thanks to Xbox support my game today runs smoothly....no
 reinstall needed - it is useless....starting a "New Game" solves nothing - this is my 4th "New Game" ;)</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span><span><span>All right, Good luck!!!<br />

<p>that is not a guaranteed solution. back in January they gave me the same exact list of items to do exactly what you said as if you were typing it out word for word. It only worked temporarily because a few days later the issue was back again so doing that
 was pointless. As I tried it again and it did not work. I contacted Bethesda and they told me to play offline. Which I tried to do that the second time. But all of a sudden going back online again I lost all my offline game save. It's happened 3 times since
 then.&nbsp;I tried to explain that to the other person who had the same problem and posted another thread in this forum. it's an issue that is related to both the Xbox console itself and the game. The game save files if you read my other posts are saved in a way
 where it uploads to the cload as soon as you do a save but it uploads one huge file to the cload automatically &nbsp;instead of the individual smaller games slot files. &nbsp;being the console relies on a system that is not reliable. which is what's corrupting your
 game saves and destroying it. It's going to keep happening as long as the cloud is there. It may run temporarily but give it time it will go again. and you lose game saves. &nbsp;so there's no real fix for this issue at least at this time unless they give us the
 option to back up our own game saves to a flash drive. other than that the issue will continue to remain with this game.</p>

<p>I would like to also add that I've been playing the game and maxed it out completely for the achievements even with the new DLCs. I have found a way to bypass that problem at least so far it has not happened to me since then their Solutions do not work.
 So don't even waste your time. whether it's from Xbox support or from Bethesda support. I found my own solution and it works just keep an eye on your manage game save. Keep it about 230 megs. is also a good idea to save many times. Due to the fact it could
 be corrupted with a glitch. I had it many times glitch back to my dashboard with this new DLC Bar Harbor that I was lucky that it did not corrupt any of my game saves but in the main game I've had it crash to the dashboard also and have corrupted game saves
 many times. &nbsp;so be careful with that. After you're done playing leave the console on unless you have it in standby mode but do not have a downloading anything updates or purchases. Because that will stop the game from uploading to the cloud. If the cloud is
 out it will hopefully try later. When I am finished playing Fallout 4 I leave it up loading until I see the network lights blinking off. and that could take an hour or two depending on the status or the condition of the network connected to the cloud. do not
 shut your Xbox completely off because that right there will also stop it from updating to the cloud and sync issues will happen. I had that from experience.</p>

<p>DogRox 1 : Yes and yes and yes....I agree with Your way how to keep your saves in safety, btw in fact I am doing the same - yes we have to let xbox synchronize our saves...what You said is the best protection I know and yes this is also my own experience....also:
 I was in the same trouble in January, xbox operator gave me this solution and I was out of trouble till May. But.....and this is important ....Your prevention is the best as i said but if You are in trouble You need some way to get out and this solution is
 the only i know - how to return back to game....going offline in this case is wasting of your time You will loose Your progress You know that I know that ...what we both do not know WHEN someone will do something with this issue or IF....I posted "1st Aid"
 not Real Fix - only Developer can do that /of course with Microsoft/....I say again You prevention is good, but in such a emergency state You need something more....If You know better solution pls - I mean - what to do if that lovely error message bringing
 Nightmare - pls post it here... I will be that 1st one which will be THANKFULL...really!!! You can trust me because I am also scared to death that tomorrow this issue will be back and I ll be again helpless, sick and angry....Thank You for Your kindness and
 attention, wishing my very the best, </p>

<p>well so far I have not seen the error code pop up. Since I've been doing the solution that I've been doing that I came up with everything seems to play okay. Not the best or anything like that but I still have to be extra careful. The game still can go to
 crash spots where you go to an area and all of a sudden they will freeze and take you back to the dashboard. If you are in the middle of saving a quick save during that time your quick save gets corrupted. Or any other saves get corrupted if you're actually
 saving at that time the game crashes to the dashboard. It is hard for me to explain it exactly the whole steps I do or precautions I take by typing it in here. Maybe sometimes I can explain it to you voice on the Xbox. Like I said I can't understand why they're
 telling you to adjust your IP address your account name excetera excetera when that's totally not the issue. If the game is an offline single-player game why would it care what your IP address is? I'll tell you why. It's because of the stupid cloud. And that's
 not the game's fault that's the Xbox clouds fault. but the game still has issues because of the way it saves to the cloud it doesn't seem like other games that I played. Minecraft also is the game that does that also not so much exactly like that but I've
 had lost many hours of work building worlds because of the stupid cloud with Minecraft as well. that's supposed to be also offline game if you want it to be. :-) I'm sorry I can't be much more of a help right now but I can't explain it any other way then what
 I had my previous post.</p>

<p>well, I don't know how I really helped you. But I was just giving my opinion. I'm not saying my system is guaranteed to be foolproof, all I'm saying is that the the so-called fixes everybody else's thing to do, I have already tried them and they do not work.
 I had to find my own way around it. &nbsp;I went through many times with support both with xbox support and bethesda support. It's almost like Bethesda doesn't even know or care what's going on. specially with the Vault 111 Black dome issue. and as far as the Xbox
 support they're just trying to get you hooked up to they're cloud system feeling that they have to support that because it is their system. I think it's wrong that we don't own our game saves just like we don't own the console. All the time putting behind
 the scenes no info given, updates on our system and breaking things each time. If it's not broken why fix it that's why I always say. we have no control over that. It's like me selling you a car and then 2 days later go over there and rebuild your engine because
 I don't like the way it runs. you wouldn't like that would you? &nbsp;that's why I don't waste my time anymore building huge worlds in minecraft or spending hours upon hour creating killer looking settlements in fallout, when you gotta rely on a cheap backup system
 that doesn't work half the time. why why even bother? it's a waste of timeand I will not recommend an Xbox console to anybody. I even told a lot of my friends not to buy them. because issues like that. they all agree that's a huge deal-breaker right there
 when you can't back up your own game saves.</p>

<h2>            Unable to create partion or delete the free space .</h2>
                    <p>I want to create a new partition in the free disk space. I want to use this space(60 GB) to create a partition. I tried the New Simple Volume option and followed all the steps but at the end it gives error that not enogh space is there to create the volume.
 I had used default options and had given size of new volume as much space was available.</p>
<p>Then I found that i need to delete the partition first before creating the New Simple Volume. But the option to delete partition is greyed out.Infact all the options except new simple volume are greyed out.&nbsp;How can i create new volume or delete this free
 space partition so that it becomes unallocated space and i can utilize this unallocated space..</p>

    <title>Can we please have an audio driver that lets us disable power - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jachapman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can we please have an audio driver that lets us disable power management on the headphone jack&#63;</h2>
                    <p>The Surface Pro 3 has a significant audio issue due to power management on the headphone jack - it is disabled when no sounds are playing then enabled when audio is expected to play - this causes distracting 'pops' in headphones/attached speakers on a frequent
 basis, as power is supplied/removed from the port. This would not be so bad IF there was the option to disable this power saving feature, which there is not (that I can find). I use my Surface 3 at a desk quite frequently, and it is a failure on the otherwise
 excellent product to function as a desktop solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some Realtek driver versions allow users to disable this power management feature, as evidenced in these threads:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.tomshardware.co.uk/forum/11715-63-realtek-audio-noise-sound</p>
<p>http://forum.notebookreview.com/hardware-components-aftermarket-upgrades/587521-fix-realtek-sound-popping-high-pitched-tone-squeal.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problems they describe are the exact problems I, and others, experience with the Surface Pro 3. However, I have searched the registry and found no option in the default drivers to disable power management, and even after removing the default drivers
 and installing the latest Realtek HD Audio drivers from their website, which include the Realtek Audio Manager tool, the power management option is missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run out of ideas on how to solve this issue, which I find quite a significant hitch in my experience of the Surface tablet as a whole, and it is frustrating because I am certain it is a software issue and not a hardware one. I am writing this to ask
 if the issue is known within the Surface team and whether we can expect the option to disable audio jack power management (or enable only when on battery) to arrive in a future update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reading.,</p>

            This problem has existed in all surface tablets since the original surface rt. I don't think they care to fix it. This makes using headphones a terrible experience. It also makes me think that nobody in the surface team actually users them, as it is so
 annoying that they would fix it.

            <p>Exactly the same problem here. I'm plugging my surface into external audio and it pops loudly every 10 sec. Basically unusable.
</p>
<p>The problem is identified and the solution simple: let us disable the realtek power management. Want to do better? only disable&nbsp;PM when the audio jack is plugged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is so hard about it? Why is MS not willing to help all the people complaining after all this time? It is an expensive product and we're unable to use its basic features!&nbsp;</p>

            I'm just writing to confirm that I'm having the same issue on my Surface Pro 3. &nbsp;A few minutes browsing around the internet yielded a fix for multiple other brands of laptops using similar realtek hardware, however, as the OP stated, this option seems
 to be missing entirely for the surface. &nbsp;I would very much appreciate an added option for power management in the registry. &nbsp;Certainly hope this gets fixed, the problem is quite obnoxious.

<h2>            Start menu won&#8217;t open after restart</h2>
                    <p>Every day I shut down my computer at night, and I turn it on in the morning. I turned it on today and the start menu wouldn’t open at all. I go to restart it and it still doesn’t work. I restart it a third time today, and now it works. I had the exact same
 issue yesterday as well but the start menu worked after one restart. Everytime the start menu stops working, and I go to restart, I get something about task host stopping tasks.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2904b7ac-eaba-43da-b69c-4b1c31ae7e60?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2904b7ac-eaba-43da-b69c-4b1c31ae7e60?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>I have already run an sfc /scannow which found nothing. I have no idea why windows 10 is so crap. I’ve had similar issues in the past and the only “solution” was to clean install. That is not an option this time as I am sick of having to do that every few
 months.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Opencl.dll is a type of
<strong>DLL file</strong> associated with Windows 10 Operating System developed by Microsoft Corporation for the Windows Operating System. The latest known version of Opencl.dll is 1.2.11.0, which was produced for Windows. This DLL file carries a popularity

<strong>allow multiple software programs to share the same functionality (eg. printing)</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Most opencl.dll errors are related to
<strong>missing or corrupt opencl.dll files</strong>. Because opencl.dll is an external file, it presents a great opportunity for something undesirable to occur.</span></p>

 will provide a "opencl.dll not registered" error. Fortunately, you can use a built-in utility called "Microsoft Register Server" (regsvr32.exe) to re-register your opencl.dll file.</span></p>

<p>I had the same problem but this fix didn't work for me. &nbsp;Every time I tried to shut down Windows it came back up again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happened was that the Automatically restart on System Failure option was set. &nbsp;To fix it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Search for Recovery options</p>
<p>Under Advanced startup click Restart now. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Your laptop will show a blue page with a menu. &nbsp;Select Troubleshoot.</p>
<p>At the next menu, select Advanced options</p>
<p>Now choose Startup Settings</p>
<p>The Startup Settings page has a Restart button. &nbsp;Select this.</p>
<p>Once Windows has restarted, you will get a blue page with a menu options. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Press 9 to select Disable automatic restart after failure</p>
<p>Your PC will reboot once again and should now shutdown.</p>

<p>I don't have the Intel Management Engine Interface as an option. I'm running a brand new HP laptop with an AMD dual core processor. I've always had good luck with AMD in the past. When I purchsed this laptop, I immediately did a reformat and clean install
 to get rid of all the unused bloatware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I REALLY don't want to have to take it into the shop for diagnostics, but it has shut down 3 times now in the middle of a test for school. Luckily I could get back in before time ran out, but this is just not okay.</p>

            I have noted advice from Dave and have turned off Fast Startup as an experiment. I have AMD processor so the other action is not valid. I had experienced random restarts without warning in past few months, so will monitor to see if they now cease.

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>- what do you mean by <strong>'from open windows in explorer'</strong> ?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
- Are you referring to multiple Internet Explorer Windows not reflecting in the the system tray when you open them?
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Follow this step if you do not see multiple Internet Explorer Windows when you open them.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. After you have opened multiple Internet Explorer Windows,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>b. Right click on the blank space in the system tray and select "properties"</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>c. Under taskbar, next to taskbar button, select "never combine" and check.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>In the default view, each program appears as a single, unlabeled button even when multiple items for a program are open for a clean and uncluttered look.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can customize the taskbar appearance to change how buttons appear and how they group together when you have multiple items open. You can also choose to see individual buttons for each open file. For more information, see</div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Change how buttons appear on the taskbar. </strong></div>

            Hi PKRNZ, 
<br />
<br />I think I’m getting a little lost in what exactly happened, but I’m sure we can figure it out. 
<br />
<br />Click on start, and type “control panel” - search for user accounts, then “manage accounts”
<br />
<br />How many user accounts are listed? Which ones are admins? Which ones should be? Send a screenshot if you can. 
<br />
<br />I’ll be here, and we can work through this!
<br />- C

            A Local Account and an Administrator privilege are two different things. 
<br />
<br />If you want to change your account type, do the following:
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family &amp; other people
<br />Select your account, click Change account type
<br />Choose Administrator
<br />Click OK
<br />
<br />If you can't do that, do the following.
<br />
<br />Log out to the sign in screen.
<br />
<br />Hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen.
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart.
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears.
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />Click Command Prompt
<br />
<br />	At the command prompt, type:
<br />	net user administrator /active:yes
<br />
<br />	Hit Enter
<br />
<br />	Close command prompt, restart, then try signing into the Administrator account. 
<br />
<br />Try signing in again.
<br />
<br />Try changing the privilege of your account.

            There is only one user account on here that I need to change back to administrator, and then change the user name if possible. After user accounts I get this page.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f4a6e62b-3795-44c5-9a23-0c48d02001f1?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f4a6e62b-3795-44c5-9a23-0c48d02001f1?upload=true" /></a>

            OK, and when you click “change account type” is it asking for a username/pw ? It looks from screenshot it will, but maybe we’ll get lucky and it’ll allow you to change from standard to admin. <br /><br />Let me know. Screenshot if possible. <br /><br />- C

                    My dvd-rom was working perfectly until one day when I logged onto my laptop the little symbol saying the driver was being updated appeared at the bottom of the screen.&nbsp; I couldn't stop this update and when it had finished I could no longer play DVDs or
 game CDs.&nbsp; I went to the device manager and could not roll the driver back.&nbsp; The name of the driver was interrupted by many @ signs, which made me suspect it was not the real thing.&nbsp; Since then, the only time my DVD worked was when I updated to DivX Plus and
 that seemed to install the original driver, as the name on the device manager was now cleared of @ signs and I could play DVDs and games.&nbsp; This lasted until the next Microsoft update, when the whole thing went back to the bogus driver.&nbsp; As it was installing

Did you REMOVE (all) of the Devices as indicated at the top of Stage 1?<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue<br />
below.<br />
