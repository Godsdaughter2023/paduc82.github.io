            Hi Donald, switching out of S Mode is now free, please follow these steps:
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Menu)
<br />
<br />Go to Update and Security - Activation 
<br />
<br />In the Switch to Windows 10 Home or Switch to Windows 10 Pro section, select Go to the Store. (If you also see an "Upgrade your edition of Windows" section, be careful not to click the "Go to the Store" link that appears there.)
<br />
<br />On the Switch out of S mode (or similar) page that appears in the Microsoft Store, select the Get button.
<br />
<br />After you see a confirmation message on the page, you'll be able to install apps from outside of the Microsoft Store.

<p>Well, as far as I know, the only thing you can do is changing the Windows Volume (Taskbar).</p>
<p>But you must change every program manually. WMP, VLC for instance keep the volme setting though.</p>

                    <p class="contentHeader2">I'm rebuilding my Win10 desktop after recovering from a failure to boot. I've used GOOGLE to obtain a list of DLL files that hold icons.&nbsp; They're located in the "system32" folder, along with HUNDREDS of other DLL files that DON'T
 hold icons, and whose names make no sense whatever (the names of the icon-containing DLL's also make no sense whatever).</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">You'd think that common sense would require a unique folder (like "Icon Holders")&nbsp; into which the icon-containing DLL's would be held.&nbsp; But common sense doesn't seem to be relevant here. I've tried creating&nbsp; the folder I envision(in
 the "system32" folder&nbsp;and putting copies&nbsp; of the icon-holding files into it. But when I go into the "change icon" procedure and browse to one of the relevant DLL files, I get a message informing me that the file in question contains no icons.</p>

</p><p class="contentHeader2">
</p><p class="contentHeader2">This is simply insane; why does this happen? putting a copy of a file into another folder should not change it.</p>

            Hi Jim
<br />
<br />A DLL is a Dynamic Link Library file
<br />
<br />That file contains source code mainly and other resources, like icons that software on your PC use for their functionality and the names of those dll's make sense to programmers, because thy are the ones that link into those files, those files are not meant for use by the normal user . . 
<br />
<br />Moving a copy of a dll will break the chain of dll's, there are references inside a dll to other dll files and when you move a dll, that reference goes to the wrong location, because it is relative to the original file
<br />
<br />Please explain what icons you need for your purposes, because all Windows icons are freely available on the Internet in large libraries of icon sets . . .
<br />
<br />For example, here are the icons from inside the default DLL in Windows 10:

<h2>            Roaming Profiles&#58; Cannot find documentation on Event ID 4625 - Error Code 0xC0000073</h2>
                    <p>My company has been using roaming profiles without issues until we switched to Windows 10 (V6 profiles). Now all roaming profiles on PCs with a version of Windows 10 (which one doesn't matter, from original to creator's update) fail to log in and a temporary
 profile is created. No amount of profile resetting, server settings or internet solutions have helped. One thing I could never figure out is the following reoccurring event:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Audit Failure</p>
<p>Event ID: 4525</p>
<p>Failure Reason: An Error occured during Logon.<br />
Status: 0xC0000073"<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping that finding out what the problem is here, might help us figure out the roaming profile problem. However code&nbsp;&nbsp;0xC0000073 seems to be completely undocumented. So don't just link me a website with documentation on error codes for Event ID 4625
 unless you are sure it is actually there. I also tried the "More Information: Event Log Online Help" link. All those links (for any event I've tested) are dead though. Any help?</p>

            <p>Hi Harry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will have a go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your devices will be assigned IP address by your DHCP server. For most home networks this will be on your gateway router (i.e. the device connecting your Internet and all your devices)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I expect if you log on to your router you will see that it has an IP in the 192.168.x.x. range and any device connecting to it and using it as the DHCP server will be assigned a 192.168.x.x address. As such I expect your PC is also displaying an IP address
 in the 192.168.x.x range.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am guessing you are trying somehow to use your PC as a bridge for your XBOX to your Internet connection - I have never tried to connect my XBOX to the Internet this way so would need to look in to it to advise how to do this correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">As for why your XBOX is getting the 169.254.x.x address it would appear this is because it is unable to locate the DHCP server and is therefore not being assigned an IP address from your routers IP pool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Google states the following;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><em>The&nbsp;</em></span><em>169.254</em><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)"><em>.x.x range of IP addresses is reserved by Microsoft for private network addressing. If you have a pc set to
 automatically obtain an IP and you receive one of these addresses, windows has assigned this because it cannot find a DHCP server within the network subnet.</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I expect if you carry your XBOX over to your router an plug it in directly it will receive a 192.168.x.x address as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As such the problem looks to be in how you have interconnected devices. The router does not see the XBOX, the XBOX does not see the router - perhaps it is trying to obtain IP address from the PC, which is not acting as a DHCP server.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without looking in to using a PC as an intermediary so not sure if it will work or not in daisy chained scenario;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could try assigning static IP to the XBOX within the same network subnet. For example if your router is on 192.168.0.1 and it assigns your PC 192.168.0.2, you could statically assign your XBOX 192.168.0.3 for example. If you regularly connect multiple
 devices to your wireless you may want to leave a bit of a gap to avoid any IP conflicts with those devices being dynamically assigned IP's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example if you have your PC and perhaps phone and a tablet connected to the wireless then 3 IPs from the routers IP pool will be assigned - for example PC 192.168.0.2, Phone 192.168.0.3, Tablet 192.168.0.4. In this scenario may better assigning a static
 of 192.168.0.10 for the XBOX as an example.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure it is going to be quite as simple as that though (pause)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, gave in and had a look - &nbsp;a quick check and you probably need to check your Internet sharing settings on your PC - managed to find this guide, may help;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-one/networking/connect-live-using-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">XBOX connection sharing</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The best option though is to direct connect - if you have a lot of distance between your XBOX and router and don't want to string CAT-5 through the house then can invest in units that leverage your houses electricity cabling for network connectivity. Plug
 in one module into power socket in the room you have your XBOX, plug XBOX in here with network cable. Plug another module into power socket near your router, connect network cable from here to spare LAN port on router. Job done. Generally a faster (network
 speed) solution than using wireless, let alone sharing wireless. Also the router will see the XBOX directly and vice versa so much easier for DHCP to work correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check here for example units;</p>

</p><p>I use Netgear as example as have used their products (routers and power adapters) for years without any issues - very reliable, but obviously take the time to look and purchase what makes you happy.</p>

            <p>Hi, thanks for the reply. I will look into the netgear power adapters but I probably should've mentioned that I had shared my pcs internet to my Xbox for a while and have never had an issue until now, so I'd rather keep it this way if possible. Also I have
 tried setting a static ip to my Xbox and still it says unidentifiee network no internet and doesn't connect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that in the sharing tab that internet connection sharing had been unticked, it had been on for so long I forgot to check. However whenever I turn on sharing my wifi on the PC says unidentified network as well as the Ethernet. I did troubleshoot
 this and it managed to fix the wifi however the Ethernet still doesn't work and now I still have the wifi unidentified network if I tick sharing, I have to troubleshoot it everytime but it still doesn't make a difference to the Ethernet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I solved the issue! I was trying to share my ethernet connection instead of my wireless conenection. Thanks for the help.</p>

            <p>Hi Harry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Glad you got it sorted. Think that can be a common oversight - there is even a note in the guide that says make sure you are sharing the Internet connection and not another network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you mark your post as solved so people know you have been able to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had picked up that there had been a change of some sort - i.e. you did have this working before as you stated had been down only a couple of days. Can you confirm if you think there was any reason why the Internet sharing settings had changed - has your
 PC received an update recently or anything like that which may have led to the settings changing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The extra info may be useful for anyone looking in future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy gaming!!!</p>
<p>

            &nbsp;Hi,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
This issue may occur due to incorrect power settings, due to corrupted system files or due to conflict between third party applications.
<div>
<p>To guide you in right direction we want to know: <br />
1.What happens when you try to restart?<br />
2.Do you get any error message?<br />
<br />
Method 1: <br />
<br />
I would suggest you to run&nbsp;Power troubleshooter and check if it helps;<br />
<br />
a. Press ‘Windows + X’ key on the keyboard.<br />
<br />
b. In the search box, type ‘Troubleshooting’, and press Enter.<br />
<br />
c. Click on ‘System and Security’ and click on ‘Power’ click on next to run the troubleshooter.<br />
<br />
Method 2:<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, I would suggest you to set the computer in a clean boot state and then try to shut down again.<br />
<br />
Setting the system in a clean boot state will help to identify if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.<br />
<br />

            <p>Answering your questions, it restarts fine, it just won't shut down or sleep properly. There is no error message, as the screen goes black but the fan still runs and the power light stays on. I tried Method 1, but the "fixes" done were undoing my preferences
 (don't go to sleep for 5 hours, etc) that I wouldn't have chosen if I hadn't have run into this problem.</p>

            I am using IE 10, and I believe it is upgraded. If I use google Chrome it works fine, it is just when using IE 10. Yes, my gmail account does the same thing when using IE 10. I do not have another computer. I looked up the optimized portal you recommended,
 but I do not see an Internet Explorer 10 option. Any other suggestions?

<p>The wheel does support the receiver I play Dirt 3 on my pc without any problems but I cant play NFS Shift 2. The wheel is not on the NFS shift 2 list of supported controllers so I assume that it is not supported but based on my experience I wonder if someone
 got it to work. Sorry about my English.</p>

<h2>            Printer Spooler running but not found by Add printer</h2>
                    <p>OS: Windows 10</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to add Adobe PDF as a printer on my system. I thought that maybe the Spooler wasn't running so i went to the services.msc. Once there I found that it was running. So I tried restarting it. For some reason, I still cant pull up the "Add Printer"
 function. It begins searching for printers then shows a message stating "Windows cant open add printer - The local print spooler service is not running. Please restart the spooler or restart the machine".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried both of these. Any suggestions?</p>

<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Yes, I was able to restart the Print Spooler Service.</li><li>I do not have a physical printer, I am looking to add Adobe PDF as a printing device.</li><li>See #2</li><li>Some programs which I print from do not have an Adobe PDF plugin.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>There are no printers installed, and thus, no drivers to uninstall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the "Fix printer problems". This tried restarting the spooler service, but that did not end up fixing the problem.</p>

                    <p>Hi everybody,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought my lenovo x220 used, it does not have any cd drive. It came with Windows 7 which I upgraded to Windows 10 during the free upgrade promotion. I installed ubuntu about two months ago and yesterday I followed this video &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ( https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=T-syEhjw-B0
 ) &nbsp;to uninstall ubuntu, half way through the the video I realized I needed the windows cd??. Not very smart of me. I turned off my laptop and now when I turn it on after the ThinkPad screen I get a screen saying:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>error: no such partition</strong></p>
<p><strong>grub rescue&gt;&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>If anyone can help me it would be greatly appreciated. Ideally I would like my windows 10 without ubuntu.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>I am not very computer sophisticated.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thanks to everyone.</strong></p>

<p>
</p><p>Based on what you have stated, it seems that re-installing Windows 10 would be the only option to rebuild the partitions. You can create a Windows 10 installation media using our

            <p>Nine out of ten problems with the Upgrade have to do with it being an inferior install which has passed issues from the old OS which often is a junkyard.&nbsp; That's why I wanted to make sure to have it's integrity checked first to see if there is deeper corruption.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>By comparison those who have done the <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">
Clean Install Windows 10 Upgrade</a> don't report any such problems.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you've assured the integrity of the install I was willing to work with you&nbsp; further to address the issue
<strong>but you will not get any more help from volunteers here unless you can behave decently and show appreciation for our taking our time to try to help you.</strong>&nbsp; Over the past seven years I've helped about 60,000 people in forums and every single one
 of them who was polite and cooperative got their fix.&nbsp; You need to decide if you can conduct yourself decently enough to continue and if so we will most certainly resolve your problem no matter what it takes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

</p><p>If the SFC cannot repair files then the next step is to run the DISM command to refresh the image from which the pristine files needing repair are copied.&nbsp; But it takes absolute accuracy in the phrasing (even spacing).&nbsp; You also need the WIndows 10 ISO file
 mounted (by right clicking after download) or as bootable media to reference it's location in the command, if prompted for media.&nbsp; See the example provided in

<h2>            a problem loading page while Internet download manager is downlaoding a file.</h2>
                    Hi everyone<br />
<br />
I am having a problem loading page while Internet download manager is downloading a file.
<br />
Besides, sometimes the internet be disconnected for a moment, then gets connected a fter a little while.
<br />
<br />
http://img521.imageshack.us/img521/3243/problemloadingpagewhile.png<br />
<br />
Also, I am quite surprised that IDM takes about an hour and half to download a file whose size is 75MB, although my DSL speed is 256KB/sec.<br />
<br />
Also, IDM was only running and everything is closed<br />
<br />
The maximum transfer rate reaches only 42 KB/sec, this is not OK at all in comparison to my DSL speed<br />
<br />
Sometimes transfer rate became 0 Bytes/sec in IDM. While happening, any pages can be loaded without any problems.<br />
<br />
<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 - Stuck at Login Screen, From Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Coming from Windows 7 Home I successfully reserved Windows 10 through the GWX app. I installed it Wednesday the 29th. The installation seemed to finish without fault. I proceeded to try to login at the screen, but every time I pressed enter or clicked on
 'Next', the mouse pointer would change into the circle, the screen would then fade white, then go black. The computer would then restart and bring me back to the same login screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried in safe mode and the same thing happened. I tried to run troubleshooting but Windows 10 could not find anything wrong. I was going to reset the computer while keeping my files but the action could not be performed. I tried running it without my graphics
 card, so using integrated graphics, and that did not work. Any help would be appreciated as I need my computer to finish my summer work for school.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If nothing else, I want to be able to return to my Windows 7 I had previously.&nbsp;</p>

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10.<br />
<br />
The issue could be due to some Software/update causing the issue. I would suggest you to press the
<strong>Shift key and hold the power button</strong> so that it will go to the <strong>
recovery options</strong>, Select safe mode and boot to the desktop. If you are able to boot to the desktop, then I would suggest you to update the display drivers. To update display drivers, I would suggest you to check with your computer manufacturer if there
 are any updated drivers for Windows 10. If there are no drivers available, download and install the drivers in compatibility mode.
<br />
<br />

</span>My system OS is Vista Home Premium. I have an ADS PYRO A/V Link &amp; I'm trying to capture video from a pre-recorded videocassette to convert it to DVD. After finally getting it to show the movie I was attempting to record, I figured it was capturing the
 movie &amp; thought nothing else &amp; concluded it was doing same. The video stream in the preview mode was quite choppy; but I attributed that to the current SW that came w/the A/V Link(ULead VideoStudio 7.0). When I thought it had completed capturing the movie,
 I proceeded to play it back in VideoStudio &amp; it came back w/an error msg. stating that it failed to use the DirectShow Video Engine &amp; that it couldn't play back the video stream; it also stated that no audio hardware was available and/or the hardware in-question
 wasn't responding. According to the instructions for the A/V Link, it required Quick Time &amp; RealPlayer as the drivers for it; Ligos Indeo 5.0 was also one of the drivers required, but Ligos doesn't have a driver for Vista &amp; isn't providing one for it at this
 time. Adobe Acrobat I already have it's latest version. Any help provided for this issue would be greatly appreciated. Thank You.

            Hi TorandAl,<br />
<br />
So basically Ligos Indeo version 5.0 software is not compatible with Windows Vista.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-vista/Search.aspx?type=Software&amp;s=Ligos Indeo 5.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-vista/Search.aspx?type=Software&amp;s=Ligos%20Indeo%205.0
</a><br />
<br />
Let us try to reduce the video harware acceleration and check if you’re able to play the video in Video Studio successfully.<br />
<br />
<strong>What can I do about video problems, such as green or pink lines appearing in the video, flickering or choppy video, the Player stops responding when playing video, and so on?

You can also use the Fix it tool if you still have audio problem while playing video.<br />

    <title>Worst customer support - faulty hardware - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kameltreiber  say:</h3>
<h2>            Worst customer support - faulty hardware</h2>
                    
<p>Dear community,</p>

<p>this post is just to inform you on how Xbox support deals with loyal customers.</p>
<p>When referring to loyal I am saying that I have an Xbox, an Xbox 360 and and Xbox One. I have more than 100 games on the 360 alone and already bought 4 games for Xbox One.</p>

<p>A short time after I bought the console my controller started bugging around - disconnecting every few minutes and instantly reconnecting. This is quite annoying as it puts you back into the menu of whatever game you have been playing at that moment.</p>

<p>I have checked the forums here and have seen that many people have the same problem. It seems to be possible to fix this by replacing the controller. So far so good. It turns bad when you read that a lot of other customers had their controller replaced in
 advance, meaning they had a new controller send to them before they had to send away their faulty one. This option however was not offered to me. Support told me I had to either send the console back alltogether or send my controller to Microsoft, wait, and
 then get a new controller. This means effectively sacrificing warranty time.</p>

<p>This is unacceptable support - especially since it has been done otherwise for certain users.</p>
<p>Get your *** together Microsoft.</p>

<p>Hi there k4meltreiber sorry to hear about your problems with customer support unfortunately i have not seen those cases where a new controller is sent out before the defective controller is returned. You could always buy a new controller from a local retailer
 instead of dealing with support.</p>

<p>Done a quick search, first topic I found:</p>
<p><a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/xbox_one_support/f/4269/t/1627064.aspx?PageIndex=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">forums.xbox.com/.../1627064.aspx</a></p>
<p>So either user King Rambow lies - or the level of support varies from user to user. As a community ambassador / Microsoft employee I would be very careful on what to reply to this.</p>
<p>Also your comment on me buying a new controller has to be a joke. If this is a solution the thread title of this thread is way too positive. What comes next? Suggesting that I buy a new controller, deposit the broken controller in the box and return it just
 so I can continue to play and by this *** with the experience of another user?</p>
<p>Imo Microsoft should back up customers who support their products from day one. They have my freaking account data, credit card and Paypal info - if I would not send back a broken controller bill me - not waste my time and the warranty of this product.</p>
<p>Customer friendly looks different to me.</p>

<p>I brought a Xbox One on day one. When I got it home I found it had a faulty disc drive. I took it back to the retailer who had sold out and said it is best to send it back to xbox for replacement. I paid the £391 holders fee for the 3-5 day advanced replacement
 promise on the 2nd of December. It is now the 4th of January and I'm still waiting. I have called close to 20 times now and not one member of staff can help me. I have had on staff member not understand the English language, I have spoken to a "supervisor"
 who said he would find out personally what has happened then call me back in an hour. I waited 3 hours, called back and was told the person who's name I was given does not exists. I have had two people give me email addresses who say they will keep in contact
 and have never replied to me and another 3 say they will be in touch in 24 hours which never happened. The 3-5 day replacement is a lie to begin with. What they don't tell you until you have paid is it takes 3-5 days to send a console from them to UPS then
 another 3-5 days to go from UPS to you. I have been given a tracking number after asking 8 times for it and UPS still haven't received the console. This company is a joke and I have been treated disgustingly.</p>

<p>i have had a horrific start to my xbox one experience.</p>
<p>i purchased the xbox a week ago and as soon as i plugged it in i realised there was a problem.the controller was disconnecting and crashing the game i was playing and sending me back to the home screen,then it asked me who i was???</p>
<p>i phoned xbox support who told me i had a faulty controller and i would have to send them the controller before they could replace the faulty one at a cost of £10 for shipping!!!!!!!</p>
<p>2 hours later while playing forza 5 the game crashed and would not let me play it,so i ejected the disc and looked at it and it had warped/burnt edges around the very outside of the disc,so on the phone to microsoft i went.</p>
<p>microsoft told me that i had to send the console to them and wait approx 3 weeks for a replacement,or they could take a £400 hold deposit from me and send me out the console via "UPS" within 3 working days,so i got out the bank card and forked out the £400
 holding deposit!!</p>
<p>2 days later "UPS" turn up with a replacement,i was overjoyed at the 2 day turnover.</p>
<p>so i gave the courier my old console and plugged in the new one.</p>
<p>the noise that came from it was quite obviously not right,it sounded like an old pc tower with an out of balance fan.</p>
<p>so back on the phone to ms i went.</p>
<p>the advisor has said he can not replace the console again,he said he needed to escalate the issue to a higher department,and it will take them up to a week to contact me to resolve the problems!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>so i now have a console i cant use for the second time,a controller that is faulty,and a forza disc that is about as much use as underwater show jumping!!!!!!</p>
<p>i have been with xbox live since 2007,i had 4 console replacements of the 360,i have spent thousands of pounds on xbox merchandise and games ect ect.</p>
<p>now in 2014 im in the same boat getting treated the same way.</p>
<p>I am absolutely disgusted at the way microsoft have dealt with this,and also around £1200 out of pocket!!!!!!!!! &nbsp;</p>
