<p>Hiya.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So anyone that lives in Australia knows it gets hot here and recently it's been pretty hot which I have taken into account but has anyone elses XBOXONE been getting pretty hot while playing certain games? I've been playing AC: Unity and my game crashed (granted
 the game has bugs atm) but when I felt my console it was really hot. Is it just the heat and the game or is there an actual problem here?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sounds like the game. I wouldn't worry to much as the console will shut itself down to avoid damage if it overheats. Keep an eye on it though and keep the &nbsp;place you have the console well ventilated. I don't have AC unity to compare.</p>

<p>sounds like it may be the game - with the crashing problem - have had a few games do that now.</p>
<p>just monitor it and see how it goes - check it out when the outside temp has cooled down and if its still running hot.</p>
<p>mines warm to the touch.</p>

<p>Mine has been running really hot had the controller sitting on top of the console was pretty hot to the touch underneath and to touch the top of the console is really how not warm... actually hot ... and this wasn't on a hot day either also i notice my power
 brick makes allot of noise O.o ... console is probably 2 months old give or take.</p>
<p>Haven't noticed any difference with the console besides that runs fine.</p>

<p>Hi Stan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your concern about the performance of your device when projecting colors can be due to the changes in its configuration. To better understand your concern, we'd like to know the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The last changes made/activities performed on your device prior to your concern.</li><li>If you're desktop's background had been changed to white or black with black accents. See example below.<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c8f774a2-b79b-47c8-96e3-63ed9bc51ad8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c8f774a2-b79b-47c8-96e3-63ed9bc51ad8?upload=true" /></a></li><li>The version and build of Windows 10 that you're using on your device. To check this, you can perform the steps posted on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/13443/windows-which-operating-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we'd recommend performing the following to revert the configuration of your device back to default Theme settings:</p>
<ol>
<li>Search and launch Themes using Cortana, and then click on Themes and related settings.<br />
</li><li>Under Themes, click on Theme settings.</li><li>In the Change the visuals and sounds on your computer box, locate your previous theme. If you're unable to find it, you can use the available items under Windows Default Themes.</li><li>Once you click an item, Windows will automatically switch to that theme.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you can press Ctrl + Windows key + C to disable the color filter in the event that it was enabled accidentally. Color filters are designed to make it easier for Windows 10 users with color blindness to see the difference between colors and help those
 with light sensitivity to work with applications and consume content.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: In the event that it wasn't due to the color filter feature and you've enabled it using the keys above, you can press the key combination again to turn it off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your your response.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t find network --</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hello -- my laptop has a wired and wireless connection for net access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the longest time I was using the laptop with the wireless connection. My router assigned 192.168.1.237 to wireless connection. &nbsp;I was able to map to the disk on the laptop and remote access to it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>About a month ago I &nbsp;connection the laptop to my home network &nbsp;via a wired connection &nbsp;at 192.168.1.172 &nbsp;-- again, I was &nbsp;make connections to and from the laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I &nbsp;disconnect the wired &nbsp;connection and now the laptop seems to have problems finding other computer on the network or can the laptop find&nbsp;</p>
<p>computer too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if this is an OS issue or an issue with my router and the DNS &nbsp;-- any suggestion on how to get the laptap back on the network with the&nbsp;</p>
<p>wireless connection would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Does deleting save files affect achievements&#63; &#40;Killer Instinct and D4&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi everybody. A younger sibling of mine accidentally deleted the save files to some of my games, and I was wondering if deleting the save, and having to start over, will affect getting achievements, or make getting any achievements impossible. The games
 are Killer Instinct and D4: Dark Dreams Don't Die. In KI, I had played a couple matches with Jago before. Would having my save deleted make it impossible to get any more of Jago's achievements. For example, I won 1 ranked match. Would, now that my save is
 gone, I be able to get the "Win 10 Ranked Matches" achievement and just have to win 10 ranked matches instead of 9, or am I completely unable to get the achievement. The same goes for D4, which I made more progress in. I had collected some, but not all, of
 a certain collectible, and I was wondering if because I was in the middle of collecting them, I can no longer get the "Collect all collectibles" achievements. Would I miss out, or would I just need to collect them all in my new playthrough in order to get
 the achievement?</p>

<h2>            Skype for Windows 10 mobile keeps causing a blank screen during audio calls &#40;sound works fine&#41;</h2>
                    <p>For many months, when dialing landlines with Skype on my Lumia 640, Skype will transmit audio both ways but the phone screen turns black and no amount of tapping or button-pressing restores it, so I have no access to the dialpad, etc. The screen finally
 returns when the call ends.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried reinstalling and resetting Skype in Apps settings (to fix a more recent problem of it not loading at all) but this blank screen issue is confounding.&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>I haven't really used this phone with Skype video, so this question only covers voice calls</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any tips.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The Skype version is 12.1815.209.0 but this has happened for over a year and I don't know the version it first started with. Other than a few random freezes (e.g. browser locking up) the phone doesn't do this with other apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The phone specs are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Model: Microsoft Lumia 640 LTE<br />
Carrier: AT&amp;T<br />
Software: Windows 10 Mobile<br />
Installed RAM: 1 GB<br />

<p>
</p><p>Well, I generally use it in landscape mode to begin with, and it makes no difference in tests I just did. The screen stays blank (with audio) then recovers when call ends.</p>

<p>Thanks. I assume it's a known issue. Does it only happen with certain phone models based on something to do with their screen rotation mechanism?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In general, I hope Windows Phone can be supported as long as possible, as I like aspects of it better than Android and Apple is overpriced.</p>

<h2>            Well, that was odd - brightness inverted</h2>
                    <p>On the last time my screen powered off, my brightness got flipped backwards. &nbsp;Instead of the screen momentarily getting dimmer, as it normally does, then going off, it got brighter as it went off. &nbsp;Once I moved the mouse and brought the screen back up, I
 noticed it was dimmer than normal. &nbsp;In checking to see if my settings got off somehow, I noticed that all the brightness responses were now backwards - turning the brightness up dimmed the screen and turning it down brightened the screen. &nbsp;This happened from
 everywhere you can control the brightness - power settings, display settings in control panel, display settings in the modern settings app as well as the setting in the notification center where 25% was bright and 100% was completely black. &nbsp;Even the keyboard
 controls did it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Took a reboot to get it back to normal, and nothing shows up in event monitor or reliability monitor to coincide with it.</p>

<h3> carlosmonfort  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10  - Nothing is responding</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I ve recently upgraded my window 7 to windows 10 via the free update that Microsoft was offering a few days ago. Everything was working fine until today when i turned on my &nbsp;computer. My desktop background changed to a &nbsp;solid &nbsp;color of orange and none
 of the windows 10 related apps &nbsp;would work. Example: &nbsp;The start menu does not response- When I click the IE browser it says explorer.exe not registered- Cortona doesnt work- task view does not work- &nbsp;even when try to go to settings or the control panel via
 the run program by holding the windows key + r, it would say no such interface is supported- basically nothing works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive tried the sfc /Scannow and it comes back with there are corrupted files but it can not fix it, so i tried the DISM /Online/Cleanup-image/restorehealth command since it's what people would suggest. It did not work though, it would always get stuck at
 20 percent. I heard it's normal for it to get stuck there, but mine was stuck on it for 15 hours :/ so &nbsp;i &nbsp;gave up &nbsp;on that fix.</p>
<p>Even when i use the task manager to sign out and restart the pc, it would just get stuck at "windows is &nbsp;getting ready, do not shut down" :(</p>
<p>Please help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I &nbsp;was excited to finally upgrade to windows 10, but it seems like it's been a bad decision by far :( I've had it a little less than 2 days and this happens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

                    I use Windows 7 Home Premium on my desktop computer.&nbsp; I'm happy with it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Are there major advantages of upgrading to 10?&nbsp; Will Microsoft continue to support 7 if I don't upgrade to 10?

            <p>The advantages of Windows 10 are numerous and plenty. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 7, the problem of your computer randomly dropping connections to the internet can often be fixed by going into your power save settings and changing your wireless adapter to Maximum Performance. &nbsp;In Windows 10 you'll drop your wifi connection
 regardless of your power settings, and Microsoft will most likely never fix the issue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 has problems with dropping network shares, but that's a problem that can be resolved through a roughly thirty step process that requires significant knowledge of Device Manager and the Command Prompt, Windows 10 will drop connections to network
 shares and no amount of Device Manager or Command Prompt knowledge will ever resolve the disappearing shares issue. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 promises you an option to create a USB installer that will never actually work, so you'll be able to go through the process, but then when you plug your USB installer into another machine you will get an "Operating system not found" error every
 time! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are just some of the exciting changes that Microsoft is planning for the Windows 10 operating system!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Unable to change my old Skype password</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>
</p><p>I created my Skype account long before Microsoft acquired Skype with my google email account that I deactivated and deleted because it was hacked. Earlier this year I noticed that my Skype was logged out and got a notification that my account might have
 been compromised. I tried resetting my password but I kept getting the reply that the information I submitted is not sufficient enough to reset my password. The problem is that the email&nbsp;account&nbsp;I used back then was deactivated and deleted because it was hacked
 and I did not submit all the information required now back then when I created my account which means I will never be able to use my old Skype account...right? This is frustrating and scary because I am not sure if there is some dumb nut using my account to
 do malicious things seeing that we are living in such sick world these days. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there no other way I can resolve this issue and get my account back? I am sorry to say this but everything Microsoft touches turns into ****.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lindsley Nathan</p>

<h2>            OneDrive uninstalled, still in charge of my filesystem</h2>
                    <p>Hi -</p>
<p>I uninstalled OneDrive because I had no control of my files, particularly my Excel files. This computer is somewhat new, so I don't have much yet to lose on OneDrive on this computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled OneDrive, but the file system still thinks my files are coming from&nbsp; and going to OneDrive storage. Check out these two attached pictures

            Hi Doug8765,
<br />
<br />Thanks for sending through those screenshots. These show that Excel has recently opened these files. 
<br />
<br />You can right click these entries from within Excel, and select 'Remove from list' 
<br />
<br />You can right right-click a file in the File &gt; Open window, and select 'Clear unpinned Documents'
<br />
<br />In Excel, you can make a few changes to stop this to begin with:
<br />- Open Excel
<br />- Select File
<br />- Select Options
<br />- Select Advanced (left-hand side)
<br />- Set 'Show this number of Recent Documents' to 0
<br />- Set ;Show this number of unpinned Recent Folders' to 0
<br />- Untick the 'Quickly access this number of Recent Documents' box 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps,
<br />Nathan       
        </p>

            Hi Doug.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Before you uninstalled OneDrive did you change it's AutoSave Settings to  have Desktop, Pictures and Documents folders reverted to saving on This PC only?  See picture below. 
<br />
<br />If not then you can revert them to Default User folder locations following this tutorial:  
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/23504-restore-default-location-personal-folders-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/23504-resto...</a>
<br />
<br />There are also ALWAYS unintended consequences when removing major System Files.  So you might want to reinstall OneDrive and simply don't sign in - except to change those settings back.  Check also that the setting to store files only in the Cloud (for smaller drives) is not set as this was forced as default for some reason:  <a href="https://blogs.office.com/en-us/2017/05/11/introducing-onedrive-files-on-demand-and-additional-features-making-it-easier-to-access-and-share-files/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.office.com/en-us/2017/05/11/intro...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Nathan -</p>
<p>I've been unpinning dozens of files per day. All files, regardless of whether they&nbsp; were stored on OneDrive or not stored on OneDrive, get pinned or referenced as being on OneDrive. I don't deliberately store any files as OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I reduce the&nbsp; number of files shown as Recent or pinned, then I'll not get the local disk drives files, which should be all files I open&nbsp; or save.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I am misunderstanding what OneDrive does, I'd be glad to get the explanation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Doug</p>

</p><p>Hi Greg -</p>
<p>I read that TenForums tutorial and restored my Desktop folder. I had to move another directory (one I call "Data") back to the Desktop directory. I'm going to see what else needs done by using the files. Option 1 seemed the only workable suggestion. Overall,
 they make me a little more comfortable changing stuff that seemed inviolable. I hope I'm right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help. Should I post in this thread with more feedback?</p>

    <title>iYogi changed my Admin password w&#47;o permission - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> californiaentrepreneur  say:</h3>
<h2>            iYogi changed my Admin password w&#47;o permission</h2>
                    I made the INCREDIBLY foolish <b>mistake of hiring a bad company named iYogi</b> to do tech support when I was frustrated with my brand new computer. &nbsp;They work out of India and once you hand over access to your computer, they go SO fast and they modify
 SO many things (in their favor, at your expense) that you won't even know what is going on. &nbsp;If I hadn't been paying super close attention to every keystroke, I wouldn't have seen him do this. &nbsp;As soon as he did it, I insisted he change it back and he refused!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I had not yet read the hundreds of warnings and bad reviews online! &nbsp;Sure enough,
<b>they took over my computer - with my permission - but then immediately changed my Admin password.
</b>&nbsp;(This is NOT the one I log in with in the morning, it's the one I'd use to, say, modify Add-Ins in Outlook). &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>They will not tell me what it has been changed to!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>As an aside, they also installed a half dozen suspicious programs in my computer WHILE I WAS ASKING HIM NOT TO DO SO - and then automatically set me up for a monthly charge for the programs I didn't want! &nbsp;I suspected a scam and I canceled my credit card
 - they had too much information on me already! They also installed something that is supposed to "help" me by saving all my passwords, yeah, right. I uninstalled everything I could find as soon as I got off the online chat with them. &nbsp;They did NOT solve my
 original problem and claimed they had, and that I was satisfied, even though I kept saying no, it still didn't work - and showed him right in front of his nose since he was sharing my screen.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've learned an important lesson, but here's my question: &nbsp;<b>Is there ANY way to see my Admin password without wiping my whole hard drive and re-installing all my programs?</b></div>
                </div>

            You've learned a hard life lesson. Even if I could give you a magical recipe that would give you back control of your computer (and TBH, I cannot), the amount of damage to your computer cannot be repaired by a mere mortal short of scrubbing the operating
 system and re-installing to factory defaults.
<div><br />
<div>Unplug your computer from outside connections (e.g. Internet) and get everything you can of personal value off it. If you need help getting product codes and software serial numbers then look into the free
<a href="http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">BelArc Advisor</a> for a detailed hardware and software report. When you are satisfied you have everything you can get, scrub the current operating system by re-installing to factory defaults and begin your
 rebuild from there.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You might also want to notify your bank and/or credit card companies of your dilemma and take all necessary precautions in that arena.</div>

<div>They called me at 8 PM California time one night (long after I'd left) and then again today.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I called back and spoke to a front line guy who wanted all kinds of data from me (again - that's their thing) and I insisted repeatedly that he transfer me to a supervisor. &nbsp;Elapsed time: 11 minutes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I got to a supervisor. &nbsp;He told me there is a problem with my account. (Heck, yeah!) &nbsp;I explained to him that the guy had installed all kinds of stuff I didn't want and told him not to install - on my time and on my dime!; didn't solve the problem I called
 for in a reasonable way; and he took nearly 2 hours to do what should have been a simple .pst file import. &nbsp;I told him worst of all, the guy changed my admin password for Outlook.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>He said, "What do you want me to do?"</div>
<div><br />
<div>I said, "Tell me my own admin password!!!"</div>
<div><br />
<div>He gave me two to choose from and one of them works. I feel it would be unethical to share it, so I won't.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>He said the guy who helped me has been "strongly warned". I don't want the guy to lose his job, just get trained. &nbsp;Believe me, he needs it! &nbsp;I know almost as much as he appears to know!</div>
<div><br />
<div>My deal with iYogi is to stop writing bad things about them across my rather large social media network, so I will desist now. &nbsp;I will never, ever use them again, but I can understand how this may all boil down to one inept, unqualified employee and his
 faults may not invalidate the entire company's capabilities.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The End.&nbsp;</div>

<p><span>Hi Christitley35,</span></p>
<p><span>First you may try to
<strong>Uninstall and Reinstall the Wireless card drivers</strong> from device Manager
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step1 : Uninstall the drivers from the Device manager</span></strong></p>
<p><span>1. Click
<strong>start</strong></span></p>
<p><span>2. Type
<strong>devmgmt.msc</strong> in Start Search and press <strong>Enter</strong></span></p>
<p><span>3. In Device Manager locate the drivers,
<strong>right click</strong> on it and select the option <strong>uninstall</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>4.
<strong>Restart the computer</strong> and check.</span></p>
<p><span>You may also refer the Manufacturer’s website and download the latest wireless card drivers.</span></p>
<p><span>For more information, you may refer the following link to update the drivers</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</span></a>
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: Disable IPv6</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Try uninstalling IPv6 on all interfaces, removing any IPv6 virtual adapters, and resetting the TCP/IP stack.
 To remove IPv6, go into the properties for each network adapter and either uncheck the box next to the protocol "Internet Protocol version 6 (TCP/IPv6), that will disable it, or select it and click uninstall, which will remove it off the computer. Then go
 into device manager and remove any 4to6 adapters, WUN miniport adapters, or tunnel adapters.<br />
<strong>NOTE:</strong> You should do this for each network connection.</span></p>
<p><span>For more information, you may refer the following KB articles:</span></p>

<h2>            0x0000007E during installation of Windows 7 Pro</h2>
                    Hello. I just installed a new motherboard (ASUS M4A89GTD Pro/USB3) and am having some problems getting the Windows 7 setup to start. I boot from the CD and after the files load the Windows 7 splash screen appears and then goes to the blue screen of death
 giving me a STOP: 0x0000007E error. I have tried stripping out all additional hardware from the expansion slots (Radeon 5770 x2) and left only the keyboard and mouse. The error still appears and I am at a loss. Please advise on how to proceed with my installation.
 Thank you very much!<br />
<br />

<p>You may need to put the motherboard's&nbsp;hard drive controller driver on a usb flash drive then load them in order for the Windows 7 installation disk to see your hard drive.&nbsp; I had to do this with a Toshiba Portege M400 tablet laptop which has a raid controller
 which the Windows 7 installation disk doesn't have drivers for.&nbsp; Get the driver from the ASUS website, expand it onto a USB flash drive, put the USB flash drive into a usb port, boot your Windows 7 install disk, install the driver when required...</p>

    <title>Unable to install things due to TEMP folder issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lucasbs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to install things due to TEMP folder issues</h2>
                    Hello<br />
<br />
New problem...<br />
<br />
<br />
Just formatted the PC<br />
Windows 7 Professional x64<br />
<br />
I am<b> </b><u>the only user</u> &gt; <b>full admin</b> rights<br />
<br />
<b>UAC </b>= Completely <u>off</u><br />
<b>Firewall</b> = Completely <u>off</u><br />
<b>Windows Updates</b> = Completely <u>off</u><br />
<b>System protection/restore</b> = Completely <u>off</u><br />
<b>Windows Defender</b> = Completely <u>off</u><br />
<b>Antivirus</b> = no antivirus<br />
<br />
(I've disabled the windows updates only after installing all of the offered)<br />
<br />
I have the System planted on <i>C:\</i> and all my software on Partition <i>D:\</i><br />
<br />
When trying to run any (ANY) software from their folders I get all kinds of different warnings telling me the same thing<br />
<br />
-------------------- Examples: --------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<b>Setup was unable to create the dir</b><br />
<i>C:\Temp\TMP\blablabla</i><br />
<b>Error 5</b>: access denied.<br />
<br />
<b>Process explorer</b> says : Unable to extract 64bit image. Run ProcessExplorer from a *WRITEABLE* directory.<br />
<br />
<b>Nero 8 </b>says : Can not delete output file<br />
(I've tried run nero setup from D: and the desktop)<br />
<br />
<b>DirectX SDK</b> says : Could not create folder <i>C:\users....desktop\DX</i><br />
Or<br />
Could not create folder <i>C:\DX</i><br />
(No matter what the target dir, acces denied, if I try to extract from the D:)<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<b>Gets weirder</b> &gt; IF I copy the program to C: and run from there it works<br />
If I try to run Process Explorer from, let's say.. the desktop, It works (except from the nero and the DX case above)<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<b>I have changed</b> the environment variables of TEMP from <i>C:\users\blablabla\Temp</i> to<i> C:\Temp</i><br />
And the same with TMP, which now is <i>C:\Temp\TMP</i><br />
<br />
The C: has ME as owner, and 'Full Control' to 'Everyone'<br />
I made sure all the subfolders had the same configs, and that includes the User folder.<br />
<br />
The D: partition, where my software is at, is the same as C:\: ME as the owner, Full control to everyone. And I made sure that the programs I'm trying to install have these setups too.<br />
<br />
<b>Also important:</b><br />
<br />
The same gos to the TEMP folder: ME as owner and Full control to everyone. That includes the TMP subfolder.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<b>Already Tried the following:</b><br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Creating a new user with administrative privileges &gt; no result at all</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Enabling administrator accound and try from there &gt; the same: no result</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>MicrosoftFixit.ProgramInstallUninstall.RNP.22296434173431717.2.1.Run</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>MicrosoftFixit.ProgramInstallUninstall.MATSKB.Run</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Turning ON Windows installer service. It is ON and automatic...</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Give full access to other users, like Administrator, and Trusted Installer</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>SFC /scannow</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>Change variables back to default<br />
</li></ul>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
And I repeat: The PC is clear. No Virus<br />
<br />
<br />
* THE MOST RELEVANT OBSERVATION : THE PROBLEM OCCURS WHEN TRYING TO INITITATE FROM THE D: PARTITION. BUT IT WORKS NORMAL WHEN STARTING THE SETUPS FROM OTHER, LIKE C:.&nbsp; THE DESKTOP FOLDER ALSO SEEMS TO BE PROBLEMATIC, LIKE THE DirectX CASE. BUT AGAIN &gt; DESKTOP
 HAS ME AS USER AND FULL ACCESS TO EVERYONE*<br />
<br />

<div>I realize this is a bit late to the party, but someone in the future might find this helpful.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>One possible cause of this problem is the accidental inclusion of DENY permissions on the temp folder. DENY overrides ALLOW, so even if a user has full control, if there is a DENY somewhere in the mix that will take priority.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Another possibility is a group policy software restrictions policy which prevents running executables from the temp folders. Obviously that's unlikely in the OP's case, but it's happened to me, so it might be worth checking out.&nbsp;</div>

    <title>Error&#58; SXS.DLL Syntax error in manifest or policy file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> awyarbr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error&#58; SXS.DLL  Syntax error in manifest or policy file L&#58;&#92;I386&#92;asms&#92;1000&#92;MSFT&#92;WINDOWS&#92;GDIPLUS&#92;GDIPLUS.MAN</h2>
                    
<p>I recently purchased Windows 7 ultimate 64-bit.&nbsp; My computer has two hard drives; the one that came with my computer had Vista; the second was pulled out of an old computer had an XP upgrade from Win Millenium.&nbsp; I recently purchased Windows 7 ultimate.&nbsp;
 I installed Win 7 over XP (the old drive) as a "clean install" without any difficulty.&nbsp; I liked Win 7, but the old drive didn't have any space for it, plus Win 7 wouldn't run my legacy programs.&nbsp; So I installed Win 7 over Vista (the new drive), again without
 any difficulty, and then set about re-installing XP over the first Win 7 installation on the old drive, again a clean install.<br />
<br />
It was here that I enountered difficulty.&nbsp; In the initial phase, I was told that five xml files would not install:&nbsp; cmnicfg, ipcfg, osinfo, potscfg, and pppcfg.&nbsp; Then, after the first reboot, the installer needed the installation disk to look in the L:\I386\asms.&nbsp;
 But when it attempted to read it, it gave the error above:&nbsp; "Error: SXS.DLL&nbsp; Syntax error in manifest or policy file L:\I386\asms\1000\MSFT\WINDOWS\GDIPLUS\GDIPLUS.MAN".&nbsp; Then it rebooted the computer.&nbsp; I checked the installation disk on another machine and,
 yes, the file was present and readable.&nbsp; I then replaced by new copy of WinXP with the old upgrade disk that I used to install XP on that drive back in 2003.&nbsp; I received the exact same error.<br />
<br />
But what was worse was that I could no longer boot from the drive that had Windows 7!&nbsp; I went to the BIOS startup screen and selected the drive, but I kept returning to the unfinished installation of XP!<br />
<br />
Fortunately, I could still boot from the floppy, but for some reason I kept getting errors if I tried to start the XP installation again from scratch.&nbsp; So I installed Win 7 on the old drive, erasing the XP installation and at least getting the computer functioning
 again.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I am unable to boot from the win7 installation on the new drive.&nbsp; If I select the new drive at the bios, I am greeted with the error that &lt;Windows installation&gt;\system32\ntoskrnl.exe is missing.&nbsp; But I checked and the file is present on the new
 drive at D:\windows\system32\ntoskrnl.exe.&nbsp; Yes, I'm sure this is the right place.<br />
<br />
When I select the old drive at the bios, I am greeted by a new screen that lets me select the operating system I want to start.&nbsp; My options are "Windows 7" and "Windows 7 ultimate (recovered)".&nbsp; If I select "Windows 7", I boot up normally off the old drive.&nbsp;
 If I select "Windows 7 ultimate (recovered)" I am tossed back to the bios without explanation.<br />
<br />
Now I suppose I could completely reinstall Windows 7 on the new drive again, but I spent 4-5 hours downloading updates and installing applications and whatnot and I'd rather not have to do all that again, so I'd like to know how I can recover what I've already
 done.&nbsp; But I also want to know how to avoid the problem installing WinXP.</p>

            I attempted to run startup repair off the installation disk.&nbsp; It when through several iterations, but if finally gave up with a Problem Event Name of StartupRepairOffline and "problem signatures" of:<br />
<br />
01: 6.1.7600.16385<br />
02: 6.1.7600.16385<br />

06: 2<br />
07: NoRootCause<br />
08: OS Version 6.1.7600.2.0.0.256.1<br />
<br />
It also gives a series of files in the LogFiles directory that might help:&nbsp; disklayout.txt, bcdinfo.txt, bootstat.dat, bootfailure.txt, Srt\SrtTrail.txt; also, StartupRepair.etl in the Temp directory.<br />
<br />
The "diagnosis and repair details say that it successfully completed every test, but that "unspecified changes to system configuration might have caused the problem."

<h2>            Charms Bar Activates From Bottom Right Corner</h2>
                    New features implemented in Win 8.1 to turn off the Charms Bar works only partially. From Charms Bar - Settings I turned off the top right charms bar activation which works fine. However the charms bar still activates if the cursor swipes the bottom right
 corner. Does anyone have a complete solution to turn off the charms bar? Thank you.

<h3> frankgillam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth Headset &#40;Jaybird X&#41; Sound Quality &#47; Headset vs. Headphones</h2>
                    <p>So, I upgraded to Windows 10 and my Bluetooth headphones sound like I'm on a bad Skype call.&nbsp; I've got Windows 10 running, everything is currently updated (as of 9/3/2015) and the headset is Jaybird X's.&nbsp; When I connect, Windows recognizes them and I get
 sound, but it reads them as a "headset" instead of headphones.&nbsp; I noticed that when I physically touch near the mic (also the sound controls)&nbsp;I can hear my finger hit it in the speakers.&nbsp; This makes me think that the mic is picking up reverb/sound/feedback
 and that's what is killing my sound quality.</p>
<p>I checked my sound settings to see if there was a "headphones" option (eliminating the mic) and there was, it even says stereo! Wow!&nbsp; So I change to that and I get absolutely no sound.&nbsp; What a let down.&nbsp; I don't know why it won't let me change the type of
 connection, especially since it shows both types.&nbsp; As a side note, if I connect the headphones to my Windows Phone (running 10) the sound quality is clear as day.&nbsp; Any ideas?</p>

            I agree. I updated to Windows 8.1 earlier this year, and it bricked my computer. Fortunately, I was able to restore it to the former version, but it was difficult and extremely stressful. Now that I got the message saying that we're going to update in
 4 hours, I'm really stressing out again. Do I have to go through the entire process of letting it update and install, only to have it brick after waiting a couple of hours, then have to go through the hassle of restarting in safe mode and restoring to the
 previous version, only to have it force me to update again? I need to stop this somehow. Please give us a solution!

            <p>It is strongly encouraged that you upgrade to Windows 8.1 since support for Windows 8.0 will be ending next year. Microsoft does not want anyone to be caught off guard. There are lot of things to benefit from in Windows 8.1, including security updates going
 forward, ability to better customer the interface etc.</p>

</p><p>If you wish not to upgrade, see the following post:</p>

            Day late and dollar short. I'm on my PHONE because Microsoft hijacked my PC. I had no, NO option other than install this garbage. I'm at 74% right now and I do not want this on my computer. I Didn't even choose an option I immediately powered down my pc
 to avoid it losing all my work . The only 2 options I had was install or power down losing my work and it installed anyway! I'm now at &nbsp;82% tell me how to stop this immediately.... before it bricks my gaming rig.

            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; No need respond now, I'm black screen on boot, did I mention there was a reason i didn't upgrade? Been here before already. Thank GOD for this &nbsp;old laptop or the company of Microsoft would have completely shut me down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I learned my first programming on Basic. &nbsp;Absolutely amazed at what could be done. Hell first time i started checking out books from the library. Got in trouble for sneaking up on a school night &nbsp;to write programming LOL. First real program? an alarm clock
 with snooze!</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Finally a tape drive. I could store my programs!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Windows widows 3.1, i mean wow, that first screensaver. &nbsp;A hard drive?! 10 megs? how in the world would you ever fill it up? It was HUGE!</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 95? lets face it, it felt like 3.1. sure had nice graphics tho.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 98, man, perfection in a PC. Absolutely stunning for it's time. it turned the calculator into a PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows ME. We don't talk about that LOL. Honestly, I waded threw that for a couple years and had minimum problems. &nbsp;Not many complaints actually.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows XP, Man 98 is back! another fine showpiece for Microsoft. Do you know i still use XP on my work stations at work? Runs beautifully. Support or no support, XP is like a freight train, they just keep chugging along.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Vista? I honestly loved that system. I run large PC's so lag or boot times were not a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7? disappointed. A very watered down Vista. Why this was called Windows 7 and not Vista Lite i'll never know. quick buck $$?</p>
<p>
</p><p>.....and here we are Windows 8. I mean, what the hell were you thinking? I don't know who came up with this brain child but seriously, i mean SERIOUSLY, fire his ****. Whats next hire Barack Obama as your financial adviser? This isn't a change problem, this
 is a garbage problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I never thought i would say this but tomorrow i'm going to download Abuntu and learn something new. Hell never tried a MAC might be something to check into. Bottom line I am done, No more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Me and Kris999RT maybe a whisper in an ocean of shouts but we are many.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Feel free to ban me, kill thread, whatever, i copied the entire thing I feel this needs to be addressed outside the thumb of Microsoft. Ill be moving it somewhere more "open minded".</p>
<p>

            <p>If I want to run 8.0, that’s MY business. Usoft has NO right to force 8.1 on me. You’ve just lost a customer.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do NOT appreciate Microsoft hijacking my PC to install Win 8.1. Why couldn’t you offer an opt out? Why force it down my throat? When this PC breaks down, or if the Windows OS ever fails to function, I WILL
 be getting a MAC, AND I’ll be sharing this experience with my friends, family, and co-workers, and I won’t look back.

            <p>Once you go Mac, you never go back ;)</p>
<p>Well, until you're forced to by an employer, or school, etc. I feel your pain. I came home to my laptop automatically installing 8.1. Personally I didn't mind the upgrade, but I was rather annoyed that there was a complete OS upgrade sent out as an automatic
 update. Seems that should be one of the prompted updates, "Do you wish to upgrade to a new version?"</p>

            I was perfectly happy with Windows 8. I had been clicking the "remind me later" button for months because I had no intention of moving to 8.1. I have two computers (a desktop and a laptop) with two users set up on each one. I was literally forced to upgrade
 both computers -- no choice, so I had to stop what I was doing and reconfigure the computer for four different users. What a waste of time for something I did not want! Microsoft -- you need to give your users a choice! And, BTW, I really don't like Windows
 8.1. I hate learning where everything has moved after being quite efficient and quite happy with Windows 8.

            I also updated earlier this year and could no longer connect to the internet. It just forced me to update 8.1 again. And again, i cannot connect to internet. I called Microsoft and they told me the only solution is to refresh my computer, losing all of
 my downloaded stuff. ...including office. I'm through with this. I asked the rep to pass on my comments that 1. I shouldn't be forced to update and 2. How fair is it that Microsoft is going to be ending their support for 8 but not have fixed 8.1 to allow me
 and other users to connect to the internet?&nbsp;

            <p>I completely agree!!! Before they force us to download their **** they should at least have the decency to make sure all the kinks are worked out. I've heard nothing but problems from windows 8.1 and then I was forced to install it after pressing the remind
 me later for a long time. </p>
<p>Now, I'm having issues. Thankfully I haven't lost anything (...yet) but now I'm getting the gray screen of death which makes me have to press the power button to put it in sleep mode and turn it back on to get my screen back to normal. -.-</p>
<p>Microsoft is getting on my last nerve.</p>

<p>Servers have had many issues in the past. &nbsp;Online play is still available when servers are up, but the GHtunes server is shutdown and you can no longer download custom tracks made by users.
