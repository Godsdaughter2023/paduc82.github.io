<h2>            I do not have the option to hide notifications while presenting</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like every update, I check the new stuff that's been added, and while I was looking at the Microsoft Tips for this new update I came across a feature, the option to hide notifications while presenting. But in my case, I do not have this option, and I don't
 know why. I have a picture to prove it. Thank you for your understanding.</p>

            Hello frozenstein. The option to hide notifications while presenting was not new in 1803. I believe that the option has been taken out as I have also successfully updated to 1803 and do not see the option either. 
<br />
<br />You might want to tick the option off to get notifications from apps and other senders if you don't want any to show while presenting.

<br />Click on During these times

<br />Choose the hours you don't want to be disturbed.

<p>Maybe in the future, but to be crossplay needs to be an agreement between the developer and the platforms in question.
</p>
<p>Cross play works now in xbox exclusives because the developer and the platform is the same company.</p>

<h2>            Issue with Windows 10 Upgrade on Sony Vaio VGN-FW</h2>
                    Has anyone else had issues with Windows 10 and upgrading your Sony Vaio? &nbsp;I have attempted to upgrade with a usb and from the computer directly, but it always gets stuck on 32 percent at the 6 percent complete mark for the installation of drivers. &nbsp;Are
 there any ways of fixing this issue? If not, when will the drivers be available? I've already lost valuable amounts of time trying to upgrade and this is getting ridiculous. My computer was stuck for 48 hours.

            <p>Exactly same issue with Sony Vaio. Tried to install 4 times in vain. Sticks to 32% of installation, 6% for the drivers part. Even after a day &amp; night no progress. Before installment I updated drivers manually, de-installed Norton, but in vain. No further
 solutions from Answer Desk. I give up now. Obviously W10 not suited for W10</p>

I will caution you to be careful that you don't accidentally format any of your hard drives - be sure your USB stick is in and know what the drive letter is! This part always makes me a little nervous, so be careful.<br />

<h3> borderrider  say:</h3>
<h2>            Epson Perfection V600 Scanner vs. ArcSoft Photo Studio 6 Version 6.0.6.187</h2>
                    <p>The software for both above came together, and worked fine until late May 2018.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a Windows 10 update in May 2018, I can no longer do more than 1 scan.&nbsp; Also it appears that if ArcSoft Photo Studio is not being used at the same time, then the Epson Perfection V600 Scanner will load and scan a number of times.
<br />
<br />
But if ArcSoft Photo Studio is being used, then on trying to open Epson Perfection V600 I get a message "cannot communicate with scanner". If I turn off the scanner and turn back on, it will allow 1 scan, and then locks up.<br />
<br />
Microsoft Corp so far has been worthless, and will not acknowledge the problem or offer any real help.

            Hey Rider.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If you want to complain to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback.   But Microsoft will not even see it here because this is a  tech forums where we are mostly volunteers trying to help solve your problems.
<br />
<br />Rather than spending too much more time fiddling I'd simply Clean Reinstall the scanner which always works, lasts longer and actually saves time:
<br />
<br />1) Power up the scanner, if wired unplug it's USB cable from PC.  
<br />
<br />2) Go to Settings&gt;Apps&gt;Apps and Features to find and Uninstall the scanner software.    
<br />
<br /> 3) Next type CMD in Start Search, right click Command Prompt result to Run as Admin, copy and paste in the following command and press Enter:  printui /s /t2     (Note that there is one space before each forward slash). 
<br />
<br />4 Open the Print Server properties, Remove the scanner drivers for this scanner and for any other scanners or printers you don't use presently.  
<br />
<br />5) If you get a message about access denied or the scanner/printer being in use and you cannot find the driver or any installed program that would account for this, you may restart the computer in a diagnostic startup and then use the printui  command to remove the driver package(s): <a href="https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/enable-diagnostic-startup-in-windows-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/enable-dia...</a>
<br />You must restart back to normal mode before you will be able to install the pscanner again.  
<br />
<br />6) Now type Control Panel in Start Search, open CP, choose Icon View.  In Control Panel open Devices and Printers, right click the scanner to delete the scanner and any printer or fax of the same name.  Restart PC.    
<br />
<br />7) Go to the  model’s Support Downloads webpage to download and install the latest full software package.  Now is also the time to check for any  newer firmware to install which matters a lot. 
<br />
<br />Older software may need to be installed in Compatibility Mode to run correctly:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-software-windows-10-compatibility-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/run-old-softwa...</a>
<br />
<br />8) Extract  software, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  Follow the setup screens closely as you install the software.  For USB it should prompt when to plug in the scanner.    
<br />
<br />If you have further problems reply back with results of each step.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Yes, not the best news you want to hear. These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Now, get ready to go back to your previous version. I recommend Windows 10 1703 because its the most stable and efficient release to date. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy

<h2>            &#34;The activation server determined that the specified product key has been blocked&#34; Error 8xC004C003</h2>
                    <p>Having successfully overcome several frustrating issues in upgrading 3 of my personal computers to Windows 10, I have come across a perplexing error and was wondering if anyone has experienced such issues and knows of a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having upgraded to windows 10 from Windows 7, my OEM product key activated with out any issues. A few hours later, Windows 10 is running into several "Device cannot start - Code 10" errors so &nbsp;I decided to perform a clean install using the Windows 10 Media
 Creator tool. As my machine had already activated I knew that upon reinstalling the operating system Microsoft's activation servers would recognise the machine's unique ID and reactivate automatically (I had successfully achieved this on two machines just
 prior to attempting it on this machine).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the fresh copy of Windows 10 was installed I was informed that Windows could not activation due to error code 0xC004C003. In the usual Microsoft fashion the error code description is less than helpful and in summary states that I should "buy a new key
 from Microsoft".&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Could someone explain what has happened and how to rectify it? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot explain how frustrating it is that something goes wrong with a perfectly good and valid key and the default response is not how to fix the problem or why the problem happened in the first place but to direct the consumer to buy another key...</p>

            <p>ok, replying to myself just to update. Called The automated system again because there apparently is not a direct number to contact the Windows 10 Activation/Technical Support Department. Spent 23 minutes on hold after getting past the automated system before
 i finally got a Live person to Transfer me to the Windows 10 Department only to have have a system tell me that my call can not be completed at this time, and then Disconnected the call. No pass back to anyone, just disconnected the call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can not believe there is no Number to call to get to this Windows 10 department they are passing people to. If I know I can not be helped by the first department why must I wait on hold for them to transfer me to the next department?</p>

<p>
I uninstalled a few programs and one of them was a cloud storage. Next thing all my desktop files had little grey crosses. Then I noticed that a couple had green ticks so I automatically associated the problem with files not copied or backed up. Damn nuisance
 now Ive got to find a way to remove the horrible cross from the files without clouding them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your question in Microsoft Community. We are glad to help you.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To help you suggest more steps to resolve the issue, I would appreciate it if you could answer the following questions:
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Were any significant changes made to your computer prior to this issue?
</span></li><li><span>What is the complete model number of your Dell Inspiron laptop? </span>
</li><li><span>Are you using any third party sound manager for audio enhancement? </span>
</li><li><span>Does the computer also slow down while using other programs/applications?
</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to try following the suggestions given below and check if this helps to fix the issue.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: Update the driver for Sound Devices.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would first suggest you to update the drivers for the sound devices on your computer and check if this helps to fix the problem.
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Access Device Manager by clicking the <strong>Windows Start Button</strong> &gt;
<strong>Control Panel</strong> &gt; <strong>System and Maintenance.</strong> </span>
</li><li><span>Scroll down and click on <strong>Device Manager</strong>. <span>&nbsp;</span></span></li><li><span>Expand <strong>Sound, Video and Game Controllers</strong>" by clicking on the
<strong>+ sign</strong>, <strong>right-click over the sound device</strong> and click

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: Perform Clean Boot. </span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to try performing a Clean Boot on your computer, as </span>

    <title>Connecting a Mac monitor to a PC - dual monitor setup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> liamflanagan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Connecting a Mac monitor to a PC - dual monitor setup</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
My problem is that I've been trying to connect a Mac monitor to a my Dell PC laptop that's running Windows 7. I've bought the Mac to PC adaptor (DVI Female to 15 pin VGA male) from Maplin and everything's connected up. But I can't get anything to appear on
 the Mac Monitor. I've been able to move parts of my music software off screen but then they don't appear on the Mac monitor. In fact, its hard to tell if the monitor's on, the white light is on but the screen doesn't flicker or change from a blank black screen.
 I've tried using both duplicating and extending the screen in the Display settings on my laptop but to no avail. Could someone please explain to me how to set this up and where the problem may lie?<br />
<br />
Thank you<br />
<br />
Liam<br />

            If the Mac monitor will only accept digital input the adapter is useless.
<div><br />
<div>The adapter will convert the plug-out from a DVI-I signal, which includes an analog signal, but cannot convert a VGA (analog) signal to a DVI-D (digital only) signal.</div>

            If the monitor will only accept a digital connection you!need to connect it to,a digital output on your laptop. Either DVI - any version - or HDMI with a HDMI to DVI adapter.
<div><br />
<div>If your laptop only has a VGA output there are converters available, but a simple adapter will not convert the analog VGA output to digital.

<h2>            Surface 3 won&#39;t charge and no longer starts up because of low battery</h2>
                    <p>I've had charging issues the last few months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not 100% sure if the actual battery has run it's course and if I should get that replaced or if it's another problem.</p>
<p>I've had my surface 3 since 2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using the original charger, which can charge other micro USB devices fine - So I'm sure it's not the Power Brick/ USB Cable.</p>
<p>One thing that's odd and I don't remember if it was always like this, there is a lot of 'play' with the Surface charging port. I have tried multiple Micro USB's and they all wiggle around..</p>
<p>I've also read that a few people found that the charge port needed to be re-soldered.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I press the on button I get the Low Power picture and it doesn't matter if I have had it on charge for a few hours or not that's all I'm getting now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before my laptop ended up like this for about a month the laptop would only charge up to 100% if it was in sleep or shut down.</p>
<p>When the laptop was on and in use with the charger was plugged in, the battery icon would say 'Plugged in - but not charging'.</p>
<p><br />
Unfortunately because I'm in the UK there are no Microsoft Stores to get help in person.</p>
<p>Before I start spending money on repairs I just wanted to try and rule some stuff out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone one else come across this problem?<br />
</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Greetings from Canada!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My charging port has been loose since shortly after I purchased S3 3 years ago. I had charging issues in the past and found cables that are suitable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also purchased a desktop docking station for the surface 3. It charges through another port. You may find&nbsp; a used one in your area. That has lessened my concerns about charging.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a fine machine and will continue to use it until it quits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jim</p>

            Hi Eric.  Hi  I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year WIndows MVP here to help you.<br /><br />First you can try updating the chipset and AI Suite from the Asus Support downloads webpage for your PC model.<br /><br />Was this the Fall Creators Update version 1709?  Check at Settings&gt;System&gt;About.<br /><br />If so you can roll it back to the older version at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery or following this:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/rollback-uninstall-windows-10-creators-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/rollback-uninstal...</a><br /><br />Then I'd hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>.  Run the tool to check for Updates and hide Feature Update Version 1709.  <

<h2>            Upgrade to W10 and Creation of Microsoft account locks me out of my PC</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to W10 on my main PC, worked great, used it for a while, tried to add an app, that required creating a Microsoft account. During that process, I had to create a password. Not know that this would become the only way to login to my PC, I used a
 password manager to create a long complicated password. Everything went fine until the next time I restarted my computer and discovered that my PC was now a "device" using my new Microsoft account ID and whatever long complicated password I had selected. I
 can't access my password manager without logging in and my "PC as a device" is not connected at login,&nbsp;so using a different computer to change my Microsoft account password does not help. I can't roll back to Win7 or fix, reinstall, etc because all attempts
 to do that fail due to the main boot drive being locked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to get W10 to let me login&nbsp;via the old way? Right now, I see no way to change to a different user or account - it makes me attempt to enter the password for my Microsoft account just to login to my PC after a reboot and it is not even connected
 {Your device is offline. Please sign in with the last password used on this device. (except&nbsp;it does not acknowledge the password that I used before to login after reboots/lock-screens)&nbsp;}</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a backup, but no way to get in to restore to that backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help,</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Vanessa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the quick reply. Unfortunately, the first thing I did was reset my password and that did not work. My W10 PC will not go on-line from the login screen to verify the new password and allow access. When I type in the new password, it says "Your
 device is offline. Please sign in with the last password used on this device." The W10 PC is supposedly connected to the internet, but will not go on-line with Microsoft to verify my password for &lt;username&gt;@outlook.com. The network icon in the lower right
 corner of the login screen is full, and clicking on it reveals that the PC is connected to the network/internet. Here is the timeline for this situation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Used W7 for many years with a simple login password for start-ups and unlocking lock-screen. For simplicity, let's call that Pwd1.</p>
<p>2. Accept offer to upgrade from W7 to W10. Continued to use Pwd1 to login and unlock the screen.</p>
<p>3. After successful upgrade, 99% of my previous stuff under @7 still worked under W10 (the only thing that no longer worked was BitDefender, so I uninstalled it and re-installed it with no trouble and it was working fine). Continued to use Pwd1 to login
 and unlock screen.</p>
<p>4. Now that I had everything working, I decided to try some of the new features, such as the ability to install apps. The first app that I tried to install from the MS Store required that I create a Microsoft account. I created a new MS account and chose
 &lt;username&gt;@outlook.com as a new ID/e-mail, since it would not allow me to use my existing &lt;user&gt;@q.com e-mail for an ID. I chose a strong password with a password manager that generates long complex random passwords, because I thought this would only be used
 to access the Microsoft Store to buy/install apps. For simplicity let's call that VeryLongComplexPassword2. I did not notice any warning that I would need to memorize this password in order to login to my machine or to unlock the screen. If such a warning
 had existed, I would have chosen a new simple easy to remember password and/or written it down.</p>
<p>5. After exploring the new features/settings of W10 for a while, I decided to shutdown and do other things. Shortly after shutting down, I remembered something else I wanted to try, started the computer and attempted to login with my usual Windows login
 password (Pwd1) and failed. At that point I noticed a new addition to the login screen, right above the password box was my brand new MS account ID: &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt;. Uh Oh. The password that was now required to simply access my machine was probably
 VeryLongComplexPassword2. I never even saw that password, let alone memorized it, because it was generated by a Password Manager. Without access to my machine I could not access the Password Manager.</p>
<p>6. I fired up a separate W7 computer and went to microsoft.com to see if I could reset my password to something easy and get back into my W10 computer. That went fine and I chose a new simple password, Let's call that Pwd3. I go back to my W10 machine and
 type in Pwd3. No luck - "Your device is offline. Please sign in with the last password used on this device." The W10 machine would not connect to microsoft to check to see if my new password was valid.</p>
<p>7. After many restarts and an overnight time period, my W10 machine still will not connect to microsoft to verify any password that I attempt and thus will not recognize my new password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what are my options? Can you call me and tell me my old VeryLongComplexPassword2 that I had around 9:30 PM mountain time Wednesday August 6th (about 3:30 AM Zulu/Universal time Thursday August 7th in the timeline that I can see in my account summary
 at microsoft.com)? Doing so should not compromise security, since the only machine/account that cares about that password anymore is my unconnected W10 machine and even it won't care once it finally connects to microsoft to see that I have a new password (Pwd3).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that is not possible, i.e. if nobody can see my original Microsoft Account VeryLongComplexPassword2, then is there a way to force windows to login to my machine via my old pre-Microsoft-Account method that utilized Pwd1?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for your help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Scott</p>

            <p>Solved:</p>
<p>1. Avoid the problem in the first place by not allowing Microsoft to hijack your login. Make your login account local. Set up a backup local user just in case they somehow manage to hijack your login despite your diligence. Make your local login passwords
 simple and easy to remember. Store backups of those passwords somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Pick an easy to remember password for your Microsoft Account, not a complex random secure password. It is unfortunate that you have to be less secure in order to reduce the odds of trouble. For every other site , in my experience, you can safely choose
 the maximum length/complexity/randomness and never have to worry because they will never hijack your login and make that password your login password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Despite not knowing about 1. and 2. above, I would have been able to avoid trouble via resetting my Microsoft Account password if I had known how to keep Bitdefender from blocking internet access after upgrading to Windows 10 (see Bitdefender FAQ for
 instructions). Thanks for putting the last several months to good use toward avoiding this mess Bitdefender...</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. If you somehow end up in this situation anyway, my solution was to remove the boot drive from my Windows 10 computer, plug it in as a non-boot drive in another computer and extract my password manager file. I was then able to open that file with the password
 manager on that computer and access my VeryLongComplexPassword2 and then I put the boot drive back in the W10 computer and used the old password to get past the "Your device is offline. Please sign in with the last password used on this device." blockage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. After getting back in I fixed Bitdefender and created two local login accounts with one of those being the default login account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fun times.</p>

            <p>I had the same problem. Why doesn't MS tell us that it will change the password when we login to MS account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I got around it by using my friends computer, changing the password for MS account (click "forgot password", give email address, and receive a link to change the password) or go straight to link shown in previous post:

    <title>Hard Drive Enclosure for Surface Pro 4 SSD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jodie2017  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hard Drive Enclosure for Surface Pro 4 SSD</h2>
                    <p>My little over 1 year old Surface Pro 4 died last week.&nbsp; Locked up while surfing the web.&nbsp; I tried all the internet button combo suggestions, never got it to turn back on.&nbsp; Took it to Microsoft Store and they couldn't get it to turn back on.&nbsp; Offered me
 a discount on a trade, as it is 2 months out of warranty.&nbsp; I don't want to trade because I need to get my files off.&nbsp; Of course, I got the looks of contempt when I told them I hadn't backed up the files to the Cloud.&nbsp; Don't judge.&nbsp; I shouldn't have to back
 up to the cloud *just in case* my 1 yr old computer suddenly decides to croak.&nbsp; Why doesn't Microsoft work to making a better product for the price??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway....Since I was told there was *nothing they could do*, here I am with my $850 drink coaster.&nbsp; I have torn it apart to get at the hard drive to attempt to recover my files.&nbsp; And, I'm staring at a hard drive with a bunch of letters and numbers and looking
 on Amazon for an enclosure to shove it in to get my files off.&nbsp; So many choices and so many specifications.&nbsp; Can anyone tell me exactly which enclosure they have used that worked?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the stuff on the hard drive:</p>
<p>Samsung</p>
<p>Model MZ-FLV1280</p>
<p>PM951</p>
<p>MZFLV128HCGR-00MV</p>
<p>
</p><p>In some places I've searched, I'm finding that no enclosure currently exists for this drive, but I really, really, really hope that is not the case and I would really, really, really like to get at my files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>External SSD card enclosures are all over the place. &nbsp;You can get them for about $10 and they are universal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is one:&nbsp;https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01M08LCXW?aaxitk=jdPc9vwQQriUNrDliO4zpQ&amp;pd_rd_i=B01M08LCXW&amp;pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_p=3534726502&amp;pd_rd_wg=2eYB3&amp;pf_rd_r=H8K05DXTRK4P3WW0MWZ1&amp;pf_rd_s=desktop-sx-top-slot&amp;pf_rd_t=301&amp;pd_rd_w=uKgAc&amp;pf_rd_i=ssd+card+enclosure&amp;pd_rd_r=ba981077-1cad-449e-9a87-85991e4bcb19&amp;hsa_cr_id=6247291910201</p>
<p>
</p><p>HOWEVER!!!!!!!!!!!!! &nbsp;Getting the card out of the machine is a whole different ballgame! &nbsp;Go to http://www.ifixit.com and type in "surface pro 4" and you will find a section for replacing the SSD card. &nbsp;It will show you instructions on how to get to it but
 you destroy what is left of the machine doing it. &nbsp;Since it is already broke, probably no loss but you do get to save your data.</p>

<p>Oh well....seeing as how my tablet is basically an $850 drink coaster anyway, I have already completely destroyed it getting the hard drive out, so that's not an issue.&nbsp; Curiously enough, what I found when I dug inside is that there was basically no thermal
 paste on the cpu.&nbsp; Hmmm....wonder if that could have had anything to do with the system failing....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I have the external drive out and ready to get data off of it.&nbsp; And, I know it works.&nbsp; A tech friend put it in an empty slot in his desktop and was able to see the file structure.&nbsp; Unfortunately, thanks to BitLocker and all that, he was unable to
 pull my data off.&nbsp; I gave him my BitLocker key and all my logins and passwords.&nbsp; I'm getting really mad about how hard it is for ME to get MY files off this stupid tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there are a ton of external enclosures out there.&nbsp; That's why I was looking for a specific recommendation of an enclosure someone has actually used successfully to get their data off one of these hard drives.&nbsp; Do you know if the one you linked is
 PCIe compatible?&nbsp; Because that's what the drives in Surface Pro 4 are....PCIe SSD.</p>

<p>Well, if the drive functioned when a tech put it into his computer, the SATA interface is working!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ask the tech to see if he can view the drive using Linux.&nbsp; If it is not recognized, then the entire drive is simply encrypted and you are not going to get anything off of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can run Linux "live" mode without installing it and try to view the SSD with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have two external cases myself and they work 100% with just about any SSD card.&nbsp; I also have a docking station that you can insert the card into it and use it that way also.&nbsp; All work from a USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SATA, by the way is PCIe controlled.</p>

<p>I'm concerned when you say, "if it is not recognized, then the entire drive is simply encrypted and you are not going to get anything off of it."</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the entire drive is encrypted, then Microsoft needs to have a way to get into it and get MY data off.&nbsp; I did not encrypt it.&nbsp; I simply purchased a tablet running Windows 10.&nbsp; The stupid BitLocker crap is built into the OS.&nbsp; So, then, what I need to know
 for the future is how to turn BitLocker off if it is going to keep me from ever getting my own files off my own system that I bought and paid for!&nbsp; I guess I just don't understand this BitLocker stuff at all.&nbsp; I get it that it protects you from if your tablet
 gets stolen and stuff, but why on Earth does it keep you from getting at your stuff yourself?&nbsp; I gave the drive to a friend who is way more tech savvy than myself.&nbsp; I gave him all my passwords and even the BitLocker key I found on my Microsoft Account.&nbsp; He
 ran a Windows emulator and still couldn't get the files off.&nbsp; It's BS.&nbsp; It's frustrating that I can't even get into my own files on a working hard drive.&nbsp; I sure miss the good ole days.&nbsp; When my laptop choked on the last Windows 10 update in March and started
 giving me BSOD, I was able to pull it apart, pop out the hard drive, put it in an enclosure and get my data off before reinstalling the operating system.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, about the enclosures...you say they work with just about any SSD, but can you confirm a specific enclosure that works with the specific SSD out of a Surface Pro 4 tablet?&nbsp; Because, every single enclosure on Amazon, NewEgg, etc. says down in the specs
 that they do NOT work with M.2 PCIe SSD.&nbsp; That's why I am asking for some specific information.&nbsp; I don't care if they are only $10, I want to make sure it's going to work with this specific SSD before I waste my money.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It shouldn't be this hard to get at my data.&nbsp; Of course, I also should be able to buy a reliable piece of tech that works for more than a year or at least has the support to help me when it fails.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>If Linux can't see the data, then Bitlocker is doing its job.&nbsp; That means you will still have to use a Windows PC and enter the bitlocker key to access the data.&nbsp; However, looks like you tried to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take the drive back to the tech you worked with before who apparently had it functioning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have never had a problem from a SSD card by attaching it to either a docking station or an enclosure.&nbsp; The card or the enclosure has an adapter for the card edge connector which gives it a SATA interface to connect to a standard SATA hard disk cable.&nbsp;
 At that point, any computer should be able to read it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From your first reply, it looks like you did this before and it functioned and asked for the Bitlocker key.&nbsp; I do not see what the problem beyond that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Take it back to that tech who worked with it before and try again.&nbsp; Other than that, you hit the card with a hammer to destroy it and consider your data gone!</p>

            I tried it in Google instead of Microsoft Edge and it does not do it. Why would Microsoft Edge be the one to cause this?&nbsp; Really strange. Ii switched from Google to Microsoft Edge over a year ago due to issues with Google. Now what?

<p>

    <title>Swapped hard drives - cannot activate Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drwhok9  say:</h3>
<h2>            Swapped hard drives - cannot activate Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I've tried about every 'fix' I can think of for this and every one is a dead end so would appreciate any insights anyone might have.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here is the basic gist of what happened.&nbsp; I purchased a&nbsp;refurbished laptop for my daughter that was working great on Windows 7 that she upgrade to Windows 10 and it was working even better (love Windows 10 by the way as I use it on my other laptop).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, shortly after the upgrade, the screen became defective as 3 pinkish vertical lines would show up at all times (no, this wasn't an OS issue, this was due to a screen defect).&nbsp; It proved to be a hardware error and as I was within the warranty period,
 they agreed to replace the system...yeah.&nbsp; So I get the new system and as I didn't want to lose all the data she had already setup on the new machine simply swapped drives so her old drive was now in the system with a fixed screen.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is where the problems start.&nbsp; I go to activate Windows and it says its a "blocked" product key and won't let me.&nbsp; I try reinstalling windows 10, no dice.&nbsp; I try reverting back to Windows 7 so I can then upgrade again, it gives me an error and says I
 can't.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>On the old versions of Windows it would give you the call-in option when you had issues like this.&nbsp; However, with Windows 10, that doesn't appear to be an option.&nbsp; Please note, the replacement system also came with a valid OS and I have tried using the product
 code for both it and for the old 'pre-return' system and it tells me both are invalid.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help!?!?!?&nbsp; I can't go forward and I can't go backward.&nbsp; I appear to be in 'the void' and don't know how to get out of it.&nbsp; Any suggestions?????</p>

            <p>Thank you for the reply however, I'm afraid it doesn't help much. &nbsp;:(</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I mentioned previously, this was a recent purchase and the system came installed with an authentic/valid version of Windows 7. &nbsp;However, as is the case with many systems these days, it came pre-installed and I did NOT receive any install disk with the
 system. &nbsp;Actually, one of the first things I tried when I realized I was stuck was to select the "Go Back to Windows 7" option in the recovery section under Update &amp; Security. &nbsp;However, I get an error message saying that it can't revert. &nbsp;If I had install
 disk for Windows 7, I could use the product key associated with this system but as I do NOT I have no way to get to the point where it'll ask me for the code. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I DID perform a backup of my data so I have that if I can every find a way to install a clean copy but I'm stuck now. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions????&nbsp;</p>

<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />BCC101 is usually due to a hardware issue. I see BIOS driver was named:
<br />
<br />*** WARNING: Unable to verify timestamp for mssmbios.sys
<br />
<br />But as this issue concerns an Insider build it might be an intermittent issue. Did you try rolling back to the last stable build?

<p><span><span>&nbsp;Why do we have to download every game that we buy to me thats a waste of 500 gb there is no point in buying the next gen consoles if your gonna download like 7 games and there goes 500 gb...
 sometimes i feel like i wasted my money on the xbox one. I am a diehard microsoft fan and would never go to sony but i am very disappointed</span></span></p>

<p>I think it's because the game data can't be pulled off the blu ray quick enough, whereas a hdd it can. If the blu ray drive could spin quick enough and read the data it would probably explode.</p>

<p>Do you mean download or install? I'm not sure why it matters if it's installing because there's extra storage options like an external HD or you can just delete the game when you're done.... Am I missing something here?</p>

<p>I mean install the game. why cant u just put the game in the xbox one and just play the game? Nd the games i have is titanfall, the evil within forza horizon 2 nba 2k14 madden 25 spiderman 2 destiny and that filled up all my memory. And yea external storage
 is the way to go but its dumb how u have to purchase that and the 500gb that your xbox came with was worthless. I just think the 360 way was better. Put the game in and play and it would only use the memory to save the game data. If u wanted to install the
 game than u could if not than it wouldnt matter.</p>

<p>Hey there Anne!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're experiencing difficulty with attempting to launch this game.
</p>
<p>In this situation, I would first suggest trying the steps here on our support site entitled "<a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/troubleshooting/game-freeze-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">My Xbox One game won't start or freezes during gameplay</a>"
 and see if that helps resolve the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If that does not work, then the next best course of action in my opinion would be for you to attempt what we call a soft reset of your console.
<span>
<span>It's a reset of your console back to factory settings but one that does not uninstall any of your games or apps and is a really good troubleshooting step for most issues.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p style="text-align: left; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); margin-left: 0">
<span><span>Just
 make sure that before you go ahead with it, that you do know all of the sign-in information for any/all of your accounts</span></span><span><span>(as</span></span><span><span>they
 will be removed) </span></span><span><span>and
 have easy access to your internet network</span></span><span><span>.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p style="text-align: left; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); margin-left: 0">
<span><span>Also
 make sure that you select the option denoted reset and keep my games and apps.&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
