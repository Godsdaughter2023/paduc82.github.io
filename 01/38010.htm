    <title>Activate Button Went Missing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Activate Button Went Missing</h2>
                    <p>After installing the Technical Preview on my Samsung notebook previously running Window 8.1, the upgrade to Windows 10 went well.</p>
<p>The prompt to activate Windows came and I went to the Settings page. I clicked the Activate Now button, and the message was that this could not be done for the time being. I tried several times without success. So I clicked Go to Store hoping that was where
 the key would be obtainable. Alas, a stern message told me to buy ( at $199.00 ) the key. ostensibly because the key was not genuine. I tried to click on the Change Key button, got the same result. But now the Activate now key is nowhere to be seen in the
 Activation menu. How did it go all wrong?</p>
<p>How do I get this installation validated?</p>
<p>Help will be appreciated</p>

            <p><span>Hi John,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community. Your interest in Windows 10 is much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you upgrade to Windows 10 from Windows store, then you don’t need any product key for Windows 10. This issue might occur if Windows activation file gets corrupted. I would suggest you to activate over phone.</p>
<ol>
<li>Press Windows key + X then click Run, then type: slui.exe 4</li><li>Next press the 'ENTER' key</li><li>Select your 'Country' from the list.</li><li>Choose the 'Phone Activation' option.</li><li>Stay on the phone (do not select/press any options) and wait for a person to help you with activation.</li></ol>
<p>Hope this information was helpful and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to assist.
</p>

            <p>Thanks&nbsp; for your help. Unfortunately the phone support did not help much. I phoned the local support office, gave them the numbers and was told the key had been blocked.&nbsp;I&nbsp;explained &nbsp;that my Samsung notebook had shipped was bought new, went through the upgrades
 to 8.1 to the Technical preview without a hitch, installed the final build successfully. Only in the rush to get the activation done after the activate button had been pressed fruitlessly after several attempts did I make the seemingly fateful mistake of pressing
 the Change the key button did I notice that the Activate Now button had disappeared and directed to the Store and have to pay to get the new key. After waiting for an eternity on muzak,, my airtime ran out and had to disconnect. I hope to reconnect sometime.
 I might end up having to buy the retail version-not yet available here- wipe my disk and start afresh.

<p>I need to reinstall Photo Editor or a replacement </p>
<p>I have followed the procedure as per doownload document&nbsp; original disk inserted and it tells me</p>
<p>"cant due to the upgrades"&nbsp; maybe I clicked the wrong box as they are different to that as defined in the</p>

<p>So how do I install this or a relevant program so that I can decrease the Byte Size of a photo that I can email them</p>

            <p>I have MS Photo Editor version 3.01 and it does not require installing.<br />
I just left click the 'microphotoed.exe' file and it unpacks the files into<br />
the same folder...then I can launch the program by left clicking <br />
'PHOTOED.EXE'<br />
<br />
More info...<br />
<br />
In XP when you right click a photo and choose...Send To Mail Reicpient...<br />
you should see a Resize dialog box...if it's not appearing...try the following:<br />
<br />
Go to...Start / Run...and type or copy/paste the following command:<br />
<br />
regsvr32 /i shimgvw.dll<br />
(yes, the space after the 2 and the space<br />
after the i is required)<br />
<br />
Press...Enter...<br />
<br />
You should see a dialog box that says:<br />
DllRegisterServer and DllInstall in shimgvw.dll succeeded<br />
<br />
Also the free Windows XP PowerToy Image Resizer<br />
may be worth a try:<br />
<br />
Go to the following link and left click the <br />
PowerToys tab...<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System <br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
Windows XP Downloads<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/windows-xp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/windows-xp</a><br />
<br />
Download and install:&nbsp;&nbsp; ImageResizer.exe<br />
(Filename&nbsp; :&nbsp; ImageResizerPowertoySetup.exe)<br />
(will not run on Vista)<br />
<br />
Then you can open any folder that contains<br />
images and you will have an option to resize.<br />
Just right click the selected image files and<br />
choose Resize Pictures from the menu. You<br />
can select one image or a whole group.<br />
<br />
The program will place the resized copies in<br />
the folder with your originals.<br />
(Tip: *Never* overwrite your originals)<br />
<br />
To insure that images in both portrait and<br />
landscape orientation are resized to the<br />
same dimensions...go to...Advanced...<br />
and enter the largest number in both fields.<br />
IOW...for 600x800...enter 800 in both fields.<br />

The newer models are different brands or webcams.<br />

The older models used Logitch webcams. Maybe there are drivers available from Logitech.<br />

</span><b>A Monument To All Your Sins (150G)</b> - <i>Complete the Campaign on Legendary difficulty -- alone</i>.<br />

</i></span>
<ul>
<li><span><i>You can find helpful strategies and tips when playing on Legendary all over the internet. Obviously, you'll want to take your time, use cover and health packs a lot. If you're up for a challenge, go ahead and try Legendary. Good luck, Spartan.</i></span>
</li></ul>
</blockquote>
<p><span><span><b>Campaign/Firefight</b></span><br />
</span></p>
<blockquote><span><b>They've Always Been Faster (25G)</b> - <i>Clear the 2nd mission without setting foot in a drivable vehicle.</i><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">This is really simple, but you have to do it on Normal difficulty or higher. On Winter Contingency, simply do not get in any drivable vehicles during the entire mission.</span><span><br />
<br />
<b>KEEP IT CLEAN (5G) </b>- <i>Kill 7 Moa during the 2nd mission of the Campaign.</i><br />
</span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">Moa are the ostrich looking creatures in this game. You'll come across a lot of them in the 2nd mission, "Winter Contingency". Simply shoot and kill 7 of them to unlock this achievement.</span>
<b><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">*No animals were harmed in the making of this achievement.*</span></b><br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><br />
</span><b>Two Corpses In One Grave (25G) </b>- <i>Kill 2 vehicles at once with the Target Locator in the 3rd mission.</i><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">On ONI: Sword Base, choose the Rally Point Alpha checkpoint. Make sure the difficulty setting is on Normal or higher. Once you start, move forward a little bit and on the left you will see the Target Locator. Pick it up and
 proceed forward. Go down the hill a bit and you will see 2 Wraiths which you will need to destroy at once with the TL. Wait until they move towards the middle of the pathway and mark the target right on them (or near them). They should both be destroyed and
 you will unlock the achievement.</span><span><br />
<br />
<b>Banshees, Fast And Low (25G) </b>- <i>Hijack a Banshee during the Campaign</i>.<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">Load up Tip Of The Spear mission, on Rally Point Bravo. Make sure you're on Normal difficulty or higher. After you crash land from riding in the falcon, proceed up the hill and you'll run into some enemies. If you notice above,
 there will be at least 2 Banshees flying around. Focus on one and try to get close enough to hijack it (press and hold X). Be careful because one of your teammates might destroy it. If they do, focus on the other one. This might take some time to do but you'll
 eventually get it. Also, having a jet pack equipped might help you.</span><span><br />
<br />
<b>Your Heresy Will Stay Your Feet (25G)</b> - <i>Kill the Elite Zealot before he escapes during the 5th mission.</i><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">Load up Tip Of The Spear mission, on Rally Point Alpha. Again, make sure you're not on Easy difficulty. Once you're past the bridge, you'll run into some buildings. Not long after you'll hear about the Elite Zealot, who you're
 ordered to take down. Make you're way through the level until you see the Elite Zealot. He will have a little red arrow above him. You can take him out easily with a DMR from far range, just make sure you kill him before he escapes. Pretty simple achievement,
 just make sure you keep an eye out for him.</span><span><br />
<br />
<b>If They Came To Hear Me Beg (25G) </b>- <i>Perform an Assassination against an Elite to survive a fall that would've been fatal.</i><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">A lot of people have a tough time with this achievement for some reason. Nobody knows exactly why. Sometimes it will unlock, sometimes it won't. So expect to give it a few tries. It took me about 20-30 attempts until I finally
 got it. The easiest way to do this is on Pillar Of Autumn at mission start and jumping off the cliff right when you start the level onto an Elite and assassinating him. You'll see the Elite standing next to some Grunts down below. The trick is to run and jump,
 but while in the air, tapping LB to get out of sprint (watch your sprint meter to the left) and then performing the assassination on the Elite. If you just jump off you probably won't make it, so make sure you run and jump. Timing and accuracy is extremely
 important (and some luck). You must be out of sprint while doing the assassination, though. If you do it but don't unlock the achievement, don't give up! Keep trying. Make sure you're not on Easy difficulty.</span><span><br />
<br />
<b>Wake Up Buttercup (25G)</b> - <i>Destroy the Corvette's engines &amp; escort in under 3 minutes in the 6th mission on Heroic or harder.</i><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">Make sure you're on Heroic difficulty! On Long Night of Solace at Rally Point Alpha, you'll need to destroy all the engines on the Corvette and escort out in under 3 minutes. This one is kind of difficult to explain and/or
 show you in text, so <b><a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81HHBRg63y4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here's a video</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/81HHBRg63y4?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/81HHBRg63y4?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></b> showing you how it's done.</span><span><br />
<br />
<b>Tank Beats Everything (25G)</b> - <i>Finish the 9th mission on Legendary with the Scorpion intact.</i><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">This one can be challenging. You'll need to prevent the Scorpion from being destroyed all the way through the mission, "The Package" on Legendary difficulty. My advice is to move slowly and look around a lot. Try and take
 out enemies from far away because if you get to close or if you get in an area where you're surrounded, you probably won't make it. If you die and the Scorpion blows up, but you start back at your last checkpoint with the Scorpion intact, that is OK. You can
 still get the achievement. Overall, you'll just need to take your time with this one. Be patient!</span><span><br />
<br />
<b>I Didn't Train To Be A Pilot (10G)</b> - <i>Kill 3 of the anti-aircraft batteries during the 8th mission.</i><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">On the mission, "New Alexandria", when you're assisting the Pelican, you'll need to destroy the 3 anti-aircraft turrets on the building. Each one has a little red arrow above them, so you can't miss them. Simply shoot and
 destroy all 3 them. Easy as cake.</span><span><br />
<br />
<b>Doctor, doctor (5G)</b> - <i>Use a Health Pack to replenish life after taking body damage.</i><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">This achievement is pretty much impossible not to get when playing through the campaign. Health packs are everywhere. When your health is not full, restore it by using a Health pack.</span><span><br />
<br />
<b>That's A Knife (10G)</b> - <i>Perform an Assassination on an enemy.</i><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">To perform an assassination, sneak up behind an enemy and hold down the melee button (RB). You will then perform an assassination. Doing this for the first time will unlock this achievement for you.</span><span><br />
<br />
<b>Lucky Me (25G)</b> - <i>Earn a Triple Kill while Jetpacking in Campaign, Firefight or Matchmaking.</i><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">I got this while doing Firefight. Make sure you have a jet pack on and a powerful weapon. Wait until you see 3 or more enemies nearby, jet pack up in the air, and fire away. I used a rocket launcher but you can use whatever
 you please. Grunts are good enemies to kill while doing this achievement.</span><span><br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><br />
</span><b>I See You A Favor A .45 (10G)</b> - <i>Kill 10 enemies in a Firefight or Campaign session with the M6G pistol.</i><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">Another easy one. Simply kill 10 enemies with your secondary M6G pistol. You can do this in Firefight or during the Campaign.</span><span><br />
<br />
<b>An Elegant Weapon (10G)</b> - <i>Kill 10 enemies in a Firefight or Campaign session with the DMR.</i><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">Just like "I See You A Favor A .45" achievement, except you need to use the DMR instead of the pistol. Simply shoot and kill 10 enemies during the Campaign or in Firefight.</span><span><br />
<br />
<b>Swap Meat (10G)</b> - <i>Trade weapons with an AI ally in Campaign.</i><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">Really easy. Go up to an ally and hold down X to trade weapons with them. You must have ammo in your gun to trade.</span><span><br />
<br />
<b>A Spoonful Of Blamite (10G)</b><b> </b>- <i>Kill 10 enemies in Firefight or Campaign with a supercombine explosion.</i><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">You can do this in the Campaign or Firefight. Shoot 10 enemies using the Needler until they
<b>explode and die</b>. The enemies must explode in order to get this achievement. The enemy needs to be big enough and playing on a higher difficulty is recommended. You'll see a pink badge pop up on your left if an enemy explodes. I did this in Firefight
 and kept shooting Hunters in the back until they blew up. Do this 10 times. The Needler is the gun with pinkish crystals sticking out of it.</span><span><br />
</span><span><b><br />
</b></span></blockquote>
<p><span><b>Firefight</b></span></p>
<blockquote><span><b>Crowd Control (10G)</b> - <i>Earn a Killionaire medal in Firefight.</i><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">A Killionaire is where you kill 10 enemies within 4 seconds. Watch for the drop ships when enemies are coming out of them. Using a Rocket Launcher is a good idea. Get a good look and blast away at them. This may take awhile
 to get if you're not using an easy Firefight playlist set up.</span><span><br />
<br />
<b>Score Attack (10G)</b> - <i>Score 15,000 points in Score Attack Firefight Matchmaking.</i><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">Just like it says. Play until you score 15,000 points in a Score Attack Firefight game. Note: you can't unlock this by doing an easy firefight achievement playlist set up.</span><span><br />
<br />
<b>Firestarter (10G)</b> - <i>Score 50,000 points in a Firefight game.</i><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">You can unlock this in an easy firefight achievement playlist or you can do it normally. It shouldn't take that long to unlock. Just keep going until you reach 50,000 points.</span><span><br />
<br />
<b>Blaze Of Glory (25G)</b> - <i>Score 200,000 points in a Firefight game.</i><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">Same as "Firestarter" achievement, but you have to reach 200,000 points.</span><span><br />
<br />
<b>Heat In The Pipe (75G)</b> - <i>Score 1,000,000 points in a Firefight game. </i>
<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">Same as "Firestarter" and "Blaze Of Glory" achievements, but you have to reach 1,000,000 points. This is one of the most challenging achievements to get in the game if you're not using an easy firefight achievement playlist.
 You can Google or Youtube good Firefight strategies. Good luck.</span><span><br />
<br />
<b>Game, Set, Match (25G)</b> - <i>Complete a Firefight set on Legendary without dying.</i><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">Make it through a full Firefight set on Legendary without dying once. My advice is to play like you're playing the campaign on Legendary. Be very careful and cautious. Take your time!</span><span><b><span><br />
</span></b></span></blockquote>
<p><span><span><b><span>Multiplayer</span></b></span><br />
</span></p>
<blockquote><span><b>Be My Wingman Anytime (5G)</b> - <i>Let a teammate spawn on you 5 times in an Invasion Matchmaking game.</i><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">You should be able to get this one while playing Invasion frequently or even in one game, make sure you are in cover and away from danger so that your teammates can spawn on you easier. They have to spawn on you 5 times.</span><span><br />
<br />
<b>Yes, Sensei (10G)</b> - <i>Earn a First Strike Medal in a Matchmaking game.</i><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">To unlock this achievement, all you need to do is get the first kill in a matchmaking game. Getting the first kill earns you a First Strike Medal, which then awards you the achievement.</span><span><br />
<br />
<b>Skunked (10G)</b> - <i>Win a game of Invasion in the 1st phase.</i><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">Self explanatory. Win a game of Invasion in the 1st phase. If you don't get it your first try, keep playing and you will eventually get it!</span><span>
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">Teaming up with players you can count on is a good idea :)</span><span><br />
<br />
<b>What's A Killing Spree? (5G)</b> - <i>Earn a Killing Spree in multiplayer Matchmaking.</i><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">A Killing Spree is where you kill 5 enemies in a row without dying. If you play multiplayer a lot, you're bound to get this sooner or later.</span><span><br />
<br />
<b>Knife To A Gun Fight (5G)</b> - <i>As an Elite, kill 5 Spartan players in Matchmaking.
</i><br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">A good way to do this is to play Invasion and when you are on the Elites side, kill 5 Spartans. You should be able to get this in no time.</span><span><b><span><br />
</span></b></span></blockquote>
<p><span><span><b><span>Misc.</span></b></span><br />

 way for head shots in the Firefight Commendations, or some parts of the campaign you could play over and over to work on a Commendation. Basically, just focus on one and play a lot. You'll unlock this achievement over time. If anyone else has good strategies
 or quick ways to earn this achievement, post them!</span><span><br />

<h2>            How to&#58; Setup Windows 10 on your Mac using Boot Camp</h2>
                    <b>Technical Level</b> : Intermediate
<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br />If you own a Apple Macintosh but need to use Windows 10, there are many options available. The most common choice is the Boot Camp utility bundled with OS X. This helps you prepare installation media, download Windows 10 drivers and partition your Mac's
 hard disk or SSD. With Boot Camp, your only option is to dual boot OS X and Windows 10. The benefits are significant because you get direct access to the hardware so the performance faster.

After my recent experiment trying out the Boot Camp Option, I have come to the conclusion, installing in a Virtual Machine is the most convenient method. If you are using apps that do not require intense use of components such as your video adapter, it’s more than perfect. This is especially true if you work in a business environment but only need to run a few a line of business applications. A great benefit, you don’t have to reboot into Windows 10 manually which is quite a chore. Setting it up it is quick and easy too.

<h2>            Windows 10 Right Click Menu on Desktop Disappears Quickly</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi All,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So I am having a problem that when I right click on the desktop the menu flashes and then quickly
 disappears. This doesn't happen when I have a window open (but shrunk so that it doesn't take the whole screen) but does happen if I have no programs running or all windows minimised. I also can't type in certain programs, such as the control+f find function
 of excel and also the search bar in spotify.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Restarting my computer used to fix the problem... but now that doesn't even help.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have tried the shell extension fix of disabling 3rd party shell extensions but it didn't solve the
 problem.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Anyone else had this problem and found a solution?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks</span></p>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Run the Start Menu troubleshooter:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/windows-10-start-menu-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/windows-10-start-...</a>
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to open Task Manager, show More Details, then choose Processes tab, scroll down to Windows Processes, then further down to Windows Explorer.  Right click to Restart, click OK.  Restart PC.
<br />
<br />If any steps cannot be performed normally then try them in Safe Mode with Networking or Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>0x80070035 Error - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            0x80070035 Error</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried all the proposed solutions to this (apparently common) problem that I can find on the Internet and nothing seems to be working.&nbsp; Hoping for some fresh ideas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a QNAP NAS on my network, and a Windows 10 computer that, until recently, had no problem reaching it.&nbsp; Then it stopped working.&nbsp; I'm not sure what exactly changed that caused this to happen - could be an update to software on either box, or a password
 issue or who knows.&nbsp; These systems kinda update themselves these days so it's hard to draw a straight line between "I did this" and "this happened," which leaves me in the annoying "it just stopped working" bucket.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, the error is 0x80080035 - The network path was not found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer is a Windows 10 machine with IP Address 10.0.1.8.</p>
<p>The NAS has IP Address 10.0.1.20.</p>
<p>In other words, they're on the same subnet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can ping 10.0.1.20 successfully from the Windows box.</p>
<p>WINS is enabled on the QNAP.</p>
<p>The Windows machine has NetBIOS over TCP turned on.</p>
<p>I've turned Windows Defender completely off (at least I think I have).</p>
<p>I've reinstalled Windows 10 leaving Apps and Files in place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there's a YouTube video, forum post or article proposing a solution I've probably found it and tried it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing seems to be working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any brilliant suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>-Ben</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yes, you are correct that certified Skype bots have the check-mark in its profile just like the example screenshot below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ec5f5578-0f0a-46f8-b62a-4e77d8c36b24?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ec5f5578-0f0a-46f8-b62a-4e77d8c36b24?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest not to add suspicious bots on your account. You can check this FAQ link on how to secure your account:

    <title>Windows 10 Disable Onscreen Keyboard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chrismoschini  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Disable Onscreen Keyboard</h2>
                    <p>I have a laptop with a touchscreen, so it has a full keyboard, and you can use the trackpad or touchscreen to click on stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>EVERY</strong></em> time I tap on a textbox a giant onscreen keyboard appears, often in the way of what I'm clicking on, and I cannot disable it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3ec20804-4d3e-481f-baca-23c1fe29fcca" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>OH FOR THE LOVE OF CRICKETS MAKE IT STOP, MAKE IT STOP!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a Windows 10-specific issue; there are discussions like it here for Vista, 7 and 8, but none relate to my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I've already tried; yes I've restarted after changing each setting:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) In Settings &gt; Devices &gt; Typing, turn off the checkbox at the bottom, "Automatically show the touch keyboard in windowed apps when there's no keyboard attached to your device." Note that this does nothing on or off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) In Settings &gt; Ease of Access &gt; Keyboard, turn off the checkbox at the top, "Turns on the on-screen keyboard." Interestingly that checkbox displays a DIFFERENT keyboard if I turn it on - the old Win7/Win8 keyboard. The one I'm enduring is Win10-specific.
 And irritating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) In the hidden Control Panel, in Ease of Access, under Use the computer without a keyboard, uncheck (it was already unchecked) Use On-Screen Keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) Assault the software directly by breaking the keyboard. Vista, 7, and 8 have solutions where you rename C:\Windows\System32\osk.exe to osk.exe.bak (harmless as you can always rename it back). This didn't solve it but provided interesting info: The keyboard
 in Step 2 no longer loads when toggling that checkbox. The annoying one I'm coping with goes on undeterred. This confirms the one in Step 2 is the old Win7/8 keyboard and runs with osk.exe, while the one ruining my life really is Win10-only, loading from an
 exe or DLL I've yet to discover (and if I do... I shall destroy it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking for ANYthing that will stop this. A registry setting. An exe. It would be nice to have this thing available in case my keyboard ever dies, but for now all I want is to disable it completely, since that inelegant solution seems much more likely
 to have an answer.</p>

</p><p>Excellent! I hope this is resolved - a Vista thread here seems to be drawing others with the same Windows 10 issue to it, so this seems a somewhat common issue.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I wasn't a part of the Technical Preview, just the regular Upgrade, and apparently Feedback is not fully included to those who didn't participate in the Preview. Searching the Windows 10 Start tiles or Start10's much better Start Menu for "Feedback" gets
 nothing despite Microsoft support documents saying there ought to be something there. After a lot of digging I was able to find Feedback in Settings under Privacy (why?), but all it has is a couple dropdowns about when to ask me, nothing that lets me send
 unprompted feedback.</p>

<p>
</p><p>No screenshot provided there, and Win10 is a bit different, so click to this giant screenshot to see how to do this in Win10:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right-click empty area of Taskbar</p>
<p>
</p><p>Task Manager</p>
<p>
</p><p>Services tab</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>And so forth through the dialogs pictured in the screenshot.</p>
<p>

            <p>If you're on Win10 and the keyboard you're seeing looks exactly like the one in my screenshot, disabling the above service will definitely do it. It's got nothing to do with Chrome. I added a little more info to help since a lot of people are probably unfamiliar

<p>
</p><p>"Your goal is to Disabled the highlighted Service. You'll also need to Stop it if you want the keyboard to stop coming up immediately."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just disabling it will only prevent it on future boots. Stop without disable will stop it right now, but not next time you boot. Doing both gets you no keyboard ever again, problem solved.</p>

I have disabled the service and it still starts up when I reboot.

            This happened to me in Windows 8.1- it kept coming back. I also use Google Chrome but hadn't associated the keyboard problem with usage of Chrome. I just disabled the above mentioned "service" again now that I've updated to Windows 10, I'll be back if
 it doesn't stick.

            <p>This has been an on-going problem and I found this solution which was posted in a thread "<strong>keep on screen keyboard from appearing at startup
</strong>" by fazenk on September 10 2009</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution then which still works today is:</p>
<p>:quote</p>
<p>I had the same issue with the keyboard poping up on log in. I solved it by going into control panel, ease of access and clickung on use computer with out mouse or keyboard, then deselecting the check box next to (Start On-Screen Keyboard at log in). this
 solved it for me instead of going to a toutrial, this is more simple than that. Hope I helped!</p>

            <p>I'm seriously struggling with this. &nbsp;My use case is simple, but the suggestions here don't help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Surface Pro 4 - sometimes I use a bluetooth keyboard with it, sometimes I use it as a touchscreen tablet. &nbsp;I prefer not to use tablet mode. &nbsp;Pretty simple use-case, this is what the Surface is for right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I plug in my bluetooth keyboard and select a field to enter text, the touch keyboard pops up, obscuring a big portion of the screen. This is fine when I'm using as touch tablet without physical keyboard, but I don't need it when I'm using a bluetooth
 keyboard. It seems like Windows 10 was designed to accommodate this pretty simple use-case. But there is simply no way that a user can intentionally suppress the touch keyboard if they're using a physical keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ideally Windows would detect the presence of a physical keyboard and suppress the touch keyboard (supposedly "Continuum" does this, but apparently only for switching in Tablet mode? I don't know). &nbsp;That's OK, I think to myself, Windows doesn't detect it
 so I will just disable it manually. &nbsp;But HOW? &nbsp;Only through doing backflips through all the menus to stop the service as shown by another user here. &nbsp;This is really hacky, very far from convenient.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my choice is</p>
<p>(1) I can stop touch keyboard for my current session (and not be allowed to switch to using as touch tablet), so every time I want to use my keyboard I will have to go through all the settings and stop the service. Then if I want to get the touch keyboard
 pop-up back to use as touch tablet I reboot my machine. &nbsp;Or,</p>
<p>(2) I can permanently disable the service and be forced to always use a physical keyboard.</p>
<p>

 bit of googling:<br />
<br />
:: --&gt; Start/stop touch keyboard service<br />
for /F "tokens=3 delims=: " %%H in ('sc query "TabletInputService" ^| findstr " &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;STATE"') do (<br />
if /I "%%H" == "RUNNING" (<span>
</span><br />
:: --&gt; If TabletInputService is running, disable and stop it<br />
sc config TabletInputService start= disabled<br />
sc stop TabletInputService<br />
)<br />
if /I "%%H" == "STOPPED" (<br />
:: --&gt; if TabletInputService is stopped, enable(auto) and start it<br />
sc config TabletInputService start= auto<br />
sc start TabletInputService<br />
)<br />
)<br />
<br />
To use it, save the code above in a text file with suffix ".bat" and execute. Note, you'll need to run it as an administrator. To make it *always* run as administrator, you'll need to create a shortcut. Right click on the shortcut file and go Properties &gt; Shortcut
 tab &gt; Advanced &gt; Run as administrator. Now you can execute the shortcut to toggle the keyboard enabled/disabled. You will still get a pop-up each time confirming that you are administrator, you just have to click OK.<br />
<br />
My plan is to pin this batch file to my taskbar so I can enable/disable the touch keyboard at will. I'll be leaving my touch keyboard settings as I want them for pure touch navigation, and disabling the service will suppress the touch keyboard when I'm using
 a physical keyboard.<br />
<br />
Microsoft, I hope you build this simple functionality into Windows 10 sometime soon!<br />
<br />
P.S. OK discovered you can't pin .bat files or their shortcuts to the task bar? Sheesh. The workaround is to open the shortcut and update the "Target" to say: &nbsp;<br />
cmd.exe /C "path_to_your_bat_file"<br />
<br />
I went ahead and downloaded a fancy keyboard icon and applied it to the shortcut before pinning to my taskbar. &nbsp;Looks pretty good!</p>

            It appears that you have a worm problem.<br />

<br />
When active the worm attempts to connect to a remote IRC server and allows a malicious user remote access to the infected computer. If I were you, I'd reformat and change passwords. As to WHERE you got it, do any of the users on that computer do P2P (file sharing)?<br />

            NOTE:<br />
<strong><em>"After your scan, if you are still having problems..."<br />
</em></strong><br />
The reason malware returns is because you are doing the same thing that caused you to become infected.<br />
OR<br />
You are not able to SEE all the files involved and a rootkit component is reinstalling the infection.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is not the job of the operating system to do malware protection. That is what anti-virus/anti-malware programs are for and why they have to be constantly updated.<br />
<br />
A backdoor is nothing to take lightly, and is not something that you want to leave remnants of. I usually suggest that folks reformat when these are found on systems.<br />

<br />
The threats mentioned are not indicating a rootkit - which also can be removed simply by running anti-rootkit softwares which have generally been included in quality antivirus programs for several years now. I never agree with throw in the towel and reinstall
 windows after wiping the disk clean. This is in most cases completely unnecessary.
<br />
<br />
A self replicating worm must not be mistaken for a rootkit present. Any quality shareware antivirus would have blocked this "several years ago ?" Ouch. Obviously if there is spyware and other like threats present (password stealing virus) your entire past few
 years online are completely comprimised. <br />
<br />
I find this astounding that you have allowed such things to continue for "several years. With a bit of innocent sarcasm - what rock did you just crawl out from under ? Simply installing quality antivirus and antispyware will/would have cleaned this up immediately.
 What are you waiting for ? <br />
<br />
TIP: With a self replicating worm - it may take several passes by the quality antivirus product to remove it. In other words - you are alerted to worm infection. You run the antivirus to remove it and reboot. Back again. DO this two, three times until the quality
 antivirus no longer indicates the infection. THIS is what is not to be confused with a rootkit or a Downloader Trojan - which is simply a poor man's rootkit in the underground scum known as cyber crime.
<br />
<br />
NOTE I am offering this alternative because it was mentioned to wipe the disk. NO where in the threat descriptions did I see that a rootkit is part of the payload (malware) installation present. That is possibly a rush to judgement. DO understand that a Downloader
 Trojan can reinstall or add new threats almost at will - which a rootkit can also do. The problem apparently is that you have not and still do not have quality antivirus and antispyware products installed and protecting the machine and your personal data -
 "for several years" OUCH.<br />
<br />
PLEASE accept this as your last ditch attempt at cleaning the machine as opposed to wiping it clean and reinstalling Windows to factory fresh. You are guilty of severe gross neglect of the security of the computer as you confess. Self replicating worms and
 trojan downloaders though in great numbers now are very very very ho-humm to quality security products.
<br />
<br />
Apparently you are not aware of Real Time Protection offered by quality paid subscription shareware antivirus and antispyware products availsble as&nbsp;a multi billion dollar industry now. These products block these type installations. These products installed
 fully updated will remove these threats detected. It is very simple. It is the alternative to a reinstall and without these - what will prevent reinfection ? Safe Practices ? That's absurd considering the high rate on infections of "safe websites" like even
 Government websites being infected and infecting visitors, though Safe Practices does aid like 20 to 50 percent in not getting infected only if you have real time protection products installed.
<br />
<br />
SAID all that to say this.... try these and if you can not install them then it is the payload infection blocking installation. An Emergency SB Stick would be last chance. .....<br />
<br />
Emsi has over 3.3 million removal defintions (antivirus and antispyware combined) and if they find nothing it is very doubtful anyone else would:

            <strong><em>"The threats mentioned are not indicating a rootkit - which also can be removed simply by running anti-rootkit softwares which have generally been included in quality antivirus programs for several years now"<br />
</em></strong><br />
<br />
If the vulnerability used by the worm was available remotely without user action, then there is no guarantee that the worm was the only thing that took advantage of the vulnerability.
<br />
<br />
Furthermore, it may take several scanners to find a rootkit. Otherwise, we wouldn't be removing rootkits from systems of users who run so-called "quality antivirus programs for several years".<br />
<br />
Why speculate, diagnose without knowing the facts, and throw tools at something? Find somebody who can tell you exactly what is going on.&nbsp; If the system is a bot, clean it. I dislike throwing in the towel as much as Gerlad60606, but if the system has been so
 compromised that passwords and personal information have been accessed, I maintain that the best route to take is to flatten and reinstall.<br />

            Thanks for everyone above that has answered this thread. &nbsp;I think I have found out where this winup.exe is coming from. &nbsp;Something to do with the USB port. &nbsp;I noticed that I would get this file after using an external laptop hard drive. &nbsp;You don't suppose
 that this "VERY BAD" file is put on everyone's PC through the USB drivers? &nbsp;Only thing I can think of! &nbsp;I'll come back here when I get more answers!

            NOTE:&nbsp; I am coming back here years later to see WHTUP?&nbsp; It was a USB port.&nbsp; Did not matter what you plugged in this port triggered the installation of these files.&nbsp; I did not get down to the engineering of hardware, which is software, but hard.&nbsp; Whatever,
 you know what I am saying.&nbsp; Anyway, do you suppose that the Chinese actually snuck into their chips a thing of two?&nbsp; Something to think about.&nbsp; Year is 2016 now.<br />

    <title>Getting the Surface Pro 4 to work with the old Type 2 Cover, and Touch - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joek78  say:</h3>
<h2>            Getting the Surface Pro 4 to work with the old Type 2 Cover, and Touch covers from the Surface pro&#47;2&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I fly a lot and I was curious if there was any thought/idea/way to make the old Surface Pro/2 Touch/Type 2 covers work with the SP4?&nbsp;&nbsp; The keyboard is nice and small for flights, and when I work in cramped spaces (or just occasionally need a keyboard).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 also I have a few spare touch and type keyboards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They seem electrically compatible since they use the same mount/dock on the bottom of the surface.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you connect a Surface Pro/2 keyboard to the SP4, they never turn on, or populate the hardware list so I assume this is a firmware block of some sort to stop legacy hardware like that being used.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be great to allow customers to use the smaller/old keyboards if they want.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Thank you for contacting the Surface community. Sorry, the Surface Pro 2 keyboard is not compatible with the Surface Pro 4.

<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
