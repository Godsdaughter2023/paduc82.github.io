            Hi,
<br />
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />Please see the below options:
<br />
<br />Option 1.Try Rolling back if you have an option:
<br />Go to Device Manager by typing in Devmgmt.msc in Run dialog box. 
<br />Navigate to Display devices and right click ATI Radeon HD or Similar device you have. Choose Properties. 
<br />On the Driver tab, hit rollback Driver to go back to the previous version. 
<br />
<br />Option 2. Remove drivers completely and Install the the newest ones available from the OEM or the maker.
<br />What you need to do:
<br />1. Uninstall everything of Display driver using DDU
<br /><a href="http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dri...</a>
<br />2. Reboot.
<br />3. Make sure your device manager shows Microsoft Basic Display adapter.
<br />4. Download the driver from the OEM or the maker like AMD
<br />5.Run the Setup and you should be good to go.

            Hi Balakrishna
<br />
<br />A lot of users are having the same trouble with Intel HD 4000 graphics, Intel deprecated the 3000 series a while back and is seems the 4000 series may also be nearing its end of life . . .
<br />
<br />Version 1809 of Windows has caused a lot of older hardware to become incompatible, if you cannot get a working driver for your graphics, perhaps installing an older version of Windows 10 (1709) would be the only way forward . . .
<br />
<br />Have you tried installing the driver directly form the Intel website?
<br />

<p>Your choice of course, but in my view, it's usually a mistake. With a<br />
modicum of care, it should never be necessary to reinstall Windows (XP<br />
or any other version). I've run Windows 3.0, 3.1, WFWG 3.11, Windows<br />
95, Windows 98, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista, and now<br />
Windows 7, each for the period of time before the next version came<br />
out, and each on two or more machines here. I never reinstalled any of<br />
them, and I have never had anything more than an occasional minor<br />
problem.</p>
<p>It's my belief that this mistaken notion stems from the technical<br />
support people at many of the larger OEMs. Their solution to almost<br />
any problem they don't quickly know the answer to is "reformat and<br />
reinstall." That's the perfect solution for them. It gets you off the<br />
phone quickly, it almost always works, and it doesn't require them to<br />
do any real troubleshooting (a skill that most of them obviously don't<br />
possess in any great degree).</p>
<p>But it leaves you with all the work and all the problems. You have to<br />
restore all your data backups, you have to reinstall all your<br />
programs, you have to reinstall all the Windows and application<br />
updates, you have to locate and install all the needed drivers for<br />
your system, you have to recustomize Windows and all your apps to work<br />
the way you're comfortable with.</p>
<p>Besides all those things being time-consuming and troublesome, you may<br />
have trouble with some of them: can you find all your application CDs?<br />
Can you find all the needed installation codes? Do you have data<br />
backups to restore? Do you even remember all the customizations and<br />
tweaks you may have installed to make everything work the way you<br />
like? Occasionally there are problems that are so difficult to solve<br />
that Windows should be reinstalled cleanly. But they are few and far<br />
between; reinstallation should not be a substitute for<br />
troubleshooting; it should be a last resort, to be done only after all<br />
other attempts at troubleshooting by a qualified person have failed. <br />
And perhaps most important: if you reformat and reinstall without<br />
finding out what caused your problem, you will very likely repeat the<br />
behavior that caused it, and quickly find yourself back in exactly the<br />
same situation.</p>
<p>If you have problems, post the details of them here; it's likely that<br />
someone can help you and a reinstallation won't be required.</p>
<p>And to add one other point: these days a slow computer is perhaps most<br />
often caused by a malware infection, and your first step should be<br />
looking into that possibility. What anti-virus and anti-spyware<br />
programs do you run (they are far from being equally good)? Are they<br />
kept up to date?</p>

<p>That's completely wrong.</p>

<p>Ken, thanks for getting back to me. I really, really hate the idea of re-formatting. I am NOT that good, have no programing background and don't want to make more of a mess. I think most of my problem happened when someone hi-jacked my son's email address,
 sent me something, naturally, I opened it (it was my son) and got a trojan/virus. I went nuts, followed a forum I used when I had my old, old computer (elder geek) and ever since then, forget it. When I turn it on, it takes almost 3 min just to get to password
 and another 3 or 4 to get to the main screen. THen when I get on the web, it can take a couple of minutes to get to my hotmail from "my msn.com".</p>
<p>Do you have any suggestions what I could do instead of re-formatting? I am disabled and on a limited income so having someone come in and do it is impossible. I have a chance to get a job from home but need my system in top shape. Help?????</p>

Scan for Malware:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>If necessary</span></span><span>, do all the work in<strong>Safe Mode with Networking.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>To get into<strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong>, tap F8 right at Power On / Startup, and use UP arrow key to get to<strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong> from list of options,

<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Then&nbsp;run the Vista System File Checker Tool:</span></span><span><br />

<br />
<br />
</span><span>1. Open a Command Window in Administrator mode:</span></p>
<p><span>* click<strong><span>Start</span></strong><br />
* click <strong><span>All Programs</span></strong>, then<strong><span>Accessories</span></strong><br />
* right click on the <strong><span>Command Prompt </span>
</strong>option,<br />
* on the drop down menu which appears, click on the <strong><span>Run as Administrator</span></strong>option.</span></p>
<p><span>* If you haven’t disabled User Account Control (and you shouldn’t!) you will be asked for authorisation. Click the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert
 the administrator password.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Start the System File Checker</span></p>
<p><span>* In the Command Prompt window, type:<strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong>,<br />
* press Enter.<br />
* You’ll see “the system scan will begin”.</span></p>
<p><span>The scan may take some time and windows will repair/replace any corrupt or missing files. You will be asked to insert your Vista DVD if it’s needed.</span></p>
<p><span>Close the Command Prompt Window when the job is finished.</span></p>
<p><span>One caveat: you need a Windows DVD to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs.</span></p>

If SFC finds serious errors it can not fix, you may have to do a Vista&nbsp;Repair Upgrade Install.<br />

<p>As I said, "these days a slow computer is perhaps most often caused by<br />
a malware infection, and your first step should be looking into that<br />
possibility. What anti-virus and anti-spyware programs do you run<br />
(they are far from being equally good)? Are they kept up to date?"</p>
<p>And you confirmed that you are infected. Getting rid of an infection<br />
by reformatting and reinstalling is possible, but it is normally<br />
overkill. <br />
Since you didn't answer the questions, I'll give you my<br />
recommendations: <br />
For an anti-virus program, I recommend eSet NOD32, if you are willing<br />
to pay for it. If you want a free anti-virus, I recommend one of the<br />
following three:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Avira<br />
Avast<br />
Microsoft Security Essentials<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You also need anti-spyware software. I recommend that you download and<br />
install (both freeware) MalwareBytes AntiMalware <strong>and</strong><br />
SuperAntiSpyware. <br />
Run one of the AVs and both the anti-spyware programs, and there's a<br />
good chance that your problem will be solved.</p>

            Ken, sorry, been ill, trying to get this done inbetween. I have the ANTIspyware, Malware and now have NORTON Security suite provided by my hispeed company. The infection had been cleared out with Malware and the Antispyware has kept anything else from
 coming in. I did not have problems until a couple of months ago. I ran these programs and nothing came up. Now I know I don't have the biggest system, only 1GB of memory but when I ran a 'speed test" and a "desktop doc"(norton) the speed gave me a 3.3 out
 of 5 and desktop said I have 77% free memory. So that's what has me puzzled and I thought maybe I should even backup the memory, do a restore from back in January when I know the system was optimum. Does that sound kosher?

<p>Not a problem.</p>

<p>I hope you don't mean you have malware ("malware" is short for<br />
"malicious software," something you don't want to have). You should<br />
have <strong>anti</strong>-malware. Perhaps you mean MalwareBytes Anti-malware. Do<br />
you? If so, that's good news. Despite its poor and misleading name,<br />
It's the best anti-spyware program available.</p>

<p>Ugh! In my view, and that of lots of others of use here, that's the<br />
<strong>worst</strong> such program available. Your choice of course, but I strongly<br />
recommend that you replace it with one of those anti-virus programs I<br />
mentioned in my previous message.</p>

<p>Speed tests are mostly meaningless as far as I'm concerned, and<br />
Norton's are probably among the worst. The best speed test is your<br />
assessment of how fast the computer feels. <br />
How much RAM you need for good performance is <strong>not</strong> a<br />
one-size-fits-all situation. You get good performance if the amount of<br />
RAM you have keeps you from using the page file significantly, and<br />
that depends on what apps you run. Most people running a typical range<br />
of business applications under Vista find that 2GB works well, others<br />
need more. 1GB is not enough for most people, but it could be enough<br />
for you.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>and desktop said I have 77% free memory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Free "memory" or free disk space? Please don't mix the two up. The<br />
term "memory" is used to refer to the place where the computer holds<br />
the program and data it is working with at the moment. It's normally<br />
random access memory (RAM), but that can be extended with the page or<br />
swap file on the hard disk. The word "memory" is never used to refer<br />
to the space on a drive (whether that's a hard drive, diskette, CD,<br />
DVD, or thumb drive). Space on a disk drive is normally called<br />
"storage" or simply "disk space." <br />
Calling disk space "memory" isn't so much wrong as just<br />
unconventional. In a sense, disk space is, of course, memory, but the<br />
important thing to realize is that the word is never used that way,<br />
and if you do so, you do it at the risk of seriously confusing your<br />
audience. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>So that's what has me puzzled and I thought maybe I should even backup the memory,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Backup the disk? If your data is important to you, you need to back it<br />
up regularly. You might want to read this article on backup I've<br />
written: "Back Up Your Computer Regularly and Reliably" at<br />

<p>Restore from what? Do you mean System Restore? If so, you can not do<br />
that. Restore Points never go back that far.</p>

            Sorry about this mis-name. I have done all kinds of scans for Malware. I used the sites you mentioned and have the professional edition of SuperAntiSpyware package downloaded on my system. I ran&nbsp; a sfc/scannow and it came up clean. Anything else I can
 do to speed up my system? I tried to do a backup because when I read "help pages" it led me to understand that besides my C drive there is a D that is for backup. When I specifically tried that it told me I could not back up to this. What now?

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You have 1GB of RAM.</p>
<p>To speed it up, buy more RAM.</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>And you are confusing Hard Drive space and RAM.</p>
<p>The memory term for HD space has gone out of fashion, due to confusion with RAM.</p>
<p>Hard Drive space was called secondary memory</p>
<p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>Your D: drive is normally your Recovery Partition.</p>
<p>Read&nbsp;what ti does and what you are not to do with it:</p>
<p><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Recovery Drive:</span></span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>System or Data backups should be saved to an external Hard Drive or DVDs.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>If the information below applies to you, you will have to contact the Computer Manufacturer for advice.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Read this info:</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Your D: Drive normally is the Recovery Partition<span>and is about 5Gbs-19GBs in size</span>, that the Manufacturer put there,&nbsp;for your computer to put it back
 to factory settings in case of System Crash.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Contact your Computer Manufacturer on how to remove anything you have saved to the Recovery Drive, as it is their Recovery Partition, not Microsoft’s.<br />
<br />
It is not for you to save anything to; and it is not to compress and/or Index, Disk Cleanup, use for Backup, Defrag or have System Restore turned on for it.<br />
<br />
<span>Also ask them if it is possible to make Recovery Disk/s from the Recovery Partition in case of Hard Drive failure or System Crash.</span><br />
<br />
Ask the Manufacturer if you can make them, and how to delete/fix what has been done there.</span></p>

<p>Hey there!</p>
<p>Thanks for the support message.</p>
<p>If you're still having this issue, this is actually a feature for Xbox One. &nbsp;You can start playing most games before the download completed with limited capabilities while the game is still installing. &nbsp;This is so you can get to playing your games faster
 then ever! &nbsp;Keep in mind that running apps./games may slow down the download though.</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

<h2>            Random partition showed up on Windows 10 &#40;Solved&#41;</h2>
                    After the latest update on windows 10 a random partition showed up on my SSD. When I try to see whats on it it says it's empty. Wouldn't normally be a problem but windows constantly notifies me about it having "Low Disk Space", which is quite annoying
 when trying to watch videos or play games. I could delete the partition but I'm not sure what's on it and if its necessary or not, and I would rather not have to reinstall Windows if I did end up deleting something important.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2c202742-1bee-42da-8fd2-a5706c741d8c?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2c202742-1bee-42da-8fd2-a5706c741d8c?upload=true" /></a><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/458ee38a-0f47-4c91-9392-49b1279614a9?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/458ee38a-0f47-4c91-9392-49b1279614a9?upload=true" /></a>

            Hi Andreius, do not delete that partition, this is a known issue in the 1803 Update,
<br />
<br />It is the recovery drive, you are not meant to see it, it is not meant to have a drive letter, remove the drive letter and everything will return to normal:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type cmd, then right click Command Prompt and choose 'Run as Administrator'
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />diskpart
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />list volume
<br />
<br />Note down the letter associated with that new drive
<br />
<br />Run these commands one at a time and hit Enter (replace X with the correct drive letter)
<br />
<br />select volume X
<br />
<br />remove letter=X
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and restart your PC       
        </p>

            It has been happening with new update that new drive is getting uncovered and you start getting low space notifications. You can do following to hide it and there will be no harm anywhere.
<br />
<br />Type diskpart in Windows Start Search box (Cortana) &gt; Right click on Diskpart and Run as Administrator
<br />Give following command and Enter: 
<br />select volume e
<br />Give following command and Enter: 
<br />remove letter=e

<h2>            Windows Photo app won&#39;t start</h2>
                    <p>After Windows 10 update on June 12, attempts to open a photo from File Explorer result in error message indicating "The app didn't start."</p>
<p>
</p><p>In efforts to repair the damage I have:</p>
<p>Uninstalled the update.</p>
<p>Un-installed and re-installed the Photo app (from the Windows store)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- after deleting the Photo app the default viewer was 3D Paint - not Windows Photo Viewer as I was lead to expect.</p>
<p>Tried a RESET from the apps viewer&nbsp;</p>
<p>Done a clean boot</p>
<p>Tried various other diagnostics&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have a solution or do I need to install a 3rd party viewer?</p>

            The only other option is to try a repair upgrade.
<br />This will NOT remove apps or data.
<br />Below is a link by Andre Da Costa on how to do this.
<br />If this does not work then clean install or 3rd party viewer.

<p>I just paid $200 for a clean install and data recovery after the May 23 upgrade crashed my computer. Tired of this - will try 3rd party photo software unless someone else has another solution.</p>

<h2>            Titling Chapters in Windows DVD Maker</h2>
                    I am using Windows DVD Maker, and want to know if there is a way to name my chapters on the DVD menu. I am talking about naming them in the menu, so that under each scene is the TITLE for each scene. Simply stated, the DVD is a concert, and I want to be
 able to title each song in the menu, and yet still have the concert run seamlessly when played in full. The songs are all individual files, and are shown as individual scenes in the menu, I just can't find a way to title them there. Thanks...

    <title>Black Ops 2 disconnecting me from Xbox Live - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bmcg36  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black Ops 2 disconnecting me from Xbox Live</h2>
                    
<p>So about every 10 minutes or so, I will be in an Xbox Live Black Ops 2 multiplayer game and the migrating hosts screen pops up. &nbsp;While this is happening, it says my friends in my party all leave. (To them it will say I left.) &nbsp;Then it puts me back into the
 lobby, where it shows everyone that was in the game there too. (Like the migrating hosts failed) &nbsp;After I wait a bit for another game to start, a loading screen will pop up, then it will take me back to the home screen for multiplayer with the could not connect
 to the Black Ops 2 servers at the time error. &nbsp;I click on the Xbox live option in that multiplayer menu to play more, but it will then disconnect me from Xbox Live. &nbsp;At this point, I can either wait about 5 minutes and it will let me connect back to Xbox Live,
 or I have to turn off and on my Xbox. (I can also go to the network settings on the Xbox and disconnect and reconnect to my network) This has only been going on for a week, before that it was fine. &nbsp;I have tried messing with UPNP and port forwarding, but that
 just caused my NAT to go to strict. &nbsp;I fixed that back to open, but the problem still happens. &nbsp;I have tried re-downloading my profile and clearing the cache for my hard drive. I can't really find any other fix. &nbsp;When this happens the internet still works
 perfectly fine on my computer. &nbsp;Zombies also works fine, so I assume that other games would work. &nbsp;Please help!</p>

<p>EXACT thing has been happening to me lately. I do IT for a living and I know my network is golden. I have an original Elite with a USB wireless dongle that I've been using for years. I play COD almost every day and have never had this problem. Yesterday
 it started and today it continues. Matchmaking and the first 5 to 10 minutes work flawlessly but after that Every Single Game quits on me with a connection problem...it throws me out then I get probation. It did that for about 10 games yesterday and about
 6 tonight. Every Single Game. Signal strength is high and Netflix streams just fine...so...does anyone have anything for us? &nbsp;~Loyal Xbox user and MS technologies programmer.</p>

<p>Let me clarify my above statement: When I say "it kicks me out after 5 to 10 minutes" what I mean is that it kicks me out of the online game and takes me back to matchmaking. It never says I'm disconnected from Xbox Live.

<p>I've been having having this problem as well, I get disconected while I'm playing Zombies or &nbsp;MultiPlayer in COD Black Ops 2 and it disconnetcs me completely from XBL. Not just COD, I was playing FIFA 13 and i just assumed it was EA because thier servers
 arn't always well. Has happened when I'm on Netflix and Doritos Crash Coures 2 with my friends. My internet connection is 100% and I reset my modem but it persists and I never had this happen before. I've got a very strong WiFi connection to my XBOX S and
 I don't know whats up. It gets annoying when I'm the host of a zombie party and everyone lags out. I've got my NAT set to OPEN. Helps us please?</p>

<p>A sequential power cycle is the first step in clearing connection problems, and the order and timing of the steps is important to success:</p>
<p>1) turn off the Xbox and unplug the power supply cord from the back of the Xbox then</p>
<p>2) unplug power from the router (Some folks have a combination modem-router AKA 'gateway' or only use a modem with no router. If either, skip steps 3 &amp; 6).</p>
<p>3) unplug power from the modem.</p>
<p>4) Wait at least 5 minutes then replug the modem/gateway power.</p>
<p>5) Wait 'til the light on the front of the modem/gateway which says BROADBAND, ONLINE, READY, CABLE or DSL is on solid (not flashing), then plug in the router. If you have a gateway instead of a modem and router or a modem with no router, then when that
 light says it's ready, skip to step 7.</p>
<p>6) Wait until the WiFi light on the router is on; you may or may not use WiFi, but it's still a good indicator your router is finished booting up.</p>
<p>7) Plug in and turn on the Xbox. &nbsp;If the problem persists, please send us the info we need &nbsp;so we may work on this further:</p>
<p>How many Xboxen do you have connected?</p>
<p>What Country/State/Province do you live in?</p>
<p>Modem brand &amp; model number:</p>
<p>Router brand &amp; model number:</p>
<p>If Wireless, are you using a white or black external adapter, or an internal (Xbox 360S) adapter?</p>
<p>If wireless, how many bars of signal do you have on the Xbox list of Available Networks?
</p>
<p>Things you have tried:</p>
<p>If wireless, is there a wireless stereo headset module plugged into the Xbox, like a TurtleBeach or MadKatz?
</p>
<p>If so, please remove it from the Xbox and retry connecting. </p>
<p>If not wireless, please replace the ethernet cable which connects the Xbox to your router, modem or gateway.</p>

<p>I have been having the EXACT same problem since around last weeks update...get into a multiplayer in Black Ops 2...5 mins in, connection interruption, then kicks me from game (5 min probation sucks for this EVERYTIME) then fnny thing is, when I dashboard...it
 re-connects me to Xbox Live...my internet settings have not changed in YEARS! Nat is open, all ports needed to be open are open...tried both direct wire to modem as well as wireless...has me pulling my hair and it's definitley an XBOX issue..rolled back the
 update, deleted &amp; redownloaded profile, moved my profile to a different device, removed hard drive, power cycled, this literally started happening Aug 26 and hasn't stopped..i've tested other games thinking it was only COD and its others as well, just takes
 slightly longer to kick me...I give up!!!!</p>

            If you spelled the name correctly, then it's very likely to be malware.<br />
<br />
<p>When a Google search results in either no hits or suspicious hits (the case for unsecurapps.exe), the answer usually is that the file in question is malware-related.</p>
<p>What antivirus application do you use? Is its subscription current and never lapsed?<br />
</p>
<p>Download, install, update, and run full scans with both of these free scanning tools:</p>
<span><br />
<a href="http://malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MalwareBytes AntiMalware</a><br />
<a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SUPERAntiSpyware</a><br />
<br />
Don't run the scans simultaneously.&nbsp; They may take a while, so start one up and then go do a non-computer chore for a while.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if the task actually is <span style="font-weight: bold">unsecapp.exe</span>, that's another story.<br />
<br />
If you are running Vista (what version of Windows is installed, including service pack?):<br />
<br />
</span>Sink to receive asynchronous callbacks for WMI client application running in different processes. WMI, Windows Management Instrumentation, enables software developers to write scripts and programs for the management or querying of devices, user accounts,
 Windows services, running programs, networking, and many other internal technical aspects of Windows.<br />
<br />
This particular task, UNSECAPP.EXE, is started by Windows Vista when a program needs to use WMI programming - it provides programs with a conduit (sink) to receive from Windows the results of their WMI queries and commands.<br />
<span><br />
Unsecapp.exe is not, limited to Vista but also relates to the use of Windows Management Instrumentation in XP sp2:&nbsp;

</p><blockquote>My HP Envy Shuts down after closeing laptop. It goes into sleep mode but then shuts down. This happened just after upgrade to Windows 10.
</blockquote>
<p>Win10 will configure power settings that were not the same for the previous os.</p>
<p>The sleep settings timer is less than the shutdown one.</p>
<p>Hp has their own power management program and this may have been migrated over to win10.</p>
<p>Control panel, system and security, power options, change plan settings, change advanced power options,</p>
<p>change settings that are currently not available, &nbsp;expand sleep and check the settings, power button action check settings.</p>
<p>Sleep and power button need to be set to what you want.</p>
<p>If fast boot is enabled and you change some pm settings you may get errors.</p>
<p>If this occurs, you may need to turn of fast boot, it is part of the hibernation settings.</p>
<p>Some pm settings for individual devices may also need to be set from device manager, usb and network&nbsp;</p>
<p>adapters as well as in the power options also.</p>
<p>Post back if you run into issues.</p>

            <p>Yes you can use a capacitive pen in OneNote,&nbsp;not as seamlessly as with an Active Digitizer as on the Pro 2. In OneNote select the Draw Tab and select on of the Pens and start writing.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Keep in mind that there is no Palm Rejection on the Surface 2 so you will not be able to rest your palm on the screen, also your finger will draw just like the stylus, so to scroll you need to switch to the type mode or use a mouse.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The Stylus will work in other Office apps if you select Inking (typically under the Review Tab).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I find inking works best with the Adonit Jot Pro Gen 1 (Gen 2's changes doesn't give as accurate inking).</p>

<p>i was on it for 2 hours last night and not one hack/modder..there are alot of new players coming to cod4..all i see now are players who are on level 6 or something..not many with the gold cross..black ops is a bit dull and lets face it mw2 is the biggest
 pile of rubbish for kids...this is by far the best cod game ever and will not be bettered ever..alot of people are starting to get the message that this game is more balanced..with the the kill streaks and the guns are alot more realistic..i really dont understand
 why mw2 is more popular..but i guess kids like that kind of thing.</p>

<p>COD4 was and still is an awesome game, while MW2 has its flaws it still is a great game to play. I tried playing cod4 the other night and was getting killed by someone under the map on BOG with a .50 cal on search n destroy. I would rather deal with mw2's
 flaws then be killed by someone who has to cheat to win</p>

            Have you tried using the Direct X Web Installer ?<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer from Official Microsoft Download Center</a>
<br />
<br />
If you have,&nbsp; then the file may be corrupt. The Web Installer does not overwrite existing files,<br />
so as you know the name of the file, you can delete the current d3dx9_25 file from
<br />
System 32 (and sysWOW64 if you have 64bit Windows) and when you run the Web Installer<br />
again it will replace the 'missing' files.<br />
<br />
(The System 32 &amp; sysWOW64 folders are&nbsp; found in&nbsp; C:\ Windows \ )<br />
<br />
The other option is to use the DirectX runtime installer package. This will overwrite all the<br />
DX files.<br />

<h2>            How to run my old windows OS on a new hardware &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello, about 2 months ago my computer motherboard was damaged. Now i bought a completly new computer. My problem is to find a way to get my two OS (windows xp and windows 7) to boot up on new hardware from my two old hdd`s. Normally there is no problem to
 do that using sysprep but the sysprep can run only on OS that can boot up and mine won`t because of hardware differences (chipset, SATA controller and CPU [HAL is still the same - Multiprocessor computer with ACPI]). My &nbsp;question is :</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>- Can I run sysprep in this situation (from recovery console for example) ?</p>
<p>- Can I set up the system to run mini setup without using sysprep ? For example do it from virtual environment or form other OS or if it is possible from recovery console ?</p>
<p>- What changes sysprep do in the windows xp when i check -mini option ? Maybe i can do the same things maunally from command line ? (the XP system is the most valuable for me ... )</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>And the last thing ... re install / repair or formatting the hdd isn`t an option for me. I know I can use the CD/DVD and reinstall system or let the installer to repair it but too many changes and settings will be lost if i do that... I need really "pro"
 solution ...</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Arthur</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Hello, let me answer your questions first:</p>
<p>1) My first operating system that is still in good condition was installed in the year 2004 and it is Windows XP Pro 32bit PL edition updated later to SP3. It was installed first on a 60 GB hard drive from original CD ROM. Few years later i did an image
 of my system and all software installed. I used sysprep to prepare my Win XP to run on new hardware and I cloned it to new HDD with 250 GB of capacity. Next i just installed it inside my new computer and it works great another few years without need to install/change/reinstall
 any kind of software that i have on it installed. Two years ago i added another HDD with 500GB capacity to my computer and I installed on them Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit with SP1 from a DVD ROM. So none of my systems was installed by other way than clean install
 from original CD/DVD disc. To make the things more clear the current partition table looks like that :</p>
<p>HDD 1 (250GB) :</p>
<p>- partition 1 primary Windows XP (NTFS with a bootflag enabled and a windows standard bootloader from Windows 7 that let me choose which OS i want to boot) size 40 GB</p>
<p>-partition 2 primary NTFS (with software) size 60GB</p>
<p>- partition 3 primary NTFS (with valuable data ) size 150GB</p>
<p>HDD 2 (500GB) :&nbsp;</p>
<p>- partition 1 primary Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit (NTFS) size 60GB</p>
<p>- partition 2 primary (NTFS with software) 150 GB</p>
<p>- partition 3 primary (NTFS with valuable data) size 290 GB</p>
<p>* the partition sizes may be little different but it`s the best description i can give you right now</p>
<p>2) As you see the OS has a bootloader on the first hdd with windows XP and it boots up a Windows XP from the first disk/partition 1 and Windows 7 from the second disk/partition 1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the answer is YES ... I can use bootrec.exe on Windows 7 partition as you mentioned in your reply and that resolves just a half of my problem because i can boot a Windows 7 at all and access the data on my hard disk drives.</p>
<p>But now there is still the problem with my Windows XP ...&nbsp;</p>
<p>I`m just trying to find a way to get the same effect that i had after using a sysprep while i did a sucessfull cloning of my HDD to another, bigger HDD and a new computer at all. Too bad for me that i can`t use a sysprep because my old mainboard is dead
 and i cannot boot up the system to do anything like before I did.</p>
<p>Thank You for you reply. I hope you can find a solution that let me do what i mentioned here.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi RoyLi,
<br />
<br />Hope I can help you here. If you've been trying to update your graphics drivers through Windows Update, that's no good. You have to go to your manufacturer or NVIDIA's site to install the WHQL drivers.
<br />
<br />If you've done this already, please let me know so I can venture into looking for other solutions. Thanks.       
        </p>

<br />
<br />Strange, if this is a recent development you could attempt a system restore on it (Windows key + R &gt; rstrui), or download an older version of the drivers. Be sure it's not using your integrated graphics being used instead of your 950M.
<br />
<br />Keep me posted.

<h2>            HELP&#58; Windows Volume Randomly Lowers and then Returns Issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi, this has been happening constantly, I just never bothered to fix it until now, when its really starting to get on my nerves....</p>
<p>
</p><p>The volume of my PC sometimes randomly lowers the volume, and then the volume level returns to normal. In the process of shifting volume, there are some slight static noises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This generally happens when the computer is being loaded down(like while gaming, or watching Youtube)</p>
<p>The volume bar doesn't change at all, just the actual speaker shifts in volume.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I plug in earbuds, this still happens, just with the speakers of the earbuds alone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I've tried already:&nbsp;</p>
<p>-check for new updated audio driver</p>
<p>-reinstalling the Realtek audio driver</p>
<p>-run troubleshoot</p>
<p>-disable all enhance audio settings</p>
<p>-checking off "don't do anything" in the communications settings</p>
<p>-restarting the computer multiple times</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions?</p>

<p>No Im using the stock speakers on my laptop. However, this issue still exists when I use earbuds, or other speakers plugged in via the headphone jack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, this only happens when the laptop is under a heavy load, like gaming...I feel this might be a key point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I disabled Exclusive mode in the advanced speaker properties, and it did nothing. The issue still persists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any other suggestions?</p>

            <p>Okay, so I found the issue. Maxxaudio pro enchnacement feature was shutting off for short intervals of time every time the computer CPU was loaded(while gaming). I prove that this was the issue, I turned off the enchancement feature, and the sounds aren't
 messed up. However, now the sounds from the computer sound really bad without the enhancement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions for fixing this Maxxaudio "glitching out" issue?</p>
<p>

                    So I'm not sure what's going on, it's my first time using a support forum like this for help so bear with me. A couple weeks ago my computer seemingly updated from windows 8 to windows 10 without my permission. I cannot be 100% sure this is what happened
 but it seems that way to me at the moment. Ever since this happened my computer's performance has been incredibly erratic. Every so often it runs great but most of the time it has terrible input lag which causes me a lot of problems. Prior to this unexpected
 update to windows 10, I was playing a lot of very basic 2D games on steam. Most of them were pixel art, not graphics intensive, and games I figured I could use to pass the time every so often considering I have a laptop that I don't think is particularly built
 for gaming. Now all my games are practically unplayable most of the time. It seems like every third key I press is a second behind at least. It's obviously noticeable when I'm typing as well, but that doesn't present as much o

<p>It may be corrupt data. You will have to delete the map pack &amp; Re-download it. Also, ensure that you are attempting to play it on the gamertag the maps were purchased on, and on the console in which that gamertag is recovered onto at the moment.</p>
