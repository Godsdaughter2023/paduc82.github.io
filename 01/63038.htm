<h2>            PC keeps crashing&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So every other day or so my PC will just freeze up and crash and I'm struggling to find the reason for it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an above average desktop PC:<br />
- AMD FX8350 CPU with H55 cooler<br />
- MSI 1050ti &amp; 750ti GPU<br />
- V550 Power supply</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing that does need improving is my RAM card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the problem before and I found that buying the power supply I have now fixed the problem, but now it's starting again. I've tried looking at logs and reports and nothing seems to be jumping out at me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>
<p>

<p>Try this:<br />
<br />
- enter BIOS<br />
- locate "Package&nbsp;C State limit" (should be in "Advanced" and "CPU Configuration" or something similar)<br />
- set it from [Auto] to [C0]<br />

<p>If it bluescreens when it crashes you can use 'bluescreenview' (&nbsp;https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/blue_screen_view.html ) to find the responsibe driver. Once identified you can either re-install or update the specific application or driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other random crashes can be attributed to a possible bad hard drive. Use HDD Sentinel (&nbsp;https://www.hdsentinel.com/download.php ) to check the health of your drive. Replace if it has bad sectors etc.</p>

<h2>            Skype for Business IM response groups</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a newbie to this forum, hoping you can help me out with the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to set up a response group for instant messaging in Skype for Business. One of my customers wants to provide a chat function on their intranet so end-users can contact the IT-department. Obviously a response group principle will help to route
 and balance chat-requests amongst the helpdesk team-members. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Would it be possible to support such a scenario and&nbsp;what would be required on the intranet page to initiate such&nbsp;a chat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for&nbsp;helping out. Cheers&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you mean Skype for Business Online, the answer is no, it’s not feasible to set up a response group for instant messaging in Skype for Business Online. If you mean Skype for Business server, the answer is yes, you can refer to:</span></p>

            <p>I suspect that Norton may be part of the issue and if you were to perform an Internet search on something like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>norton&nbsp; windows&nbsp; update&nbsp; failure</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would see over half a million results with those words:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/22dbd404-0195-46f7-bead-8b5bb3a17203" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/22dbd404-0195-46f7-bead-8b5bb3a17203" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Granted there are known issues with Windows Update for the past several months but if your updates are downloading and just failing to install I would suspect Norton - because in their online support community there are so many reports of problems and many,
 many discussions and ideas of things to try that might work sometimes maybe (sometimes they work), adjustments to Norton, reinstall it from scratch...&nbsp; it is all very messy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In their community they especially discuss Norton vs Windows Updates and you say your Adobe and Trusteer update okay but those use a different method to update than the Windows Updates to the problem could be JUST with Windows updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless you are being forced to use Norton for some reason you can consider uninstalling it at least temporarily, then restarting your system without it and see how things look.&nbsp; You can always install it again later, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You must be sure to use their custom removal tool to be sure the uninstall is clean:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://support.norton.com/sp/en/us/home/current/solutions/v60392881_EndUserProfile_en_us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.norton.com/sp/en/us/home/current/solutions/v60392881_EndUserProfile_en_us</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Some folks dislike Norton so much (and the problems that come with it) they consider Norton its own kind of computer infection and malware.&nbsp; I would never recommend it or install it but your mileage may vary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Consider replacing Norton with something like Microsoft Security Essentials which has a much smaller footprint and you can download it the low low price of free:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5201" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=5201</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Your system will reward you with better performance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As mentioned Windows Update has been afflicted for a long time too but you can probably fix that part.</p>

    <title>Wi-Fi Acting Strange - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slasher333  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wi-Fi Acting Strange</h2>
                    For some reason a few days ago my laptop started randomly saying that my wi-fi had lost connection. By this I mean that my laptop was still connected to the wi-fi, but it wasn't receiving an internet signal. I know the first thing you'd probably say is
 to check where the wi-fi signal is coming from, but not only have I already done so, I've got multiple other devices connected to said wi-fi and they'd have no problems at all. Another strange thing is the fact that if I disconnect then reconnect it starts
 to work again perfectly fine, but then later at another random moment it will stop again. I don't know what could be causing this.

<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Your router would be suspect here, have you updated its firmware as a possible<br />
solution?&nbsp;The router can be the issue even it other OS's are working fine. And <br />
I would update your WiFi drivers on the computers.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Try actually updating your driver :<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Network - write down make and model of Wifi - double click <br />
on it -&nbsp;driver's tab - write down version - <strong>click Update Driver (may not do</strong><br />
<strong>anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers). Then Right Click on Wifi</strong><br />
<strong>Device and UNINSTALL - Reboot - this will refresh the driver stack.</strong><br />
<br />
Then check the System/Motherboard Maker's Site and that of the actual device<br />
maker (such as Intel,&nbsp;RealTek, Broadcom, or Atheros) for even newer drivers.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN.<br />
<br />
You can download several at once however reboot after you install each one.<br />
<br />
After looking at the System Maker's you can check Device Maker's for even <br />
newer versions. (The ones from System maker become your fallbacks).<br />

<h2>            cursors and scroll bars move by themselves</h2>
                    when on the internet or a window the cursor will start moving by itself or the scroll bar will move on its own also if you sometimes click on a shortcut it will bring up the wrong program. Is this a virus or something wrong with computer?

<p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>It doesn’t seem to be a virus issue,
 but for your assurance you may cross check by performing a scan on your computer using the antivirus installed on your computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span>May I know if it is a Desktop or a Laptop, and was it working fine earlier?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If it is a Desktop, may I know what kind of mouse you’re using, wired or wireless? For a Laptop, download and install
 pointing device drivers from your device manufacturer’s website to adjust sensibility of the mouse.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps!</span></p>

            I began having this same problem on my new Windows 7 Pro Sony Vaio 13" laptop (Model VPCZ1) shortly after installing Skype. No problem before that, and people I talked to did not think it could be related to Skype. However, after trying everything else,
 including re-installing various drivers (e.g., for the touchpad, mouse and graphics card) nothing worked, and in fact the problem got worse. So as a last resort before taking the laptop back to the Microsoft Store where I bought it a couple of months ago,
 I uninstalled Skype, and voila! the problem went away. I Googled Skype and only found that they have had numerous problems running on Win7, but nothing reported about Skype affecting how other functions work. Does Microsoft have any report of problems with
 Skype on Win7?<br />

Scenario 2 resolution
<p>You can safely ignore this error message. <br />
<br />
However, you can also use one of the following methods to eliminate this error message during future backup operations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create the missing LocalLow, Contacts, and Searches folders that are listed in the error message.</li><li>Exclude the folders from the files to back up in the Backup settings, and then include those folders in their original location. To exclude the folders in the additional locations and to include those folders in the original location, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>In <strong>Control Panel</strong>, open <b>Backup and Restore</b>.</li><li>In the <strong>Backup</strong> section, click <strong>
Change settings</strong>.</li><li>In the <strong>Set up backup</strong> dialog box, click <strong>
Next</strong>.</li><li>In the <strong>What do you want to back up</strong> dialog box, click
<strong>Let me choose</strong>, and then click <strong>
Next</strong>.</li><li>Expand <strong>Data Files</strong>, expand <strong>
 Libraries</strong>, expand <strong>Additional Locations</strong>, and then click to clear the
<strong>AppData folder</strong>, <strong>Contacts</strong>, and
<strong>Searches</strong>check boxes.</li><li>Expand <strong>Computer</strong>, expand the item for your system drive (for example, expand
<strong>Local Disk (C:)</strong>), expand <strong>
Users</strong>, expand , and then click to select the
<strong>AppData</strong>, <strong>Contacts</strong>, and
<strong>Searches</strong>check boxes if they exist.</li><li>Click <strong>Next</strong>, and then click <strong>
Save settings and exit</strong>.</li><li>In Backup and Restore, click <strong>Back up now</strong> to perform a new backup. The backup operation should complete without errors.</li></ol>
</li></ul>

 console, go to play next day and controller won't turn on console. Try different batteries, no luck. Try to power on console manually and use sync button. Nothing. Power cycle console, nothing, remove and reinstall batteries in controller and power cycle console
 then try sync 2-3 times and it will finally find it. Happens everytime I try to power on console regardless of how I try to turn it on. Had this console for 7 days now and it isn't getting any better. Brand new in box. already having issues :(</span></p>

<p>Just did a little more research. Have another controller and it works as intended. Starts console, never looses sync. It's great. Checked firmware of both controllers, 2.3.2385.0 is the firmware of the controller that continues to loose sync. 1.2.2236.0
 is firmware of controller that works as it should. So is there a problem with the latest firmware that's been released?

<p>Exact same problem here. No problems until the Xbox sleeps ("instant on"), and then the controller will not connect/sync (even via sync buttons), turn on the Xbox, or anything. Only a full shutdown/restart, or connection via USB cable, will allow controller
 to connect.</p>
<p>Definitely seems like a software/firmware issue. Would love to roll back controller firmware, install older version.</p>

<p>My issues seem to have been fixed with latest Xbox update, amazingly enough. Wow. My console now turns on when I press the Xbox button on my controller, and those sync issues are gone. I also turned of my router's 5 GHz Wi-Fi (Xbox controllers operate with
 5G Wi-Fi Direct tech, it was within a few feet of my Xbox, unnecessary, etc), which may have nothing to do with it. Still testing.</p>

<p>But why not though? I mean it's not like it's a separate gamertag altogether. If I try and make another gamertag 'DemonWings88' it says this gamertag already exists, which is clearly referring to me... thus I should be able to have it for nothing seeing
 as nobody else can use it.</p>

<p>It is possible but you would have to change your gamertag twice at a cost of 1600 MS Points. First change it to anything else, not similar to the gamertag you want, That frees up your gamertag. Second change it to the gamertag you really want. So you have
 to ask youself "Is it worth 1600 points to take out the space?" Probably not.</p>

<p>Are you using an FTP Server application or service in your work?&nbsp; If so what program (name and version)?</p>
<p>Go to <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</a>&nbsp;and download Autoruns which&nbsp; is much superior product to msconfig that comes with Vista.&nbsp; Open the Everything tab and look for any item relating to ftpserver.exe.&nbsp; If you find it, uncheck the
 box to stop it from loading at startup.&nbsp; Click OK and reboot.&nbsp; The messages should now stop.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, d<span>o you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began (give a little leeway if you can).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work (the procedures may vary slightly with the disk but if you follow the prompts and with the above information you should be able to get through it
 just fine). Reboot and see if the problem persists.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, then you may be infected with malware.&nbsp;
<span>
Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:
</span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a><span>&nbsp;and
</span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp; You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></a><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials
</span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></a>
<span>(with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time).
<span>&nbsp;</span>You may also want to try the free Avira at: </span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></a><span> and Avast at:
</span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></a><span>.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Reboot after completing all the scans.<span>&nbsp; </span>
You may also want to try the free OneCare at </span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></a><span> and let it run all the options (except
 the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>I hope one of these options resolves
 the problem.&nbsp; If not, post back with results of what happened when you tried each option and any other information about the problem you can add.&nbsp; We'll then see if we can come up with some other alternatives to try.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>Good luck!</span></span></span></span></p>

<h2>            &#34;Full touch support with 10 touch points&#34; changed to &#34;Limited touch support with 5 touch points&#34; why&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I have an Samsung Ativ Book 9 Plus (NP940X3G-K04US) Intel core i7 and windows 8.1<br />
<br />
Within the first 3 weeks the touch screen support was working perfectly. Suddenly it stop working.<br />
I noticed in "PC info" under "Pen and touch" that the specification changed from "Full touch support......." to "Limited touch support......" and sometimes it says "No touch support available"<br />
<br />
I already downloaded SW Update but problem persist. I did "Recovery" and problem still persist. I don't know if the setting changed because an app that I download or a setting I changed while customizing my pc. Or perhaps its a driver update that I still don't
 find. <br />
<br />
Oh btw, Samsung online support have no solutions whatsoever regarding to this issue. Their last words are always "wait for updates". But it doesn't make sense that the update is missing since it was working perfectly when I unboxed the pc.
<br />
<br />

<h2>            Restoring System backup after hard drive failure&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was upgrading to window 10 but after the&nbsp;install completed&nbsp;things were not working.&nbsp;I started the restoring&nbsp;the old version, when it&nbsp;was done&nbsp;the drive would not boot. I wasted a bunch of time tying to fix it but finally bought new drive.
 Even MS support couldn't help fix it, that was a bigger waste of time as I had tried most everything they suggested.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The only info I could get&nbsp;off the old laptop is below. I'm hoping product configuration ID is what I need to install the correct version of windows. If so&nbsp;does it identify which version?</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/35ffe2d8-88d8-4f13-9c54-4a251e777ff0?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/35ffe2d8-88d8-4f13-9c54-4a251e777ff0?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>At the time I installed the new hard drive I couldn't remember which version I was using so I installed windows 8.1.&nbsp;I had to get something working I had&nbsp;things I had to get&nbsp;printed on my 3D printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that I've finished I found a backup file on an external&nbsp;drive and wish to restore it. Does it matter which version I restore it from? I'm unable to find how to restore system backup on 8.1, only personal files. If&nbsp;the backup was made on Norton Security
 its not recognizing any backup for this computer now? Please help!</p>

            It is a SCAM!!! Microsoft does not do that nor do they have partners who do that nor do they hire sub-contractors or people or even get volunteers to do that. There are probably thousands of such companies out there doing this every day - we get two or
 three messages like this (or more) every day asking about it. You are the lucky ones who recognized the scam enough not to be sucked into it and end up with identify theft, infections, hacking of your computer, convincing you to buy software or services you
 either don't need or that don't really exist at all, and all sorts of nefarious tricks. You'd be surprised by how many contact us AFTER they realized they'd been suckered asking what to do. Do not waste time talking to these people, do not give them any personal
 information whatsoever, do not be tricked by what they may get you to see on the computer - in fact, don't do anything they suggest on your computer or even visit websites they recommend, and for heaven's sake don't give them access to your computer.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Microsoft knows this goes on but with these companies springing up like dandelions, or closing and changing names when discovered, and mostly operating in foreign countries, it would take an army of lawyers to pursue every one of them. They do the best they
 can, but there simply are too many and more get added every day. People have to be careful of these things. They not only occur by phone, but also by e-mail, instant messaging, regular mail and every way imaginable. Just remember that Microsoft does not do
 this and hang up or delete emails or messages or mail from anyone claiming they are doing this because they know information about your computer or want information from you to confirm your account so it won't be closed and ask you for your username and password
 and all sorts of other personal information. Microsoft DOES NOT DO THIS!<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
See the following for additional information about this and what to do and how Microsoft operates:<br />

http://blogs.msdn.com/b/securitytipstalk/archive/2010/03/09/don-t-fall-for-phony-phone-tech-support.aspx<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I hope you didn't get caught by these scammers and saved yourself a big headache. Continue to use the same caution and you should do fine.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you got caught by these scammers (did any of the things they suggested and especially if you gave them access), I would also proceed as follows:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It was not a good idea to give them access to your computer or any personal information, but if they had access to your computer or you visited a website they suggested or downloaded anything intentionally or unintentionally from a website or email, they could
 have infected you or made changes (or installed a way to gain access at their convenience in a background download occurring while they were showing you things and installing who knows what). Plus if they installed fee-based products (as is often the case
 since they negotiate deals with such vendors to split the profits on such “sales” – in effect, a kickback), they may have removed other products and when the service is cancelled what they installed may also be cancelled. In some cases, this may be good. In
 others, it may leave you without security protection depending on what they did. So you need to make sure that you eventually have proper firewall and real-time AV protection installed (and remove any they installed unless you did a clean install or System
 Restore as will be suggested shortly – then just confirm things are back to normal and the security is enabled or re-installed).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
See this article: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/securitytipstalk/archive/2010/03/09/don-t-fall-for-phony-phone-tech-support.aspx?PageIndex=10. The article also includes links for things to do if you think you've been a victim of this type of scam and information
 about what Microsoft does and doesn't do so you won't be tricked again.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Still, it doesn't hurt to be cautious. I believe the safest thing to do at this point is to backup your data and do a clean install or a restore to factory conditions (however you are setup to start from scratch after doing a full format of the hard drive).
 If you aren’t prepared for such a radical solution (even if it is the safest), please at least proceed as follows:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Do a System Restore to before the call and giving them access. That will hopefully remove anything they may have installed and undo any changes they might have made. Also change your password and security questions with your email provider, network, ISP and
 perhaps others listed below (which a System Restore won’t do – they’ll still be the same until you revise them). There’s no telling what they could have done while they had access to your computer.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Then to make sure you weren't infected, please do the following;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:http://www.malwarebytes.org/ and SuperAntiSpyware:http://superantispyware.com/ and then run a full ESET online
 scan: http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Are you running Microsoft Security Essentials?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If so:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Start here - https://support.microsoftsecurityessentials.com/and select the link that says - I think my computer is infected. Options will vary by region, but phone support leads you to Microsoft Answer Desk (http://www.answerdesk.com/) in the US at this time.
 After an initial free consultation, a fee will be charged for assistance, based on the details of the case.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If not:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You can start here: https://consumersecuritysupport.microsoft.com/ (which will also lead to the paid support options if you are in the US)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In other regions not served by the link above, go here: http://Support.microsoft.com/securityand go to the “assisted support” or contact us menu.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If the above is too expensive and you'd like some free options (though they can take days or a week or so before getting a response and then more days going back and forth in a forum environment - and though the quality of help you get is generally good, the
 level of expertise of the person assigned to your case is pretty much the luck of the draw - but that's the "price" of free options), here are some free malware-removal forums:<br />

<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
P.S. In the meantime, I'd contact the bank or credit card company and dispute the charge to try and get my money back (if you actually paid anything - otherwise skip ahead to the P.P.S). Canceling the card is not enough to remove prior transactions that were
 charged to it without disputing them – and there may be more than just this one company if they installed products that cost money that will separately charge you (or already have). That may be simpler than asking the company or companies for a refund - but
 if the banks can't help you at this point, then of course try to get the refund from the company or companies (and keep asking to talk to the person's manager until you get as high as you can) and tell them if they refuse you'll notify the authorities and
 the company that hosts their website and take legal action (even if we know you won't because it's too much of a hassle, they won't be certain).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
How far you want to go in terms of changing all your other passwords, pins, logon information, account information (including all your financial data if on the computer) and such is a decision you need to make for yourself. They are not all related to resolving
 the computer issues and your best bet outside of anything computer-related is to contact those companies or the local authorities and see what they advise (or seek out an attorney for advice).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
P.P.S. If you wish to report it and live in the United States, here are some links you can try:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
http://www.usa.gov/Citizen/Topics/Internet_Fraud.shtml<br />
<br />
<br />
http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx This one is the "big gun" and while the best (like getting the BAU to take your case at the FBI), they really only focus on the major cases. I imagine enough complaints from enough people (or the right person or perhaps someone
 actually victimized or the company being misrepresented) about a particular company would make it a major case, but frankly don't know how they work or prioritize what they do. Still, since if they do get involved they can probably do the most to resolve the
 matter, I'd include them if I were harmed.<br />

<h2>            Add Members to Xbox Family Account Via PC</h2>
                    
<p>I'd like to add family members with existing Xbox Live profiles to my family account. &nbsp;They (and their consoles) are not in my home right now, but they are within my country.</p>
<p>I'd rather not go through the hassle of downloading their profiles to my console, and adding them to my family.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing-and-subscriptions/parental-controls/managing-family-members" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox website</a> indicates that there is a way to add members through a PC on the Xbox website. &nbsp;However, it does not seem to exist at present.</p>
<p>Is this "coming soon", or I am just missing something?</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
This was an option previously I believe, someone else had also made a thread on this topic and it was said that you cannot add family members to the XBOX Live Family Pack on the PC anymore (or at all), the only way to add them would be through the XBOX 360
 console.<br />
<br />
<strong>"To add a family member, go to Settings, Family on your Xbox console."</strong><br />
<br />
Sorry.&nbsp;</p>

 because the battery was 'defective' and slowly started expanded behind the screen. He paid almost $3000 when he bought it. Microsoft tried to charge him for a replacement which he couldn't afford and he had to continue using it for work. I have the same problem
 with my Surface Book and now I am really worried, and I feel cheated for paying so much for a defective design. I'm an architect and travel a lot with my laptop, I also just find it embarrassing when I meet clients and consultants having to explain the issue
 when they see my laptop.</span>

<p>They are replacing free of charge if you are within 3 years of original purchase (I think it should be longer). But please, it is NOT SAFE to use these devices once they are in this condition where the battery has bulged and the screen has separated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi tmoney139, if you're unable to reset your password via email or other means such as security question or mobile code, you will need to go to
<a href="http://account.live.com/password/reset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account.live.com/.../reset</a></p>
<p>-</p>
<p>From this page, select "I forgot my password," then enter the email address associated with the Xbox Account as well as the CAPCHA image and click "Next." From this next page you will get the option to choose a reset method, and if any alternate methods
 appear other than "Email me a reset link," I would suggest trying them. But if you can't do those options either, you will need to select "I can't use any of these options" and fill out an account verification questionaire to verify your identity.

            Hello I am so sorry I had the late late late reply. Anyways, Dell community got the bingo first... It didn't even require restart and stuff like that (at least for me). You just had to go to the dell driver thing and download the chipset driver and you
 will be ready to go in a box packaged for shipping to Europe and get shipped again to China. Thanks for your help though.

            <p>Hello Kate,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on what kind of document type your sheet music is stored as, you could try a simple document viewer which handles this/these types. As to a particular app that does them all - am at a loss for a recommendation.. Freda does html epub and such, there
 are a variety of pdf viewers..</p>

            <p>I am in the process of creating just such an application for myself.&nbsp; I will share this if it is deemed appropriate.&nbsp; Functions I plan to code initially:</p>
<p>Scanned PDF Files stored in a Database by Song Title, Author Source.&nbsp; All Searchable.</p>
<p>Combine PDF Files into a SINGLE PDF File. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Then once a single PDF file is loaded, a standard PDF File reader (I use Foxit https://www.foxitsoftware.com/)</p>
<p>This can be set to Full screen and the a simple foot switch like this:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IEOIJ8E?psc=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IEOIJ8E?psc=1</a>&nbsp; (The one I have)</p>
<p>OR If you are a DIYer: </p>
<p><a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/USB-Foot-Pedal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.instructables.com/id/USB-Foot-Pedal/</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially the application will just allow you to search for songs and add them to a combined PDF file.</p>
<p>Then you will use Foxit or other PDF Reader to navigate the combined PDF file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ultimately, I would like to expand the scope to allow direct scanning into the system, bringing up&nbsp;songs inside the application and navigate through&nbsp;individual PDFs without combining them.&nbsp; Also maybe saving the songs to a Set List with the ability to have
 multiple "Sets" per Gig.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I plan on using a SQLite database (single file without any type of installation...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you are interested...</p>

<p>I have been using "Song Repertoire" by Gernot Knes.&nbsp; It's very easy to use.&nbsp; I set up my set lists for each gig and have several "Practice" sets.&nbsp; My Big Band has over 300 active charts in our book, so this makes it much easier to use. I haven't tried the
 upper limit yet (our library is over 1100 songs).&nbsp; Works with the AirTurn pedal devices too.</p>

            <p>Just tried "Song Reperoire" personally I was very disappointed in the program. There is no information on what format your sheet music needs to be in. It didn't recognise any of the sheet music I have in a rather large folder of the sheet music I have that
 has been stored as PDF files. The program I am currently using will do until something better comes a long.&nbsp; have been using an android tablet for about 3 years I carry all my classical sheet music on it which is a lot better than the many kilograms of sheet
 music I used to have to carry around to singing lessons rehearsals and to performances. Until either I develop an app that matches what I have on my android tablet I will not be switching to a surface pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is worth noting that I have a companion program on my windows 10 laptop that allows me to create song lists and organise my music as well as add and delete songs from my tablet. The app on the tablet also can assign backing tracks to the sheet music so
 at those times when my accompanist is not travelling with me I still have access to good quality backings</p>
