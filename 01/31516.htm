            <p>Since&nbsp;you upgraded to Windows 7 did you run the Upgrade Advisor and check with the Compatibility<br />
Center (for device compatibility)?</p>
<p>Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor &lt;-- please run this now<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/get/upgrade-advisor.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
<span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/get/upgrade-advisor.aspx</span></a></p>
<p>Also check the Compatibility Center (for device compatibility)?<br />

<br />
Check with the System and Device makers for updated drivers and many have special instructions<br />
to help with upgrading to Windows 7.</p>
<p>========================<br />
<br />
<strong>If the system is Windows 7&nbsp;compatible AND there are drivers for your sound (and other devices).<br />
<br />

<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High<br />
Definition Audio&nbsp;(that is an example and yours may have an entirely different name/maker).<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version.<br />
Now Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers.<br />
Then RIGHT CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click on<br />
and RUN AS ADMIN (This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE : Sound drivers often rollback so check the version after installation and the<br />
reboot to see if the version you installed is there, if not repeat the install&nbsp;- reboot<br />
until it is. It can take several tries depending on how many rollbacks it does.</strong><br />
<br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
</span></span></span><br />
Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
=================================================<br />
<br />
Exhaust all the other methods in the troubleshooter above before trying these.</p>
<p>Logon as ADMIN for all of these.</p>
<p>You can try Compatibility Mode however this rarely works on Sound Drivers.<br />
<br />
Right Click the executible driver file (.exe) - Select Compatibility Mode<br />
<br />
From the drop down menu choose XP&nbsp;and Service&nbsp;Pack OR Vista&nbsp;&nbsp;(if that is the version<br />
drivers you are trying).<br />
<br />
Click OK and then let the executible run to see if it will install.<br />
<br />
=================================================<br />
<br />
This one also seldom works on Sound Drivers.<br />
<br />
Another method to try is to run the .exe (if self extracting) or upzip (if compressed)&nbsp;it to a folder&nbsp;:</p>
<p>How to Open a Elevated Command Prompt in Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/783-elevated-command-prompt.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/783-elevated-command-prompt.html</a><br />
<br />
Open an <strong>elevated command prompt</strong> : (probably looks like this)<br />
<br />
C:\Windows\System32&gt;<br />
<br />
CD \the path to that folder&nbsp;&nbsp; such as&nbsp; C:\User\Your User Name\Sound_Folder&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or whatever the path<br />
is to the folder where the driver is unpacked.<br />
<br />
So in this case it would be&nbsp; CD&nbsp;\User\Your User Name\Sound_Folder and the prompt would look like :</p>
<p>CD&nbsp;\User\Your User Name\Sound_Folder&gt;<br />
<br />
type this in at the prompt and hit enter.<br />
<br />
pnputil -i -a *.inf<br />
<br />
It will take a little while to respond.<br />
<br />
If that does not work (errors out)&nbsp;use the entire path to the driver such as (which can be used from<br />
any prompt) :<br />
<br />
pnputil -i -a C:\User\Your User Name\Sound_Folder\*.inf<br />
<br />
Again wait to see if it will install.</p>

<h2>            Samsung XE500T1C-A04US Display Adapter crashing resuming from standby</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When Windows 8.1 was released I upgraded my Samsung 500T&nbsp;XE500T1C-A04US. &nbsp;Since the upgrade when the tablet resumes from standby the display adapter will crash. &nbsp;Windows will recover the display adapter but it takes a while to resume due to the display
 adapter having to be recovered.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When the display adapter crashes the following message is found in the system event viewer.</div>
<div>"Display driver igdkmd32 stopped responding and has successfully recovered."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Before the Windows 8.1 install I used Samsung's SW Update and made sure all drivers were updated to the latest versions. &nbsp;Windows 8 was also fully updated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I contacted Samsung's support October 19th and the response was to wait for a fix. &nbsp;A fix to my problem has not materialized and I contacted Samsung's support again. &nbsp;The support informed me the problem was with Microsoft and that it is a compatibility
 issue. &nbsp;The support representative then informed me there has been a release of a Windows 8.1 patch that does fix this issue. &nbsp;Although he was unable to provide KB ID to the said fix.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am reaching out to the Windows 8.1 support community for help in resolving the display adapter crashing after resume from standby.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>* I have tried uninstalling and installing the display adapter. This did not resolve the problem.</div>
<div>* SW Update does not contain any newer display driver updates.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Below is the information on my adapter&nbsp;</div>

            Hi KamalaDP ... you can disable it using a registry setting.
<br />Before you do this make sure to create a system restore point.
<br />To do that go to search and type create a system restore point.
<br />Then right click your start button and select run.
<br />Type regedit and open it.
<br />Go to... 
<br />
<br />HKEYCurrentUser:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\StorageSense\Parameters\StoragePolicy\01
<br />
<br />Set that to 0 to disable it. 
<br />See if that works.       
        </p>

<p>Thank you for the advice. Unfortunately that key ('01') is already set to 0. That appears to just be the key that is toggled by the switch in Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage, and I turned Storage Sense off for the second time there already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That works fine, and it was previously turned off <em>until Windows decided to turn it back on</em>. I want to stop Windows from deciding on its own that I want to have Storage Sense
<em>enabled</em> and some files deleted, and doing it against my express command without telling me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I suppose if any other service turns on by itself - not <em>runs</em> by itself, any other service that I
<em>turn off</em> and then Windows says 'nah' and turns it back on - basically whichever toggle there is for telling Windows to stop getting any more bright ideas, that's the one I need.</p>

<p>I am running Windows 10 Professional, ver 1803.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope maybe there's a policy that would do this, the same way OneDrive can be completely disabled from the Policy Editor in Pro. That would be great, but I haven't seen a setting that would relate to Storage Sense in the Windows Components policy folder.</p>

            I have scoured and come up nothing as well.
<br />what version of windows are you currently running?
<br />i wonder if this is a bug that you have encountered.

<p>As mentioned, I am running Windows 10 Professional ver 1803. It's the 64-bit version if that's what you mean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think it's a bug because Windows explicitly notified me that they detected low disk space and said the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<strong>We have turned on Storage Sense for you</strong>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is a direct quote from the notification (from memory). Storage Sense was turned off, and they 'turned it on for me'. As you can imagine, I'm quite concerned what the next thing will be that they decide to 'turn on for me'.</p>

</p><p>I think you need to find a networking solution and that may depend on the version of XP.&nbsp; E.g. have a look at Remote Desktop Connection.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have XP Pro it looks as if it may actually be more feasible to go the&nbsp;way you want--I'm finding a lot more clearer
 documentation for that setup.&nbsp;&nbsp; ; )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's an ambiguous "Answer" for your case:</p>
<p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_web/windows-10-remote-desktop-connection-to-windows-xp/d6189860-2f3b-4f32-b60a-65474c1c061b">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_web/windows-10-remote-desktop-connection-to-windows-xp/d6189860-2f3b-4f32-b60a-65474c1c061b</a>
</p>
<p>(BING search for<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; remote.desktop.connection windows.10 "other OS" XP<br />
)</p>
<p>
</p><p>"If and only if it is Professional"?&nbsp; Which?&nbsp; Plus this was posted in the Windows 10 Phone section!&nbsp;&nbsp; ; }</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to go to the next page of that search to find this.&nbsp; There may be better "How to"s but this seems like a good overview</p>

            <p>Thanks for quick response.</p>
<p>The story so far.</p>
<p>I installed a RS232 to USB cable for a direct connection which failed. Contacted manufacturer who recommended fitting a USB Multi-display adapter, as supplied by them (Ugreen)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The driver, from DisplayLink, came with this unit. Checking on 'Device manager' it is working OK. However on the 'events' tab it shows 'USB\VID_17E9&amp;PID_03C1\127515&nbsp;requires further installation!</p>
<p>
</p><p>DisplayLink state that the display adapter should be contacted - I await their reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp;'display settings' of the laptop shows that there are 2 screens but cannot move to the second screen.</p>

<h2>            How do I get four PCs to be on the same network&#63;</h2>
                    I have four PCs on a home network and they all appear to be on their own network by name, One is on network 4, one is on network 2, one is on wayne;s network. I am using windows 7, a linksys E3000 router and a netgear switch. All computers have internet
 access but they don't appear to be on the same network. How do I get them all on the same network?

<p>Hi</p>
If the computers are capable to surf the Internet through the same Router they have to be on the same Network.<br />
<br />
It is probably a matter of adjusting the settings and looking at the correct place.<br />
<br />
The names network 2, 4, etc. are probably the name of the connection’s adapters, not the network name.<br />
<br />
The Network name appears in the System's Window, <a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_name.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_name.jpg</a> <br />
<br />
<strong>Go over this slowly and make sure that everything is configured correctly.</strong><br />
<br />
Maybe this can Help.<br />
<br />
<p>Win7 when configured on peer-to-peer Network has<strong>three</strong> types of Sharing configurations.<br />
<br />
<strong>HomeGroup </strong>= Works only between Win 7 computers. This type of configuration makes it very easy to Entry Level Users to start Network sharing.<br />
<br />
<strong>Home Network or Work Network</strong> = Basically similar(and better) to the previous methods of<strong> Work Group</strong> sharing that let you control what, how, and to whom folders would be shared with.<br />
<strong><br />
&nbsp;Public Sharing</strong> = Public Network (like Internet cafe) to reduce security risks.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;For best results log to each computer's System Screen and set all the computers to be on a with the same<strong>Work Group</strong> name while each computer has its own<strong>unique name.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_name.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_name.jpg</a></p>
<p><br />
Make sure that the Software Firewall, AV, or other components of Security allow free local traffic on all Networked computers. If you use 3rd party Security On, Vista/XP Native Firewall should be Off, and the active Firewall has to adjusted to your Network
 IP numbers on what is some time called the Trusted Zone (consult your 3rd Party Firewall instructions<br />
<br />
General example,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ezlan.net/faq#trusted" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/faq.html#trusted<br />
</a><strong><br />
Please Note that some <em>3rd party Software Firewalls/AV/Security suits</em> keep blocking aspects of Local Traffic even it they are turned Off (disabled).</strong> If possible configure the Firewall correctly, or totally uninstall it to allow clean flow of
 local network traffic.</p>
<p>If end up with the 3rd party software uninstalled or disabled, make sure that Windows native Firewall is<strong> On</strong> .</p>
<p>------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>If your network is comprised of Win 7 only and you want a simple Network, use this.</strong></p>

<p>After configuring the Homegroup scroll down to the <strong>Permission/Security section.</strong></p>
<p>-----------------------------</p>
<p><strong>Networking&nbsp;Win 7 with other version of Windows as&nbsp; Work Network (</strong><strong>works very well if all computers are Win 7 too).</strong></p>
<p>In the Network Center, clicking on the Network type opens the window to the right.</p>
<p>Choose your type of Network. Notice the check mark at the bottom, and check/uncheck it according to your needs.</p>

<strong>When finished with the setting of the system it is advisable to Reboot all the hardware including the Router and all computers involved.</strong></p>
<p>-------------</p>
<p><strong>If you have Permission and Security issues with Vista/Win7, check the <strong>
following</strong> settings.</strong></p>
<p>Point to the a Folder that meant to&nbsp; to be share. Right click and choose properties.</p>
<p>In the properties</p>
<p>Click on the Security tab shown in the pic bellow to the right) and check that the users and their permission (shown in the pic bellow center and left) are correctly configured. Then do the same to the Permission tab.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/Permission-Security.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/Permission-Security.jpg</a></p>
<p><strong>In both the Security panel, and the Permission panel you have to highlight each User/Group and examine that the Permission Controls are checked correctly.</strong></p>
<p>When everything is OK, Reboot the Network (Router, and computer).</p>
<p><strong>* Note</strong> . The Groups and Users shown in the screen-shoot are just an example. Your list will look the way your system is configured.</p>
<p><strong>**Note</strong> . All users that are allowed to share need to have account on<strong>all the computers</strong> that they are allowed to connect to.</p>
<p><strong>Everyone</strong> is an account, it means a group of all of the users that already have an account and been established as users. It is available to avoid the need of configuring permission to each on its own, it does not mean<strong> Everyone</strong>
 that feel that they would like to login.</p>

<h2>            Type cover not working after update</h2>
                    <p>I have the problem reported by many people and have done ALL of the potential solutions shown on this community and others inc a full reset</p>
<p>One thing has occurred to me after extensive reading namely a lot of people talk about buying a type cover separately from the original surface and not seeing any details of the type cover in either the firmware or elsewhere in the device manager. SNAP</p>
<p>Is the Asset Tag / Microsoft support data too intelligent and thus says "no type cover when initially registered, therefore no type cover software/firmware needed"</p>
<p>I am not a professional just trying to use basic common sense on the problem</p>
<p>Anyone have any thoughts</p>

<br />It's a nasty problem that Microsoft has said next to nothing about (I don't work for Microsoft) and it's aggravating to me as well that there has not been a solution other than paying for an out of warranty exchange. 
<br />
<br />The things you may not have tried is going into the UEFI and disabling and then enabling the type cover or trying to find an older Surface Pro 3 typecover and see if that worked - if you are in the USA, the Microsoft Retail Stores should at least have a test SP3 typecover to try and Amazon still sells them <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Surface-Type-Cover-Black/dp/B00N3K3KOC/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-Surface-Type-C...</a> . I'm not too hopeful on these two, but want to make sure you've tried them.
<br />
<br />I wish I had a real fix for this (if I did, I'd have a VERY happy neighbor).
<br />
<br />Best I can offer. Please DO mark as Answer if this was of assistance (even if it was not a real resolution)       
        </p>

<p>Where do I find the UEFI, obviously not in the Device Manager</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read somewhere that the Surface Pro 3 did not use but firmware from other suppliers e.g. AMI but I can't find it again quickly. I am sure it was in either on the Microsoft website or a community post</p>

            The UEFI settings can be adjusted only during system startup. To load the UEFI firmware settings menu:
<br />	1. Shut down your Surface.
<br />	2. Press and hold the volume-up button on your Surface and at the same time, press and release the power button.
<br />	3. When you see the Surface logo, release the volume-up button.
<br />The UEFI menu will display within a few seconds.

<p>Thanks for that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the UEFI was displayed nowhere was anything vaguely resembling "type cover" displayed in any of the folders / sub folders</p>
<p>The best there was was "Docking Port" which I disabled, saved, shutdown, restarted, used machine, shutdown, re-enabled, restarted, used. No success</p>
<p>The only change that I am 98% certain changed was that in "Device Manager" "Firmware" there is now a folder "Surface Pro UEFI that I am certain (virtually) was not there before</p>
<p>On startup the machine still acts as if there is no type cover because it displays the on screen number keyboard to insert the pin</p>
<p>
</p><p>I confirm that when in UEFI adjustment mode my machine displays "American Megatrends Inc" across the bottom of the screen</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any further thoughts - I am trying to get your neighbour happy as well as me</p>

            Brian,
<br />The American Megatrends menu is not the UEFI. But based on your description this isn't going to help. 
<br />
<br />Can you run

<br />winver

<br />and reply with the complete OS version and build number (it will look like 16299.334 or something similar).

<br />You can try the Surface Diagnostic Toolkit <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/403723...</a> - if this fails, do you have a Surface Pro 3 typecover or a Surface Pro 4 or newer typecover. If SP3, can you try someone else's SP4 typecover on your Surface and see if that works. If you are in the US, you can go to a physical retail Microsoft Store and they will test this with their store typecovers. <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/all-locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations...</a>

<h2>            Game lag after the most recent update</h2>
                    <p>I just updated my windows 10 today (Jul, 06, 2017).</p>
<p>Before the update, my games run very smoothly with zero lag (Witcher 3)</p>
<p>My computer is a gaming laptop (Laptop: MSI stealth pro GS70), so the hardware can support the game.</p>
<p>I've also updated my graphics card and the drivers are up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, after the update, my games (Witcher 3) starts to lag a lot. I've tried to lower the setting but the game still lags...</p>
<p>I'm wondering if anyone has the similar issue or know the fix?</p>

    <title>App Readiness causing black screens. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ewitzms  say:</h3>
<h2>            App Readiness causing black screens.</h2>
                    <p>This appears to be an issue popping up with certain vendors; HP and Lenovo gets mentioned a lot.&nbsp; In this case we just deployed a number of new Lenovo desktops and laptops at a site.&nbsp; I configured them first in our offices and found no issues, but later
 I brought them to the site and joined their domain, at which point the "black screen at boot up" issues came to light.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was assuming some manner of domain issue at first, because some user accounts would log right in and others would be stuck, but eventually found out about the App Readiness issue.&nbsp; And indeed if I disable App Readiness while any user login is sitting at
 a black/blank screen and not letting Explorer load, stopping App Readiness lets it continue in normally.&nbsp; (Though for whatever reason the Start menu wouldn't launch.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disabling App Readiness completely takes care of it for any account that was affected.&nbsp; And eventually the Start menu would work for them again, too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, this workaround should not be a permanent fix.&nbsp; Are there hotfixes available from Microsoft or Lenovo, or instructions on how to resolve whatever's going on?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, what is App Readiness being disabled specifically going to mean for the users?&nbsp; Does it disallow certain updates?&nbsp; "What does it do" is built into my questions as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>BSOD's as we all know at times occur due to possible faulty drivers, corrupted programs or user profiles, or system files being damaged or missing. This case might be different however. Since you've mentioned that doing your initial set up on an open network,
 that the computer works fine after the setup and you only experience this upon connecting the units on their domain. It could be possible that there might be some permissions, restrictions, or settings that needs to be granted, modified or amended on the domain.
 That being said we would like to know the following for us to refer you to the correct TechNet channel:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you using any Windows Server on top of the domain net being used?</li><li>Are there networking permissions that was set on the domain?</li><li>Have you checked the compatibility of the units versus the domain?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, you can refer to this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4043292/windows-10-black-screen-when-restarts-after-windows-update-oem-factory" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a> for future reference specially when you're getting black screens when Windows 10 restarts after a Windows update on some OEM factory-imaged devices. Be advised though, that the troubleshooting suggested on the link may work. Otherwise, it could
 be the permissions that really needs to be set in order to get your devices up and running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>There is a&nbsp; Windows Server 2012 R2 Foundation at the site, running the domain, which was migrated from an older 2003 server.&nbsp; It is running all the functions.&nbsp; There were no specific networking permissions set that I could see interfering in this way.&nbsp; It
 is a simple network and was set up with Windows defaults.&nbsp; I don't think any full-compatibility check was performed for Windows 10 units vis-a-vis the entire domain setup.&nbsp; They would obviously work with a 2012 server fine, but it's possible some settings
 initially in place from the 2003 environment were not updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would any of this specifically run afoul of the App Readiness function, tho?&nbsp; Especially since so much info out there is calling this a hardware vendor issue that is hotfixable?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And again, to pass along, what exactly goes on when a computer leaves App Readiness completely disabled, as the new workstations are currently?</p>

<p>Thank you for keeping us posted and also for the clarification. It is recommended that App Readiness
<span>is enabled. This will help to gets apps ready for use the first time a user signs in to this PC and when adding new apps.

<p>Obviously it is recommended that App Readiness be enabled.&nbsp; But without a proper patch to cute the issue, they HAVE to run with it disabled.&nbsp; I am wanting to know all the side-effects will occur while in this state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll post on the TechNet forums.&nbsp; Apologies, I thought you were indicating earlier that you were passing it along that way, not that I should manually create a new one there.</p>

<p><span>Here's a FAQ on how Indexing affects searches:
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Improve-Windows-searches-using-the-index-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Improve-Windows-searches-using-the-index-frequently-asked-questions</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 You should read the entire article - it's very instructive about how searches occur in Vista which is quite different from how they occurred in XP.&nbsp; It includes how to add files and locations to the index.</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><br />
To search the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">entire</span> C: drive in Vista go to Start / Search Box and type in '&lt;filename&gt; or &lt;foldername&gt;'. As you're typing you'll see two hyperlinks appear just above where you're typing and one will say Search
 Everywhere.&nbsp; Click on that.&nbsp; That will do a quick indexed search and bring up a dialog box.&nbsp; Click on Advanced Search.&nbsp; Click on the location drop down menu and find Drive C: and click on it. Check the box "include non-indexed, hidden, and system files (may
 be slow)."&nbsp; Then click on Search.&nbsp; You will now be searching your entire hard drive for the specified file.&nbsp; And yes, it's not a very efficient way of searching the entire drive for a file but that's how it's done in Vista.</span></p>
<span><br />
Here are some tips on how to find files (and the page includes a number of hyperlinks to related articles about doing searches which you can also review:
</span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Tips-for-finding-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Tips-for-finding-files</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 There are also a lot of links to other articles on Vista searches - but none as good as this one.<br />
<br />
I did a search for a character in my book, and every draft of my book came&nbsp;up in the search (well most of them - as many as would fit in the listing without going Advanced).&nbsp; That's because .doc, .docx,&nbsp;and Documents are&nbsp;all &nbsp;included in the Index.&nbsp; I think
 if you add .sql and .vb as well as the location of your files you'll be able to search by content as well.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.&nbsp; Good luck!<br />

    <title>Built-in Microphone not picking up voice correctly. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Built-in Microphone not picking up voice correctly.</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I am using Windows 10 Inspiron ONE2330, which is a desktop computer. I have been having a problem with my built-in microphone. Every time when I talk into it, it barely picks up my voice. I would only hear my voice, but muffled very badly. This problem
 has been around for the last two to three months. During that time I was trying to find a solution to the problem or someone with a very similar problem but I have not found any. I have checked my settings and I have also troubleshooted the problem but nothing
 has solved anything. I've opened the settings tested if it would pick up my voice, and the green bar for it was very low. I have even checked to see if my microphone's drivers need to be updated. I realized that they needed to be updated, but each time I updated
 them they'd still say the same date of the last update as before. Also, it is still saying that there are still available updates for the drivers. I do know that this computer is over two years old so I was suspecting that there was dust clogging up the microphone.
 The thing is I do not know where the built-in microphone is located in my computer. Does anybody know how to fix this problem? If so, thanks in advance.</p>

            Hi Mikayla.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Type Microphone in Start Search to choose Set up Microphone and go through the steps there to set it up correctly.  
<br />
<br />If that's not enough here is everything else to try: 
<br />
<br />Please run the Recording Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try this fix next:  <a href="http://maxedtech.com/fix-microphone-not-working-in-windows-10-1803/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://maxedtech.com/fix-microphone-not-working...</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the volume icon in System Tray at right end of task bar, open Recording Devices, see if the microphone is listed, set it as Default device.  
<br />
<br />Type Microphone in Start Search, open Set up Microphone, scroll down to Microphone and choose Get started to set it up.
<br />
<br />Try rolling back the sound controller drivers in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Choose Sound controller device, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />
<br />Update the Sound drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  While there make sure you also have the latest Chipset, Display, Network, USB and all other drivers, comparing with the version presently installed in Device Manager.
<br />
<br />If no newer driver then uninstall the ones presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />When did this behavior begin?  If you have an idea you might be able to System Restore back to a point before it began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />It's possible this was caused by a Windows Update so if nothing above works, go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update, check the Installed Updates list for Updates that might have been just installed, try uninstalling them using the Uninstall button present there.  Then hide the Updates using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also roll back Version 1803 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br /> Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>A few of the movies I have bought on XBOX Video have an expiration date, which states "Movie cannot be streamed or downloaded after 2/14/2014" I stream my movies, I guess after that date I won't be able to stream the movies I bought?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Browncoat0379,<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the movie states an expiration date then that is the case. Some content does expire but if the content is ever available again through the service, you will be able to stream it from your purchase history and watch it again. Look at it as a black out
 period in that sense. Hope this clears things up. Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Desktop slideshow stops working after a few days</h2>
                    <p>I have a selection of photos in a subfolder of 'photos' which I use for a desktop slideshow, I select all and save my settings. I then get a continuous changing desktop background for a few days - exactly as I should, so all good so far. After a few days
 I find that my desktop photo is no longer changing so I go back into the 'Personalise' settings, open up my 'Desktop Background' and find that there are now no items selected from my slideshow folder, I reselect all save my settings and off it goes again for
 another few days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas as to why it stops working? My PC is left on 24/7 and only rebooted for updates usually.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance, Chris</p>

            <p>Thanks for the response Abdul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not a branded PC but running an i5-4570 with 12GB RAM, we're an IT support company so this is our own build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1 is not really a feasible troubleshooting option as this is in constant use during the day and the failure rate is over days not hours. Running without the 3rd party software is not an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2 I have checked all and confirm it is 'available'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 3 - not a laptop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 4 - I have just updated the display driver, my original was dated January this year, the latest in September.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try it over the next few days with the updated display driver and see if that fixes it</p>

<h2>            Xbox charged me twice for the same digital game and don&#8217;t care</h2>
                    <p><span>Last month, resident evil 2 deluxe edition I pre-ordered was charged again a few days after my initial purchase. I had to open a dispute with PayPal cause Microsoft didn’t seems to understand the problem. It seems, that, since they created that refund
 policy this became quite a mess. What they see as a transaction is not real money transactions. Not like on PayPal and most of the time, dates differ. For that game, they finally refund me at the end of the dispute a few minutes before PayPal review the file,
 saying that they already credited me and PayPal said that the dispute was closed not in my favor, which I found hilarious. Anyway, I had my money back so I thought I could let them a chance and just try to forget it and turn the page. So I bought a new Xbox
 One X on their site and took my preorders back (DMC5 and MK11); I was so frustrated by that issue that I had cancel everything.&nbsp;</span><br />

<span>March 6. I’m charged for Devil May cry 5 deluxe Ed. Good game which I completed in almost 5 days minus 2 hard achievements. March 12, while I was still playing and trying hell and hell, my mobile beep with an email receipt saying thanks for DMC5 deluxe

 that I ask for refund too much recently which is false but the probably also took my preorders cancellations for transactions when it was not.</span><br />

 something in the case and send it again saying that I will be refund if they don’t answer after 10 days. So after being on stress about a fraud for 10 days, I need to wait another 10 days for nothing.</span></p>

            <p>Windows Defender is only an anti-spyware program - it does not protect against viruses and other types of malware. You therefore need a separate anti-malware program. If you get one of the major anti-malware programs that covers all malware, including spyware,
 then turn off Windows Defender to prevent systems stabiliy/performance problems (in fact some of these major anti-malware programs will deliberately and correctly disable Windows Defender for that very reason).</p>
<p>Opinions on the best anti-malware program vary massively. In the reviews I've seen though, McAfee is mediocre and is also currently using may people problems with pictures getting hidden due to a bug (see:
<a href="http://service.mcafee.com/faqdocument.aspx?id=TS101228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://service.mcafee.com/faqdocument.aspx?id=TS101228</a>) . Whichever one you choose make sure it is reputable (there are many fake anti-virus programs about) and keep it updated.</p>
<p>Also, make sure that you have a firewall running. Windows 7 comes with its own firewall that you can use (Windows Firewall) or get one as part of a secuity suite by a major company or a standalone 3rd party one.</p>
<p>Other security advice:</p>
<p>- keep Windows, programs and browser plug-ins (like Flash Player and Java) up to date to help close security holes.</p>
<p>- if possible keep an eye on how cyber-criminals are attacking - for example fake phone calls from Microsoft saying they'll fix your PC's problems are now a major problem.</p>

Something you should know.....<br />
If you end up choosing one of the following AVs ( anti-virus ) programs, your Windows Defender will be shut down. It is because those AVs have their own defenders. Having 2 defenders running in the same machine will create conflicts. They will shut down your
 Windows Defender.<br />
<br />
Here is the lsit of AVs that will shut down Windows Defender :<br />
<br />
Microsoft Security Essentials <br />
Norton<br />
McAfee<br />
AVG.

<p>Hey there Cokiegirl! I'm sorry to hear you are having trouble watching this movie. I assume you are trying to stream it, correct? Can you try clearing your system cache (<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../clear-system-cache</a>),
 restarting the console, and then streaming it again. If that doesn't work, could you try downloading the film instead? Let me know if either of those help, thanks!
