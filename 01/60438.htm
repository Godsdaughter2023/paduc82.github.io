    <title>Windows 10 will not allow me to remove a Canon toolkit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> guera fodonga  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 will not allow me to remove a Canon toolkit</h2>
                    <p>My Canon scanner worked perfectly until the Windows 10 upgrade. &nbsp;Now, my computer keeps telling me I need to install it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called Canon and they walked me through every which way I SHOULD be able to uninstall the original toolkit (which I must do), but the uninstall process goes nowhere and ends up "Not Responding."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help out there? &nbsp;Thanks in advance!</p>

<h2>            unable to play Skyrim on Windows 8.1 and i wanna roll back to windows 8</h2>
                    hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I had windows 8 pro with media center installed on my pc , then i updated it to windows 8.1.</div>
<div>and the moment i've installed new windows 8.1 update on my pc, i am not able to run the game skyrim. it was running butter smooth before but now when i play the game it crashes in only 2-5 minutes of gameplay with no error. i've tried everything i could
 including re-installing the game, video card drivers, refreshing my pc, etc. but found everything useless. so i've decided to roll back my current win 8.1 OS to win 8. &nbsp;and so i need a step by step process of how to do it.</div>
<div><br />

            hi karthik,&nbsp;
<div>thanks for d reply,&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>my game skyrim is updated to the lastest patch which was 1.9.32.0. everything else including all drivers are also updated. and i dont' use any security/ antivirus software except the default windows firewall and defender which i update regularly.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've already checked the game via compatibility troubleshooter and it was not helpful. and my computer doesn't crash while playing this game, what happens is simply the game crashes within 2 to 10 minutes of gameplay without any error.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've been through this link, and have analyzed that the game is not compatible for windows 8.1 , and so i want to downgrade my OS to windows 8.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>check out the link here:&nbsp;</div>

            Today I had Windows 8.1 automatically update onto my computer. I have had this same issue and none of the reply above has been very helpful. There has also been no follow up (over a month later) which is absolutely terrible customer service, I imagine
 Shivam is quite unhappy with that.<br />
<br />
I myself will certainly be taking all steps to downgrade back to Windows 8, but will also be raising the issue of the lack of response here as well as the failure to properly address the problem.<br />

            It appears to me that they don't reply to our problems where we talk of downgrading their product. They want me to use win 8.1 until of course I'll get frustrated enough to format my C drive and boot again with Win 8 to play the game. &nbsp;
<div>and Microsoft must know that its their responsibility now after the game publisher had produced final patch more than a year ago and the game was running smooth on win 8. so I can't even ask the publisher to produce another patch for windows 8.1 users
 or to provide a solution because its the problem of this windows upgrade itself. &nbsp;</div>

<h2>            So learned how to make audio work on xbox app recording but not happy</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason i'm not happy and the people at xbox you guys that are in charge of this app need to work out a compatability patch asap, your app it no compatiable with 24bit 192000hz stuido quality settings for audio, your app is also not compatible or able
 to read 5.1 surround sound when it comes to realtek cards. We as realtek users shouldn't have to drop out settings to 16bit 48000hz with stereo audio quality. This is on your guys end, so please get your team to make your xbox app compatible with 5.1 surround
 systems and even 7.1 for that matter along with 24bit 192000hz studio quality audio.</p>

<p>To add into explanation what I mean is your Game DvR recording needs to be able to be compatible with 5.1 surround up to 7.1 surround audio systems along with 24bit 192000hz studio quality audio settings, otherwise your game DvR that you guys are giving
 to us is technically obsolete compared to others out there. Because no offense I should be able to get Game DvR to record sounds if I have 5.1 or 7.1 surround with 24bit 192000hz audio quality, as most applications are compatible with those settings recording
 wise, as they know those settings produce the best audio.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Outlook Icon Missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bevjones43  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Outlook Icon Missing</h2>
                    <p>When I purchased my laptop a little more than a year and a half ago from Currys PC World I purchased Mircrosoft Office 2013 and they put it on for me. &nbsp;As I already had an email account with Gmail I asked if my new Outlook email and Gmail could be synced
 so when I clicked onto the mail icon I had the option to click on my Gmail or Outlook- all was well until a couple of months ago when my Outlook mail disappeared and my Outlook icon disappeared from the group of all the other Microsoft icons which were still
 all there. &nbsp;I went into device manager, Microsoft Office and selected full repair but still no joy - I can google Microsoft Outlook and log in from there but it's not the same, it looks different.............any ideas? I have windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in anticipation.</p>

And try to play the file in <a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/download-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>VLC Media Player</span></a>. It plays many more formats than

Other things you could try:-<br />
<br />
System Restore:-Select any restore point when there was no such problem.<br />

            I would prefer not to do a system restore because that would just be a real pain. And I don't really want to start having to use VLC. I want to use the media player that came with my computer -- Windows Media Player 12. Thank you for your help, though.
 I really appreciate it. Anyone else have more solutions?

<h2>            Compatibility with CanoScan 3000ex</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have a Cannon Scanner 3000ex. It is a bit too old, and can run on Windows XP 32-bit only, while I am using Windows 10 64-bit. Unfortunately, it doesn't even have a driver for 64-bit version of Windows XP; therefore, I can't install the driver. Is
 there any way to run the setup in Windows XP 32-bit mode?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I still have the problem that Canon offers the drivers for 32-bit version only. Even though I run the driver setup in compatibility mode for Windows XP, it can't run on my 64-bit Windows. Is there any way to run a 32-bit driver setup on 64-bit Windows?</p>

            The fix for this problem is to upgrade using the microsoft download tool then burn a dvd for install. This will prevent the upgrade for looking at your video card. After you install win 10 go back and install the latest windows 8.1 driver dated 2015 for
 this card. I have done this on 3 machines with this video card and it works just great!!!

            It's a Dell XPS 410. &nbsp;The Sound is not a beep. &nbsp;It's the "chord" sound you usually hear when you try to click on something that's invalid. &nbsp;It sounds once exactly every 10 seconds. &nbsp;I tried unplugging my keyboard and mouse thinking that maybe a key was
 sticking or something, but it kept doing it. &nbsp;Help!

            <p>The "chord sound" is probably the sound Windows associates with a "critical stop" error.</p>

</p><p>See the following thread for some general troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; Note that both of the people who had the problem determined that it was related to a Java update, so before you start down a long investigative path, go to Control Panel &gt; Add or Remove Programs

<p>Hi</p>
<p>You can download msvcp90.dll from here:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dll-files.com/pop.php?dll=msvcp90" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dll-files.com/pop.php?dll=msvcp90</a>&nbsp;. Just follow the instructions on the page to unzip and save the file to C:\Windows\System32.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternatively, msvcp90.dll is also installed when installing Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Components. You can download it here&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?familyid=A5C84275-3B97-4AB7-A40D-3802B2AF5FC2&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?familyid=A5C84275-3B97-4AB7-A40D-3802B2AF5FC2&amp;displaylang=en</a></p>

            <p>I have same problem with dnsapi.dll. &nbsp;My AV (Symantec) calls it Trojan.Mentono, but it can't remove it. I ran SFC and it did say it replaced dnsapi.dll, but still no joy. Outlook says it can't find DNSAPI.dll in path. Neither Chrome nor iExplorer can access
 DNS, but I can ping www.google.com &nbsp;and name gets resolved. Tried all sorts of DNS cleanup (netsh winsock reset, restore hosts file, restart DNS service), no joy.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I believe I have it fixed now. Firstly, I used Norton Power Eraser to remove the virus (<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Trojan.Mentono). Then I did a full scan using my AV (Symantec) and verified virus was removed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I created a bootable USB stick with Windows 7 (my applicable version). I started the Repair your computer, and then Startup Repair. That fixed a boot parameter issue (not sure what that
 was). Then I used the Advanced Repair function to get a Command Prompt. I went to the Windows System32 and SysWOW64 directories and deleted the DNSAPI.dll in either directory.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I grabbed the respective DNSAPI.dll files from my other PC (which did not have the virus) and copied them onto the affected pc, rebooted, and all is well - I have normal internet access
 again.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>TB, I'm glad to hear that you found that out because I am also trying to repair a communal laptop for the house I live at,. The malware on it makes it appear as a non-licensed version of Windows 7, which is of course not the case.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There seems to be lots else in common with what you experienced...numerous Trojan viruses seem to not get removed by MSE because of the the same files that you mention (namely Windows\system32\dnsapi.dll).</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other thing, since I cannot make any use of my DNS, whether through the web browser or even Command Prompt, I was wondering if before I go ahead and put in the windows CD or bootable image for Repair (brilliant by the way), am I likely to gain anything
 from going about yet another system restore (tried already a number of times). At the present moment, I have loaded the settings for diagnostic boot option and I am no longer getting a message about the activation problem (yay!). But, since the settings pretty
 much render the Windows operating system useless by restricted devices and services, I would like some suggestions about the removal of the virus that could have caused the files on my computer to become corrupt. Once again, thanks for posting this and I will
 certainly give it a try once I've been able to scan my computer again, which is also a disabled feature for Diagnostics mode in Win7. (Oops)</p>
<p>
</p><p>One day, it would be nice if Microsoft would make a legitimate attempt to publicize all that's wrong with their operating system, including MSE's ability to miss altogether on catching and removing viruses.</p>

            How did you do it? &nbsp; Defender quarantined the dll and broke things. &nbsp; When I remove it from the quarantine it works but then defender says bad again. How do I clean the file? &nbsp; Btw spybot and malware bytes do not find the malware when I do a full scan
 with them. Is it really infected?

            <p>I had the same issue. Windows Defender flagged the dnsapi.dll as a Trojan so I removed it and tried to replace it. A brief history, my family computer got infected with the Jabuticaba Adware. I removed the adware, but I think the dns file was still affected
 and thus eventually flagged as a Trojan by Windows Defender. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Initially, the dns file that I downloaded to replace it didn't work.&nbsp;After some more searching,&nbsp;I replaced that one with the&nbsp;.dll for sysWOW64 (since that was the one causing the problems) from this link -
</p>
<p>http://www.smartestcomputing.us.com/files/file/23-windows-10-dnsapidll/ - and I haven't had any issues since.</p>

<p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>The advice given to me by TbNielsen to remove the virus and then replace the file in question, was effective.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In regards to another prior post it was and still is a matter of consecutive scans on the system, while it is in Safe Mode as I performed myself by booting into active directory repair (not sure if I needed to or not). I then literally scanned the file system
 and registry about a half dozen times before taking any further actions. BY running the scan in more than one configuration , i.e. with registry and without, then scanning certain portions of the drive, I used malware bytes, some instances may take up to 2.5
 hours to complete (for a 100-200 GB disk that is) and it caught some piece of the virus on it every time it ran until soon enough voila no more teeny bits of virus...give it a try, I have not heard of Spybot, but would suggest that if the problem you're reporting
 is possibly not a virus, but something else altogether like a spyware or something like that that you uninstall and reinstall your Internet browsers, including Internet explorer because that can save you a lot of time in trying to determine what other than
 the scan could be infected (effected). And perhaps the not so toughest part was replacing the bad file with the one I download d from &nbsp;online but not until after removing the virus once and for all (Windows activation says it is online.</p>

            <p>I just spent the last week working with Malwarebytes support on this issue.&nbsp; It turns out the reason that defender locks out the internet when quarantine this virus is that there is no "clean" version of dnsapi.dll.&nbsp; When I installed Windows the system restore
 was not on so I did not have a "clean" file for windows to replace the infected one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to "reset" my windows and I have turned on system restore!&nbsp; All is clear now.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Try to register RegSvr:</p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">SFC scan will check the system files, if they are corrupted.</span></span></p>

<br />
Hello.&nbsp; I have win 8.&nbsp; I cannot find trim tools in my version of MM.&nbsp; I have seen youtube videos showing how to segment long videos into shorter versions and then paste back together.&nbsp; Ie, take a 25 min video and slice out segments and put them back together
 say, in a 1 minute video.&nbsp; I would also like to do this with other videos by cutting a few different videos and then paste those segments together to make an entirely new video.&nbsp;&nbsp; How is this done?&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;

            I have used the split key numerous times as I make videos for class each week. However, I am now trying to use the split function and instead of it "splitting" as it usually does, it is deleting the remainder of hte video. Any advice?

                    <p>I recently updated my computer to whatever updates windows had. Since then, whenever I go to plug in my charger or unplug it, the screen goes black but comes back on after a second. I've looked on other threads but none of the solutions have worked. I've
 tried changing the screen resolution and changing the hertz (from 40 Hertz to 60 Hertz and back and forth to see if that worked.)</p>

            Hi Erika,<br />
<br />
<br />
We notice that this thread became idle for a long time now. Were you able to find solution to the said issue? The issue could be related to hardware drivers which were yet to have the updates right after updating the operating system. Try to update the graphic
 card driver first. We recommend that you download the latest version from the manufacturer's support site first, freely uninstall the old one, and install the brand new driver.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are reports that this method worked with many relevant issues. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Feel free to keep us updated. <br />

<p>==========================================<br />
FWIW...Wndows Movie Maker 2.6 is not an update...it is a stripped <br />
down version for systems that will not run Vista Movie Maker 6.</p>
<p>The new version...would be Windows Live Movie Maker. It's quite<br />
different than version 6. If you decide to try it...plan on creating <br />
a new project because your version 6 project files probably won't <br />
be compatible.</p>
<p>Windows Live Movie Maker<br />
<a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-movie-maker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://explore.live.com/windows-live-movie-maker</a><br />
(There are other apps included in the download...<br />
uncheck the ones you do not want)</p>
<p>As for the error...I wonder if you might have a compatibility issue <br />
with your source files.</p>
<p>Many formats are reportedly compatible with Movie Maker but the <br />
most reliable choices are:<br />
<br />
Photos -&nbsp; bmp<br />
Video -&nbsp; wmv or dv-avi<br />
Music -&nbsp; wma, wav, wmv</p>
<p>Have you tried Publishing (Saving)&nbsp;your project in the WMV movie <br />
format and then importing the WMV movie file into Windows DVD <br />
Maker?</p>
<p>It's also possible that your project is too large and/or complex.</p>

I completed the Windows update pushed November 12, 2013.&nbsp; I did a normal shutdown of the computer last night after the update. Today when I booted up I have no video. I had 2 monitors, 1 VGA, 1 HDMI,&nbsp; connected, both working at the time of shutdown. Now neither
 monitor is getting a signal, I have disconnected each monitor separately and still get no signal at the other monitor.<br />

I can hear the hard drive working but no signal to the monitors.<br />

            <p>Hi Ralphy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What are the KB numbers of the updated installed recently? </p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What is the make and model of the computer? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s follow these methods and check if it fixes the issue.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span><b><span>Method 1: Start the computer by using Low-resolution video (640×480) mode and check if you see the desktop items.</span></b></span></p>

<p>If updating drivers does not help, try the method 2.</p>

</span></b></span></p>
<p><span><b><span>Method</span></b></span><b> 2: </b></p>
<p><b>Step 1: </b>Start your computer in <span><span><span>Low-resolution video (640×480) mode and
</span></span></span>perform system restore to the previous working date.</p>

            If you see no video at all when turning the computer on, i.e. before Windows starts to load, there is clearly a hardware problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that the case?<br />

<h2>            I got an Xbox One for Christmas..from my Girlfriend&#33; &#40;Switzerland&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello Guys</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My Girlfriend was very hyped the last couple of days as she was very excited to give me my Christmas presents. Last night we exchanged our presents and I bought her some very cool stuff and she told me that I would be so surprised of the Present she has
 for me and what she did for it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now as most of you guys know the Xbox One is not available till around March or April next Year so the only Way to get such a Console is through Import which some Shops here in Switzerland offer. They either come from Germany or Austria.</p>
<p>As the time came I gave her my biggest present for her and she gave me my biggest present. I had no clue what that could be but the present was massive! She told me to read the Card on the present and then unwrap it very quickly. Now before the Big Present
 she gave me Lego Marvel Heroes for my Xbox 360.</p>
<p>As I quickly got rid of the Present Paper, there it was...a big green box with the Xbox One Logo on it. I could not believe my eyes! I was speechles and had issues Controlling my emotions...She bought me the Xbox One Console with COD Ghosts as Download plus
 the last present was Forza Motorsport 5....</p>
<p>She drove 150km each way to get me for Christmas the Xbox One! She drove my Switzerland to Germany....I was again speechless...I opened carefully the Box and slowly get everything Setup. Batteries into the Controller and the Console hooked up with the TV.
 Launched the Console and hoped to not get any issues.</p>
<p>It took a few minutes to be ready and I just waited for the Setup to be ready. Did the Wireless Setup and downloaded the 500mb Update.&nbsp;Took 5 Minutes and the Console rebootet, loaded the Update and within another 5 Minutes she was ready and welcomed me with
 an Intro. The Controller is perfect. The UI really responsive. Installed the Blu-Ray App, Youtube App, etc. Took the Forza 5 Disc and inserted it into the Console. Loaded up, wanting a 6GB Download, no Problems..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>10 Minutes later I was ready to Play Forza 5 while I used the QR Code through Kinect to Download the Game.</p>
<p>OMG this Console is amazing! My Girlfriend is Amazing! The Game Looks very sharp, runs super nice the Switch between the Game and the Dashboard is quick as hell!</p>
<p>Even registering my User Profile was very easy such as everything else was..Fluid!</p>
<p>I am right now the most happy Person on this Planet.</p>
<p>Now I Need a few more games :) :)</p>
<p>Thank You Microsoft ! I must say that even her Brother who is a Genius liked the new Interface and we had a blast with this next Generation Console from Microsoft! Once I am back at my place today I can turn up the Volume and lets race!</p>
<p>Best Regards</p>
<p>NS</p>
<p>Sorry for the Length but I am just so super duper mega Ultra happy! Never got such a amazing present for Christmas from such an amazing human being like my Girlfriend..now that is true love ;)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have a question to which you guys may help with. Before I went to bed I download and queued 3 Demos like Zoo Tycoon, Kinect Sports Rivald and Xbox Music. Now when I just turned it on it says that the Installation has been halted. Is there a way to resume
 those Downloads??</p>
<p>Another Thing I just launched COD Ghosts and when I press on the Xbox Button I go back to the Dashboard. Can I actually just quit the game ?

<p>If you want to stop the game running, just press Menu (used to be Start) when hovering over its icon on the dashboard, then quit.

<h2>            Varying BSOD Codes - Cannot figure out the cause</h2>
                    <p>I bought a CyberPower PC last July and I've run into serious issues with the BSOD.&nbsp; My computer usually crashes after 10-15 minutes of being used. The errors vary widely, here are a few of the codes though:</p>
<p>
</p><p>SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION</p>
<p>What Failed: win32kfull.sys</p>
<p>
</p><p>PFN_LIST_CORRUPT</p>
<p>
</p><p>DRIVER_IQRL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;(This is the most common crash code)</p>
<p>What Failed: storport.sys</p>
<p>
</p><p>KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED</p>
<p>What Failed: NTFS.sys</p>
<p>
</p><p>KERNEL_SECURITY_CHECK_FAILURE</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried so many things to fix this problem. I did a check disk a while ago but that didn't fix anything. I'm really at a loss for what the problem is because the code's are so commonly random and it never crashes from a consistent cause. This started
 happening about 3 months ago. I have not installed any new software recently. I used to have Avast but I uninstalled it in an attempt to fix the problem. The crashes seemed to become less frequent after that but now they happen more frequently than ever before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are my system specs:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Operating system: Windows 10 64 bit</p>
<p>Processor: AMD Ryzen 5 1400 Quad-Core Processor, 3200 Mhz</p>
<p>Video Card: AMD Radeon RX 560</p>
<p>RAM: 1-stick 8GB DDR4</p>
<p>Hard Drive: 1TB HHD (Model:&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1)">WDC WD10EZEX-08WN4A0)</span></p>
