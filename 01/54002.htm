<h2>            keep homepage from being changed</h2>
                    <p>on IE10 sometimes my homepage is automatically changed. Is there any way to prevent this?</p>
<p>o/s= win7 pro</p>
<p>browser IE-10</p>
<p>Maybe I was not clear. sometimes my homepage is changed by outside influences from my default home page.</p>
<p>I was wondering if there was a program or something I could use to stop that.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 keeps installing the default not working driver for audio HD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phanyx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 keeps installing the default not working driver for audio HD over a working one.</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
i have a problem with realtek HD audio driver in Windows 7 Pro x64. My audio is an integrated sound card Realtek HD (realtek alc660 6 channel codec) on Asus k8v-vm SE motherboard. Fresh after an installation of Windows 7, it installs its default HD audio driver
 and says, that it is working (in device manager it says, that the device is working properly), but in the Playback Devices list (in the system tray speaker icon menu) there is no devices, so eventually there is no sound. There is no problem, since Realtek
 has its own drivers for Win7 x64 available, which are working just fine (ver. R 2.39 at the moment). The problem is, that after every single start of the computer, Windows installs back its own default drivers, that as I've already said are not working. The
 curious part is, that it does not recover them after restart, but only after turn off and on.<br />
<br />
I think, that the problem lies in the fact, that Realtek's drivers are not certified, and the MS drivers of course are. I think, that Windows is choosing the latter, because it believes that they are safer (Realtek's workin&amp;not-certified drivers vs MS's pseudo-working&amp;certified
 drivers).<br />
<br />
Have someone any suggestions how to make Win7 stop installing the faulty drivers? Installing the proper ones on every boot is not very convenient.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Dominik<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
1. The first solution didn't work, but made me realize, that the driver was not recovering but it was being removed and then recovered with standard procedure (certified drivers &gt; not-certified drivers). Furthermore, it was all random, when the driver was being
 removed - sometimes it was working just fine after halt and sometimes not.<br />
2. Second solution can be followed only partially. I can uninstall the device, but I cannot uninstall the Windows's driver (possibly because system is assuming that MS is the most trustworthy provider). Of course I am able to uninstall the third party drivers,
 but I am not willing to remove Realtek's driver (I tried this though).<br />
<br />
3. While following the first solution I found, that Windows will always prefer certified drivers over not-certified. So I came up with an idea of removing the default Windows' driver and disabling the function of downloading drivers by Windows Update. That
 was pretty tricky though, as I found, that I (the system administrator with no restrictions) am not able to even list the driver file (c:\Windows\System32\drivers\HdAudio.sys), not mentioning the actual removal of the file. It's funny that, I managed to list
 it by using the search function, but I still wasn't able to remove it though, so I rebooted to a LiveCD and removed it from there. I also removed copies of the file in locations, where Windows Update downloads them. After that it seems to work properly now.<br />
<br />
4. I suggest Microsoft to release a patch or sth, that will not make Windows 7 install this default driver for this particular device, since it is not working. Or allow users to decide which drivers they prefer to use - even not-certified, because it can be
 not a secluded case, when a not-certified driver works, but a certified, not working one is prefered and used. Or force producers to certify their drivers somehow.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Dominik

<h2>            WINDOWS 10 Upgrade - VIDEO_TDR_FAILURE &#40;nvlddmkn.sys&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have upgraded two brand new W 8.1 laptops to W 10 with no serious problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also "upgraded" my main dektop computer after which it immediately started crashing.&nbsp; I get a blue screen with the message:</p>
<p>VIDEO_TDR_FAILURE (nvlddmkm.sys).&nbsp; The screen informs that data is being collected after which it will restart my computer for me.</p>
<p>The data collection reaches 100% but it does not restart the computer.</p>
<p>This happens frequently but randomly so that I cannot link it with any particular activity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all the "solutions" recommended on this thread and other similar ones on this and other forums with no success.</p>
<p>This computer has performed faultlessly for eight years first under VISTA then under WINDOWS 7.&nbsp; Now, under WINDOWS 10, it has become virtually useless.&nbsp; Any activity that needs more than five minutes is simply a non-starter.&nbsp; This is my main computer that
 I use for "serious" tasks (eg. video editing) so this is a major problem for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Failing a resolution, I shall have to take the retrograde step of reverting back to WINDOWS 7 (which I was very happy with) and find a way to prevent Microsoft from stealthily forcing me to "upgrade" to W10 again as they are rumoured to be about do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gathered the three items you need (Minidump, MSinfo32 and computer info via Speccy) and zipped them into a folder that you should find at:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=6063BA5B9F1F92FB!663&amp;authkey=!AMEtFLL3F4O2ZVw&amp;ithint=file%2czip</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to run Speccy, I sometimes get an immediate BSOD with the message PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA (cpuz_x64.sys).</p>
<p>Again, the promised restart does not happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once, and so far only once, I got a BSOD at start up with DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE.&nbsp; This time the promised restart DID happen.&nbsp; ( I don't have a record of this one to send you).&nbsp; I don't know if these BSODs are causally linked to the VIDEO one but I mention
 them anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really do hope that you can resolve this problem for me and for many others who seem to be experiencing it too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Geri Atric.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>I have already tried the actions you suggest and many more also.&nbsp; Over the past two months I must have tried everything reccomended on Microsoft forums and other forums too.</p>
<p>A post earlier in this thread said that you needed the dumps and other info that I mentioned in my post.</p>
<p>I have provided that info and supplied the requested link to it in my post.&nbsp; I had hoped that you would tell me that you have been able to access the dumps and that they were being analysed.&nbsp; Is this so?</p>

<p>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</p>
<p>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</p>

</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)</span></strong></p>
<p><span>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. It will scan your system
 files and to repair missing or corrupted system files in Windows. To run the SFC scan, refer to the Microsoft article below.</span></p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Nvlddmkm.sys is a Windows driver. A driver is a small software program that allows your computer to communicate with hardware or connected devices. This means that a driver has direct access to the internals of the operating

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>2. In the list of devices, you should see the Display Drivers.
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>3. Right click on the device and then select "Uninstall".
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>4. In the uninstall dialog, make sure you select the option to delete the driver package from the system. This causes the driver package installed earlier to be deleted.
</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>5. In the Action menu of Device manager, select “Scan for Hardware changes” option. This will cause the device driver to be reinstalled. Once the driver is installed, close all windows and restart the computer.

<p>I have an external hard drive that I use for backup.&nbsp; I attach it to my system via the USB port&nbsp;and backup my files once a month.&nbsp; As a result I attach and remove the hard drive on a monthly basis.&nbsp; How do I stop the Recycle Bin from being created on the
 external hard drive.&nbsp; I can delete the old Recycle Bin but within 2-3 seconds after the old one is deleted the system creates a new one.&nbsp; I follow the procedure to eject the USB attached drives and not just pull the usb connector.</p>

    <title>Keyboard not working on windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tylerrupe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keyboard not working on windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I doubt it's my actual keyboard considering I've used 3 different ones (2 being USB, 1 being ps2). But What is going on is I was on the internet and was surfing and suddenly my keyboard didn't work. When I pressed the A key, it would "select all" and my
 S key would "save" and my&nbsp;W key would "exit". It seemed like all my keys had been changed to their shortcuts, and none of them would actually type the letter. So&nbsp;I disconnected and tried my keyboard in all of my USB ports, on the back and front of my computer.
 None of them worked, so I decided to shut off, in case&nbsp;I had a virus or something. Now, when I tried to log back on I couldn't start up ( I'm password protected and you can see the problem there) so I couldn't get past the log in screen. But the weird thing
 is, when I tried to type in my password, the delete, space, and underscore keys entered in characters, but none of the letters would enter a character. My dad suspects that my keyboard driver is corrupt, but I don't know how I'm going to access that if I can't
 even log in. Anybody ever had this before or know how to fix it?</p>

            Well technically, my dad made my computer. I tried to click on the ease of access and all it does is "indent" the button, there are no options or anthing, even when I right click. And I tried the "safe mode" startup, and the option isn't even there, all
 it asks is what device I want to boot off of, my hardrive or a disk, so i tried my windows disk, and that did nothing either. there wasn't even a safe mode option.

            Hi,

Try Restart Windows Explorer
This is one simple fix that can help you restore your taskbar to working order. If the problem with the taskbar is not so critical, this method should do the job for you. You won’t need to play or manipulate with other system settings. Here’s what you need to do:
1. Press&nbsp;Windows Key + R&nbsp;combination on your keyboard to launch&nbsp;Run&nbsp;prompt. Enter&nbsp;taskmgr.exe&nbsp;and hit Enter to open&nbsp;Task Manager.
2. Now, under&nbsp;Processes&nbsp;tab, scroll down and look for&nbsp;Windows Explorer&nbsp;over there.
3. Select&nbsp;Windows Explorer&nbsp;and click on&nbsp;Restart&nbsp;button in the bottom right corner.
4. This should simply kill the Windows Explorer process and restart it in a little while.

Check for bad explorer addons
Boot your Windows 10 computer in https://www.thewindowsclub.com/what-is-clean-bo... and try to locate the offender by trial

            Hi Zaid, this is a known issue with DPI scaling in Windows 10 
<br />
<br />Right click your Desktop, choose Desktop Settings 
<br />
<br />What Scale factor is set there 
<br />
<br />Click Custom Scale and adjust your Scale factor 
<br />
<br />Log out and back in to Windows 
<br />
<br />Check to see if this is resolved, if not, adjust the scale factor and log out and in, until you can see all the icons

<h2>            Bitstream DTS reported as 5.1 not 7.1</h2>
                    
<p>I currently have Xbox One connected to a Sony MDR-HW700DS.</p>
<p>The Xbox One is set to output Bitstream in DTS format.</p>
<p>When using that setting the Sony receiver is showing a 5.1 input, &nbsp;If I set the Xbox One to 7.1 uncompressed, it comes up as 7.1.</p>

<p>Yeah, the blu-Ray has up to 11.1 (DTS Neo) on this disc. I'll try another one and see if I get the same issue.</p>

<p>Afaik DTS provides a little bit better audio quality as DD, but I'm not sure if you may hear a difference, when using 7.1</p>

<h3> ciaran1707  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dialogue Boxes, Task Manager and Msconfig has no text in tabs or windows &#40;Windows 7&#41;.  Double click on border does not bring the text back.</h2>
                    <p>When I open the task manager,&nbsp; the File Options View Windows and Help menu options are there as are three blank buttons at the bottom of the window. There is no text content in the main window. I believe this is small footprint mode, and double-clicking
 on the border&nbsp; has no effect.</p>
<p>When i open Msconfig to try and do a clean boot the same happens.</p>
<p>When i open some dialogue boxes, i.e install a new program, they also have no text and are disproportionatly sized, thus disablling my ability to install any new programs or run a virus scan from the main box (i am still able to do this via right click on
 icon).</p>
<p>I have tried safe mode and this has no effect.&nbsp; i have also uninstalled and reinstalled the latest drivers for my onboard graphics card and my NVIDIA card and still no change.</p>
<p>Also, there is sync issue with Windows Media Player when i play videos, which work fine on other players, which i think is related.</p>
<p>My Laptop is 3 months old and had no problems until 7 days ago.</p>
<p>Any ideas?<br />

            <p>To get out of Tiny Footprint mode in Task Manager, you can do the following: </p>
<p>Double-clicking anywhere on the graphs in the performance tab, or the gray sidebar next to the tabs will get you out of Tiny Footprint mode.<br />
<br />
However, I am not sure this is the issue you are experiencing. <br />
<br />
You can try a System Restore point to before this issue was occuring. (7 days ago)<br />
To choose a System Restore point,</p>
<p>Go to Start. Right click on computer. Go to Properties. <br />
On the left hand side, click on System Protection. <br />
Click on System Restore button. Click on Next. <br />
You should see system restore points when changes to your computer were made, I have several for when Windows Updates were installed.
<br />
At the bottom left, put a check mark in "Check more restore points."<br />
You should see more restore points. <br />
Highlight the one you have before you you were having the problem. <br />
Click next. This will confirm the restore point you want to install. </p>
<p>Once you select the restore point, click next, then select finish, this will start the restore process.</p>
<p><br />
If that doesn't help, I would do a virus scan and see if you have malware on your system.
<br />
If you don't have a antivirus, you can download and install Microsoft Security Essentials.
<br />
<br />
Download the free antivirus from the following location:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/security-essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/security-essentials</a></p>
<p><br />
Run System File checker to see if you have any corrupted system files.</p>
<p>Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, right click CMD<br />
Click “Run as Administrator”<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: sfc /scannow</p>
<p>This will check for any integrity violations and fix any corrupted operating system files.</p>
<p>Restart your system.</p>

<h3> tonyhorsak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with AUDIO&#47;VIDEO</h2>
                    <p>Hi:</p>
<p>While making successful SKYPE video communication between USA &amp; Europe (Czech Republic) several times before, this time we are experiencing the following AUDIO/VIDEO problems:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- AUDIO problems: while trouble-shooting no AUDIO, I run the 123Echo test and it failed to record my voice yet - I checked the SKYPE Options settings for AUDIO and my Webcam microphone responds to my voice BUT my party in Europe CAN NOT hear my voice (or
 only sometimes a very weak one), and I could only SOMETIMES hear very distorted voice from the party in Europe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- VIDEO problems: while we both receive video it is frequently distorted.&nbsp; I have checked my SKYPE VIDEO settings and could NOT find any problems with my Logitech Model C615 HD-Webcam camera.</p>
<p>An expeditious advice &amp; help would be greatly appreciated...!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks.</p>

<p>MANY THANKS for your reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My answers to your questions are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Device's OS:&nbsp; WINDOWS Vista, Home Premium<br />
&nbsp;WEBCAM:&nbsp; Logitech HD WEBCAM, Model: C615</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Exact Ver of SKYPE:&nbsp;&nbsp; 7.36.0.150, which was confirmed to me as the MOST UPDATED Version, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Is the issue with a specific contact ONLY:</p>
<p>We did NOT have a chance to confirm it yet - but we will be trying to get connected again at 10 am today so - could you perhaps suggest what to check out OR test on BOTH of our SKYPE/PC systems, please ?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>- on my (in USA) SKYPE/PC system, I run several times the 123ECHO Test it failed each time BUT a very strange thing: I was checking ALL Settings in SKYPE Options re to AUDIO-settings, and tested also the response of my mike in the WEBCAM by talking to it
 and it is PERFECTLY responding to my voice! - BUT the 123ECHO is just telling me that I might have a problem with the mike-recording setting or otherwise...well, it does NOT make any sense because the mike is very responsive to my voice; in addition, my Windows
 sound is ALSO working perfectly while playing back any sound file...!</p>
<p>Re: VIDEO:&nbsp; I also checked all Video settings in the SKYPE Options and could NOT find anything wrong OR even any unusual behavior</p>
<p>THE OTHER party in Europe (Czech Republic) is are engineers educated and are also trying to test-check anything on their system: so far they revealed to me that they've got a system message re some problems with accessing their sound card...wold have perhaps
 any idea what does it mean - or suggest to do ANYTHING about it on THEIR SKYPE/ PC system...?</p>

<p>If these steps don't work, try reinstalling the driver:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open Device Manager, right-click (or tap and hold) the name of the device, and select Uninstall.</li><li>Restart your PC and Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver.</li></ol>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Taskbar search doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>Ever since a couple of days ago the taskbar search stopped working. </p>
<p>I searched online for solutions and found some odd advice.</p>
<p>One of them said to go to control panel and use the native trouble shooter..How can I do that when the search bar doesn't work!😭😂 (I use the search bar to go to the control panel and do pretty much everything)</p>
<p>The other person said to kill the Cortana process but I don't have that installed (or enabled) since I live in Greece.</p>

    <title>Using GetWindowLongPtr function to retrieve handle to an application - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ajithkm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using GetWindowLongPtr function to retrieve handle to an application</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the following line to get the handle for my application window from windProc</p>
<p>
</p><p>HINSTANCE appHandle=GetWindowLongPtr(hWnd,GWLP_HINSTANCE);</p>
<p>
</p><p>which promptly returned an error saying that "a value of type long cannot be used to initialize an entity of type HINSTANCE". But when I used HINSTANCE word as a return type, it ended up being fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HINSTANCE appHandle=(HINSTANCE)GetWindowLongPtr(hWnd,GWLP_HINSTANCE);</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the return value is being modified when I do that. But I am interested as to why I have to do this exclusively. Isn't HINSTANCE a type of long_ptr? Actually the same thing happened earlier when I tried to assign GetStockBrush function to app.hbrBackground.
 It forced to specify return type as HBRUSH.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have a mac running the latest os 10.14.3, I also have Skype for Business, Skype and the Skype Meetings app. When I click on a calendar invite it opens chrome and then asks me if I want to download the app again. Every time! I must have installed it 30
 times. Why can't it see it's already installed? I try to paste the meeting invite into the Skype Meetings app and it just hangs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 volume warning -- how do I turn it back on&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maharetr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 volume warning -- how do I turn it back on&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I have the opposite problem to most people, it seems! I have a HP laptop running Windows 10 Home using the presumably preinstalled Realtek high definition audio, and I don't think I've ever seen the volume warning that people want to turn off -- I'd like
 to turn it back on (or turn it on in the first place, whichever), and ideally, to be able to adjust it lower than its probably set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If it's the OSD (on screen display) for Volume in top left corner see here for how to turn it off or on, including installing a small utility that will let you toggle it back on:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/269011/how-to-hide-the-volume-pop-up-display-on-windows-8-and-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/269011/how-to-hide-th...</a>
<br />
<br />If it's the HP on screen display then your model PC may have a special driver to do this on the Support Downloads web page to update or install:  <a href="http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.hp.com/us-en/drivers</a>
<br />
<br />See also this HP resource:  <a href="https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Video-Display-and-Touch/Volume-Bar-on-the-screen/td-p/1100711" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Video-Di...</a>

<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hah, sorry, looks like I phrased the question badly. I don't have the below message, and I want it. Ideally, I'd like to be able to set the sound warning/blocker at about 6, because I use headphones all the times, and wow is anything above that loud.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://superuser.com/questions/991638/how-to-disable-high-volume-warning-dialog -- this person wants the message/lock to go away. I want it to come back/never had it in the first place, I don't think, and I want it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used Sound Lock to reasonable effect for a while, until it stopped working for some reason.</p>

            The article seems to say this is only an issue with Samsung PC's.  I've never heard of it on HP, or at all, so it may only affect Samsung.  What makes you think it might be available as a feature missing on your HP?  
<br />
<br />In any case these are almost always controlled by a driver, so I'd scour the list on the HP Support Downloads webpage for WIndows 10 and 8.1 to see if any of them control this.  There are clues in the HP articles I linked.  You can also post in the HP web forums which is pretty good and have experts who deal exclusively with HP.

    <title>&#34;No bootable partition in table&#34; on Windows 7 w&#47;BitLocker - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ahmd0  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;No bootable partition in table&#34; on Windows 7 w&#47;BitLocker installed</h2>
                    I was upgrading my desktop to a new SSD drive. I first unplugged my old HDD, then plugged in new SSD (and later installed Windows 8 on it.)<br />
<br />
So now I am trying to go back to my old HDD with Windows 7 installed on it. When I plugged it back in, during booting I get this message:<br />
<br />
"No bootable partition in table"<br />
<br />
I haven't done anything with this drive. It's been unplugged all the time. How can it not have a bootable partition?<br />
<br />
PS. The HDD in question is encrypted with the BitLocker that reads the key off of my USB drive.<br />
<br />
FOLLOW-UP: I just tried to boot up without the USB flash drive that I use to unlock BitLocker on that HDD and manually typed in the 192-bit key and it booted up just fine. So why doesn;t it boot with that USB flash drive?<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From the issue description I understand that you have issues with booting Windows 7 from HDD.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Computers today are capable to boot from numerous devices including CD/DVD drive and Flash Drive/USB devices apart
 from HDD. If your computer tries to boot from flash drive / disc without any master boot record, it will throw this error message.
</span></p>
<p><span>Try to remove any USB devices and CD/DVD from your PC. Try to make sure the boot sequence point to your HDD first
 in BIOS setting. </span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>Remove any USB devices that are connected to the computer and check the boot sequence. Keep Windows 7 as first
 boot drive, then Windows 8 SSD and at last USB devices.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><u><span>BIOS Disclaimer:</span></u></b></p>
<p><span>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that
 may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Keep us posted if you face any issues related to Windows in future. We will be glad to help you.</span></p>

Is there anyway you can test the keyboard on a different computer?&nbsp; At this point we don't know if the keyboard is even functioning or not.&nbsp; You said it has no lights on it at all - not even for the caps lock, num lock, and scroll lock?&nbsp; There should be some
 kind of lights on the&nbsp;receiver for these functions&nbsp;and if those are not working then the keyboard is most likely defective.<br />
<br />
Here is a link to an article that has some good troubleshooting steps for wireless keyboards, including how to re-synchronize it with the computer.<br />
The Microsoft wireless keyboard or mouse does not respond as expected or responds intermittently<br />
