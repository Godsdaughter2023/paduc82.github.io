<h2>            Icons Disappeared on Windows 7</h2>
                    I need help. I don't know what happened, I left my computer alone for a second then came back and all my icons disappeared from my desktop. &nbsp;I tried the "check" to show icons under preferences, but that doesn't work! I've looked online through here at
 similar situations..and none work....I don't know what to do. I have a Windows 7 by the way.

    <title>Win 10 mounting multiple ISO files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> p3dja  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 mounting multiple ISO files</h2>
                    <p>Is there anyway that we can mount multiple ISO files to a virtual image drive without auto changing of drive letters? I had to mount second ISO, eject the first one and open Disk Management to change back a drive letter, only then I was able to continue
 installation from another image file. Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can only mount ISO files one at a time. Multiple ISO files mounted at the same time may cause issues on your PC. Why? Because multiple mounted ISOs could mix its data, creating a buggy system code that could lead to system failures.</p>

<p>Sorry, maybe I was not clear enough or the title is unclear...I am mounting ISO's one by one, when I get a message "please insert disk 2 in E:/" and I mount second ISO it mounts on another virtual drive (which has another drive letter), to be able to continue
 installation I have to change drive letter "manually" in Disk Management.</p>

<p>Have you tried ejecting or unmounting the first disk before mounting the second disk? If you are mounting the second disk while the first disk is still mounted, the second disk will be assigned a different drive letter.</p>

            Yes, I have dismounted the first ISO before mounting the second one, and it mounted on other drive (it follows letters alphabetically, if the 1st was mounted on E: the second one will mount on F: etc.). These ISO's are 2 installation discs for a single
 application and they have to be mounted in correct order for installation to complete. I don't know if I'm going to be able to turn on Cortana, I think it doesn't work for my region, but I will try. I was able to continue the process by changing the drive
 letter in disk management, as I sad before, so there is a workaround. Thanks for the help anyway.

 that I have use for years with no problem. Probably related to the cloud coordinating my Mac and phone. It seems I have opened a new account under the same e-mail.</p>
<p>HOW DO I GET MY OLD ACCOUNT AND CONTACTS BACK? It would be a major task to get back all those contact numbers, etc. I would like credit for the $ I have with Skype. Somehow , my password did not work and now I am confused as to which one to use.</p>

    <title>Small tablet use is clumsy - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scottjkelly  say:</h3>
<h2>            Small tablet use is clumsy</h2>
                    I have a 7 inch tablet, and I have found that most of the dialog boxes (both for 8.1 as well as 100) are rather too small for a finger or a stylus. Take the Disk Cleanup application, for example, or the file manager.<br />
<br />
I'm wondering if MS is aware of this and has plans to make improvements, or should I make use of the Ease of Access features?

How does one 'right click' on a tablet?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I know about the display settings, but it's not a fix. While there is an increase in size in the top level menus, it has no effect elsewhere.<br />
Window controls, menu dropdowns, etc. are VERY difficult to use, even with a stylus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember, this is a 7 inch tablet.</p>

            <p>I don't mean to be rude, but your post is one of many I have seen where the idea your answer seems pretty logical, but the steps describe do not reflect what is happening on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First off the person mentioned this a tablet.&nbsp; That most likely implies that they are in tablet mode.&nbsp; And as such they can't right click on the Desktop even if they somehow had a mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's more even if they switch out a tablet mode (to desktop mode) and have a mouse and right click on the Desktop they will not find a
<strong>Graphics properties</strong>.&nbsp; They would be looking for <strong>Display settings</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You/Microsoft really needs to update your focus to switch to instructions that actually apply to Windows 10 instead of how it might have been done on a previous version of Windows.</p>

            <p>I don't think I have a "good" answer for your problem, but I will try to give some pointers on this and my opinion on others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First off if you lower your resolution like was suggested everything on the screen is going to get bigger.&nbsp; This might fix your current problem at the cost of causing all kinds of problems with scrolling and such.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you are facing is the mix of old and new.&nbsp; Windows 8/8.1/10 all support both the older "desktop applications", and the newer "store" or "universal" apps as Microsoft is now calling them.&nbsp; The desktop interface was designed for using a mouse, and the
 store/universal with touch.&nbsp; The result is that desktop applications will have things on them that are really too small for fingers, and I guess on your screen even too small for a stylus.&nbsp; Where as a desktop user on the other hand usually finds the "universal"
 apps to be "large" and "simple" because they don't have the room to put in all the extra options you might find on a desktop application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now there are a number of ways to make the desktop applications larger (but most will make the "universal" apps bigger too).</p>
<p>The one that was suggested was to lower the resolution.&nbsp; This is basically telling the hardware to use less pixels on the screen, so that each pixel is larger.</p>
<p>To get to the setting:</p>
<p>Select the Action Center icon near the clock -&gt; All Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Display -&gt; Advanced display settings -&gt; select a lower Resolution and then -&gt; Apply</p>
<p>Everything will be larger.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another way to go at this is to tell Windows to scale the display up (make everything bigger).</p>
<p>All Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Display -&gt; Slide the setting under "Change the size of text, apps, ..." to the right, and select Apply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If none of this works for you, you will most likely have to use the Magnifier.</p>
<p>You can do a search for it and pin it to your Start Screen.</p>
<p>When you click on it, it magnifies the screen.&nbsp; When you close it, it goes back to normal size.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for when Microsoft will change all of this, that is anyone's guess, but if indications are right they do seem to be pushing towards using the universal apps for everything.&nbsp; Which will not please a lot of desktop/mouse users.&nbsp; But there is whole lot of
 applications that are core to Windows that are desktop applications, and as such my prediction would be it would be years before most of these are changed over.</p>

<h3> marylander72  say:</h3>
<h2>            Window 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p><br />
</p>
<p>Starting January 15, 2018 Microsoft send message about updating my Window 10. I did try to download the update the message said that downloading failed. I tried to delete the message because it was running around the circle, downloading
 continuously even when I click to hid it after a minute it was coming back in cover my screen. I could not remove it of down load it.</p>
<p>With difficulties I could talk to technician ,Sania. I explain the problem that Microsoft created for me, I asked her since the downloading this version can't be done I like this message to be removed fro my screen and leave me
 alone. She got control of my computer and worked on it for two hours and didn't resolve the problem. She give me cas# 1412778718. She said a higher level tech, was going to call me Jan, 26 8:00 AM to 10:AM. ( 3 days later)..</p>
<p>Jan, 26 Tech, called and got controlled of my computer. He was working on it till 3:00PM(4 hrs) He said that W10 Upgraded could not be done till HP changes something therefore he put back the previous version. I said fine give me
 my computer the way it was. He wanted the computer be connected to router with cable. When I disconnect the cable the computer disconnected fro router. He. Put me on hold said he will fix the problem. I was watching him was working till 4:05 PM(after 5:20m),
 He left me without saying anything while he was controlling and accessing my computer. Two hrs later I call service and holding the phone for some time, A tech. Said she will fix the problem. She got control on my computer and was doing different things and
 she diapered without saying some something.</p>
<p>The problem is not fix, still the Message covering my screen and downloading continuously, the added another problems, connection to router and the change the Delete. Key.</p>
<p>I don't have to explain the frustration and disappointment and feeling of helplessness I have. Microsoft is big and powerful and the people can't demand the company be responsible for what they do. Do I deserve to spend that much
 time for the problem that I didn't created . MS even added more problem to my computer&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

            Hi Marylander.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />We will get this sorted out for you so that it improves your system and not impairs it.  If it turns out that Fall Creators Update Version 1709 actually won't install or run well on your System then we will help you hide it so it doesn't push itself any further. 
<br />
<br />What I would first do if you haven't yet is try to manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by installing Media Creation Tool and choosing to Upgrade Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  
<br />
<br />This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have.    
<br />
<br />You can use the same tool to download the ISO or create bootable media so you only need to do it once, and have the bootable media for repairs or possible Clean Install.   
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during the Upgrade see these steps to optimize the install as this is evidence it's corrupted: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />If the Upgrade fails after trying all the preliminary steps then I would roll it back and hide it using the Hide Updates tool.  Install the Hide Updates tool and immediately run it to Check for Updates and hide Version 1709 Feature Update.  If it slips by again I will give you steps to halt it so you can hide it successfully.  
<br />
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

<h2>            Cortana doesn&#39;t work in a foreign country</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just upgraded to Windows 10 Professionnal, but I face some problems with Cortana. I'm french but living in China for some months (sorry to post here, but I get no answers on the french Microsoft forum). My laptop was bought in France and every setting
 is in french, and Cortana is activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that she doesn't understand when I speak/write in french. Everything is written in french in Cortana (notebook, weather forecast, settings, she says "hello Christophe" in french, etc...), but when I speak/write in french to her&nbsp;she just opens
 a bing search with my words (for example "Hey Cortana, open a Word file", she opens bing with "Open a Word file" in the search box). I've even used the option to let her learn my voice and she speaks in french and understands what I'm saying. At first I tried
 to turn her OFF and ON and to reboot the laptop, but it didn't worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, I've tried to write in chinese to her and she understands, I have the let's talk option, she replies to me in chinese,&nbsp;she works fine ! But I'm bad in chinese and, as my whole Windows settings are in french, couldn't she understand french or am I forced
 to use some kind of VPN to fake being in France ? If not, I will practice my chinese with her...</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, maybe another issue that I face can be related : I can't access to Skype (either my Skype account nor my Windows account works)/Windows Store (error 0x80072EFD). Even Romstation (Software for retro-gaming) or&nbsp;Steam&nbsp;can't access to the internet. I can
 access to the internet as usual with other softwares, except that I'm facing&nbsp;some strange behaviors&nbsp;with my browsers. In China, we can't access to Google websites or social medias, but :</p>
<p>- Firefox and Google Chrome are able to access to the websites that are normally blocked (Facebook, my gmail account, YouTube, etc...), but cannot access the "normal" websites (nearly the entire internet so.....).</p>
<p>- Microsoft Edge works normally, normal browsing with bing and the restricted websites are blocked as it should be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, sorry for the long post, I'm not sure that the internet problems can be related to Cortana's problem, but I thought that it could be, with some sort of french Windows/chinese location issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for help ! =)</p>

            <p>Thank you for your help !</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked and all parameters are aligned : Country set to France, Windows display language set to french (but below it, there was "search of Windows update" with chinese, I've deleted it but Cortana hasn't changed, and the speech language is set to french.
 I've also found "Manage the optional features" (in Settings &gt; System &gt; Applications and features &gt; Manage the optional features), and there is only two Cortana feeatures, both set to french.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I must say that, when I open for example Firefox, my homepage is google.fr, but on edge when I use bing.com, this page shows up in chinese. Maybe, as Cortana works in relationship with Bing, she uses the language bing is displayed is my browser ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Concerning the proxy, I did what you told to me, but there is no proxy connection right now.</p>

This has always been this way. As it has not been fixed for months and there is no official answer to this very obvious issue, I guess it is not a mistake but somehow related to the infinit stupidity of the&nbsp;Great Freedom Party of China (if you know what I mean...),
 as 95% of Internet issues in the country. Sad.

<p>
</p><p>Your problem was between French and Chinese whereas mine is English and Chinese. The best part is, Cortana only understands what I say if I use English, and yet cannot reply and only translates in Bing with Chinese responses. Unless I switch the full thing
 to Chinese and then she can both understand and reply in Chinese.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try asking her if she's American, she will reply she is born in China. Oh Microsoft you dirty scoundrels~<br />

            Install them as you did before... If you did not install them, but they came pre-installed on the system per your OEM (reseller) - contact them for support on getting the applications they installed pre-sales back onto the system they sold you (restore
 it to factory defaults.)

<p>In my experience, it doesn't normally do this.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>It MAY do this when upgrading from a prior OS, maybe even when going to the next major build (although I have not witnessed the latter) - but in those cases it tells you what applications will be removed because they are incompatible and it can/does save
 that list to the desktop of the upgrading user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what exactly did you initiate (from what to what) and what did you see happen and specifically what was removed?</p>

            What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Cameras
<br />Right click the camera, then click Uninstall
<br />
<br />Note: If you don't see it under cameras, look under Imaging devices. 
<br />
<br />Exit device manager then restart.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 should redetect it then reinstall it.
<br />
<br />Check if the camera is working again.
<br />
<br />If you have a third party Antivirus utility installed, please remove it.
<br />Also check the manufacturers website for updated driver. 
<br />
<br />If its an external web cam and you have it plugged into a USB Hub, that will not work. You need to plug your web cam directly into the USB port on your system unit. USB hubs are not necessarily powerful enough to power devices like web cams.

<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Open the app and if you have chatted or called, all will be listed on the left side. You can show that to your wife to prove that you didn't use or used that. 
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

<br />
<br />You can tell your wife that Skype gets automatically installed with Windows updates and also with some versions of Microsoft Office, this is not something you did . . .
<br />
<br />Log into: <a href="https://web.skype.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://web.skype.com/</a>
<br />
<br />On the left will be a list of contacts (if any)
<br />
<br />If you click those contacts, you will see any activity between those contacts and yourself and also the date and time that interaction took place

    <title>Remove Region Lock XBOX GAME PASS for PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> halbarz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remove Region Lock XBOX GAME PASS for PC</h2>
                    <p>Why region lock Xbox Game Pass for PC?? Microsoft is one of the few companies that doesn't want our money.&nbsp;<br />
Nintendo joined the club late and still managed to provide Nintendo Online almost globally. Microsoft&nbsp; (with Xbox live)... 30 countries ... 0 added in the last 4 years.<br />
<br />
While it might be more difficult to provide actual Xbox live in a country, a PC based service isn't and locking it is just ridiculous.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Why region lock Xbox Game Pass for PC?? Microsoft is one of the few companies that doesn't want our money.&nbsp;<br />
Nintendo joined the club late and still managed to provide Nintendo Online almost globally. Microsoft&nbsp; (with Xbox live)... 30 countries ... 0 added in the last 4 years.<br />

While it might be more difficult to provide actual Xbox live in a country, a PC based service isn't and locking it is just ridiculous.&nbsp;</p>

            There are global issues with supporting the international market.&nbsp; Sometimes the laws of local regions present a problem for businesses.&nbsp; Many times the region itself will want a piece of the pie, so to speak, where it makes it less than cost effective

<h2>            Want to know how to auto open a program to the second monitor I extended from my monitor. </h2>
                    I have used many third party software but wondered if microsoft xp has the software to do it. I just want to open windows media player always on the extended monitor I connected to my laptop. I have a ATI video card which I use with Hydravision but since
 the monitor is not a seperate desktop I cant point it as desktop number 2. Anyone could help that'll be great. I want to make sure when I reboot the program windows media player always open on the second monitor.

<br />
<br />
<p><span style="font-style: italic">Yes, they can, and should be, deleted periodically.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">The temp folder provides workspace for programs. Programs can create temporary files there for their own temporary use. Each program should delete all its temporary
 files when it closes, but for various reasons it doesn't always happen (for example, if the program crashes, it never gets to do this). That's why it's a good idea to periodically clean out anything left there.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">Also note that there are some program installations which work in two steps. The first step concludes by writing temporary files and rebooting. The second step starts
 automatically after rebooting and needs to find those files there (and then deletes them when it's done).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic">Other than doing it automatically when rebooting (that would interfere with installations like the kind I described), it's always safe to delete the contents of the
 temp folder. Because it's safe to delete any temp files that aren't open and in use by an application, and since Windows won't let you delete open files, it's safe to (try to) delete them at any time. If any fail to delete because they're open, they'll either
 be deleted automatically when the app using them closes, or you'll get them the next time you delete manually.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I have just updates my sp3 and everything is good except an annoying graphical bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In a random fashion, graphical elements in modern apps or on the start menu start to dim progressively including text.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This impacts the tiles on the start menu, but in apps, such as the Facebook app, they are grey rectangles at strange places&lt; those grey rectangle di; to black and hides content of the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not the only modern app experiencing those problems, I experience this strange behaviour on the favourites menu in Edge took where Amorites are liste but not visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My theme is dark in windows and edge.</p>

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hello! I am running Windows 8.1. &nbsp;And before, I had absolutely 0 problems with it, when I had a Windows 7 computer. &nbsp;And now, for some odd reasons some maps ABSOLUTELY refuse to load. They will get past the D in "LOADING," and absolutely stop.
 I tested this, and it stayed frozen for one hour.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I Alt Tabbed, to find out that the game seems to have... Well... Stopped responding. &nbsp;This has been a problem, for a week. The maps I am playing are not broken, or bugged. They download correctly, so I know for a fact it's not the maps, but
 the computer... Anyone out there have similar problems?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>&nbsp; If anyone can help me, thank youuuu!</div>

            <p>Not sure if you got it fixed? &nbsp;Anyway, I've had the same issue as you (with Windows 8.1) and accidentally found a solution to the problem. &nbsp;I've tried a different copy of the game (One I copied to a USB from a friend) and found an application "War3 Screen
 Resolution". &nbsp;The copied version of the game gave me the exact same error on my PC but worked on my friend's. &nbsp;I've simply ran it as administrator, without any compatibility mode, and chose the Frozen Throne icon....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't know if it will work for you but it's worth a try:&nbsp;http://blog.obelisk.ro/2010/09/wide-display-resolution-fix-for.html</p>

<h2>            Xbox ONE&#58; Can you get Day One DLCs from Disc preorders with digital download versions&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi! I did not preorder physical disc based copies of the games I want to buy on Day One because I don't like swapping discs the whole time and prefer digital versions.<br />
But some games like Forza or Ryse have Day One editions with bonus content (DLC), can you get them with your digital day one purchases too? Or is it possible to buy them like a normal DLC on day one? Would be sad to not be able to get them with digital copies
 on day one, you pay the same price but get less. :-/&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
Microsoft has stated that you will be able to get preorder items with digital games for 2 weeks after they are released. That means that purchasing these games digitally within the first 2 weeks will also net you the "Day One" preorder bonus's for those games.<br />
<br />
You essentially miss out on absolutely nothing. The only time you'd miss out on something is if there's a specific retailer that has preordered items separate from what comes inside the box, or if there's some sort of statue or physical collectable apart of
 the preorder bonus in store. Other than that, you're all set for all digital.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you very much!</p>
<p>Now the only thing I don't know is if I will be able to download Dead Rising 3 which will not be released in Germany. Is it possible to download it anyways (or from Austrian marketplace) because I heard there is no region lock and it should not be in the
 store (on reddit /r/xboxone).</p>

<p>There will still be regional differences in terms of what's offered in a specific country/region. All because the console is region free does not mean that the downloadable content is region free as well. If something is restricted to your country/region
 and you change your account region to another region that has the game available you may not be able to download it unless you are physically located in that region.<br />
<br />
For games that are not allowed in your country, you may need to play them using the retail disc. As with the Xbox 360 there's still no knowing what items will or won't be region locked on the Xbox LIVE marketplace. This is why it's best to stick with your country/region's
 LIVE marketplace.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Shattered Blue Screen</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I used to experience Blue Screen with WHEA_UNCONTROLLABLE_ERROR in certain games like FO4, COD WII, Watch Dogs for a veery long time now.
</p>
<p>Today I installed PUBG and it gave me following shattered/distorted Blue Screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ace0831d-9626-4c62-8403-07c96287f620?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ace0831d-9626-4c62-8403-07c96287f620?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>then just in order to get a "normal" bluescreen I started Watch Dogs and I got similar bluescreen like you see in the picture above.</p>
<p>it stays for a while and PC restarts into the BIOS.</p>
<p>you will probably ask me to upload MEMORY.DMP but since it will take for a long time, for now I will just leave the WinDbg analyse text here with the hopes that it is enough to diagnose my problem. Once I finish to upload the dump file I will give the link.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Checked the temperature values, no overheat.</p>
<p>no Over Clock on any module</p>
<p>memtest86+ run for a night long with 8 passes and zero errors (checked it like a couple of weeks ago)</p>
<p>drivers are up to date</p>
<p>bios up to date</p>
<p>I freshly reinstalled windows 2 times. nothing changed.</p>

</p><p>PS: maybe it is related or maybe not but I have an unknown problem on my pc that makes it turn off once in every single day since the day I built the PC. it turns off instantly as if there is an instantaneous electrical outage. it turns off and I can turn
 it on again in no time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Please share the minidump which is of small size and easier to upload.
<br />We need log files(called dump files) that tell us what lead to the crash.
<br />Please share them with us for a better analysis of the problem. Instructions can be found here:

            The dump blames something related to the processor. 
<br />Do these 2 tests:
