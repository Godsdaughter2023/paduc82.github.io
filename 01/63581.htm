<p>I went to: Control panel, device manager, batteries, Microsoft Compliant Control Method Battery,</p>
<p>(drivers), (two?) are listed: &nbsp;C:\WINDOWS\system32\DRIVERS\battc.sys</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;C:\WINDOWS\system32\DRIVERS\CmBatt.sys</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same two drivers are listed under &nbsp;device manager, batteries, Microsoft ac adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure if this is the info you need, but is the only refrence to the battery system I can find.</p>
<p>Thank you! for your help with this, very much appreciated!</p>

For your Lenovo P500 laptop, there are three possible power management software that came pre-loaded with your device:
<strong>Lenovo Energy Management</strong>, <strong>Lenovo Power Manager</strong>, or
<strong>OneKey Optimizer</strong>. There should be an icon on your system tray to launch the power management software currently installed in your Windows 10 device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an alternative, you can download <strong>Lenovo Settings </strong>which is available for free from the Windows store and follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open <strong>Lenovo Settings</strong>.</li><li>Select the <strong>energy management</strong> icon.</li><li>Set <strong>Conservation mode</strong> as <strong>Off</strong>.</li><li>With AC adapter plugged in, the battery level will keep increasing.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the suggestion above doesn't work, feel free to post back so we can further troubleshoot.</p>

                    <p>Hello everyone. I have a Surface Pro 4 with the Windows Insider Programme (slow) latest update on. While restarting my devise, the error screen 0xc0210000 comes up. I do everything it tells me to do. When I press Windows key, it comes up with another recovery
 screen this time saying to press the Windows key to use a different operating system. Then it comes up with the BitLocker recovery screen. I enter my BitLocker code &amp; it restarts &amp; goes back to that original screen. It worked once, but I Accidentally turned
 off the computer in the recovery options screen. I am also fine with reading my computer &amp; putting a fresh Windows 10 on it. So long as I don't lose my copy of Windows 10 Pro. Thank you for reading. I really need help with this because Microsoft Windows Technical
 Support couldn't help me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for reading.&nbsp;</p>

<br />Open the Store
<br />Tap or click the user icon on top, next to the search form

<br />I would suggest you to completely remove the game and its shortcuts from your system and then open Windows Store and install the Game again . Before re-installing, remove all the files related to the game from your system.

            <p>The problem is not about the computer or Windows being unable to start. It is with speciifc applications that call on this graphs32.ocx file that is causing the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing I tried was to copy it off another laptop and paste it over the current version thought to be corrupted. That didn't work. I this graphs32.ocx&nbsp; - something that is tied to Registry?</p>
<p>I tried reinstalling the two programs that exhibit this problem. That didn't work either.</p>

<h2>            Bought wrong region First strike map pack because the market wasn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t giving any other options</h2>
                    
<p><span>So, yesterday i went to a Gamestop shop and bought a 800 and a 2100 Microsoft Points to buy Minecraft Xbox 360 Edition and buy 2 black ops map packs because they had a 50% off. I bought Annihilation DLC and First Strike. After i connected to Xbox Live
 and redeemed my codes i went to Games section and saw the Black Ops special offer, went on it and selected the First Strike Map pack, i didn't pay attention, i tought: Being on a italian account i should get only italian DLCs, but i was wrong. The special
 offer gave me a EN region map pack and it didn't update to my region so i downloaded the DLC with wrong region (Mine is IT). The Annihilation map pack was downloaded correctly in IT because i searched it on the market instead of buying it from that special
 offer announcement. They downloaded correctly but when i entered in Black Ops i got a error message (you are trying to run a different region content). The annihilation map pack was working but the First Strike map pack wasn't because it has wrong region (EN
 while i need IT). I don't think it's my fault, Xbox gave an offer that was available only for the users that have a EN version of the game so now i got a DLC i cannot use and i wasted my points on it. I have downloaded other DLCs and never had this problem
 just now that the 50% off the DLC packs for Black Ops was added. I'm wondering if i could get my First Strike map pack in the correct region so i can use it.&nbsp;</span></p>

            HI Reg Fellow!
<br />
<br />Let’s run through some items to try to fix Edge. 
<br />
<br />1. Click start and type troubleshoot - then launch the troubleshooter. Choose windows store apps and run the troubleshooter. See if it detects and fixes any problems with edge. 
<br />
<br />2. Reset Edge. Click start - settings - apps - find Edge on the list. Click on it, and then advanced, terminate, then hit reset. See if that if works. 
<br />
<br />3. Uninstall/Reinstall Edge
<br />
<br />There is a great tutorial here:
<br /><a href="https://www.intowindows.com/how-to-reinstall-microsoft-edge-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.intowindows.com/how-to-reinstall-mi...</a>

            Hello. 
<br />
<br />A fix would be to go into the parent account &gt; click family &gt; under the account you need to add edge as an allowed program . If you have other accounts, add them to the allowed list as well.       
        </p>

            Also I have seen this fix work too: 
<br />
<br />
<br />Disable the scheduled tasks: \Microsoft\Windows\Shell\FamilySafety&lt;Monitor/Refresh&gt;
<br />
<br /><a href="http://i.imgur.com/YLB9APc.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/YLB9APc.png</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Then end the WpcMon.exe process in task manager. It shouldn't start again and filtering should be disabled.

            Charlie - Thanks for the recommendations. I attempted # 3 a few days ago to no avail. I just tried # 1 &amp; 2 and they didn't fix the issue either. I restarted after each attempt. This is the only PC that it prevents my wife's account from using Microsoft
 Edge. Everyone else who uses this PC can open Edge without any issues.&nbsp;

<p>Zackary, thanks for your replies. When I view under my wife's account in the family settings, the only option is to change it between Administrator and Standard account type. Her account is listed as an adult, not child. Even when I view these settings online,
 she is listed as an adult... so I can't modify apps for her account. Her account on every other PC opens Edge just fine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you all for your recommendations. It appears that I have resolved the issue. Here was what fixed it. I changed my wife's account type from Standard to Administrator. It works after that. As a test, I switched it back to Standard and she couldn't open
 Edge anymore. Changed it back to Administrator, and she can open Edge.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't understand why the account type should get confused with the family safety settings, since her account is labeled as an adult account. But this work-around seems to work.&nbsp;</p>

            I just read your update, changing the profile from standard to the admin was the fix huh? Curious, but I’ll make note of it. 
<br />
<br />Great work troubleshooting!

<br />Have yourself a great start to your week, and please leave a positive review if possible!

<h2>            Windows Defender error 0x800106ba and right click File Explorer crashing</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: A couple weird issues after clean install </p>
<p>
</p><p>So hey, I have a pretty weird problem here:</p>
<p>It is related to Windows Explorer crashing when I right-click files and also every time I boot up my antivirus (Windows Defender) it is being reported as "not turned on" in the Action Center. When I try to fix it I get the following error code:
<strong>0x800106ba</strong></p>
<p>I already tried Googling this and it turned up something about faulty .dll's which I tried to work out through the Command Prompt in order to sort of "reload" the different .dll's that might be causing the problem - only two reported back that they were
 succesful in this, the rest came back with errors as being unable to be fixed. I also tried formatting and doing a clean install of Windows 8, updated to the most recent version all the way through the 8.1 upgrade and everything. I should mention that the
 problem started when I reached the most recent update version. Also, before I formatted I was running Panda Cloud Antivirus and not using Windows Defender. During that "error-session" I was equally restricted from launching Panda Cloud and scanning. I did
 however scan the entire PC with Malwarebytes, found three supposed Trojans and removed these, but since it didn't change anything I simply formatted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I'm pretty empty for possible solutions to the problem. I haven't installed any new programs recently, it just sort of happened. Or maybe if my new Apple Airport Express router counts as a change, it happened only a day after I installed one such
 instead of the old router. I did install the setup wizard software but after the format I haven't reinstalled that program and yet it persists killing explorer.exe, also I sometimes can't reach the Start menu screen and the computer will have lost all memory
 of the "remember Wifi password" ticked box when I log onto the network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that's all I've experienced so far, so to me it seems like multiple problems in the wifi forgetting the password, explorer failing miserably and also Start being either unreachable or impossible to exit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas? : /</p>

            <p>Hi Sebastian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>File Explorer might crash while working on files and folder due to third party application or services running on the computer. It might have also happened that the antivirus (Panda security) is not uninstalled properly.&nbsp; So, it acts as a conflict with Windows
 Defender. Hence, you receive an error saying “Defender isn’t turned on”.</p>
<ol>
<li>Did you try registering the .dll files using administrator mode?</li><li>Is there any third party application such as Autodesk Inventor installed on the computer?</li></ol>
<p>If you haven't register the .dll files in admin mode, then, files may fail to register.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, let’s carry out the <strong>troubleshooting steps related to Windows Defender.</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to register these many files which are related to Windows Defender and check if it fixes the issue:</p>
<p>Check if Windows Defender service is started and is running in Automatic mode:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press <strong>Windows+R</strong> keys and type <strong>services.msc</strong>. Hit
<strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Locate <strong>Windows Defender</strong> service and right click on it. Select
<strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Set the startup type to <strong>Automatic</strong> and ensure that the service status is started.</li><li>Click on <strong>OK</strong>. </li></ul>
<p>If the service is up and running, let’s proceed further. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the steps to re-register all the <strong>.dll</strong> files related to Windows Defender:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press <strong>Windows+X</strong> keys and select <strong>Command Prompt (admin).</strong></li><li>Type the following commands and hit <strong>Enter</strong> after each one of them:</li><li><strong>regsvr32 wuaueng.dll</strong></li><li><strong>regsvr32 wucltui.dll</strong></li><li><strong>regsvr32 softpub.dll</strong></li><li><strong>regsvr32 wintrust.dll</strong></li><li><strong>regsvr32 initpki.dll</strong></li><li><strong>regsvr32 wups.dll</strong></li><li><strong>regsvr32 wuweb.dll</strong></li><li><strong>regsvr32 atl.dll</strong></li><li><strong>regsvr32 mssip32.dll</strong></li><li>Restart and see if it has helped you.</li></ul>
<p>Also, if you haven't uninstalled Panda security software, try disabling the security software and check if Windows Defender service is able to start.
</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Important Note:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Security software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you
 have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>For File Explorer crashing when you right click, follow the steps provided below:</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Let’s troubleshoot the issue in a clean boot state and check if a third party application or service is causing the File Explorer to crash:
</p>
<p>Refer to the link to place the computer in a clean boot state:</p>
<p>Refer to the section “<strong>Windows 8</strong>”</p>
<p>You can refer to the section “<strong>How to determine what is causing the problem by performing a clean boot</strong>” to check for the application or program that is causing this issue:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Please refer to the section<strong>: How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot
</strong>of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Let’s run SFC scan and check if it finds and fixes corrupt system files.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>Refer to the link to run SFC scan:</p>
<p>Follow the steps from section "<strong>Windows 8.1 or Windows 8</strong>":</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833/en-us</a><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>There are scenarios when Autodesk Inventor application has caused File Explorer to crash.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know about the results. We will be glad to assist you further. </p>

            <p>Hi, thanks for the quick response,</p>
<p>I've tried your methods and found the following:</p>
<p>Most of the .dll files did load successfully except for three of them, I restarted and the problem persisted. Next I tried running the SFC scan and got the result that some files were corrupted but unrepairable by the scan. I don't know what to look for
 in the extremely detailed log file so I've <a href="https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=78456652BBC6E971!4954&amp;authkey=!ACvNbXcjx_yQdEo&amp;ithint=file%2c.log" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
uploaded it</a> in the hopes that you might know what to look for?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll be trying out the clean boot option tomorrow but wanted to share this result instantly as it seems like it might have something to do with the problem. Thanks for your help so far :)</p>

            <p>Ok hey again,</p>
<p>Now I'm getting worried... I both managed to check the Clean Boot option and Explorer still crashes, Defender won't start etc., I also tried running the SFC scan again in this mode for good measure, but it still left me with "corrupt files that couldn't
 be fixed" :(&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also tried out the DISM fix which gave me an "Error: 87" and didn't change anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any other solutions I could try? Or would a re-format do the trick? Should be a rhetorical question I guess, it's just that I formatted becuase this happened and now it reappeared after I did the format, so it seems like it's something in the Windows
 Updates that corrupts my system, it just doesn't make much sense to me. After a format I only install Windows updates and some third party apps via Ninite.com, apps that would most likely have been tested before they're distributed to the masses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I try a reformat and not install anything else than the Windows updates?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Error 87 for DISM might occur if the parameters are incorrect. That means the spaces between the commands:</p>
<ul>
<li>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</li><li>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</li></ul>
<p>After this, run SFC scan again and check if there are still corrupt files not repaired.</p>

<p>I formatted the PC and have updated Windows fully to the most recent version, no third party apps until that was finished and it seems to run smoothly now, none of the problems are there anymore so maybe the update process went wrong somehow the other time...
 I don't know but I think this has at least solved the problem by ignoring whatever caused it.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
What is the make and model of the Computer?<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1:<br />
</strong>Run the fix it and check.<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/slow_windows_performance/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/slow_windows_performance/en-us</a>
<div>You may also perform a System Maintenance troubleshooter and check if it helps.<br />

<div><br />
If method 1 doesn’t help then perform method 2<br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
You may also perform a clean boot and check if any third party software is causing the issue.<br />
How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
<br />
Note: After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7 in the above Knowledge Base article.</div>
<div><br />
<br />
If method 2 doesn’t help then perform method 3<br />
<strong>Method 3:<br />
</strong>If this step does not help then you may perform a system file checker on the computer and check if it works.<br />
Use the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe) to determine which file is causing the issue, and then replace the file. You can refer the link:
<br />

<strong>Method 4:</strong><br />
You may perform Microsoft Safety scanner in safe mode with networking.<br />

<span>You may also run a
<span>Microsoft safety scanner to make sure computer is free from virus infection:<br />

<b>Disclaimer:</b><br />
If you run the virus scan the program that is infected with virus will get deleted. So yo</span><span>u have to reinstall the program. Also if the files and folders are affected with
 virus then they might even get deleted</span><span><br />
<br />
</span><br />
In addition, you can also perform disk clean up and disk defragmenter as a workaround. Here are the links.<br />

This has happened quite a few times till now. Does anybody know where I should start looking to sort this issue? I already reinstalled the GPU driver and run the SFC and DISM commands to repair Windows, but it's still the same. Could it be an hardware fault?</p>

<br /> 
<br />As indicated by the error dialogue the failure is either the video driver, the video device (hardware), or other hardware such as the motherboard affecting the video.
<br />
<br />nvlddmkm.sys is the Nvidia video drivers so try updating those.

<p>Hi Rob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to try checking these other resources you mentioned and report back. By the way, I already have the latest version of the Nvidia driver v390.65. I guess I'll also try reverting to an older driver version.</p>

            Not sure why you gave me a bad rating when I told you about all that can be known from the information you provided. It might help me to know so I can try to be more effective when helping others.
<br />
<br />
It is very unlikely running SFC. DISM, or similar software would help with that issue. Like the ID41 the ID141 is almost always hardware will a small chance it was the driver. Seen this many times over the years. i.e. If it was caused by something like ntfs.sys
 it could be firmware for an&nbsp;SSD.<br />
<br />
I would as a matter of course check the BIOS and chipset drivers if you have not updated them.<br />

<p>Hi SpiritX,<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, I didn't do it with malice, you didn't deserve a bad rating, I'm just inexperienced with the feedback mechanism, but I reckon I clicked carelessly.</p>
<p>Also, sorry for the big delay, I was very busy with many things and, on top of that, was testing for faulty RAM with Memtest86 first and then Windows Memory Diagnostic in extended mode, which alone took almost three days to complete. In either case no problem
 was found. Just as I began using again my PC, another Critical Event happened, as usual:<br />

<p>I'd like to add a few facts:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not personally overclocked the GPU, as I much prefer system stability, but the card came factory overclocked (1620/1506 instead of 1582/1480 MHz). However, selecting debug mode from the Nvidia Control Panel, I used the card at standard clock, but
 I run into the issue nonetheless.<br />
<br />
It's very difficult to pinpoint a moment since when the issue appeared, I guess about a month ago. When I bought the GPU early November, I run Windows 10 for a month, but even there I remember always getting "Windows was not properly shutdown" Critical Events
 and other random errors. At that time, it was early December, the infamous Samsung 960 Pro firmware update failure happened, so I was forced to swap my SSD drive, and I decided to try old Windows 8.1, hoping for some peace of mind. However, the "Windows was
 not properly shutdown" Critical Events continued to appear, but I've been able to address them by disabling "Fast Startup" from Windows. I can't help but think that these things are all related :-/ (maybe the motherboard then?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried downgrading to that driver version [388.71] and also upgraded to the newer one [390.77] yesterday, but the issue persists. I guess I'm going to try the other driver versions available.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, I've relocated the GPU to another slot and connected two separate pci-e power cables to the GPU, instead of just using both the connectors from only one cable. I'll keep you posted if this solves the problem, but the "Windows was not properly
 shut down" events are still there, sadly.</p>

Hello Rob,<br />
<br />
After so much efforts and time spent, I’ve finally figured this one out: the very cause of this and several other minor issues affecting my PC all this time was my motherboard (ASUS Rampage V Edition 10). I just bought an ASROCK Fatal1ty X99 Professional Gaming
 i7, clean-installed Windows 10 and the latest Nvidia drivers 390.77, and all is working fine, even the Fast Boot feature which was so problematic in the past. Finally, no more BSODs, no more annoyances. I don’t know, there is a remote chance I was doing something
 wrong (and I tried resetting and updating and tweaking to the exhaustion, without any significant documentation to be found), but I more inclined to assume that that particular product is just bad (and I’m being polite). Indeed, I should just have ditched
 it sooner, as from the beginning going on it’s been showing the worst driver support I’ve ever seen in my life, and I even RMAed it a while back for networking related issues.<br />
<br />
Anyway, many thanks for your support in troubleshooting this mess out with me.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
NF

<p><span>Hi Styluss,
</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for using
<strong>Microsoft Answers </strong>Forums!</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to ask a few questions to help focus in the right direction:</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are there any other specific details that you can provide that will help us to understand and resolve your issue?
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span><span><span>Since when are you receiving this error?
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span><span><span>Did you make any changes to your system?
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span><span><span>Did you install any new Updates and/or Software?
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span><span><span>Have you Upgraded your Laptop from Windows XP to Windows Vista?

<p><span>To work around this problem, follow these steps.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:
</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Put the computer in clean boot (to figure out if any third party software is hindering the process)</span></span></p>

</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check with the Step 1 (Perform a clean boot):- if everything works fine after a clean boot, you can infer that
 some third party services are causing the problem.</span></span></p>
