    <title>Best practices to create Child user for new Windows 8 laptop&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carrie_supsrv  say:</h3>
<h2>            Best practices to create Child user for new Windows 8 laptop&#63;</h2>
                    We bought a brand new Windows 8 laptop for a child for a Christmas present. Can someone respond with a best practices, how-to, step-by-step instructions on setting up a Child user for the laptop right out of the box? There will be no parent user on this
 laptop (parent has several laptops of their own). We want to maintain functionality of the Metro tile applications without signing into Windows Live ID or XBox. Child will not be downloading anything. I recently setup a brand new Windows 8 laptop for myself
 (an adult) and was amazed at the number of times I had to sign into Windows Live ID after tapping a tile on the Metro screen in order to use it. Will many of the applications not work for the Child because there will be no Child Windows Live ID?

            Thanks for responding. The articles in the web links says an Adult administrator user account must be created first before creating Child user. I understand the Family Safety filters can then be applied to the Child user.<br />
<br />
However, this doesn't answer my question about Windows Live ID. When I created an Adult administrator user on my personal brand new Windows 8 laptop right out of the box, I signed into Windows Live ID about 5 times for various applications to function. Is it
 possible to create an Adult Administrator User that never signs into Windows Live ID? What programs or applications will not work because you don't sign into Windows Live ID?
<br />
<br />
Or, is it a MUST the Adult Administrator signs into Windows Live ID? Will the Child usage be recorded &amp; tracked on the Adult Administrator's Windows Live ID and therefore, the Child is tracked online?<br />
<br />
<br />

<h2>            Windows 10&#58; Suddenly hard drive runs at 100&#37; Active even at low disk read&#47;write speeds</h2>
                    I've had Windows 10 since the release date, but on 9/11/2015 (around that time), windows is suddenly booting slowly, my hard drive has low read/write speeds and slow response times. The average is average 3000-5000ms (up to 2000)+ response time on boot
 then it falls to 400-500 (up to about 1000ms) after it has fully loaded every program on start. I didn't have this issue before, but now I do. &nbsp;I've run chkdsk&nbsp;and defrag and scanned for viruses. So far nothing. It seems as though the real issue is the latency
 with the hard drive and it starts on windows boot, but the latency starts falling after everything has loaded and it takes several minutes for windows to boot. I'm not sure if the hard drive is running at normal/full speed after everything has loaded or not
 (compared to before), but it does run noticeably faster after boot.&nbsp;<br />

 previously successfully done a full pc backup to an external dvd writer (samsung)<span>&nbsp;</span>several months ago. The difference between then and now is the progress bar showing how much copied does not go any further than %20-leading me to believe
 that I am copying the same thing over and over. When I got to the point during the backup that I knew I had used enough disks-I halted the procedure-and did not get the “successfully backed up” message as I did on the earlier system backup . Technical specs
 for my laptop: Model: Compaq Make: presario; 32 bit operating system using a 1.60 GHZ processor, 502 MB of ram, and I am trying to back up 58 GB. I think the simplest remedy would be to reinstall the Vista upgrade or would a system restore be better?</span></p>

<p>The problem with System Restore is that you don't really know when the "problem" started (or even what the problem is).&nbsp; I doubt you have restore points going back months to that full backup (and even then, that doesn't mean that the complete image backup
 system was working just because you were able to do a full backup - they are separate things though both are backups).</p>
<p>Doing a system repair/upgrade is a fairly radical step (you'll have to deal with updates - possibly uninstalling Service Packs and then installing around a hundred updates).&nbsp; There's no guarantee this will fix the "problem" because, again, we don't really
 know what the problem is (or if there is a problem at all).&nbsp; I think we should deal first with making sure you're using the right procedures for this different kind of backup.&nbsp; To do that, you're going to have to settle down for some reading of some long articles
 - but you should learn a lot in the process (and perhaps learn why your first effort at doing a complete image backup failed).&nbsp; I think somehow the process isn't recognizing that you've changed disks and that it should proceed - but I'm not quite sure how
 to resolve that issue with a DVD writer.</p>
<p>Here's a tutorial on how to do a complete image backup in Vista that might help you get through the process (perhaps you're missing a step or something):<a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial145.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial145.html</a>.</p>
<p>Here's another basic tutorial on how to do a complete image backup in Vista: <a href="http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/5100-10878_11-6133188.html?tag=rbxccnbtr1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/5100-10878_11-6133188.html?tag=rbxccnbtr1</a>.</p>
<p><span>This is an EXCELLENT article on the Backup and Restore Process in Vista</span><span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2007.09.backup.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2007.09.backup.aspx</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;but
 it doesn't go into great detail about the restore process - almost considering so easy it's self-evident.&nbsp; But it does teach you a lot about what is possible and how to do it.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this informaton helps (and that you perhaps find why your prior effort failed).</span></p>

    <title>Installing Windows 10 32 bit on a new laptop with Windows 10 64 bit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidcarraway  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installing Windows 10 32 bit on a new laptop with Windows 10 64 bit</h2>
                    <p>I have tried several different approaches to this task, and still have not been successful. The problem seems to be that when I insert the Windows 10 32 bit or my Windows 8.1 32 bit installation DVD, I am almost immediately shown a message that stops my
 in my tracks with a statement telling me to insert the 64 bit DVD and it will start installing automatically when it is inserted. The only option is to click the&nbsp;single&nbsp;button. I&nbsp;am trying this on&nbsp;the HP m7-n109dx laptop. I also created a new partition with
 half of the 1TB hard drive hoping to install on it, but could not. Windows XP DVD would not even start installing. If I do not use a 64 bit OS DVD, I get nowhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I create a Hyper-V Virtual Machine,&nbsp;the only usable interface is the DVD drive. The network adapter will not connect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am thinking that this new laptop is so solidly 64 bit that it cannot allow a 32 bit OS to be installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone show me the way???</p>

In particular, it does not play nice with other Virtual Machine utilities including VirtualBox itself and VMWare Player if you have it installed. Also, configuring it is not as simple as VirtualBox. For instance, VirtualBox makes network connections easier, I don't have configure switches and configure Internet sharing especially for wireless networks, it does all of that for me.

            <p>You must boot the installation media whenever you do an install and especially when installing another bit-version as it simply cannot run from the other.&nbsp;
</p>

            <p>As I mentioned in my original post, I tried the Hyper-V and was not able to use it. It would not connect the network adapter, so I would not have been able to transfer anything to the virtual machine being created without having to use the DVD player.&nbsp;I
 also tried the Oracle Virtual Box without success. Now, I am using VMWare to create a virtual workstation and it seems that Windows 10 32 bit is installing on it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My reason for wanting Windows 10 32 is my need to continue using VS6 and other software that has to be installed into a 32 bit OS. I love the new laptop, but cannot use it as it came out of the box with only a 64 bit OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created my Windows 10 32 bit DVD using the Microsoft Media Creation Tool. I will probably try the method outlined by Greg Carmack if my currently ongoing attempt to use VMWare fails. However, Windows 10 32 bit has installed successfully and I am waiting
 to see if all else works before I try anything else.</p>

<p>David Carraway,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had similar problems installing 32 bit Win 10 on my 54 bit Win 10 laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My solution, which was the only one that worked after tediously trying many others, was to install Windows 7 from an old installation disk, over the Win 10, 64 bit, and then install Win ten, 32 bit over the Win 7.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Win 7 does not interfere with the Win 10 32 bit installation.<span>&nbsp; </span>
(I am quite sure Win XP would not either.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>Win 7 would not install over the 64 bit Win 10 initially because the BIOS was set to a UEFI boot.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I had to change the BIOS to a legacy boot and while disabling “Secure Boot” (or something to that effect).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After installing Win 7 with a legacy boot, I inserted the 32 bit Win 10 installation disk but entered the BIOS during the power on self test and changed the boot method back to UEFI and enabled secure boot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wa La.<span>&nbsp; </span>I have 32 bit Win 10 on my laptop and am happily using all my old dBase III programs along with some other cool stuff from past years.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone ever comes up with a 64 bit version of dBase III they will make a fortune.

                    I am new to using skype and recently had texting conversations interupted by messages not written by the contact i am chatting with. They appear to be written by my contact but my contact will say they did not write that. I have done research on the “bots”,
 could it be that. Im confused because neither of us have downloaded a bot or requested to use Cortana. Or worst case can someone hack into your messaging conversations��

<h2>            Windows key stuck down &#40;not physically&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I've had this problem for a long while. Randomly, out of nowhere Windows thinks my windows key is being held down (Pushing R opens the Run window) It usually happens around 30 minutes prior to starting up the PC. I can usually fix it by tapping the windows
 key a few times. I know it's not a physical issue because after tapping the windows key multiple times (fixing it) Makes the computer go wild. The C, V, H, and Slash keys are unusable except in Windows Explorer. Discord will have to load for 5-10 seconds every
 time I click something in it, and a lot of other things. Holding the windows key shouldn't do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can tell you the programs I have installed if required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled all of my keyboard drivers and reinstalled,</p>
<p>I've used a different keyboard,</p>
<p>Still no solution...</p>

</p><p>In fact a more reliable procedure is to start OSK.exe, see that the Win- key is down on it and then click on that, toggling it off.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will probably see the same issue with the Alt- key; however, a difference there is that you probably have two of those and only need to toggle the one that is "stuck"&nbsp;(say the right one)&nbsp;with the other one that isn't (the left).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, you could try to think if there is a particular keystroke sequence that you are doing which causes this condition and then try modifying the way that you do it.&nbsp; It's probably not pressing and releasing Win- in order to get to the Start Menu
 but in case it is be aware that you could alternatively press Ctrl-Esc for exactly the same effect without touching the Win- key.</p>

</p><p>FWIW I have to do this kind of thing with all the modifier keys at one time or another when I am using Mouse Without Borders and forget that those keys are first being handled on the machine that owns the keyboard.&nbsp;&nbsp; ; )</p>

<p><span>Hi </span></p>
<p><span>Thanks for the help!</span></p>
<p><span>I tried putting the computer into Clean Start by running the msconfig..followed the instructions, after reboot tried to install the program but get the same message. Went back in through msconfig
 and all boxes are rechecked? I dont know why, so I tried redoing it, I thought perhaps I forgot to Apply the changes, still no go..the change didn't take. So I tried running&nbsp;in “safe mode” and I can start the program without the windows message, but dont have
 full functions.</span></p>

    <title>Ad-Hoc networks not visible in my Surface Pro running Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jon singleton  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ad-Hoc networks not visible in my Surface Pro running Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft Support,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently purchased a Surface Pro 3 running windows 8.1. I have installed all updates, and read a number of support tickets which have yet to be addressed for this issue. Currently, computers of various manufacturers running Windows 8.1 are experiencing
 the issue of Ad Hoc connectivity being removed for mobile hot spots. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not specific to the Surface Pro lineup, as this is persistent to only Windows 8.1 across a plethora of devices. In my tests, reverting back to Windows 8.0 (begrudgingly) allowed me to locate and connect to my ad hoc mobile hotspot with no issue at
 all. However when doing a fresh restore back to 8.1, again the ad hoc connectivity is missing.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted the numerous fixes provided by the community in previous questions of this same issue including netsh adding and connecting (which says it succeeds but never actually connects), downloading 3rd party ad hoc connection programs (which see
 my ad hoc network, but never allow connection). This is very obviously not an issue with the hardware, but rather a feature in all previous versions of Windows, stripped out of Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that I have placed a great deal of money on the i5 8gb 256gb model specifically with mobile usage in mind, it is incredibly disheartening that I am unable to connect to my mobile hot spot while mobile, without first rebooting and entering into an Ubuntu
 partition. This negates my ability to use Windows 8.1, which was the appeal in purchasing this product in the beginning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions are: </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Why was ad hoc connectivity removed/hidden?</p>
<p>2. When will it be re-added?</p>
<p>3. Can I re-add this myself through some KB article I haven't found?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note before answering, in all previous posts I have seen engineers respond with steps to create ad hoc networks on windows machines, and to connect to ad hoc networks of other windows machines. All of which individuals are able to succeed at doing
 when this is their intent, but these fixes have not helped individuals attempting to connect to mobile hot spots. Please, ensure your answers are in regards to mobile hotspots only.</p>

            <p>Hi Jon,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand you are not able to see Ad-Hoc Network on windows 8.1. This problem occurs because of a design change in Windows 8.1 and Ad hoc networks are no longer supported. For more details refer the article below:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2931166/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2931166/en-us</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But you can share the network from other computer where the Ad-Hoc Network have been already setup. Please refer the suggestions given by
<strong>Hai_Nguyen_123 replied on January 7,2014 </strong>from the link below to do that:</p>

            <p>Hello, as I stated in my original question, this function only works for computer-based ad hoc networks, it does not allow mobile hot spots. the netsh command used to connect to the mobile hot spot says the connection has completed successfully, but does
 not connect. This is true for all users in the situation I am in according to the number of complaint posts and replies on this forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Providing me a link that shows the issue and resolution does not answer my question as to why this was removed. I use a Windows 8.1 tablet, made for mobility. To remove my ability to connect to my mobile hot spot is ridiculous. Why was this removed? The
 community that uses Windows are quickly becoming more mobile and many have wireless hot spots on their phone to connect while on the go. It seems irresponsible to remove your community's ability to connect to a mobile hot spot while mobile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell me why this has been removed, and if it has been replaced in Windows 10, if it has not, it needs to be.</p>

            <p><span>I too find it strange that ad-hoc was removed for 8.1.</span></p>
<p><span>The workaround that works is to use this setup, and then use a bat file to connect.</span></p>
<p><span>With the bat file you will not have to type or copy and past in the command to connect.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To see all networks in range, including ad-hoc, run this command in command shell (cmd.exe):<br />
&gt; netsh wlan show networks</span></p>

<span>SETUP</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>This must be done once per network.<br />
•go to "Network and Sharing Center"<br />
•click "Set up a new connection or network"<br />
•double click "Manually connect to a wireless network"<br />
•enter the SSID of the ad-hoc network (as shown by "netsh wlan show networks") into the "Network name" field<br />
•configure security settings accordingly<br />
•uncheck "Start this connection automatically" (important)<br />
•click "Next", then "Close"</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Run this command (important):<br />
&gt; netsh wlan set profileparameter&nbsp;&lt;ssid&gt; connectiontype=ibss</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />

            <p>Yes I am. This method falsely states the connection has completed successfully though no connectionis made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is also how it is affecting a number of other individuals on the forums. The above method will succeed for pc based ad hoc networks, but not for mobile hot spots. There is some difference between the two though I'm unclear as to what, no background
 in networking for me.</p>

            <p>Hello Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tablet itself is well capable of a virtual machine. I appreciate your response, though this is more of a side indication that I can virtualize another OS, rather than addressing the main concern of this post. The reason Ubuntu was mentioned was to state
 that I have to reboot to this OS to connect to a mobile hot spot, rather than an inquisition on how to run it as a virtual machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks you though,</p>
<p>Jon</p>

<h2>            The Xbox Enforcement Team are Terrible</h2>
                    <p>I've seen people throw games all the time in first person shooters like Overwatch all the time, especially in Competitive. Xbox imagines that the whole community abides by there terrible policies reguarding cursing. If people can get away with intentionally ruining others experience on the Xbox servers but are shut down instantaneously attempting to retaliate, then what's the point of the enforcement team? Filing a complaint is&nbsp;pointless. The only time I have seen this system work is when a group of people go around and abuse the system. My friend moved to PC a while ago and he said that it was one of the best decisions that&nbsp;he ever made. I've also  been making plans to&nbsp;do so, as Steam is how it&nbsp;should be, if someone is using&nbsp;foul language, you can&nbsp;block or mute them. Others need to&nbsp;tell xbox what they are doing wrong so they can&nbsp;fix it.</p>

 </p></blockquote><p /><p>I'm not concerned about their previous behavior. If they are still continuing to ruin others experience on Xbox then why pay for a membership? So many can get away with this and even if they get banned, making another account takes minutes. What I did I take responsibility for, but it ticks me off how those who continue this bad behavior can so easily get around this terrible system. Besides, I doubt you know wht it's like to work hard for a rank in a competitive game only to lose it by some Internet scum. I also have another point, if you take a look at information from the CDC, the U.S is rated the 3rd&nbsp;highest in murders. If you remove 4 cities, we drop to the 4th lowest. Believe it or not, these cities have the toughest gun control laws. This relates to this as Steam has a very lax policy, and trollers and other scum have no power to abuse the system even after provoking an innocent individual. On Xbox, which I have followed their rules for 7 years, if they provoke you, you c

The system is flawed incredibly as the scum of the internet have this power to get those who even attempt to retaliate against them for saying the nastiest things are instantly shut down. Ive surfed the forums and seen other posts&nbsp;like mine get shut down by the mindless drones like you who believe a clearly faltering system needs no adjustment. Many&nbsp;would agree the system is lacking and if they don't agree, they'd probably have been lucky enough to never meet a bad sport. You wouldn't know what it feels like to lose a rank due to how little you play competitive FPS.</p>

 </blockquote> <p>Actually they do receive info on a punishment, why does a Mod not know this? Xbox will send you a message saying that you have filed one or more accurate complaints and the team took action. I personally have never been banned&nbsp;but I've heard&nbsp;plenty of stories, which many are true, about people getting banned while only retaliating against someone else who has already broken the rules yet they do not receive a suspension. If they do, they use a second account to communicate.</p>

<h2>            Xbox games specials prices arent discounting</h2>
                    In the store tab on my xbox one, click the button marked 'deals'. Next page shows a line called 'Xbox games specials' with a 'show all 77' button. Click the button to get to a page of games, all showing an original price with a strikethrough, then a discounted
 price. However, most of these titles dont actually discount when you click them. EG Watchdogs 2-original £54.99, discounted £10.99. Click to buy it and it attempts to charge the full £54.99. Many others on there do the same thing. Whats going on?

<p>Hi iamthearrison,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think for some reason you are seeng the E3 sales prices.&nbsp; That sale ended on July 17th.&nbsp; Right now Watch Dogs 2 is going for the full price via Xbox store.&nbsp; I recommend restarting your Xbox by holding the power button your Xbox for 10 seconds.&nbsp; Then load
 back into the store. There are new deals in the Xbox store via Xbox game special and deals with gold.&nbsp; Sadly, Watch Dogs 2 isn't on any of the list.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My Xbox 360 is broken so I upgraded to the Xbox One. I have CoDAW and a season pass. Do I need to purchase CoD again? Can I transfer my season pass to the xbox one version? Thanks.</p>

<p>There was an offer that the 360 season pass and the digital version of the game would automatically transfer over to the xbox one. although the offer may have expired now.</p>
<p>check the xbox store. The season pass will show as free if it has transferred over. or might just say install now.</p>
<p>If a price is listed then yes you will have to buy it again or wait for the backwards compatibility update so you can play the 360 version of COD on your xbox one.</p>

<p>@Axemator, not even answering the question they asked. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes your season pass should transfer over to the xbox 1 but you have to go through the ingame store. If you click on the dlc it should say "You have already purchased this dlc, would you like to redownload"</p>

<h2>            No title in title bar</h2>
                    For example, when I open Windows Explorer, there is no title (Windows Explorer) in the title bar.&nbsp; Is this a lacking feature in Windows 7?

            <strong><span>Hi heat dr,</span></strong>
<p><span>Windows Vista and Windows 7 don’t show title bar text in Windows Explorer. Actually title bar text was removed to make the Explorer clean and minimal.</span></p>
<p><span>If you really want to see the title bar text, you can change your theme.</span></p>
<p><span>The specific steps are below:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Right click the desktop and choose “Personalize”</span></p>
<p><span>2. Choose “Windows Classic Theme”</span></p>
<p><span>Then you can see the title bar text but you will no longer get the full Aero experience. Aero is the premium visual experience in this version of Windows. It features a transparent
 glass design, window animations, Aero Flip 3D, and live window previews</span></p>
<p><span>Some third party software can get you that function. Use your favorite search engine to get you software that provides you the Title bar function.</span></p>

<h2>            Event log writes error related to application-specific permissions on Windows 10 computer</h2>

<br />
In this case, <strong>the usual suggested fix cannot be made</strong><strong> because the Default isn't listed</strong> (value not set) for Local Machine registry entry App ID {F72671A9-012C-4725-9D2F-2A4D32D65169}. Thus, it's unknown what DCOMCNFG item to

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It started happening after yesterdays big update. I cant say I'm pleased so far as I had to reinstall my drivers and programs. Wade through loads of crappy settings, changes some back to what they were before the update. My windows 10 install was only 2
 months old and was working quite well before this update landed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway I too am seeing this same issue. Fed up with having to go through reg editor changing permissions just to try and resolve this issue. I had the same problem&nbsp;with the last win10 update that time it was&nbsp;runtimebroker.</p>

<p>to the user NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM SID (S-1-5-18) from address LocalHost (Using LRPC) running in the application container Unavailable SID (Unavailable). This security permission can be modified using the Component Services administrative tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm sure there are plenty of improvements here but I'm not happy with the way Microsoft rolls it out like a new OS install then initially breaks things that worked ok.</p>

            <p>A lot of people seem to be getting this error, and there seems to be little to no info out there about it.</p>
<p>The CLSID comes up as CDP Activity Store in regedit, but CDP Activity Store is not an item in DCOM config.</p>
<p>The only thing called CDP is CDP Reference Host, and without knowing how they're related (assuming they are) I wouldn't know what to modify.</p>
<p>Depending on my search wording I also found a lot of technical references to CDP in Windows Server on Technet, and this on VMware:<br />

<p>Set it to view in detail and you'll find {F72671A9-012C-4725-9D2F-2A4D32D65169} at the bottom. It listed as the 8th one from the end of the list.</p>

<p>
</p><p>1. I'm using a Microsoft Account</p>
<p>2. With admin priveleges</p>
<p>3. This happened since the Anniversary 1607 update, but the update has cleared my update history</p>
<p>4. There have been no hardware, software or system changes</p>
<p>5. Win10 Home 64 1607 OS Build 14393.10</p>
<p>6. I've not had a single OS, hardware or software issue with my machine since I originally installed Windows 7, smooth as butter upgrade to Win10 a year ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alongside the above issue I also now have inescapable black screens on exit of fullscreen apps and it's very frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are too many things happening that I don't like so I'm rolling back to version 1511 to see if that puts them back to a state that I'm happy with, and staying with that for the foreseeable or until there's a reliable fix available because I have no
 time to trial and error registry fixes for this issue. I've loved and spread the word about Win10 to this point but 1607 has shaken my faith considerably.</p>

            <p>I have the same issue. It has been happening since the last Windows 10 update. I have tried SO many things. Am currently running the sfc scan now to see if any system files are missing or corrupt...yes, this is how far I have gone to attempt to fix things.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Xerox Phaser 860DP driver for Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a great Xerox Phaser 860DP that I just repaired.&nbsp; It worked flawlessly on XP.&nbsp; Now I have Windows 10 and I cannot find a driver for it.&nbsp; Anybody have a generic driver or a workaround that will work on Windows 10?</p>
<p>
