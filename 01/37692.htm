<p>
</p><p>December 16th, Friday night, Windows 10 attempted to update with the new creators update patch. Without my consent the patch forced windows to reboot and now my computer is in a permanent boot loop. I can't get to anything except when I hit Ctrl a. holding
 shift doesn't work, Hitting f5 doesn't work, F6,&nbsp; F12, nothing works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;of course I don't know the Windows operating system number -&nbsp; no such thing comes with the purchase of a cyberpowerpc, or for that matter, I don't think any computer now these days. You just get Windows loaded on your computer and that's it. No, the answer
 is I did not create a boot disk or boot thumb drive before this happened - I didn't anticipate this happening - I've had the computer for 4 years and this has never happened.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Once again, I cannot get to safe mode. not withholding shift, or any of the F keys, work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;my computer was fine before this damn update Force patched without my consent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;please tell me there is SOME MANNER&nbsp; to which I can recover my computer that Microsoft has apparently broken.</p>

<p>This is a site for testing beta releases of W10 not yet released to the public.&nbsp; As members here, we test future W10 releases for bugs and new features coming in Windows 10.&nbsp; You have been a member for an hour so you are likely running public build.&nbsp; Our
 beta releases (Insiders) are not supported by Microsoft staff.&nbsp; However, the public builds are supported by Microsoft staff.&nbsp; Your question should more properly be addressed to Microsoft support staff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, you appear to be in a loop.&nbsp; If that was my PC, I would do a forced shutdown by holding down the power button for a few seconds.&nbsp; Perhaps this is what you are already doing, hard to tell from your comments.</p>

 to load Windows from your BIOS.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your best choice, if you are fully versed in PC repair options is to deal with Microsoft staff.&nbsp; You do qualify for support if you are not testing beta software normally done by this site and members on this site.</p>

    <title>Keyboard and mouse abnormal after Windows 10 recent update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Keyboard and mouse abnormal after Windows 10 recent update</h2>
                    <p>I have a Asus G20 desktop and recently I am having a big trouble with the keyboard and mouse after recent Windows update. It all started when I installed the update on 31 Oct. &nbsp;When I start my computer trying to login, somehow I am not able to type certain
 letters for example letter d. Tried to roll back to the prior version then everything comes back to normal. Unfortunately it lasted for two days then Microsoft reinstalled all the updates back and I got into the desktop again - everything started to totally
 mess up like crazy. Once I turn on the caps lock I am not able to turn it off ; Nums lock not working at all; keyboard sometimes totally unresponsive sometimes giving random numbers or letters. Mouse would select multiple items at the same time and I cannot
 put the cursor in the right place. I tried virtual keyboard - to my surprise it is Getting more confusing - if I hit 3 Windows would open my browser..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried my keyboard on my laptop it works perfectly so I think it is not the hardware problem. Due to the update I have lost the restore point on which everything is normal- so I have to reset my computer back to the clean windows but it did not solve my
 problem!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to actually retain your settings between an upgrade such as Windows 7 to Windows 8.1? I just got done making the upgrade and it said that it would retain my data. To me, that means that it will retain my settings as well, as that is data
 and it is stored in my Users folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this was obviously not the case, and poor wording yet again by Microsoft, how can I refrain from losing all of my data AND settings next time I have to reinstall or upgrade?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I was also wondering, why can't you retain settings when you upgrade from 7 to 8? I could understand going from XP to 8 and not retaining settings, but if you can retain our data, you should be able to retain our settings and programs as well.</p>

            An upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 8 (and then sequentially Windows 8.1 via the update) would keep all your files, settings, compatible installed applications, etc.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
The process is fairly straightforward...<br />
&nbsp; <br />
1. Backup!&nbsp; Anything CAN go wrong at anytime.&nbsp; This should not be extremely out of the ordinary for you and if it is, you may want to revise how you treat your computer data anyway.&nbsp; It should mean just making an extra backup of your data and perhaps an image
 of your Windows 7 system to external media *just in case* something goes wrong.&nbsp; If only you could make this sort of backup in every aspect of life, there would be less reasons to worry!&nbsp; Don't know how to do this in Windows 7?&nbsp; Read up:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/what-is-a-system-image" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/what-is-a-system-image</a><br />
&nbsp; <br />
2. Get your upgrade media and product key (or purchase it online) and store a copy (COPY) in a safe place from this point forward.&nbsp; Also, while you are at it, take note of your current Windows 7 product key (could be on a sticker on the machine or with the
 installation media if you purchased Windows 7 separately) and store that along with the COPY of your Windows 8/8.1 media and product key.&nbsp; This is another safety 'catch all'.&nbsp; You CAN create media (ISO image to DVD or USB stick) of Windows 8/8.1 if you purchased
 it online.&nbsp; Suggested you do so!<br />
&nbsp; <br />
3. Check the hardware manufacturer(s) web page(s) for all your products to make sure they have and you can get (go ahead and get them NOW and save them to your computer/external media) device drivers for all the components in and attached to your machine *for*
 Windows 8/8.1.&nbsp; It is (always has been and should remain that way) the responsibility of the hardware and software manufacturers to supply compatibility for their products with any operating systems they want to.&nbsp; If they support Windows 8/8.1, they should
 have drivers you can download or patches for their applications (if necessary) so their product(s) work for you properly under Windows 8/8.1.&nbsp; However, remember nothing says they HAVE to support the new operating system at all.&nbsp; It is your responsibility as
 the consumer to check and prepare for this change.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
If you have a big vendor system (like a Dell, HP, Lenovo, Gatway, etc...) you can likely get all the internal component drivers from their support web page under their drivers and downloads section for your model system.&nbsp; Otherwise you will have to go component
 by component (motherboard chipset, video card, audio card, network card, etc.)&nbsp; Same goes for your external peripherals (webcams, printers, scanners, etc.) and all the software you have installed (office suites, image editors, email clients, internet browsers,
 etc.)<br />
&nbsp; <br />
4. Perform the upgrade.&nbsp; How you do this will depend on what media you have, etc.&nbsp; Might start here:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/upgrade-from-windows-7-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/upgrade-from-windows-7-tutorial</a><br />
&nbsp; <br />
5. Use the computer.&nbsp; You can make a few changes if you don't like the Start Screen menu at first, etc.&nbsp; There's some ways you can quickly and easily start using Windows 8/8.1 so it looks/feels more like 7 while you get used to the differences.<br />

<h2>            BATTERY CHARGER PLUGGED IN BUT BATTERY DOESNT ALWAYS CHARGE </h2>
                    MY ORIGINAL AC ADAPTER STOPPED WORKING ( I THOUGHT UNTIL NOW).. THE COMPUTER SEEMED AS THOUGH IT DIDNT EVEN RECOGNIZE WHEN THE CHARGER WAS PLUGGED IN AND ITS ALWAYS PLUGGED IN. I BOUGHT ANOTHER CHARGER ABOUT 2 MONTHS AND NOW I AM HAVING THE SAME PROBLEM
 AGAIN. I DID A BATTERY CHECK TO SEE IF IT WAS THE BATTERY AND NOT THE CHARGERS BUT THE CHECK SAID MY BATTERY WAS GOOD. ALSO, THE BATTERY METER DISAPPEARED FROM THE TASKBAR, I WENT TO TASKBAR PROPERTIES&nbsp;AND THE BATTERY METER ICON BOX WAS CHECKED TO SHOW A DISPLAY
 BUT IT WAS GRAY SO I COULDNT CLICK IT. I RESTARTED MY COMPUTER AND THE BATTERY METER WAS BACK BUT IT DOESN'T SHOW THE BATTERY IS CHARGING. I WENT TO WINDOWS MOBILITY CENTER AND IT SHOWED THAT MY BATTERY WAS PLUGGED IN BUT NOT CHARGING. WHY WOULDNT IT CHARGE
 IF IT KNOWS IT IS PLUGGED IN OR WHY IS IT NOT RECOGNIZING MY CHARGERS?

            Hello ctarwater,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Thank you for using Microsoft Windows Vista Forums.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;What type of computer are using?&nbsp; Might need to contact support for the specific make and model. I have added some steps below to troubleshoot please let me know if this helps out or if you are still having any problems.<br />
<br />
<p><span>Welcome to the
</span><strong><span>Microsoft Windows Vista Communities</span></strong><span> site.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>When your battery doesn’t appear to be holding a charge…</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As
<strong>Carey</strong> stated if the battery “doesn’t appear to be holding a charge” it is a very good sign that the battery itself is faulty, and in need of replacement.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>With regard to your question about battery life this would vary depending on the capacity of the battery, the quality of the battery, your
 usage of the system, and your habits when charging/depleting the battery cells. So in short there is no good formula for determining battery life as you could use your laptop very different than I would use mine – in terms of power usage.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Some steps to confirm whether or not the issue is your battery…</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There are a few simple things you can do to see if the problem is with your battery, your charger, or the connection (power port) on your
 motherboard.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>You’ll want to first remove the battery from your laptop.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Then verify the wall outlet you are using is fully functional with another electronic device.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Then connect your power cable to the charger, sometimes referred to as the brick, while inspecting the cable for any damage or exposed wires.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Then connect the charger to your laptop’s power port.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Power the computer on when using strictly AC power.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span>If your computer is working as intended then your battery is most likely headed for “battery heaven” and will need to be replaced.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If your computer does not work then there may be an issue with the charger or the power port on your computer. You will want to double-check
 all connections, and the power source (wall outlet) you are using. If the problem persists this may be a sign of a faulty charger or the computers power port.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You will also want to check the port on the computer, were your power cable plugs-in, ensuring that the power pin is not bent or damaged.
 If the issue appears to be with the cable you will need to obtain another cable for testing purposes. If the issue appears to be with the power port you will want to contact your computer manufacture for further assistance.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Hi Neil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience caused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to try disabling the password requirement setting and check if it helps.</p>
<p>1. Press Windows key + R.</p>
<p>2. Type powercfg.cpl and press enter.</p>
<p>3. Click "require a password on wake up" on the left pane.</p>
<p>4. Click "change settings that are currently unavailable".</p>
<p>5. Check "do not require a password" and save the changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
        </p>

            I had wondered this same thing, but its actually a security measure. Its to preven someone from brute forcing your password, requiring them to wait some time before being able to reattempt the hack. If it was imediatly then a hacker could get in preety
 fast with a dictionary or other methods of password cracking

<h2>            repair WAN miniport &#40;Network Monitor&#41; &#35;2</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the device manager I see the device <strong>WAN Miniport (Network Monitor) #2</strong> with a yellow triangle. The device status is
<strong>This device is not working properly because Windows cannot load the drivers required for this device. (Code 31)</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not very alarming as all four network adaptors seem to work (Ethernet, W-LAN, wireless broadband and Bluetooth) but still is a bit annoying.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Where can I find the proper drivers for this device?</p>

            <p>Hi Bennet,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is not possible to directly remove the WAN Miniport drivers. The indirect way is this</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Richt click the Miniport with the yellow exclamation mark</p>
<p>2) Update the the driver, and select Browse my computer....</p>
<p>3) On the next screen select Let me pick...</p>
<p>4) remove the check mark on Show compatible hardware, from the list than select something that can be removed for instance Microsoft -&gt; Generic Mobile Broadband Adaptor. and click next.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This will replace the driver for the faulty device which than can be removed by the steps described by Bennet Martin,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a cintiq 21ux which is not working as it should. I have connected it to my pc (windows 7) and installed the latest drivers from wacom. However, it is only recognized as display. I can move the cursor but it does not jump to where the pen is, it only
 makes the same movements. When I try to open "properties of the wacom tablet" &nbsp;i get the error "There is no tablet connected that is supported".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried reinstalling the drivers, restart the service and refreshed the device manager but nothing works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope some one can help me with this problem.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How do I stop any open window from maximizing when I move it&#63;</h2>
                    Windows 8 Pro 64, recent install on new computer build.
<div>I often have two or more windows open on the desktop. After I installed a better graphics card with drivers, when I try to move a window it flashes green around the edges of the display then maximizes. Then, when I restore down, the window goes back to
 the same place where it opened. It is VERY annoying&nbsp;I have found no way to prevent this. In short, it seems the windows try to "act" in W8 mode where the focused window maximizes (AND those windows maximize WITHOUT the minimize or Restore Down buttons!). How
 do I change settings (which, so far, I've been unable to find) to stop this "auto maximize" action?</div>

<p>Hi LynnieM,<br />
<br />
<strong>Superfetch</strong> is a memory management technology that helps keep the computer consistently responding to your programs, also prioritizes the programs you're currently using over background tasks and adapts to the way you work by tracking the programs
 you use most often and reloading this into memory. When you left your device idle and when you return to your desk, your programs will continue to run as efficiently as they did before you left. To turn it on, kindly follow
<strong>Burr Walnut's </strong>reply in this <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/how-do-i-enable-super-fetch-service-in-windows-7/f1492e7e-5079-e011-9b4b-68b599b31bf5?auth=1">thread</a></strong>.

    <title>Getting Error Code 0x80070002 when attempting to add an outlook.com - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Getting Error Code 0x80070002 when attempting to add an outlook.com Email address to Mail</h2>
                    <p>After a recent restart of my pc my outlook.com addresses were missing from the mail app. So I tried to add them again, but I keep getting an Error Message (Something Went wrong, Error Code: 0x80070002). Gmail Accounts are possible to be added. (Login via
 web outlook.com is also still possible)</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I tried already to solve this issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to troubleshoot Windows Update and Windows App Store Apps - No Resolution</p>
<p>I tried the DSIM Fixing and SCM /scannow fixing - No Resolution</p>
<p>I Installed Windows Updates - No Resolution</p>
<p>I Reset, Uninstalled, Reinstalled the Mail &amp; Calendar App - No Resolution</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I didn't tried yet (and would like to avoid):</p>
<p>Reset Windows</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run out of ideas (I went through most of the microsoft.com questions and tried their solutions, but nothing seem to have helped)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to get a more detailed error message? I guess something is missing in my %APPDATA% or maybe a Permission there is missing (I might have "accidentily" deleted some temporary and cache folders in APPDATA before that)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope someone can help</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>The workaround I found now is to add the account as a POP3/IMAP account instead of outlook.com account. That worked without a problem. (Only thing is, that Inbox is not Differentiating between Focused and Other anymore)</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Still anyone has an Idea where the problem with directly adding an outlook.com account could lie?)</p>

<h2>            Videos are Always Buffering</h2>
                    Up until an hour ago everything was fine, now all video in Edge is constantly buffering or plays in slow motion with no sound. I tried the thing about software or GPU rendering and restarted the PC and the problem persists. Why does this sometimes happen
 out of nowhere after video playback has been fine?

<h2>            Tools is missing on new skype. FRUSTRATED. Trying to STOP Skype from starting up when I turn on computer. HELP please.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
I just downloaded new skype 4 days ago. Everytime I turn my computer on, it's on. It pops up on my browser.<br />
<br />
I googled stop skype from automatically turning on in windows 10.<br />
<br />
It writes:&gt; sign in to skype. Go to profile, tools, and in tools turn that off.<br />
<br />
Thing is, there is NO tools anywhere. Nowhere.<br />
<br />
It's driving me nuts.<br />
<br />
Would someone kindly tell me where tools is in new skype windows 10 so I can prevent skype from just turning on automatically?<br />
<br />
Thankyou.<br />
<br />
I hate it when programs purposefully do this. It's like they hold you hostage. I'd like to use skype time to time, but not if it means,</p>
<p>it will always power up when I turn on my laptop.</p>

<p>Hi Andre! :) You're quick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just uninstalled the new skype before I saw your answer.<br />
<br />
I then put skype in the cortana search. There is actually 1 skype app in my computer already.<br />
<br />
It had a different layout. Not the old one but not the new one.<br />
<br />
It had prompts and they said, 1) automatically start skype 2) launch skype in background 3) keep skype running in background.<br />
<br />
THANKGOODNESS it let me "toggle" those off.<br />
<br />
So we'll see if that works.<br />
<br />
QUESTION 1:&gt; When you wrote:&gt;&nbsp;<span>Delete Skype if its listed there.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
ME:&gt; Were you just telling me to uninstall it because there is no way to prevent it from auto starting and running in the background in the new windows 10 skype?<br />
<br />
QUESTION 2:&gt; You wrote:&gt;&nbsp;</span><span>Also, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Background apps &gt; toggle off Skype.<br />
<br />
ME:&gt; I'd already deleted the new version so there was not Skype in Background apps. Is that why?<br />
<br />
*Let's hope this older version already on my laptop ( I didn't know there was one till now), won't give the same problems.<br />
<br />
QUESTION 3:&gt; Did they make the new version to you can't stop it from running in the background, so you can't actually stop it from auto turning on? If so why? Did they deleted tools to prevent people from having the option to keep it from turning on automatically
 when you turn on your computer?<br />
<br />
Thankyou so much!</span><span><br />

            Windows 10 already comes with Skype built in, called Skype 12. There is another Skype, called Skype 8 for earlier versions of Windows and other platforms such as Linux, macOS, Android and iOS. 
<br />
<br />You likely had installed Skype 8, but sometimes it can be confusing, since users seem to be mixing up both Skype 12 and 8, especially if you are running Windows 10.

            Andre honestly, you are the "beam me up Scotty" for answering. THANKYOU. You are fast.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
QUESTION:&gt; Which version of the Skype will not let you turn off the fact that it auto turns on and continually pops up on your browser. The one I installed, said it was new. That's all I know.
<br />
<br />
After I deleted it, I went back to the skype website to relook at the skype version that was giving me problems. When I looked at the skype website at the downloads, and it said I could download windows 10 skype new, the menu picture it showed, didn't have
 the "tools" to have the option of turning it off. Of course, that only made sense now, because I'd already had problems with it, so then saw confirmation, that version has no tools.<br />

            It most likely would be Skype 8. 
<br />
<br />Launch the version of Skype presently installed
<br />
<br />Press Control + i
<br />Click About this version 
<br />
<br />It should tell you which versions installed.
<br />
<br />Also, post a screenshot if you can of which version of Skype is currently installed.

<p>Hey thanks Andre.<br />
<br />
I couldn't get the control to work&nbsp;<span>Pressing Control + i but I googled and found the version.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You know, had I known it was installed already I'd not have downloaded the one giving me all the trouble.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I attached the one I am using that allows you to shut off skype, prevents it from running in the background, and prevents it from popping up as soon as you power on your device.<br />
<br />
Pics #1- 3 are the easy toggle things off skype.<br />
<br />
The pic with #4 is the skype with NO tools to toggle anything off. And it's a real headache. #4 is the one I deleted. I don't know what version that is.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help. The skype in the last pic I attached, googling everyone is asking, where's tools so I can stop skype from powering up each time I turn on my computer. Tons of people.<br />

            Hi Ruwim,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thanks for the clarification. I appreciate it.<br />
<br />
And check this out, the "<strong>Bad Skype</strong>" that I downloaded a few days back, I got from this page on Skype's current site. Here's the link.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
https://www.skype.com/en/<br />
<br />
If you look at the "current website picture" of what this version of "<strong>Bad Skype</strong>" looks like to the right of download (I was using the windows 10 prompt), you can see there, that they actually have a picture advertising the "<strong>Bad Skype</strong>."
 And it downloaded.<br />
<br />
That is where I got the picture of the skype I was having problems with that I took a screen shot above.<br />
<br />
I wonder if it's a technical error/issue.

<p><span><span>The picture shown on this website is outdated. It is indeed showing an older version of the "new" Skype which you are using now,</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Skype for Windows 10 does not have a Toolbar, and the available settings can be accessed using the "<strong>...</strong></span><span>" button.
 This Skype application will always run in the background as long as you remain signed in to this application. To switch this application off, you would have to sign out.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The new Microsoft Skype for Desktop (the 8.X version) is smarter, as you can Quit the application without signing out, and Skype will close completely.</span></span></p>

            Hey Ruwim,<br />
<br />
Thanks for the breakdown again. I appreciate it. And I'm leaving as is. I'm not downloading anything else now that I have what I need through Skype 8.25.0.5. I didn't realize that it was already on my computer. Had I known, I'd not have download the "<strong>Bad
 Skype</strong>" version to begin with. I mean, I don't want to have to mess around trying to figure out how to stop it running in the background and all of the rest. I don't know why companies change things and make it difficult for users. I use it for 1 basic
 application. I don't need any upgrades if it accomplishes this. And it does.<br />
<br />
I feel like I'm kept hostage, when their app takes over my laptop and time, and I have to spend hours on google trying to figure out how to set it up so it only turns on, when I want to use it. It's invasive when they default it to start when your computer
 starts etc.&nbsp; And then they don't write a page to easily shut it off. That's not fair. It feels like you're being spammed. It's not a nice practice.<br />
<br />
So thanks again for your help and explanations. I'm glad I know what the deal is now. I'm sure this thread will help others as I googled, and many people are having the same frustration for the very same reason regarding that 1 "<strong>Bad Skype</strong>"
 download. Take care you. :)

                    <p><strong>Hello Microsoft Community!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>After installing the 1st anniversary update I keep seeing this message when I try to modify some settings on my computer:</strong></p>

<p><strong><br />
Because of it, I cannot -for example- modify the placement of the software icons on my Start menu...<br />
</strong><strong><br />
I had the same problem before and I used some Youtube tutorials and it was solved. This time I tried the same ones but nothing works.</strong></p>
