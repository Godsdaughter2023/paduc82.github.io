            Usually this would be in C:\Program Files or C:\Program Files (x86)
<br />
<br />But, since Windows 10 already comes with Skype version 12, there really isn't any need to install Skype 8.

<h2>            Microsoft Sudoku daily challenge</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft Sudoku daily challenge has started closing unexpectedly before the challenge is completed or time runs out.&nbsp; This has begun happening this week absent any Windows 10 upgrades to introduce new problems.&nbsp; I'm sure this is probably not the first report,
 but a search revealed no similar subjects to sudden closing of a working app.&nbsp; I didn't equate it with freezes or non-starts.&nbsp; Any information available out there?&nbsp;

            Thank you for your response,<span><span>here are steps on how to clear<span> cache
</span></span><span>and reset Microsoft Store in Windows 10:</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><span><span>1. Close Windows Store app, if it’s running.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><span>2. In the Start menu search box, type WSReset (Windows Store Reset) to see Wsreset in the search results.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><span>3. Right-click on WSReset and then click Run as administrator option. Click Yes button when you see the User Account Confirmation box.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><span>NOTE: If the WSReset utility is not appearing in the search result, you<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>ca</span><span>n launch the same from the System32 folder (Windows\System32). To open WSReset tool from System32 folder, please navigate to the
 drive where Windows 10 is installed (usually “C”), open up Windows folder, and open up System32 folder. Here, you<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>ca</span><span>n find WSReset.exe file. Right-click on it and then click Run as administrator option.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p><span><span>4. The Store app should now automati</span><span>ca</span><span>lly launch along with the Command Prompt. The Command Prompt window will automati</span><span>ca</span><span>lly disappear after a couple of seconds.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><span><span>Let us know how it goes.</span></span><span> <br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Regards.</span></p>

            <span>Some info to put it back to factory condition:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;If the computer manufacturer did not include Vista disk/s, there should be a Recovery Partition on your Hard drive.<br />
<br />
That is the way they do it now, most of the time. We are supposed to make the Recovery Disks ourselves, with instructions included in the installed Manufacturer's&nbsp;Software in Start &gt;Programs.<br />
<br />
At the bottom of the splash Screen at startup/power on, there usually is a Key number, F10, or F11,&nbsp;to hit to start Recovery Process, to take it back to factory standards (out of the box).<br />
<br />
Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options&nbsp;, and start a factory standards recovery from in there, by selecting the Repair computer option.<br />
<br />
See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.<br />
<br />
Each manufacturer has their own way of doing a Recovery to factory standards.</span>

            <p><span><span>Hi Aaron,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>We&nbsp;realize the inconvenience you are experiencing with </span></span>"preparing automatic repair" loop followed by
<span><span>black screen error</span></span><span><span>.&nbsp;We will certainly help you.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>We have been seeing black screen issues of several types after upgrading to Windows 10. The main causes observed so far are driver issues, output to unexpected port, and possibly also issues with the Lock Screen app.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 1: </strong>We suggest you to kindly follow the link below and try the steps and check if it helps:</span></span></p>
<p><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14106/windows-10-troubleshoot-black-screen-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">Troubleshoot black screen problems</span></a></strong></p>

<p><span><span><strong>Method 2: </strong>To Troubleshoot no boot situation, follow the below steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> </span></span></p>

<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Once the bootable media is created, follow next step:</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> Perform <strong>Start up Repair</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the steps mentioned below to perform <strong>Start up Repair</strong>:
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;a.&nbsp;<strong>Insert</strong> the installation <strong>DVD</strong> or <strong>
USB</strong> and boot Windows 10 from it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; b.&nbsp;Select “<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>” from the first Window and then select “<strong>Advance Options</strong>”.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; c.&nbsp;Then select “<strong>Start up Repair</strong>” from “<strong>Advanced options</strong>” window.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This will help you to boot into your Operating system again.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p>If all the previous troubleshooting didn't work for you that you will need to reinstall Windows 10. Follow the steps from the link below and refer to the section

<h2>            Skype for Business Incoming Call Notification</h2>
                    <p>In skype for business, is there a way to get the "incoming call" notification to pop up in the center of the screen, as opposed to just in one of the corners?&nbsp; The screens now days are large enough to where a small notification is easily missed down in the
 corner.&nbsp; I have missed several calls due to this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regular skype would pop up in the center and you always knew when you had an incoming call.</p>

<p>Hi CGUMS,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as I know, the alert cannot pop up in the center of the screen, you can only set the notification to pop up in the four corners of the screen:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f7f54ed3-4a75-4ed0-8c08-05770428a630?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f7f54ed3-4a75-4ed0-8c08-05770428a630?upload=true" /></a></p>

<h2>            Windows App Store hangs.</h2>
                    I have a one month old Samsung XE500T running Windows 8.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I`ve had it I have noticed that when I try to connect to Windows App Store I am told that I am not connected to the internet, 50% of the timing resulting in hanging.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Initally I spoke to MS and was told by a technican that he could resolve this issue for 99 dollars. &nbsp;I refused as this is a new device and expect it to work properly without additional expenditure.</div>
<div>I then spoke to Samsung and was told that because the issue relates soley to Windows, it is a MS problem.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have installed all updates and restored the system a couple of times.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please advise me of a solution to this issue....I am tired of chasing my tail on an issue which I am sure can be solved easily.</div>
<div><br />

            <p>I SOLVED this. At least for myself. It's been a 3-day journey. Argh!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The upshot is this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Kill Store and Store Broker from task list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rename the Cache folder to CacheOld at:</p>
<p>C:\Users\(Your User Account)\AppData\Local\Packages\WinStore_cw5n1h2txyewy\LocalState</p>
<p>(Your WinStore_gobblygook might be a different bunch of gobbblygook)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Create an empty folder called Cache.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Solved! For me anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Enjoy,</p>
<p>Ron</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>PS</p>
<p>I have been at this for days. I've read every article and post everywhere. I have updated graphics drivers, set date and time, run wsreset, sfc /scannnow, created new user account (store did work for new account), app troubleshooter, etc, etc, etc...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I just started digging around and looking at dates. I don't have log files to back this up but I believe I broke Store with CCleaner. I'm not sure exactly when the Store broke so this is a best guess but it makes some sense since Ccleaner does clean
 Store cache.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also recently installed Tor Browser but my gut is that that was totally unrelated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might create a sandbox user and try to break Store with Ccleaner to confirm. But honestly I am tired of this little adventure.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you have any CD or DVD inserted in the DVD drive while booting to Windows?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Were there any recent changes made to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>We usually get this error message if in BIOS (Basic Input Output System) settings CD Rom or floppy drive is selected as first boot device.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s follow these steps to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:
</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would first suggest you to unplug all external devices and then try to reboot and check.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:
</span></b></p>
<p><span>Go into your
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/BIOS-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
BIOS (Basic Input Output System)</a>, and change the Drive Boot Order so that the Hard Drive comes first as a boot priority. You should be able to boot into Windows normally after you save it to that configuration.</span></p>
<p><span>If you need more help on BIOS settings refer to the Computer Manual or contact the manufacturer for more information.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            alt&#43;spacebar does not work</h2>
                    "alt+spacebar" opens the shortcut menu for a window - Restore, Move, Size, Minimize, Maximize, etc. &nbsp;This works just fine for pretty much all windows. &nbsp;But NOT Windows Media Center.

<div>I can get the window shortcut menu by right-clicking the title bar - this works for all windows, even including Windows Media Center. &nbsp;But I need to get the WMC shortcut menu by keyboard only. &nbsp;How can this be done? &nbsp;And why does the normal keyboard shortcut
 fail for this one program only???</div>

<h2>            windows&#47;fonts &#34;font file names&#34; column empty for MANY fonts</h2>
                    <p>I was looking at fonts in C:\Windows\fonts and decided to sort by the column "Font file names" (might have to enable the column, not sure if it is on by default).&nbsp; I have what looks like 100's of files that have no filename listed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen these before, but thought they were variations or fonts in a "TTC" type file that shared the same file with other fonts in the same family or such.&nbsp; But when I sorted by filename, I found tons of files that showed no path, but were simple files
 in the C:\Windows\Fonts directory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that if a Font family, shown in the windows font display is split among 1 or more files, the 'filename' column is also blank.&nbsp; Does anyone know how to have it display *any* of the filenames?&nbsp; Ideally, it would show the file for the main-font (regular
 or medium width -- like filename with no "adjectives" on it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two examples: "7th Service" having a main file of 7th.ttf + italics in 7thi.ttf would, ideally, show 7th.ttf.</p>
<p>"A Charming Font" would show "A Charming Font.ttf", ignoring variants for expanded, italic, leftleaning, outline, and superexpanded (all separate font files).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not that groundshakingly important, but mostly curious if builtin font-page could be more helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FWIW, it is easier to locate filenames if you also open an explorer window aside the normal font-display window w/address \\localhost\c\windows\fonts (assuming you allow yourself to read your file system from the local system :-)).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Prior to what issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does it display a source file for all of your fonts?&nbsp; (that would be surprising to me).&nbsp; I don't know if it ever displayed the source file for a font that was split into more than one file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, I had a fontname displayed that had 2 variations, "regular" and "italic".&nbsp; In the column where a source file could be displayed, it displayed nothing.&nbsp; When I looked in the \Windows\Fonts directory using the \\localhost\windows\fonts pathname,
 I could see 2 files for the listed fontname -- 1 was a file containing the regular ttf font, and the 2nd was a file containing the italic ttf font.&nbsp; So the fontname displayed on the "fonts" page (seen under 'C:\Windows\Fonts') was a combination of 2 files.&nbsp;
 I am guessing, but it seems that because it was more than 1 file, it displays "zero" files in the source-file column.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question was whether or not there was a way to get that source-file column to display **ANYTHING** -- the 1st file found, or the file for the regular-version of the font, or even the last file found (in my case, that would display the name of the file
 for the italics variation).&nbsp; Displaying _anything_ would be more useful to me than displaying nothing...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does that make it any more clear?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>In other words, there is no way I will ever see a way from Microsoft, to do this in Windows 7 (or likely most any other version).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used to submit suggestions once in a while when I thought MS might actually want to know how to improve -- but never once was anything done or responded to.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even outright bugs in products that I conferred with developers on in outlook were not fixed -- but was told to "upgrade" to latest -- stupidly, I did, and the same bug was present in the new product.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, even amidst tons of people asking for the Win 7 desktop to be revived -- and enhanced, MS refuses.&nbsp; When I need a new computer, I want one that will be at least as attractive as the one on Win7 -- I don't want one that was dumbed-down for hand-held
 devices.&nbsp; I cheered when Bill Gates demo'd the glass and 3D effects with him saying it was the beginning of using more advanced 3D paradigms to display and control the desktop... then he retired and Windows direction went to stark, ugly utilitarian.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I *thought* I might be able to eventually buy Win10 if I got an Enterprise edition -- but just learned I'd also have to buy 5 licenses AND a ongoing support contract.&nbsp; Thud.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want a desktop and OS that's at least as powerful and allows the user at least as much control as I have now w/Win7-Ultimate.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want ALL of the features I have now + new things -- that's how it is supposed to be -- you sell me a *better* product that does everything my old one does and more.&nbsp; The idea that I have to give up all the features I use is sickening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Group Policy &amp; run my own Domain at home because I wanted single signon.&nbsp; I use Win7 as my desktop and use a linux-server as my backend, initially with with the two connected w/a *team* of 2 10Gb network port on a dual-port Intel card -- hoping to
 operate the two computers as one in a type of cluster.&nbsp; I'm now told that Win10-home clients won't be able to use network card teaming -- Intel's cards/drivers no longer work on Win10 for teaming and am told that it won't be fixed.&nbsp; If MS really wanted to
 help -- they'd install the SMB3 networking on Win7 -- then I might be able to use part of my 20Gb interconnect (which, due to SMB2 limitations is limited to about 1.6Gb/s</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is all going *backwards* -- desktop, usability, higher-end hardware support -- I don't want to go backwards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I see no way my telling a suggestion link is going to help when 100's of thousands of other voices have already said the same and have done so for years.&nbsp; The result -- MS has wandered further and further away from what consumers want -- and heavily
 away from what Computer Scientists (like me) want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I voted w/my pocket book when Win7 came out and required Win7 Ultimate as the OS.&nbsp; Seems the best Win10 offers is a crippled home edition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pointing me at a 'feedback link' as a solution for a Win7 design flaw just doesn't cut it as a "solution", sorry.&nbsp; Too bad Gates left -- at least he had a consumer vision.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 - Error&#58; &#34;There was a problem resetting your PC. No - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 -  Error&#58; &#34;There was a problem resetting your PC. No changes were made&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I bought a brand new laptop which has a built-in SSD a couple of days ago. The SSD is only 128GB therefore I thought of moving the "Users" folder from my SSD to my HDD to save up space.
</p>
<p>I copied individual sub-folders under "Users" in SSD and moved it to the "Hansa" (username) folder in the "Users" folder I created in the HDD. Something went wrong during the process and I had most of the documents found in my "Desktop" folder and my "My
 documents" folder in the desktop background and deleted them. Later when I tried to access my D: drive (HDD) it asks me to format my drive. (Message- "You need to format the disk in drive D: before you can use it. Do you want to format it?") and when I cancel
 the messagebox I get an access denied message. (Message- D:\ is not accessible. The volume does not contain a recognised file system. Please make sure that all required file system drivers are loaded and that the volume is not corrupted.")&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because of this, I thought if I reset my PC it would be fine. But when I attempt to reset my PC from the "Recovery" settings menu, it gives me another error- "There was a problem resetting your PC. No changes were made." I have tried to reset this laptop
 a few times but I got the same error every time. I can still boot into Windows. But when I try to launch the only application I have installed in the D:\ drive, I get the error "The drive or the network connection that the shortcut 'MySoftware.Ink' (installed
 application) refers to is unavailable. Make sure the disk is properly inserted or the network resource is available, and then try again."&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do I do?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: My user folder "Hansa" under the C:\Users; folder is no longer available either.
</p>

<p><span><em>I thought of moving the "Users" folder from my SSD to my HDD to save up space.</em></span></p>
<p><span>-&gt; The "Users" folder contains, amongst other things, certain registry files. By moving the folder away from its usual location you basically crippled your Windows installation. Your only chance of recovery consists
 of using a Windows 10 bootable flash disk to boot the machine into Repair Mode. Using the Command Prompt, you would need to manually restore the "Users" folder, in particular your own profile folder "C:\Users\Hansaka". Doing this requires good skills in the
 Console environment.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Note that the Users folder could be on a drive other than C: while in Windows Repair Mode. It could be D:, E: or F: but it cannot be X: (because X: is a virtual drive letter in Repair Mode).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A less painful method consists of reinstalling Windows on your SSD.</span></p>

<p><br />
As GTS-NJ pointed out the port you are looking at is a VGA port. Serial ports on the computer are typically 9 pins or 25 pins (in 2 rows).</p>
<p>Some bluetooth services install virtual COM ports, as do some cell phone drivers for use over&nbsp;a USB data cable. Search Motorolla's&nbsp;website for driver downloads for your phone model. You could try your phone service provider's site too in case they have support
 file downloads as well.</p>

<p>It is still listed under stetting's&nbsp; Bluetooth and other devices. </p>
<p>Updated all Dell drivers, did not help.</p>
<p>Tried to system restore, failed and can't undo that attempt it is stuck.</p>
<p>There is nothing wrong with and of the attached equipment or the computer except that the update Fail's to address the port and detect device.</p>
<p>Poor coding a character must be in error pointing to the mini HDMI port.</p>

<p>Hi MaharishiDejaVu,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For further troubleshooting, I suggest that you uninstall the drivers via <strong>
Programs &amp; Features</strong> on <strong>Control Pane</strong><strong>l</strong>, then reinstall updated driver. Updating drivers via automatic update usually create conflicts that causes issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep the thread updated with the result.</p>

<h2>            Possible to play xbox one disc on win10&#63;</h2>
                    So I got forza motorsport 7 for Christmas and have waited LONG to get this. I don't use my xbox anymore and instead have gave it to my kids but I have a pc with win10. This game does have "Xbox Play Anywhere" but for some reason doesn't work when I insert
 the disc into my pc. Does the game have to be digital or is there a way to make it compatible?

<h2>            How to add Yahoo account address book under Cortana to access the Yahoo contacts on Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>How do I get Cortana to use my address book from my Yahoo e-mail account instead of my hotmail (Microsoft/ Outlook) account? I seldom use my Outlook account and only have a limited number of contacts there.
</p>
<p>Thanks in advance! </p>

            <p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern to access Yahoo account contacts through Cortana. We will help you with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform that to access the contacts on Windows, you will have to import them to Windows People app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As this cannot be done directly, however as a workaround I suggest you to try exporting contacts from Yahoo interface first. Then, go to
<strong><a href="http://www.people.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.people.live.com</a>, </strong>try importing those contacts and check if they get imported.
</p>
<p><strong>Steps</strong>: Click on <strong>Manage </strong>in <strong>People.com</strong>&gt;
<strong>Import</strong>&gt; Choose the file you have to import.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once done, lets check if the contacts sync with People app. If yes, then check if Cortana is able to recognize the contacts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For reference: <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14103/windows-8-people-app-help" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">People app help</a></strong></p>
<p>(Applies to Windows 10 as well)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope it helps. Get back to us with an updated status of accessing Yahoo account contacts through Cortana for further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<div>Use the XP Recovery Console to verify the file system on your HDD and correct any file system&nbsp;integrity&nbsp;issues caused by power&nbsp;interruption&nbsp;problems&nbsp;and then try to boot your system - this may be all you need to do to get your system running.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Boot into the Windows Recovery Console using a bootable XP installation CD.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you have no bootable XP media (or are not sure what you have) create a bootable XP Recovery&nbsp;Console CD and be sure.</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is not the same as any recovery disks that might have come a store bought system. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>You can make a bootable Recovery Console CD by downloading an ISO file and burning it to a CD.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The bootable ISO image file you need to download is called:</div>
<div><br />
<div>xp_rec_con.iso&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Download the ISO file from here:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mediafire.com/?ueyyzfymmig</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Use this free and easy program to create your bootable CD:</div>
<div><br />
<div><a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:</div>

<div><a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a></div>
<div><br />
<div>It would be a good idea to test your bootable CD on a computer that is working.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive&nbsp;as the first boot device instead of the hard disk. &nbsp;These adjustments are&nbsp;</div>
<div>made before Windows tries to load. &nbsp;If you miss it, you will have to reboot&nbsp;the system again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>When you boot on the CD, follow the prompts:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Press any key to boot from CD...</div>
<div><br />
<div>The Windows Setup... will proceed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Press 'R' to enter the Recovery Console.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Select the installation you want to access (usually &nbsp;1: C:\WINDOWS)</div>
<div><br />
<div>You may be asked to enter the Administrator password (usually empty).</div>
<div><br />
<div>You should be in the C:\WINDOWS folder. &nbsp;This is the same as the&nbsp;C:\WINDOWS folder you see in explorer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>RC allows basic file commands - copy, rename, replace, delete,&nbsp;cd, chkdsk, fixboot, fixmbr, etc.</div>
<div><br />
<div>From the command prompt window run the chkdsk command on the drive where&nbsp;Windows is installed to try to repair any problems on the afflicted drive.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Running chkdsk is fine to run even if it doesn't find any problems. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Assuming your boot drive is C, run the following command:</div>
<div><br />
<div>chkdsk C: /r</div>
<div><br />
<div>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find. &nbsp;It may take a long&nbsp;time to complete or appear to be 'stuck'. &nbsp;Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is&nbsp;still flashing, it is doing something. &nbsp;Keep an eye on the percentage amount to&nbsp;be sure it is still
 making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear to go backwards sometimes.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You should run chkdsk /r again until it finds no errors to correct.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Remove the CD and type 'exit' to leave the RC and restart the computer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You do not have to adjust the BIOS again to boot on the HDD since the CD will&nbsp;not be present.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Once the chkdsk /r has completed, see if your system will boot. &nbsp;If not, do this:</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div>The next time your system restarts, start tapping the F8 key continuously until you&nbsp;see the XP Advanced Boot Options menu. &nbsp;From the Advanced Boot Options menu, choose:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Disable automatic restart on system failure</div>
<div><br />
<div>This will display the error message that you can't see when the system restarts itself. &nbsp;That is what Windows is supposed&nbsp;to do when it has a failure - it is supposed to restart automatically. &nbsp;The error you see on the screen has your clues...</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you do not see the Advancded Boot Options menu or do not see the Disable automatic restart on system failure option in the&nbsp;list of choices you need to try again until you do. &nbsp;Start tapping the F8 key sooner and more frequently as your system starts&nbsp;to
 come alive. &nbsp;If you miss the F8 window of opportunity, you need to try again.</div>

                    <p>I'm trying to add my iCloud account to the Windows 10 Mail app but this keeps happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Under "Manage Account" I see my iCloud account.</p>
<p>2) When I click the account, I get two options - Fix account &amp; Change Settings.</p>
<p>3) When I click "Fix account" I am asked to update the password. No matter what I enter it reverts back to the previous screen with no changes.</p>
<p>4) When I click "Change Settings" it asks me to change things but I leave them alone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of right now I can only access my mail through the iCloud website. I can't even access it on my Android device because the website doesn't work on it. I can only see my email at home. What do I do?</p>

            This usually appears due to having two-factor authentication on your Apple ID/account, the solution is to create an app specific password which is entered in-place of the account password.
<br />If you don’t have this security feature on your account then you may have to enable it &amp; follow these instructions to fix the problem.

            <p>Hello Melanie_D. It's 3 years since your message but I have had the same problem with Live Mail since installing it a year ago. Whenever the error code 'The TCP/IP connection was unexpectedly terminated etc.' comes up, which is probably 5/6 times per day,
 I simply click on OK several times and it goes away. But the email I may have been working on disappears from view and has to be brought back to the screen by clicking on the Live Mail icon on the bar along the bottom of the screen.
</p>
<p>So, to answer your questions above:</p>
<p>- this has happened since the outset of installing Live Mail</p>
<p>- I general receive email without problems but the error code comes up usually whilst working on an email, but not always</p>
<p>-it happens on both my email accounts. I only access Hotmail via the web.</p>
<p>-I only use one PC but also access emails from an iPAD or Blackberry</p>
<p>- I use IMAP</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this enables you to help solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bodg</p>

    <title>Windows 8 changes to Remote Family Safety Web Monitoring - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> family safety mama  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 changes to Remote Family Safety Web Monitoring</h2>
                    <p>I switched from Windows 7 to Windows 8, and my access to the activity on my son's account stopped appearing when I signed in online. I just got my first weekly report since the switch, and it only includes the activity before I installed Windows 8. How do
 I get the current activity (since Windows 8 installation) to show up again on my Window Live Family Safety page on the web?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I went to&nbsp;<b>Manage settings on the Family Safety website</b>&nbsp;on my son's computer, and got the prompt that I needed to switch to a Microsoft account instead of a local account. When I clicked to switch, it took me to User Settings, which had three options:
 change password and two others involving picture and pin. This feels like a deadend that isn't leading me to switching to a Microsoft account, let alone my primary objective of setting up Family Safety web monitoring...but perhaps I'm not getting something.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I need to be able to access the Family Safety controls remotely in addition to getting reports that reflect what's going on.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>I didn't see an error about the incompatibility of Family Safety with Windows, which is what the instructions provided<span>&nbsp;</span><span>(see below)</span><span>&nbsp;say they're for.&nbsp;</span><span>Even

<p><b>I am left with the problem of not being able to access the Family Safety CONTROLS AND REPORTS via the web, from another computer. I was able to do this in Windows 7, and I need this functionality.</b></p>
<p><b>I have another problem. My son cannot get in during time that I have designated as allowed time in Family Safety. This has happened two days in a row now. I was able to get into his account just now, but will it work tonight? I

            I responded to the issue that you replied to in the other thread there. But I posed a second, separate question above that I also need an answer to.
<div><br />
<div>One of the accounts (A) I am managing through Family Safety had a 10 pm curfew, but we cannot log into it in the evening the last three nights. I was able to log into it in the middle of the day today, but again tonight we cannot get into it. Another account
 with the same curfew (B) has been accessible. And I created a new account (C) with the same FS settings as the one we haven't been able to get into (A), and we were able to get into that tonight.
<div><br />
<div>Any idea what the problem is? The clock on the PC is reading correctly. My Microsoft time zone is set correctly.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks!</div>

            <p>Hi Family Safety mama,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you make any changes in the time limits or other settings in Windows Family Safety for the affected child account? If yes, it is possible that the system was unable to get the updated settings and still using the old settings. To troubleshoot this issue,
 please reconfigure the time limit settings&nbsp;for the affected account. This process will refresh the connection between the system and your current settings. You can refer to the link below for steps:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Test the settings and&nbsp;let us know if the issue still persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Have you recently installed or uninstalled any software or hardware?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to restart the computer and perform startup repair and then try to do system Restore.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Startup Repair is a Windows recovery tool that can fix certain system problems that might prevent Windows from starting. Startup Repair scans your computer for the problem and then tries to fix it so your computer can start correctly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Startup Repair is one of the recovery tools in the System Recovery Options menu. This set of tools is located on your computer's hard disk and on the Windows installation disc.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Startup Repair:</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7</strong></a></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You may also perform System restore in Safe Mode and check if the issue persist.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Safe Mode:</span></strong></p>
