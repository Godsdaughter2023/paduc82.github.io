            This looks like the way to go. I have managed to produce a *.asx file from the *.cpl file so far. I have started the IIS manager, however the Web Playlists is not showing ( neither is the Web Platform Installer). Consequently I can't produce the *.isx
 file. Also my media player interface looks quite a lot different to the one shown in the article - there is no 'edit in list pane' or 'save as' for example. I'm stuck.

<p>Hi Shannon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to hear about the current issue. This is currently a known issue that is going around that has been affecting majority of our customers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check out the full details on our website: <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status</a></p>
<p>For this we have seen that there's one solution that has been helping out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The process that has been helping out is to perform a power cycle on the Xbox and reset/restart the networking hardware.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To perform a power cycle on the Xbox:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Turn off the Xbox One console by pressing the <strong>Xbox</strong> button <span>
</span>&nbsp;on the front of the console for about 10 seconds until it shuts down completely.
</li><li>Unplug the console's power cable. Wait 30 seconds.
<p><strong>Important</strong> Be sure to wait 30 seconds. This step resets the power supply.
</p>
</li><li>Plug the console power cable back in. </li><li><strong>Don't</strong> turn on the Xbox yet.</li><li><strong>Next you perform the restart/reset network:&nbsp;</strong></li></ol>
<ul>
<li><span>Unplug the Router's power cable. Wait 30 seconds. </span></li><li><span>Plug the cable back in and wait for the network to be back up and running.</span></li></ul>
<p>Give it a shot and let us know if it helps.</p>

<h2>            skype for business can&#39;t send message to external users</h2>
                    <p>I can not send message to external skype user from my Skype for Business contact list. I talk about simple Skype external users, not Skype for business users.</p>
<p>I've read lot of forum threads and MS help pages about this issue, and tried several settings without success.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>My current settings are:</em></p>
<p>O365 admin page -&gt; Settings -&gt; Services &amp; add-ins -&gt; Skype for Business -&gt; All external related options are enabled, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Let people in your organization contact people with Skype for Business in other organizations:
<strong>ON</strong></li><li>Let people use Skype for Business to communicate with Skype users<span>:
</span><strong>ON</strong></li></ul>
<p>Domain exceptions: set to <strong>None.</strong> All domains are allowed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Setup -&gt; domains -&gt; My domain is checked and found <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Steps:</em></p>
<ol>
<li><span>I've enter the external contacts email address to Skype for business
</span><em>search</em><span> input field. Skype for Business seems to found this email address.</span></li><li><span>Enter some text as message.</span></li><li><span>Skype for Business wrote this error message: "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***
</span>nem kapta meg ezt az üzenetet egy vállalati házirend miatt." which is approximately means: "<span>*** Email address is removed for privacy *** did not receive this message because of some corporate policy</span>"</li></ol>
<p>I can contact and send messages to my own colleagues (same domain and tenant as mine) via Skye for Business.</p>
<p>I've tried to add a few valid, existing Skype contact of mines, not some imaginary ones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I think my settings are correct. However I can not add external Skype users to my contact list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, help me to get rid of this issue.</p>

<p>Hello Liktor,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the post in our forum. The error message shows that your conversation request wasn't delivered to the external Skype users successfully. Understand this circumstance, please let the external Skype users send you the message first to see if you
 can receive the conversation request. Once you receive it and accept it, you will be able to send messages to the external Skype users. If you still cannot receive the request, please also let me know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, please sign in <a href="https://login.microsoftonline.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Office 365 portal</a> and click <strong>Admin-&gt;Admin centers-&gt;Teams &amp; Skype-&gt;Org-wide settings-&gt;External access</strong>. Turn off
<strong>Users can communicate with external Skype users, </strong>wait for an hour and then turn on it again. Send a message to external Skype users to see if the issue persists.

<p>We appreciate your update. You may consider performing the following steps on how to roll back your video camera driver:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Select the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Start<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span>button, type<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Device Manager</strong>, and then select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Device Manager</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>from the search results.<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</li><li>Find your camera driver under<strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Imaging devices</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>or<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Sound, video and game controllers</strong>.<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
</li><li>Press and hold (or right-click) the name of your video camera, and then select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Select the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Driver<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>tab, select the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Driver Details</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>button, and look for a file name that includes<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>stream.sys</strong>. If
 it’s there, your video camera was designed before Windows&nbsp;7 and you'll have to replace it with a newer video camera.</li><li>If you don't find a file name that includes<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>stream.sys</strong>, try rolling back your video camera driver.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Let us know if that worked out for you.</span></span><span>

<h2>            Skype for Business partly unresponsive periodically when remote</h2>
                    <p>When I'm in the office, Skype for Business works fine all the time. When I remote into my laptop in the office, and use that instance of Skype for Business remotely, everything is still fine. When I quit that instance and start an instance on my home system
 logged into the same work account, everything looks fine, but most of the time I can't do anything on the main Skype for Business window. I can't even move the Window. It dings at me like it knows I'm trying to do something but it has some invisible modal
 dialog up. I can start Skype for Business chats and participate in meetings by using the web interface to initiate the actions, so Skype for Business itself doesn't seem to actually be locked up. But interacting with the main Window is prevented. If I Ctrl-right-click
 on the system tray status icon I can select "Configuration Information", and then Skype works fine for a little while. But eventually it freezes again. Sometimes it unfreezes naturally for a short while too. Skype for Business started behaving this way last
 week. Before that I had been using it for years from home without a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a few months my organization has required a 2FA code to be entered during sign-in, and that's not happening any more, so I don't know if it somehow got hung up on that. Also, when I try to sign out, it takes maybe half a minute, which seems excessive.</p>

            Hi
<br />
<br />I'm so sorry you are facing issues! I'm Maggie, an Independent Advisor from thr user community. I love helping other users in the Community by sharing my experience with Microsoft products. 
<br />
<br />Questions regarding Skype for Business are more likely to be answered faster in the  Skype for Business specific forum.  
<br />
<br />I would recommend post this question in that forum as well as they have experts who are specialized in that version of Skype :). This way you can get help from experts from both forums :).
<br /><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-us/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-...</a> 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps! 
<br />
<br />I wish you a great day/night :)!

</p><p>If Epson supports that model on Windows 10, Epson will help you to get it working. If Epson has decided not to support that model on Windows 10, it won't work on Windows 10, and there isn't anything that you or Microsoft can do about it.</p>

<p>Epson support shows drivers for your BX305F printer for Windows 10 64 bit?</p>
<p><a href="http://esupport.epson-europe.com/ProductHome.aspx?lng=en-GB&amp;data=FCFfEfoyEiFepczTEnlqVZun5lhSV+BdaHopv+hMf+MU003D&amp;tc=6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://esupport.epson-europe.com/ProductHome.aspx?lng=en-GB&amp;data=FCFfEfoyEiFepczTEnlqVZun5lhSV+BdaHopv+hMf+MU003D&amp;tc=6</a></p>
<p>So why you cannot connect by USB is puzzling?</p>
<p>Have you tried the printer with another computer?</p>
<p>With a different USB lead?</p>
<p>In compatibility mode?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried deleting all the printer drivers in Device manager, restarting and seeing if Windows re-installs correct drivers?</p>
<p>I am using an older SX415 with Windows 7 drivers but I have no problem with Windows 10 64 bit/32 bit and Insider Preview.</p>
<p>Other than that have you tried the printer forums?</p>

<h2>            TASK BAR WON&#39;T MINIMIZE OR BRING UP ACTIVE APPS</h2>
                    <p>I have been dealing with this problem for several months now. I have been patient and hoping that Windows 10 updates would fix it but it hasn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I have several apps open in Windows 10 (e.g. Chrome browser with multiple tabs, a Word document, File Explorer, and image viewer like MS Paint, and an Excel spreadsheet), after few minutes of having them open, I am unable to either&nbsp;bring up an active
 app by clicking on the task bar (i.e. making it come to the front) or&nbsp;minimizing an app I am working by also clicking on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is VERY annoying since I have to minimize ALL apps by clicking on the lower right hand corner of my screen and then bring up the specific app I was trying to work with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way the combination of the apps doesn't seem to have any relationship. I mentioned the example above but I have tried other combinations and I have the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</p>

            This has also happened to me several times. It happens almost every time after an update. It has nothing to do with hardware - Microsoft must know that. Why is it so difficult to find solutions to these issues. It must be a settings issue due to the upgrade.

            <p>I tried that and still have the problem. Here's the thing. It happens even when I have Microsoft apps running like Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and any of Microsoft's browsers (e.g. IE or Edge). &nbsp;The task bar actions I describe work for a little while and
 then I run into the problem I described. This is annoying beyond words. I have to close down all the apps and reboot for the system to go back to normal. Unless I start opening more apps in which case I run into the problem I described.</p>
<p>Frustrating doesn't describe how I feel.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response Thofik. While I understand that we need to isolate the problem, I have a bigger concern.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specifically, ALL of the 3rd party apps I have are exactly the same ones I had running on Windows 7 and then on Windows 8.1 (on different machines). None of the 3rd party apps are anything esoteric. Meaning, they are all mainstream, such as Carbonite, Adobe,
 Dropbox. IN fact, I have less number of 3rd party apps now running on my Windows 10 than I had on Windows 8.1 and far less than on Windows 7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, I already tried that and found nothing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I re-iterate, this problem happens when I have multiple windows open, including having only Windows apps open.</p>

<h2>            VPN connections disappear, RASDIAL makes them reappear</h2>
                    Here's a screenshot of the <em>Connect to a Network</em> dialog. Notice my VPN connection doesn't show. Nothing shows:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://i44.tinypic.com/2iu3rpg.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://i44.tinypic.com/2iu3rpg.jpg</a><br />
<br />
In order to get the dialog to regain its senses, i simply drop to an elevated command prompt, and run
<br />
<br />
rasdial [Name of the VPN connection]
<br />
You&nbsp;don't need the credentials. You&nbsp;don't need it to sucessfully connect; you just need to poke rasdial with a stick:<br />

You are seeing screenshots from Windows Vista. i have also seen this bug on Windows XP.<br />

<strong>My question is:</strong> How do i make Microsoft fix it?

<p><span><span>Hi Jack,<br />
<br />
Well,,,Gack! If this is only happening every few weeks to months, it is going to be very fun in the not so fun kind of way to track down.<br />
<br />
Here's my take.<br />
<br />
First, on a side note, I would never, ever run Windows without an antivirus package, if you go to the internet at all, which you appear to do.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>"Common sense" worked well before the age of drive by viruses. Just going to a page (even a supposedly known good one) can give you an
 infection. I'm not saying it is likely, just easily possible.</span> </span></p>
<p><span><span>I would strongly recommend that you run some virus scans (These forums have many good suggestions) just to be sure, but it does not sound
 like you have a virus to me.<br />
<br />
Okay, I'll get off my soap box now. :-)<br />
<br />
Next, rebooting is a standard "fix". If that fixes the issue, then practically every support guy in the world will tell you, "There is the fix, have a nice day." I won't argue your point though, it is kind of valid. Just please realize that there are literally
 billions of possible hardware and software combinations. There is no way all of them could possibly work together without an issue. I'll just tell you that it is a workaround and you should use if it works.<br />
<br />
Lastly, if you want to keep looking for a better solution, I'm with you on that. Solutions help all of us.</span>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>So, here is what you can do next.</span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>When it happens next time, mark the time.</span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>Then go into Event Viewer and start tracking down all of the errors around the time it happened as well as any warnings and any events
 that happened just before the problem started. We don't need (or want) the full thing, just the header with Event ID, source, level and log name.
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>We need to know what if anything started, stopped or tried to launch or tried to stop.</span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>Any service that does the above.</span>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Also, I would research over at Technet.
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Since you said that you are working, then for now, I'd mark this thread as closed and start a new one when and if the problem happens
 again. </span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>I sure hope this helps!
</span></span></p>

            <p>I spent a very long time with support but they finally fixed the issue for me. I don't know if you still need help to fix it, but if you do here it is.<br /><br />Go to SETTINGS-&gt;TV &amp; ONE&nbsp;GUIDE-&gt;AUDIO &amp; VIDEO. The far right tab is AUDIO. Set that to SURROUND&nbsp;SOUND. It will make you restart your console, but for me that fixed my problem of only getting dashboard audio but no game audio. Here is the exact instructions from the chat<br /><br /><br />These are the steps to follow: Press the Xbox button to open the guide. &gt; Select System &gt; Settings. &gt; Select TV &amp; OneGuide. &gt; Select Audio &amp; video. &gt; Change the audio option from Stereo to Surround sound. &gt; Select Restart now. Your console will restart and enable surround sound from your console to your TV or A/V receiver.<br /><br />I hope this helps you or someone else that needs it.</p><p><br /></p>

    <title>How do I change the administrator password&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I change the administrator password&#63;</h2>
                    I am using a Windows 7 computer. I opened cmd.exe to fool around and experiment, I was on the standard user account, I changed the administrator password and I don't know it. I don't have a reset boot disc.

<p>First off, it's "343 Industries" not "studios", and secondly, yes, as a matter of fact they do read their forums to get feedback. Hence why we've had 2 title updates which have fixed many of the problems the game had at launch.</p>

<p>[quote user="IntenseJames"]Halo 4 Forums[/quote]If by that you mean here specifically, probably not. To be fair though, I don't know&nbsp;if they are reading posts here or not. I have no evidence to support either. All I can tell is that since they have their
 own community forums which they use, maintain, support and all that fancy stuff, they are paying most of their attention for feedback there.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are looking&nbsp;to send&nbsp;343 Industries your feedback, I suggest posting in <a href="https://forums.halowaypoint.com/yaf_topics12_Halo-4.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
their forums</a> for the best possible chance of response. Other than that, forum here&nbsp;is just a&nbsp;discussion forum.</p>

<p>Either way, it's not very endearing. Since they don't pay much attention to what's actually going on in the forums, i.e. problems, I don't see that it matters. There is a problem currently going on with Halo 4 and if you post about it you might be banned...
 at minimum they will remove your forum threads and that's if you're lucky. Even independent posts within other' forum threads. Berate me if you wish, but I can't speak my mind at HaloWaypoint forums and some people I've convo'd with aren't as lucky as me,
 because they've been banned for no reason. Food for thought.</p>

<p>[/quote]Well, to be fair, if you're posting something against forum rules (whether you knew it or not), that's fair game to be banned or have a thread removed. I've seen A LOT of criticism on the Waypoint forums that hasn't gotten the poster banned/had the
 thread removed. Heck, I can speak out of personal experience as I had a somewhat heated debate with BS Angel (343i community manager) on the forums before Halo 4 launched. I didn't get banned and my posts are still there to read.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>If you post in a civil, constructive manner, your posts will not be removed. The vast majority of the mods are not employees of 343i, but outstanding community members who have earned the title. They express their opinions just as much as anyone else, so
 no, the Waypoint forums don't employ biased censorship in the manner you're accusing them of.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>"Problems" such as glitches are against forum rules to post about in most official and unofficial game forums (such as here) if that's what problem you're referring to in your post. Besides that, any other opinions you have (such as balancing issues) will
 be left for the world to see with the condition that you aren't blindly bashing 343i in your post(s).</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>I might also counter your assumption that they don't listen to us with the content of my first post in this thread. We have had TWO title updates since launch which have addressed major issues that the community wanted to see fixed. Looks like they're paying
 attention to me!</p>

<h2>            &#34;Windows 7 won&#39;t let iTunes 11 access the Internet.&#34;</h2>
                    I'm using Windows 7 32-bit on a laptop with ZoneAlarm free firewall/antivirus and Firefox 17.0.1 browser (not using IE 8 and IE 9 won't even load, so nuts to that).&nbsp; I didn't have problems with iTunes accessing the Internet until about two or three Windows
 Updates ago, when I was still using iTunes 10.x&nbsp; I figured maybe an iTunes update was in order, so I did that and updated to iTunes 11.&nbsp; That didn't connect to the internet, so I deleted it, shut down ZoneAlarm, and reinstalled iTunes.&nbsp; Still no Internet access
 even though I have a live Internet connection.&nbsp; I ran the iTunes diagnostic and discovered that Windows firewall -- which **should** be shut down when ZoneAlarm is running -- didn't allow iTunes outgoing access, so I fixed that.&nbsp; Still nothing, and this is
 with the browser able to connect with the network, so I know Internet access per se isn't the problem.&nbsp; So I shut down and exited ZoneAlarm; still nothing.&nbsp; Double-checked that Windows firewall allowed iTunes outgoing access; it does (in theory; at least it
 says it does), but STILL nothing - !<br />
<br />
This is stupid, because iTunes worked fine until recently.&nbsp; Is there something else going on here between Windows 7 and iTunes that I should know about??&nbsp; HELP!!!<br />

<p>File Explorer simply does not open from any of the 9 ways of accessing it that I am aware including what you suggest.</p>

            <p>I'm actually having the same problem as the original poster, and this method does not work. To give more background information, my explorer was working fine prior to an app download that took place today. I was no longer able to scan from my printer to
 my laptop because my Windows 10 would repeatedly tell me I do not have an app for this. I was able to print fine, I just couldn't scan. I ended up downloading the app through the settings menu &gt; devices &gt; printers. The apps were HP AiO remote and HP Scan and
 Capture. Afterwards I was able to scan and save my documents fine, but I was no longer able to use my explorer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restart my computer in which I now had to log on my email to have access (this setting was updated when I downloaded the app), and then every time I clicked the explorer it would freeze for a second or two, go black and then show my desktop or windows
 as they were before I clicked. If I did open a window, it simply closed it. I've tried restarting my computer, uninstalling the programs, and running sfc /scannow in the command prompt. The only way I've been able to access anything is from typing where I
 want to go in the search bar at the bottom or opening a system window. For example, I just type "documents" in the search and clicking the corresponding result or opening control panel then searching from the address bar or typing the file location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is any light you can shed to this situation it would be greatly appreciated.

    <title>Incomplete Games and a Loss of Faith and Trust - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> galactic geek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Incomplete Games and a Loss of Faith and Trust</h2>
                    
<p>Okay, so in another thread (Titanfall 6 Update), some forum-goers expressed their disinterest in Titanfall despite all of the updates that have come and are coming, which
 include bug fixes, new game modes, mechanics, etc. simply because they were upset about how little they received when the game first came out.</p>
<p>This premise made me realize that there's a sort of theme with this notion or line of thinking. It also kind of mirrors how some people feel that they've been burned by the Xbox One console itself - with how much wasn't available at the start, despite how
 many improvements we've had since, numerous people have turned away from the Xbox One. Other examples also include the poor reception Battlefield 4 received from consumers because of how it was obviously released incomplete and despite numerous updates, people
 still refuse to play it. Yet another example is Killer Instinct - despite being a free release and getting a few updates since its own launch, many people don't feel as if it's a full game unless you buy all of its "parts" or throw a chunk of money at it to
 get the full thing and so avoid purchasing it.</p>
<p>With these games and the Xbox One console in mind, how do you feel about this? Do you think many of these games were released incomplete or should have had much of its updates or DLC available at launch (which could, of course, potentially hold the release
 of the game back)? Do you think waiting to improve these games for the better could have hurt or improved sales? Do you feel burned by this or do you enjoy the fact that despite the games' rough start that they are indeed improving for the better? With the
 release of other consoles and the Xbox One and the timeframe available to the developers, do you think that holding back a game's release to add such improvements would have even been feasible?</p>
<p>IMO, although I think it's not necessarily a good thing to release a bare-bones type of game, I tend to judge it on a case-by-case basis (e.g. Titanfall was fine, but Battlefield 4 was not - the former was playable and the latter was a completely broken
 mess). In almost all of the examples, I have given above, I've weathered the storm and have been enjoying the games despite their numerous issues or lack of "game" because they've been improving regularly and have become even more fun as a result.</p>
<p>Personally, although I understand being upset about what many feel to be an incomplete game or console, I don't see any reason to remain upset about it after numerous updates and fixes are applied (no offense to those who may feel that way). Many people
 have even gone as far as declaring that they won't get a certain game because of how poorly they think it was handled to begin with, despite the many improvements since. IMO, those people are truly missing out.</p>
<p>In any case, that's my take. Now I'd like to know your responses to my opinion, this discussion, and more.</p>
<p>*As always with my discussions, please keep it respectful of others and their opinions, as well as on topic. ;)</p>

<p>Another example I just thought of that kind of goes in the opposite direction, is Minecraft. It's a game that's being held back on next-gen consoles because the developers want to ensure that all of the features are there to make their consumers happy. Meanwhile,
 many of those consumers are clamoring for them to go ahead and release the game anyways (after all, Minecraft on the Xbox 360 released with nowhere near the amount of features the PC version had and people still ate it up). I just wanted to add this into the
 discussion to show how there might even be some hypocrisy going around. Just some food for thought...</p>

<p>I absolutely think is is ridiculous that games are released unfinished, released with the thought "Release it Playable" and "We will fix it in the go". &nbsp;</p>
<p>Battlefield 4 was absolutely unacceptable (as a fan of the series), I will now not give their next game my sale. &nbsp;We as consumers need to realize that some of these Publishers push some games to make unreasonable deadlines. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I use the analogy "You would never let a uncleared plane take off, and say fix it mid-flight". &nbsp;To extreme? &nbsp;Fine... "You would never serve meat under prepared". &nbsp;</p>
<p>Titanfall's evolution is not in the same boat in my opinion. &nbsp;The game has evolved, not been "fixed". &nbsp;Like Battlefield 4</p>

<p>Also, another thought. &nbsp; Despite how "good" Battlefield 4 is (I enjoyed it despite it being nearly unplayable and then traded it in) and it being playable now. &nbsp;People are still playing it lets EA know that they can continue to do this. &nbsp;</p>

<p>^^To be fair to WD's the original E3 trailer back in 2012 was running on a high end PC. Next gen wasnt even announced yet. And then even at Sony's reveal I highly doubt Ubisoft had a dev kit. The doqngrade was definitely noticeable but if you thought the
 game would look like it originally did you are naive. </p>

            <p>I agree NxtDoc there is a huge difference between "fix as we go" and just mixing it up and adding new stuff. BF4 is an excellent example of a game that shipped clearly unfinished but they kicked it out the door anyways. Any game might need patches here and there but BF4 needed an overhaul.</p>
<p>In the case of Titanfall I found it to be a pretty polished and fun game on release. The Devs are keeping up and tweaking issues but they are also trying to keep the game fun by adding new gamemodes. I like this mentality. I think TF was great on release and continues to be great even this far after launch. </p>

<p>It's a first impressions thing. First impressions are VERY hard to change. If a game releases and is buggy or otherwise frowned upon by the masses, then 2 months later when that game is fixed and is now a shining star, it is still going to have a bad reputation
 and lots of people will avoid it.</p>
<p>Think about the top game franchises today that can't seem to lose. GTA, Halo, Call of Duty, Mario, Final Fantasy, Assassins Creed, Gran Turismo, Zelda, Metal Gear, and many more. They all have one thing in common, which is a relatively flawless release/experience.</p>
<p>EA seems to be an exception to the rule. I don't know if they're trying to do too much and simply not able to keep up, or what, but it they're building a bad reputation for themselves as a whole. However, they continue to thrive because they have an abundance
 of big game names under their umbrella. (The sims, pretty much anything sports related, Battlefield, etc.) One shining example of where they're failing is Fight Night Champion. There is a bug crippling pretty much a whole game mode and making 2 achievements
 unobtainable. That game has been out well long enough now for any major bugs like this to be resolved, and I have a feeling this one may never get fixed. If only they would see that if they spend the time/money to keep their reputation in check, they would
 make a boatload more than they do today.</p>

<p>I think Skrid makes an excellent point regarding the importance of 1st impressions. In particular, I'm also glad he brought up EA. I wonder if, as a publisher, EA is simply more slack on game release requirements when compared to other publishers.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Natural Ergonomic 4000 and IOGear KVM Switch</h2>
                    I Have 2 PC's connected to a single Keyboard, Display and Mouse with an IOGear GSC92 KVM Switch.&nbsp; My Microsoft Natural Elite that I've had for over 10 years and my Microsoft Wheel Optical Mouse worked perfectly and I've had no problems.&nbsp; On Black Friday,
 I got a great deal on a Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000.<br />
<br />
Of course, it won't work and I cant find any answers anywhere.&nbsp; Does anyone have a work around or is the a third party app that addresses this.&nbsp; Or do I have to dig my old Elite out of the dumpster and clean it up&nbsp; I dont have the room for 2 Keyboards.

    <title>Surface Pro 3 Pen Issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> heygert  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Pen Issues</h2>
                    <p>I am having a few issues with the Surface Pro 3 pen. I use the Pen in conjunction with OneNote on a daily basis, both to record the details of meetings and as an action planner. Recently the pen has been behaving very erratically - lots of squiggly, jagged
 lines as I write and the cursur jumps all over the place, and the pages jumps around randomly. I do write with the side of my hand on the screen but that was certainly never an issue with my previous Surface (the original Pro, "Pro 1"?). I also get gaps in
 in the ink quite frequently. I had none of these issues on my old Surface, and it makes for a pretty terrible experience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have changed the "AAAA" battery in the pen, and re-calibrated several times to no avail. It does seem that if I press particularly hard on the screen it improves the quality of the inking, but I have to bear down pretty hard and, quite frankly, I'm concerned
 about damaging either the pen or the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions are welcome and, as always, really appreciate the advice of this community.</p>

            <p>Thanks John1F. I realize that this is pretty unscientific, but based on something I read in another forum (can't remember where now or I'd give credit) I unchecked "Use Pen Pressure Sensitivity" under "Advanced Options" and that seemed to clear up the problem.
 I was in a three hour meeting this morning, writing throughout, and there were no issues. I just rechecked that option and and spent some time writing in OneNote and it's still working ok (no inking problems, no mad scrolling). I know that's not an exhaustive
 test but all seems good for the moment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have a second pen, unfortunately. I have ordered another from Amazon but it won't be here for a week or so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, and thanks for the point about holding the pen - i definitely hold it upright but thanks for checking on that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry this all can't be a little more empirical, but I'll post again if I have further troubles (hopefully others who have this issue will find this helpful).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>

            <p>I've improved the use of my pen by downloading the N-Trig drivers. &nbsp;Its still not as good as my original surface pro, but i would say its much better. &nbsp;I spoke with tech support and they gave me this link to update the driver</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/touch-mouse-and-search/troubleshoot-surface-pen#pressure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/touch-mouse-and-search/troubleshoot-surface-pen#pressure</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully it will help with other users as well. And also do to the fact i noticed a difference with this driver update, i think it may be possible to improve on the pen even more with further software update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tech support agent also said to try and replace the battery that came with the surface. Even tho it is only a week old they said low battery can also cause more jaggedness while inking. I will give it a shot and see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really wonder if there are users out there that are not having these issues at all, or if it is literally every surface that is out there.</p>

<h2>            Is this Trace Route Normal&#63; Access to Microsoft Downloads and Windows Update blocked by Charter, Google, et. al.</h2>
                    I was trying to update my computer while visiting relatives and I noticed that I received Code 80244019 for Windows Update. For other Microsoft download web sites, I got a message such as "unable to connect to server" from various web browsers. I can download
 files from the website of other companies but I am curious as to the opinions on why Microsoft download web sites and Windows Updates would be blocked in particular.<br />
<br />
<br />
The trace route I ran is listed below: <br />

            To anyone who may still be having issues with Windows Update being redirected to Google, check your DNS settings.&nbsp; They may be set manually to a DNS server which is intentionally blocking your access to Microsofts's servers.
