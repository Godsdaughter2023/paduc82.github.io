<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error Code 0xc0000017 means there isn’t enough memory available to create a ramdisk device. You’ll need to use recovery tools. If you don’t have installation media (like a disc or USB device). The causes of Error Code 0xc0000017 are Windows Firewall blocking
 the installation and Temporary files location is possibly infected with active malware.&nbsp; To sort this concern, kindly follow the steps below to resolve Windows&nbsp;Error 0XC0000017:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: &nbsp;</strong><strong>Check for corrupt system files</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Press <strong>Windows</strong> Key + <strong>R</strong>. Run Dialogue Box will open up.<br />
2. Type <strong>CMD</strong> and Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>3. In command Prompt Copy following commands (<em>Simply select the command and hold&nbsp;Ctrl+C and press Ctrl+V in command prompt</em>)</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">&nbsp;sfc /scannow&nbsp;</span> </p>
<p>The system will take some time to check. Let it run for a while. If it finds any issues in “os” integrity it will automatically fix&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> You will need <strong>Administrator</strong> Access to Run the above command. Simply Right Click on
<strong>CMD</strong> button and select “<strong>Run as Administrator</strong>”</p>
<br />
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> <strong>Temporarily Disable any installed 3rd Party Antivirus</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Some times Antivirus/Malware/Adware programs mark Microsoft Windows&nbsp;installer files as Spam and block it from installing. Please refer your vendors website&nbsp;for disabling it temporarily. Once installation is done you can activate it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In most cases Microsoft&nbsp;Windows update&nbsp;error 0XC0000017 should be resolved by following above steps. If however the issue still persists it means there is some critical issue with your system which needs to be fixed manually and is recommended to be done
 by an&nbsp;experienced Computer Technician.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For any other concerns, don't hesitate to get back to us.<br />
<br />
Regards.</p>

<h2>            Get me out of Microsoft Update</h2>
                    <p>I thought I would try upgrading to Microsoft Update, because I use MS Word. But its first offering was an update for Visual Basic, which I don't have.
</p>
<p>Shouldn't the site know what is on my system and what is not? </p>
<p>How do I go back to Windows Update and ditch the Microsoft part?</p>
<p>The chat support person I had was useless. </p>

    <title>which version of windows 7 sp1 do I need&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> amy s. 1232  say:</h3>
<h2>            which version of windows 7 sp1 do I need&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I had to replace the hard drive in my sony vaio laptop (2009)&nbsp;and several things (such as windows update) do not work. It looks like I need to download the intel rapid storage driver (not sure which one) but it says that the computer needs SP1 already installed.
 We have Home Premium 64 bit.</p>
<p>Does anyone know which option I should choose on SP1?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any suggestions!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Does it actually list Service Pack 1 under Windows Edition?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
<span>
</span></p><p>Windows 7 SP1 is provided in two ways, either as a full .ISO file download weighing in at 2.4 GBs or as an update available through Windows Update. The .ISO file contains SP1 code for different processor architectures such as x86, x86-x64 and Itanium systems.
 Because I have a mixture of 32 and 64 bit systems, I went with the .ISO file. Whichever method you choose, here are some tips for ensuring a smooth installation.</p>
<p><span>* Getting Windows Update errors with Windows 7 SP1? MS notes "inconsistencies," provides fix:
</span><a href="http://is.gd/22brle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://is.gd/22brle</span></a></p>
<span>
<p>* 1. Click on Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories, and right-click on Command Prompt.</p>
<p>2. Choose Run As and select an Administrator account.</p>
<p>3. At the command prompt, type net stop cryptsvc and wait for the service to stop.</p>
<p>4. Type CD\ and press Enter.</p>
<p>5. Type CD windows\system32 and press Enter.</p>
<p>6. Type ren catroot2 catroot3 and press Enter.</p>
<p>Other solutions:</p>
<p>1. Make sure you install the latest updates for Windows 7, your applications and device drivers. This can ensure a smooth experience I noticed, although Windows 7 SP1 is minor, you don’t want to take any chances. If you are updating through Windows Update,
 it also guarantees a smaller update since only missing patches will be applied.</p>
<p>2. Backup – you can never go wrong with backing up; this is something you should do often even when you are not making major changes to your computer. Windows 7 has made it very easy tobackup your computer . The built in system imaging and backup and restore
 center makes it convenient to back up the operating system and all your critical data. In fact, I used this to test the beta and RC releases of SP1 on my production system. This method carried its risks, but at least I knew my RTM installation was safely backed
 up and tucked away from pre-release code.</p>

<span>
<p>3. Don’t do it during a major project, if you have something you are working on at the moment on your computer or in the middle of an assignment or work related project which you might need your PC for, don’t install the Service Pack right away. Do it in
 your off time, such as on the weekend or when you know you can leave your PC while it installs itself automatically. My installation took over 2 hours.</p>
<p>4. This brings me to another point, which is, don’t install SP1 on a laptop on battery power, it’s a CPU intensive task and will use up most of your battery power. So make sure your laptop is connected to power. For desktop users, I strongly recommend you
 have a UPS connected, you just don’t know when the unexpected can occur. You might just be in the last lap of completing the 2 hour installation and lose power.</p>
<p>5. Disable your Antivirus, I remember installing the SP1 beta with Microsoft Security Essentials version 1 installed and received an error that my Antivirus is not compatible. Although this was resolved, your experience might vary. I haven’t experienced
 the issue in the RTM code although I am running Microsoft Security Essentials version 2. Someone reported receiving an error message about Forefront Client Security not allowing the Service Pack to install. The recommendation is to disable Forefront which
 is based on the same core scanning engine as MSE or make sure you at least have the latest version of Forefront client security installed.</p>
<p>6. Another thing you should do is a clean boot before installing the Service Pack, you can do this by:</p>
<p>* Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>* Accept User Account Control permission</p>
<p>* If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.</p>
<p>* On the General tab, click Selective Startup.</p>
<p>* Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</p>
<p>* Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.</p>
<p>* Click OK.</p>
<p>* When you are prompted, click Restart.</p>
<p>* After the computer starts, proceed with the installation.</p>
<p>7. Another task you should try is to check your hard disk for errors:</p>
<p>* Click Start</p>
<p>* Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD</p>
<p>* Click ‘Run as Administrator’</p>
<p>* At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f</p>
<p>When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 reinstalls itself, over itself, then hangs</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using W10 on my main machine for a while with 0 problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I work from a home office as a web designer and have a habit of leaving the machine on when i go to bed so it can download and install updates automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning I walked into my office and the machine is displaying the upgrading windows screen for W10 and it is stuck at 100% with no hard drive activity. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first i thought i would just leave it to do its thing but after an hour and a half the screen has not changed. &nbsp;I decided to restart, but again, over an hour later its still on the upgrading windows 100% screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already had to do some client work on my smartphone which is less than ideal. &nbsp;I desperately need this machine running as son as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone help please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ian</p>

<h2>            Windows firewall blocks everything</h2>
                    Within the past week the firewall started prompting me to allow every single app i use. Chrome, Steam, other things that periodically check for updates. I click Allow, but it doesn't save my preferences. I've tried restoring defaults within the firewall.
 Windows is up to date.

            <p>Having the same problem and noticed it started recently on both my Windows 10 and old Windows 7 machine. Makes me suspect an update is to blame. Tried uninstalling all the updates I could, but problem persists.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also found that if I turn on file and printer sharing, it reverts to off. The only way I am able to keep sharing on is to disable windows firewall service. As soon as firewall is active again, file and printer sharing turns off.</p>

            <p>There was a large update recently that kept failing through the usual method, so i installed it manually and it worked fine. This happened within the past couple weeks and my issue started after that, but not sure if it was immediate. Since i did the repair
 install the update history shows nothing prior to yesterday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not sure what you want me to do from the checklist shy of wiping it and doing a clean installation.&nbsp;<strong><span>sfc /scannow
</span></strong><span>comes up with no errors. Malwarebytes finds nothing. All excess processes have been turned off and i went through the repair install.</span></p>

<p>Hi Austin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Consumers will never receive a call from Microsoft or our partners asking for a credit card number to charge for computer fixes. Cybercriminals often use the names of well-known companies, like Microsoft, to convince people their services are legitimate.
 Our guidance for consumers is to never provide your personal information to unsolicited callers and or e-mailers, and if they are having a problem with their PC, contact Microsoft Customer Service and Support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your reference, here's one way of verifying if a company is an affiliated Microsoft solution provider:
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/solution-providers/search" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Find a Microsoft solution provider</a>. Scammers aim to make you believe that you have a problem with your PC and that they're the only ones who could fix it for you. The best thing to do if you receive these calls is to hang up the phone. We've published several
 articles that you can check for more information: </p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t set o&#37; to max disk usage for system protection</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I installed:</p>
<p>1. windows 7 x64 ultimate on my dell inspiron n5010</p>
<p>2. sp1</p>
<p>3. checked for updates and install all of them. restart and check again until there were no more updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>system protection is on for C: and uses 5% of the disk space. Cool!</p>
<p>I've just decided to see if I could turn that off and set the disk usage to 0%</p>
<p>of course turning it off is easy. the problem is that i can't reduce the disk usage below 1% (763.11 Mb). Why is that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried many ways:</p>
<p>1. deleted all restore points while the protection was on and then tried to set it to 0%.... didn't work</p>
<p>2. turned it off and then tried to set it to 0% .... no success</p>
<p>3. deleted service pack backup, restarted and .... no success</p>
<p>4. deleted updates backup, restarted and .... no success</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a desktop pc too. windows 7 x64 fully updated and same set of programs and I'm able to set max disk usage to 0% on that system</p>

<p>I didn't say hello last time. sorry about thatThe same situation is true about my desktop. I'm terribly sorry that I said I was able to set 0% for desktop pc. My mistake.</p>
<p>By running the second command an error occurs and a message is displayed. Among lots of information there it says the maximum must be more than 300MB. I was able to set it 320MB. That's as far as I could go. After that it shows 0% (320.00MB) in system protection
 configuration menu.</p>

<p>Beware!!! Don't play with "Max Usage" cursor. It will go back to 1% even if you just touch it (not move it)</p>

            <p>Hi Sylvia,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like the HDD is being bypassed and the unit is booting directly to the network. Can you try to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Boot into the BIOS (press Fn+F2 on power-up) and check if the HDD is getting detected on the Information Tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important: </strong><span><span><em>Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly.
 Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</em><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If the HDD's detected, navigate to the Boot Tab and ensure it's the first boot. If it still fails, try to disable UEFI and press F10 to save and exit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the HDD's not detected, you may need to contact lenovo for service as there's most likely a defect on the HDD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

            Bing bar is a product of Microsoft that updates through Microsoft updates. Anything offered by Microsoft update is definitely not a virus, it is just a coincidence that you are receiving the updates for it every day.
If you do not use Bing bar, you can uninstall it from Control Panel&gt;Programs and features and select Bing Bar&gt;Uninstall. More instructions here:

    <title>Language bar BUG. Not installed ENGlish appears from nowhere. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hale_ru  say:</h3>
<h2>            Language bar BUG. Not installed ENGlish appears from nowhere.</h2>
                    
<p>Sometimes English language(input) appears as input language.</p>
<p>It is neither installed nor seen in input languages setup (right button-&gt; settings-&gt;installed services)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it is seen somehow on language bar. And it causes nuisance when switching between languages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can remove it in only one way: by installing ENGlish/US on top in normal way and then uninstalling it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S. I use Japanese as main language as it already includes English input as one of IME modes.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Try the steps listed below:</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 1:</span></span></strong><span><span><br />
a. Go to Start &gt; Control Panel &gt; Regional and Language Options<br />
b. In Regional Options tab, choose another language. <br />
c. Go to Languages Tab &gt; Details<span>&nbsp; </span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>d. Highlight and choose to remove "English United States"<span>&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>e. If English US is not listed, you may try to add it and delete it as you mentioned in your post.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 2</span></span></strong><span><span>: Copy your Regional and Language
 settings to all new users on your computer or network. <br />
a. After opening the Regional and Language options go to the Administrative tab. <br />
b. Click on the Copy to reserved accounts button. <br />
Now a small box will appear<br />
c. If you check the box next to default user account, any new usernames made on the computer will adopt the same settings. This will be used as a template for future accounts.<br />
d. If you check System accounts, the keyboard layout and display language for the Welcome screen are updated.</span></span></p>

            I definitely pointed, that THERE's NO "English".<br />
<br />
<br />
You are talking about "e. If English US is not listed, you may try to add it and delete it "<br />
<br />
THIS IS NOT A SOLUTION to obvious windows bug!<br />
<br />
It is not even workaround.<br />
<br />
<br />
"Copy your Regional and Language settings to all new users on your computer or network."<br />
<br />
Already done. Doesn't help. It helps only in multiuser apps&nbsp; (some apps are using virtual restricted accounts for instance) to solve profile conflicts, that is not a bug at all, but problem of architecture.<br />

english appears from nowhere in the language bar.<br />
This happens irregularly, when I am switching the language by a predefined short-cut "Alt+Shift"<br />

            nothing wrong with the question or location, but the thread is old and because of new processes and upkeep I asked that you start a new thread with all your information. That will allow for tracking of answers and issues, as well as to bring the issue
 back in front of the community. <br />
If a moderator marks one of your questions answered, simply un mark it...simple. Once again, it one of the tools the community uses to track issues.
<br />
Wooosaaa, say it with me...Wooosaaa! LOL<br />
Life is too short to be angry in an online post, just ask your questions and the community will do it's best to answer them, or at the very least point you in the best direction to get those answers!<br />
hope this helps,<br />

            <p>This is a <strong>fundamental problem</strong> of Microsoft windows IME. And Microsoft fundamentally
<strong>ignores </strong>its existence.</p>
<p>All they do is wasting your time with useless suggestions like "reinstall", "backup", "pretend you don't see it". I would suggest, moving to Apple, or Linux is also an option...</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>It happens always when you access other user profiles from current japanese-enabled user profile</strong>.</p>
<p>Even when the program creates <strong>secure temporary user profile</strong> (like some network games, or servers) -
<strong>just </strong><strong>accessing</strong> that program or profile will create
<strong>orphaned</strong> <strong>US/E</strong><strong>Nglish </strong><strong>input
</strong>in IME.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You<strong> can not</strong> just delete it.</p>
<p>To delete it you need to add US_EN/US_keyboard <strong>on top of that</strong> orphaned input and delete it finally.
</p>
<p>You need to do it <strong>every time</strong> you use your secure program or accessing new user profile from your current user.</p>

    <title>Gamerscore reset, and why I hate Microsoft - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chewvodka  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gamerscore reset, and why I hate Microsoft</h2>
                    
<p>So I logged into Xbox LIve today.&nbsp; I haven't been on for a while, work causes me to miss out on a lot of online gaming, just ask my friends that I DO play with.&nbsp; I do play offline occasionally though.&nbsp; It's been maybe 4 days since I last logged in.&nbsp; Today
 I noticed right away that my Gamerscore had been changed from around 300,000 to 10.&nbsp; At first I thought this was a mistake, and I was misreading it.&nbsp; I had just purchased an Indie game and thought perhaps this was my remaining credit balance.&nbsp; But no, it was
 definately 10 gamerscore.&nbsp; However, when I went into the profile and looked at my games, it still showed all my earned achievments, so I thought to myself "this must be something wrong with my profile" like it was corrupted or something.&nbsp; So I erased the profile
 and re-downloaded it.&nbsp; Once downloaded, I noticed my game group had changed to "Cheater" and my gamerscore is still at 10.&nbsp; Also, now all my earned achievments on the game list shows 0's.&nbsp; I don't know what happened.&nbsp; I don't 'cheat' or anything.&nbsp; I went to
 the support page and they say very clearly that they do an extensive 100% verification before any such reset is made.&nbsp; I'd like to know what they discovered that provided a 100% verification.&nbsp; As I said, I don't cheat.&nbsp; I'll grant you, there were achievements
 I had earned offline that Xbox Live wouldn't have detected the moment I unlocked them, but that's no reason to reset me.&nbsp; I've been doing it this way for 4 years and never had a problem before.&nbsp; It's very upsetting.&nbsp; As far as I can tell, somebody must have
 hacked my console and made changes to my profile.&nbsp; Trouble is, I don't know how they could do it.&nbsp; I thought the Xbox had some kind of firewall built into it that would prevent hackers.&nbsp; When I first got my Xbox, I had to make port forwarding adjustments on
 my router just so the Xbox could connect through the internet.&nbsp; The only way a hacker could get access then would be to get into my Xbox through one of those opened ports.&nbsp; I don't see how they can access an Xbox while it's the ports are in use, and if it's
 turned off for that matter.&nbsp; So how is it possible that my account was hijacked?&nbsp; I'm very upset about this, and when I go to try to research this, I'm constantly being shown results of Microsoft being unwilling to provide any details into the matter.&nbsp; Their
 support topic shows that the would be hackers use a program or something to modify the account.&nbsp; What program is this?&nbsp; Is there a way I could search my computer to see if I have been infected by a virus that might have done it?&nbsp; What should I look for?&nbsp; I
 don't want to get my new achievments removed and possibly my account banned for something I'm not even doing.&nbsp; Also, why does Microsoft have to be so anal about giving details in the first place?&nbsp; You would think that if they cared that much about it, they'd
 provide a little more information.&nbsp; I don't see why they find it necessary to reset my account that had only 300,000 gamerscore when I've seen players that are obviously cheating (really REALLY good in Halo 4) with 1,500,000+ gamerscore and&nbsp;a flag of 9&nbsp;or
 so years of live service.&nbsp; It's outrageous.&nbsp; I pay Microsoft to have access to their services, I buy their games, and they turn around and say I cheat and lie and steal achievements that I know full well I spent HOURS earning.&nbsp; Who do you complain to when
 you're being mistreated?&nbsp; Bill Gates?&nbsp; The system is wrong, I've never done the things they say I do/did, and I don't even know how it's possible.&nbsp; Won't somebody give me the answers?</p>

<p>Yeah I already posted a message there first. &nbsp;It said it needed to pass moderator scrutiny first. &nbsp;Been a while, they're probably realizing they screwed up and shouldn't have reset me. &nbsp;I just can't believe they would single me out when I just know there
 are people out there who get by with a ton of other stuff, especially when I did nothing wrong.</p>

<p>They get tons and tons of upset gamers who have been banned every day.</p>
<p>The reason it needs to pass moderator scrutiny first is to make sure there is no explicit language, 'name and blame' information, etc. There was a reason why this happened, and the judgement stands.</p>

<p>It IS possible in cases like this that someone else accessed the account, violated the rules, and got enforcement taken against the account. &nbsp;It's happened before (granted, not terribly often). &nbsp;Before anyone leaps to the "can't be hacked" answer, I'm open
 to the possibility of social engineering leading to compromised accounts. &nbsp;First question I usually ask is, and I'll ask the OP now, when you signed on recently, did you ever get a message telling you that your account was last signed on to another Xbox console?</p>

<p>Hello Vodka. &nbsp;I just wanted to confirm that resetting a GamerScore is something that only the Enforcement team would be able to do. &nbsp;Posting in those Forums is a good step for getting further clarification. &nbsp;You can also check out the information here under

<p>As it stands right now, my post I made to the appropriate forum has still NOT been posted, and still waiting for moderator approval. &nbsp;What is the turn around time for something like this? &nbsp;I don't want to post another message about the same issue. &nbsp;I'd like
 to know what proof they have, and when I had supposedly 'done the deed'. &nbsp;I've always been a good user. &nbsp;I wouldn't buy a subscription if I didn't think it valuable. &nbsp;Only idiots abuse something they pay for. &nbsp;I'm just aggrevated that I can't get any answers.</p>

<p>Hey ChewVodka, I understand the frustration. The best thing to do is wait for that response from the Enforcement team. Often times you'll receive the response to your Microsoft Account email so make sure to check there for a mail from XBLPET!

            Hi irfan3 ... As far as i am aware you should have all those options.
<br />For system restore to tell go to search and type create a restore point.
<br />If it comes that works.
<br />And for resets go to start - settings - update and security - recovery.
<br />See what options you have in there.

<h2>            password change and Skype linked to hotmail</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just requested a password change on my Skype account and during the process the site linked my Skype account to my hotmail account.</p>
<p>Can I just unlink it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And by the notification my new password to Skype will be valid from next month only. I have left my returned company laptop with my skype account logged in, yeah, stupid me...but it was advised to me to change the password for Skype on my own laptop so when
 next time someone is opening Skype on company's laptop, automatically it will need a password to log in. Now I am not so sure if that Skype account will ask for password..</p>
<p>
</p><p>It all seems Chinese to me...how to fix this? There is nothing extra in my Skype conversations, I just feel it that my privacy will suffer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p><span>Hello isabel1111,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, once a Microsoft account has been linked to a Skype account, there is no option to have it unlinked.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Could you
<strong>try signing in using your Skype name,</strong> instead of your email address?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please be advised that to access accounts, you have to
<strong>use the credentials you've used in creating the account.</strong> If you used the Skype name, log in using the same.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know of the results.<span>&nbsp;

<h2>            LifeChat LX-3000 &#39;The drivers for this device are not installed. &#40;Code 28&#41;&#39; Windows 7 64-bit</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>

<p>I purchased this headset today and have had nothing but trouble trying to get it installed on my Windows 7 machine. The headset works (without needing to install anything, it automatically installed the driver) on my Vista machine, but Windows 7 will not
 do anything with it.</p>
<p>I have tried re-installing the latest software linked in other similar threads many times with no success.</p>
<p>Windows 7 does not recognise the device in the audio playback tab and gives me the warning 'The drivers for this device are not installed. (Code 28)' in Device manager.</p>
<p>Where can I get the driver I need?</p>
<p>The LX-3000 page states that the headset should be compatible with my OS</p>

<h2>            Xbox one parental control problems</h2>
                    I had previously added my account to an old roommates Xbox which had parental control activated, months later I purchased a used Xbox one and since then the parental lock of his account has still be on for my new Xbox, I have reached out to this individual
 and have had no response back for months, I cannot purchase or change anything with my account due to this and have no way of taking this off of my account. I am running out of options to turn to and was hoping I can get a little support with getting this
 figured out.

<p>Hi AderallAdmiral,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Xbox One safety features enable you to control what kinds of content each of your family members can access on Xbox One by providing parental controls to child Xbox account.
</span><span>To give you an idea, child Xbox accounts needs to have a parent Xbox account associated to give parental controls. If your account is requesting a parental control, there's a possibility that your account is a child Xbox account which is added
 to the Xbox Family on the old Xbox One. </span><span>Regarding your concern,&nbsp; let's try to confirm if your account is a child account or an adult account. Kindly sign into
<em><strong><a href="https://account.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com</a></strong></em>, then go to
<strong>Family</strong> tab. You should be able to see the parent account associated.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the parent account associated is available, I suggest that you sign in the parent Xbox account on the console to allow your child Xbox account to make a purchase or play multiplayer. You may refer to this
<em><strong><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/security/core-family-safety-features" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong></em> as your guide on how you can manage the privacy and online safety settings of the child Xbox account.</span></p>
<p><span>If your account is already an adult Xbox account and no parent account associated, I suggest that you change your privacy and online safety by signing on to your Xbox account on the Xbox One and perform the following steps:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>From <strong>Home</strong>, go to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>All Settings</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Privacy &amp; online safety</strong>, select<strong> Xbox Live privacy</strong>.</li><li>Choose a default, or customize your settings by selecting <strong>View details &amp; customize</strong>.</li><li>Restart your console once you're done.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Keep us updated with the results after performing the suggested solutions above.</span></p>

<h2>            US Only&#58;  Limited Time Trade In Surface RT&#47;Surface 2 for new Surface 3</h2>
                    <blockquote>Split from <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_devices/please-do-not-try-to-install-windows-10-on-the-new/ddbf7fa7-2135-43ba-9b91-05b738a10096" title="Split from this thread">
this thread.</a></blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>For a limited time, Microsoft is offering a trade-in for Surface RT and Surface 2 devices, up to $150.00 towards a Surface 3.</p>
<p>I posted the link to the site&nbsp;<a href="http://microsoftsurfacetrade.cexchange.com/online/home/index.rails" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://microsoftsurfacetrade.cexchange.com/online/home/index.rails</a></p>
<p>but it just slipped into oblivion. &nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">This is a limited time deal with only about 3 weeks left.</span> &nbsp;Would it be appropriate to create a sticky about this? &nbsp;Though this is a Windows 10 preview forum, it seems relevant
 to the WinRT/Surface2 adopters that can't experience the full Windows 10 environment and may feel abandoned.</p>
<p>

            <p>There is a similar offer in Canada.&nbsp; You have to physically go to a Microsoft Store to get it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just returned from a Microsoft Store in Vancouver BC where they confirmed this, showed it to me on an internal website, but could not provide me with a public link. Sorry about that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The rebates are more generous on Surface 3 than they are on Surface Pro 3.</p>
