<h2>            installing programs for several users</h2>
                    I work in a office that has a network server, several computers and several users that travel to each computer. How do I install programs so that each user when signing in is able to use the program. I have installed it under administrator and when another
 user signs in it does not show up. When I tried to install the program with each user signed in, it wouldn't allow me to install it. I wasn't given the option to override with administrator and password.&nbsp; Please help I have a few computers with XP and a few
 newer computers with Windows 7.&nbsp; The programs i am trying to install are Microsoft Office and a Kodak Web Camera to take snap shots.&nbsp;&nbsp; Could really use the help. Thank you Hunt IV

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Any application that's been properly designed for use on Windows 7 would either give the person performing the installation the option of making the application available to all users, or do so automatically, by default.&nbsp; This is entirely the responsibility
 of the application's programmers, and beyond Microsoft control.&nbsp; So, the easiest way, of course, is to use an application that's designed for a multi-user OS. But, sadly, that isn't always an option, where businesses must rely on legacy proprietary applications.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; If the legacy application you're installing places its shortcuts only in the Start Menu of the person performing the installation, all that you may have to do is move those Start Menu entries to the same location in the C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start
 Menu\Programs folder and/or the C:\Users\Public\Public Desktop folder.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Further, such an incompatible application may offer additional "challenges:"<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; You may experience some problems if the software was designed for Win9x/Me, or if it was intended for WinNT/2K/XP,Vista/Win7, but was improperly designed. Quite simply, the application doesn't "know" how to handle individual user profiles with differing
 security permissions levels, or the application is designed to make to make changes to "off-limits" sections of the Windows registry or protected Windows system folders.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; For example, saved data are often stored in a sub-folder under the application's folder within C:\Program Files - a place where no inexperienced or limited user should ever have write permissions.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; It may even be that the software requires "write" access to parts of the registry or protected systems folders/files that are not normally accessible to regular users.&nbsp; (This<strong>won't</strong> occur if the application is properly written.)&nbsp; If this
 does prove to be the case, however, you're often left with three options:&nbsp; Either grant the necessary users appropriate higher access privileges (either as Power Users or local administrators), explicitly grant normal users elevated privileges to the affected
 folders and/or part(s) or the registry, or replace the application with one that was properly designed specifically for WinNT/2K/XP/Vista/Win7.</p>
<p>Some Programs Do Not Work If You Log On from Limited Account<br />

&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Additionally, here are a couple of tips suggested, in a reply to a<br />
different post, by MS-MVP Kent W. England:</p>
<p>"If your game or application works with admin accounts, but not with limited accounts, you can fix it to allow limited users to access the program files folder with "change" capability rather than "read" which is the default.</p>
<p>C:\&gt;cacls "Program Files\appfolder" /e /t /p users:c</p>
<p>where "appfolder" is the folder where the application is installed.</p>
<p>If you wish to undo these changes, then run</p>
<p>C:\&gt;cacls "Program Files\appfolder" /e /t /p users:r</p>
<p>NOTE:&nbsp; On Win7 Icacls.exe provides better control.</p>
<p>If you still have a problem with running the program or saving settings on limited accounts, you may need to change permissions on the registry keys. Run regedit.exe and go to HKLM\Software\vendor\app, where "vendor\app" is the key that the software vendor
 used for your specific program. Change the permissions on this key to allow Users full control."</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We suggest that you perform the steps below to isolate and resolve the issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Perform a <strong><span><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot.</a></span></span></strong><strong>
</strong>It will start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and start up programs. It also helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program, or an update, or when you run a program in Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: </strong>If that doesn't help, try performing a <strong><span><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">system restore</a></span></span></strong>, and see if
 it helps. <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">System Restore is a way to undo system changes by using restore points to return your system files and settings to an earlier point in time without affecting personal files of users. Please take note that w</span><span><span>hen
 you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed after the restore point has been created will be&nbsp;removed.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Let us know the result.</span></span></p>
<p>

            Start by running the Windows Store Apps troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down to the bottom
<br />Click Windows Store Apps
<br />
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete try opening the Store again.
<br />
<br />Also check if the Store works in another user account. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: wsreset.exe
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Do this a couple times then try launching the Store again.
<br />
<br />Your Antivirus might be interfering with the Store, try disabling it 'temporarily' to see if it launches. 
<br />
<br />Check Windows Update and install the latest updates. Sometimes Microsoft releases infrastructure fixes for the Store through Windows Update.
<br />
<br />You can also try resetting the store app using the following instructions:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-store-apps-features/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />Reinstall the Store:
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Windows PowerShell (Admin) 
<br />At the command prompt, type the following then hit Enter: 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage *WindowsStore* -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />If that does not work, try resetting the software distribution folder:
<br /> Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /F /FI "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed.
<br />
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.

<p>Hi Frances,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the post. Regarding the phone icon, did you mean the Phone in the Skype for Business panel?
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ffc3eaa9-7e4e-4f56-a668-bbebb58fef0d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ffc3eaa9-7e4e-4f56-a668-bbebb58fef0d?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If so, you can try the following suggestions below.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Sign out your account and delete the sign-in info, then re-sign in again.</p>
<p>2. Press Ctrl key and right-click Skype for Business in Task bar, then select <strong>
Configuration Information</strong>. In the pop up, find whether the <strong>Telephony Mode</strong> is Enabled.
</p>

<p>If it’s disabled like the picture above, the phone system won’t support. And you need to delete the SIP profile to make service re-connect to the server. Please sign out your account and exit Skype for Business, then follow the path below to remove your
 profile. As a side note, you can just move the folder to another place to avoid data loss.</p>
<p><strong>C:\Users\%username%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Lync</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And if the issue persists, I’d like to collect more information for the further investigation.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. May I know your detailed subscription plan? </p>
<p>2. Please capture a screenshot of the Configuration Information window for me.
</p>
<p>3. Besides, please navigate to <strong>Help</strong> &gt; <strong>About Skype for Business</strong> and send me the screenshot of the version info.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Marvin</p>

<p><span>Hi Mehraj,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As a matter of fact, it's an expected behavior in Mac. Because of the different operating systems, some features of Skype for Business are also different. In Mac, the Current Call window won't
 display video after you switching windows. In this scenario, you can try to feedback in
<a href="https://www.skypefeedback.com/forums/299910-recently-released/category/182914-skype-for%20business%20mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Skype for Business UserVoice</a> website to suggest this feature.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Besides, since Microsoft is <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/journey-skypeforbusiness-teams" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
upgrading Skype for Business to Teams</a>, you can also suggest the feature in <a href="https://microsoftteams.uservoice.com/forums/555103-public?category_id=195943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Teams for Mac UserVoice</a> website since Skype for Business will retire in the future. We kindly appreciate for your understanding.</span></p>

            <p>More than likely not. &nbsp;They took it away (most likely) due to performance issues with running multiple things at once. So if it does come back, it would be likely to be in a later update. &nbsp;</p><p>-Caleb</p>

You would need to buy a retail version of winxp, if you can, and clean install. Theres nothing you can do with the winxp home version as its an oem version tied to the PC

            A retail version of windows can be installed on a <strong>single device</strong> that has the hardware capabilities to run that version of windows.<br />
And if that device is later scrapped you can reinstall on another single device.<br />
<br />
An oem version of windows is tied to the first device it is installed on, so is not transferable

            When I open settings, under which of the categories shown (e.g., system, network &amp; Internet, accounts, update &amp; security, privacy, etc) will I find Passwords &amp; autofill?&nbsp; I search Settings for Password and none of the options (sign in, change, sync, set

</p><p>What has been annoying is that Edge asks if I want to save the password on a site.&nbsp; Could it be that Microsoft/Edge want to save passwords and even if the setting is already off, the question will continue to be asked?</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I was dragged -- screaming and protesting -- to Windows 10 18 months ago.&nbsp; Sometimes my brain is still functioning in Windows 7 and sometimes back in XP.&nbsp; The previous advisor provided screen shots that got me where I needed to be.&nbsp;
 Since save passwords was already set to off, I wonder why Edge keeps asking me if I want to save a password on a site.&nbsp; It makes me wonder if Edge understands that 'no' means 'no'.</p>

            <p>Hi Berlix,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the update on&nbsp;the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has a technology that we support, which defines a protocol to connect an external monitor or TV to a device, and therefore can roughly be described as "HDMI over Wifi", replacing the cable from the computer to the display.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>I would suggest you to refer to the article below which explains the process to project a wireless display with Miracast.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/project-wireless-screen-miracast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Project to a wireless display with Miracast</a></span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Your tablet&nbsp;has android platform. To&nbsp;do the&nbsp;screen mirroring&nbsp;from your tab to your Dell monitor,&nbsp;&nbsp;I recommend you to contact
<a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Samsung </a>and check with them if they have such technology.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Hope this information is helpful. Pease post back for further assistance, we'll be glad to assist you.</p>

<h3> geofflees  say:</h3>
<h2>            Clean Install of Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have downloaded the Media Creation Tool and the ISO.&nbsp; I have transferred the ISO to a 32gb Cruzer Blade USB stick but, when I change the boot sequence on my pc to the USB it is not recognised and I get a message saying that it can't find a flash drive
 or words to that effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The USB stick does appear in the directory when I go into File Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can get the installation going by using the USB stick but only by clicking on 'Set-UP'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any reason why the system will not boot from the USB when instructed to.</p>
<p>

            <p>The ISO should be on a DVD the media creation tool on USB in my humble opinion, just from what I have tried.</p>
<p>I had to format my new W10 upgrade as I couldn't get back to windows 7 and was locked out.</p>
<p>Did you get the version for your windows? x32 x64?</p>
<p><span>Did you download the tool on another PC?</span><br />
<span>Created installation media for another PC</span><span>.</span><br />
Does your motherboard have a set of specific keys to access setup, you see these when you first boot? the name of the mainboard and the keys to use?<br />
Mine was F12 for boot order then ctrl+s to enter setup, &nbsp;then wait for the USB Media Creation Tool to load.choose not to keep the files. I didn't take any photos of my recent re-install of windows 10 but it went flawlessly using the USB Media Tool setting my
 motherboard to run setup ctrl+s. It was a clean install and my files were in windows .old</p>

            <p>Many computers can't automatically boot from a USB flash drive, because the boot loader doesn't know what's on the other end of the USB connector: is it storage or is it a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/product/ede3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">squirming

<p>
</p><p>You have to interrupt the boot sequence and instruct the computer to boot from a USB flash drive. OEMs provide for this in different ways. For example, in my vintage Dell desktop I press the F12 key while the computer is restarting, which brings me to a
 screen where I select the device to boot from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your OEM (computer manufacturer) can tell you what function key to press and what steps to follow in order to boot from a USB flash drive.</p>

            <p>Hi again MereteT, yes I did try in the first instance to save the file to the USB stick but I got the message that it couldn't find/locate a flash drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Saving the file to my pc seemed to happen automatically, the Media Creation Tool appeared in the 'Download' folder and the ISO turned up in the 'Documents' folder without any prompting from me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC is a Dell Studio XPS 7100</p>

            <p>The method I provided always works for me. That's how I did my clean install. It's also how I restore backups of my system partition, test my malware software, and other tasks that need to boot from USB flash drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A USB storage device is not a defined term but most people understand that to mean a storage device that connects to the computer with a USB connector. As you know, there are lots of these. A 'flash drive' aka 'thumb drive' aka 'stick drive' is that rectangular
 thing. A USB hard drive aka portable drive aka external drive is a hard drive that connects to the computer with a USB cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, a phone or tablet or camera can also be a USB storage device, if it's connected to your computer with a USB cable.</p>

            <p>Thanks for all of the help that is being offered, it really is very much appreciated.&nbsp; I am and have been for a couple of months now, running Windows 10 pro having upgraded from 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a clean install a while ago but then ran into a lot of problems with my pc, mainly I think, from downloading something that I didn't want that was discreetly attached to something that I did want.&nbsp; I must be more careful in future, to ensure that I
 only download what I do want.&nbsp; Because of all these problems I decided to do another clean install and it is at this point that I have run into the problem with the pc not recognising the USB stick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not really genned up with computers, I do get by with the help of folk on these forums, therefore I cannot tell you what the bios version is.&nbsp; Just looking at a Belarc Adviser printout it just says Dell Inc. A02 /05/05/2010 if that means anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try to write the IOS to a DVD, I will also try the verbatim that you mention. I will also follow up the link to Sandisk and see if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for all the help everyone.</p>

<h2>            Computer appears to recognize printer but won&#39;t print.</h2>
                    I am using a laptop with Windows 7 and an HP Officejet 8600 printer.&nbsp; The printer is connected hardwired to another computer and works fine.&nbsp; And it used to work fine from the laptop and nothing has been changed.&nbsp; The laptop appears to recognize the printer
 and thinks it is sending print jobs to the printer, but they don't print.&nbsp; I have tried removing and re-installing the printer software from the original disk, but no luck.&nbsp; Any thoughts?

<p>ok here we go:</p>
<p>-at first i thought it was a ssd failure, i ran chkdsk and the result was no error "<a href="https://1drv.ms/t/s!AhRPAYvkbw9li1iTJBhbQPvM50Ta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">most recent test results</a>"</p>
<p>-then i ran memtest for about more than 7 hours on one stick of 4gb ram and no error was found.</p>
<p>-removed my gpu and nothing changed</p>
<p>-then i unplugged everything and removed mobo from case to eliminate any chance of electrical contact and nothing changed.</p>
<p>-did a fresh win10 install but however this time i couldnt be able to boot it up after install is finished even though i reinstaled it 3 times</p>
<p>-got a brand new mobo "asus z270 tuf mark 2" which im able to boot windows on however im back to the blusescreens</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>NOTE THAT: the last dmp file happened during a Driver Verifier test. the other dmp files happened alone.</p>
<p>if i remember anything else that i didnt mention i will comment it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so is my problem from hardware failure or is it somehow win10 failing?</p>
<p>

            Hi Hamza,<br />
<br />
<br />
We appreciate you sharing with us those information and all the troubleshooting steps you've done.<br />
<br />
Since you've done reinstalling Windows repeatedly, it seems that the issue now is with the hardware itself.<br />
<br />
At this point, it is best that you contact your PC manufacturer for further assistance.<br />
<br />
Should you have further queries, we're just a post away.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.

<h2>            Windows 10 - cannot delete or unpin a tile from the Start Menu</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Is there any "back door" way of removing a Windows 10 Start Menu tile? I can't get rid of one particular tile that’s pinned to my Start Menu in Windows 10. The method that should work, doesn't work.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>If I right-click that particular tile, I see the "Unpin from Start" option, but if I click that, the tile stays there.<br />
If I right-click the tile again, I see the "Unpin from Start" option again</span><span>, but if I click that again,</span><span>... etc etc etc.<br />
It's an unending circle. The tile is still there even after attempting to unpin it, then shutting down and restarting the PC.<br />
<br />
</span></li><li><span>This is a tile that was set up initially to point to a folder then named (let’s call it) "Folder OldName". I subsequently renamed that folder to (let’s call it) "Folder NewName".<br />
<br />
</span></li><li><span>It seems that this tile knows that there once was a folder named "Folder OldName", but now that the folder's been renamed, the tile can neither find nor forget the old folder name; and (perhaps for that reason) the tile won't allow itself to be unpinned.<br />
<br />
</span></li><li><span>I've searched everywhere, in the Windows Registry and on the C: disk, for anything still named "Folder OldName", hoping that I could delete any hidden references to it; but nothing shows up.<br />
<br />
</span></li><li><span>So I'm stuck with a tile that points to nowhere, that doesn't do anything, and that I can't remove in any way.</span></li></ul>
<p><span>Does anyone know, please, where the Start Menu keeps its "records" of Start Menu tile instances and properties, and how I can erase the relevant records and/or delete the problem tile?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks in anticipation.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Billion,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your offer of help and I do appreciate your efforts here; but having run the SFC and glanced through the 16 million-plus bytes of MS-DOS-type information it produced in its resulting CBS.log file, I'm really none the wiser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to me that it should be a simple matter to be able to delete a tile from the start menu, without resorting to manually-executed, elevated command-level utilities rooted in a legacy DOS environment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would <strong>still</strong> like to know exactly <strong>WHERE</strong> the start-menu tile information is stored within Windows 10, so that I can get at it and delete it (assuming that that will fix things).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something, somewhere in Windows 10, is telling this tile to appear on the start menu, and telling it the name of the (now non-existent) folder that it once pointed to. Where is that information located?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And why can't the start-menu tile-system work out that this tile is now broken, and offer to remove it; just as happens, for example, if in Windows 10, I:</p>
<ul>
<li>use File Explorer to rename a recent Word file, and then</li><li>try to open that file, by</li><li>right-clicking the Word icon on my taskbar, and</li><li>left-clicking the relevant entry in the recent-files list then displayed... whereupon I get the message:<br />
<strong>The item you selected is unavailable. It</strong><br />
<strong>might have been moved, renamed o</strong><strong>r<br />
</strong><strong>removed. Do you want to remove it</strong><strong><br />
from the list?</strong></li></ul>
<p><em><strong>Why can't the Windows 10 start-menu tile-system do this too?</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem seems to have arisen because I pinned a named folder to the start menu, and later renamed the folder; the start menu's tile-link system seems somehow to have lost its way through this process, and to have failed to keep its cascading references
 properly aligned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm left with the impression that Windows 10 is buggy in at least this area and can only hope that some (hopefully not-too-distant) future Windows update will make it possible to...</p>
<ul>
<li>simply point to a tile.</li><li>and click, "delete tile";</li><li>or that the current right-click tile command "Unpin from Start" will, itself, have the inherent capability of doing exactly that, even if the tile and its associated linkage are somehow disrupted.</li></ul>
<p>Meanwhile, I still can't get rid of that broken tile.....</p>
<p />

            <p>The "broken tile" now seems to have gone away at last, all by itself.</p>

            <p>Yeah, be careful with that sfc /scannow business...I tried that:</p>
<p>1. Said found issues and couldn't resolve them all, review the CLOWNSHOW cbs file..REALLY?</p>
<p>2. Broke MS OFFICE specifically Outlook by deleting a temp dir, had to go in and repair in Registry.</p>
<p>3. Didn't fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mine is specifically that I pinned and unpinned all day long, about 3 - 5 things to start menu and taskbar. Worked just fine. But then I pinned putty.exe and pinned again real quick now I have a "putty (2)" (not even putty.exe) &nbsp;named tile that will not
 unpin, belive I've moved the original putty.exe to program files or something, so your thinking broken link right...No such luck! moved it back to original location nothing, still un-pinable (this even a word?) so frustrating for the OCD folks that don't like
 garbage in computer. Fresh install of this os two weeks ago, I'm just about done with WIN10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Funny thing is, the registry and find all right? Not in this case, this thing is a ghost...Searched entire reg for putty and putty (2). NOTHING!</p>
<p>Where in the hell is the old Start Menu? It worked, why fix it, even after all the heartburn over 8 8.1 and so on, and were still just so stubborn keeping this buggy menu...DUMP it...WINDOWS 12 or 14 might be the answer. :-)</p>

            Hello community.&nbsp; I would normally never post to a tech forum of any kind, as I would rate my own technical ability at about a 1 or 2...however, I have been experiencing the same issue with a user-made tile becoming broken or dead, and thus being unable
 to "unpin" this item from the Windows 10 start menu (or create a functional replacement tile to the same executable file). &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Exactly as PatrickOfLondon (dev) described above, I aslo encountered the issue after re-naming a program folder within the program files directory to a new name, thereby breaking the shortcut linked to the start menu.&nbsp; A silly mistake, I know, and of course
 I knew my shortcut would become broken, but honestly, I thought it would be a fairly straightforward thing to fix (i.e. Win XP/7 navigate to start menu folder...delete old...create new) WRONG<br />
<br />
I first followed steps to navigate to the Application Shortcuts folder within windows -
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Application Shortcuts <br />
(see link: <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/remove-broken-modern-app-tile-shortcuts-windows-8-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.thewindowsclub.com/remove-broken-modern-app-tile-shortcuts-windows-8-1</a> )<br />
<br />
When I navigated to this location however, no shortcut to the program and tile in question exisited.&nbsp; Subsequent searches within the hierachy for instances of the program revealed only history items. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I then followed both methods posted above by Billion Debbarma:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Method 1: Windows Store Apps Troubleshooter - see Billion Debbarma's post above<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Method 2: SFC scan (Windows System File Checker Utility) and DISM (Deployment Image Servicing and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Management Tool) instructions here:<br />
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93</a><br />
<br />
SFC found no errors and DISM completed successfully, however neither utility had any impact on the broken tile.&nbsp; At this point, I started looking into the prospect of restoring the start menu to defaults...I didn't actually try this, but it's probably good
 information to have...instructions can be found here: <br />
<a href="http://winaero.com/blog/how-to-reset-the-start-menu-layout-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winaero.com/blog/how-to-reset-the-start-menu-layout-in-windows-10/</a><br />

<br />
********************************************* WHAT DID WORK FOR ME ***********************************************<br />
After many frustrating hours of fruitless attempts to fix this issue, I was really about to give up and turn my machine over to someone more knowledgeable than myself.&nbsp; I remembered the history items discovered in my earlier searches and wondered, what would
 happen if I clear my Windows History - instructions can be found here:<br />
<a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/6712-file-explorer-history-clear-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/6712-file-explorer-history-clear-windows-10-a.html</a>
<br />
<br />
(While this step alone did not fix my issue, it could have played a role in my next idea being successful...I don't know enough about Windows processes to say for sure.)<br />
<br />
Finally, just for giggles, I decided go back into my Program File directory and slightly change the name of the executable file associated with the dead tile (re-named nestopia.exe to NEStopia.exe).&nbsp; I then attempted to pin the re-named .exe to the start menu,
 and what'd'ya know...FINALLY Windows was able to release the association between the dead tile and the corrupted file set, and successfully replace it with a functioning tile to the re-named NEStopia.exe<br />
<br />
**************************************************************************************************************************<br />
<br />
I apologize if this post has been redundant and long-winded...I feel this was an easy mistake to make (albeit foolish) and a real pain in the @** to figure out how to correct.&nbsp; I hope someone else finds it helpful.<br />

<p>Thanks MaggieTronic ... your suggestion gave me an idea! </p>
<p>Remember how I said I had pinned a file named putty.exe to the start menu, from your suggestion above I now sorta understand what went wrong.</p>
<p>I had inadvertently pinned this twice thus getting the putty (2) on the start, so then I decided to move the putty.exe to an alternate folder. Then went back to the start menu&nbsp;and suddenly found that I was unable to deleted the putty (2) tile, thinking perhaps
 it was now a broken link, spent hours troubleshooting; moving the putty.exe back to original place and trying everything under the sun to remove it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So thanks to you I repeated the SAME EXACT thing I did the first time...</p>
<p>Went to start, unpinned the GOOD working putty tile, now only left with the putty (2) that was gorilla glued into the start menu. Found my relocated putty.exe file, then pinned it twice real quick in an effort to overwrite the un-pinnable putty (2)&nbsp;tile...went
 back to start and saw that not only was the putty (2) gone now (Thank God), but the working putty tile&nbsp;was there and working.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>WORKED LIKE A CHARM, thanks for the idea to try a different approach...&nbsp; its like tricking your os to do what you want...</p>
<p>Bottom Line - It was a harmless issue, but very frustrating. And what gives with the slow response with pinning? Feel this delay and pinning twice real quick actually created this bad unpinalbe tile.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<p>Lastly - you mentioned you ran sfc?&nbsp; Do you have Office Pro 2013 installed,&nbsp;if so as I mentioned,&nbsp;it totally broke the temp file for office specifically Outlook&nbsp;and forced me to research the reg key to delete so it could re-create itself.&nbsp; Sounds like you
 don't have it installed, or I may just have a different setup, I've never seen sfc break anything to-date, that was a first for me.</p>

            <p>Hi GSXRMAN_SD.&nbsp; I'm glad my post was able to help you.&nbsp; It sounds like we had the exact same situation going on, and yes, it was so frustrating, I was seriously considering a fresh install to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your question:&nbsp; No, I do not have Office 2013 installed on my machine.&nbsp; I have Windows 10 installed on my secondary machine (an 8-year old Toshiba Satellite A205-S5835 with 1024MB DDR2 SDRAM and a Pentium Dual-Core Processor T2370) which I have
 been setting up primarily as an emulator machine.&nbsp; I recently purchased a new laptop running 8.1 and decided to upgrade my old system to Windows 10 to try it out without worrying about corrupting a brand new machine...I am so glad that I did.&nbsp; While 10 has
 proven the lightest and easiest OS to run on such an outdated setup, the wonkiness is rediculous.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After resolving my previous issue, I now have another issue in which a failed install from a downloaded .exe is now preventing any installation from any other .exe.&nbsp; Um...Great.&nbsp; I am trying to figure this one out at current, and am again considering a fresh
 install if necessary.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>MaggieTronic,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have to thank you for your post. While your exact solution didn't help me directly, it
<em>did </em>give me an idea that worked like a charm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I consider my own technology skills around an 8 or 9. The IT department where I used to work would cringe if I ever called them, because they knew it had to be a real doozie if
<em>I </em>couldn't figure it out. But even a geek like me appreciates input from people who don't necessarily think like a geek. I tend to get tunnel vision, thinking I know how to figure things out, when the solution is hiding in plain sight just outside
 of my view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also had a stubborn tile on the start menu. I had successfully removed every tile
<em>except one</em> from the start menu, using the right-click-and-unpin approach. My goal was to eliminate entirely the right side of the start menu. I have everything I want to use on a regular basis down on the taskbar, so I very rarely click on the start
 button at all, but when I do, I don't want it filling half the screen with gigantic tiles for things I don't need. The offending tile was for Microsoft Excel 2010, and if I right clicked on it, I didn't get a menu of options like I did for all the other tiles.
 After a couple of seconds, the whole start menu would just disappear as if I had clicked somewhere on the desktop... except that I hadn't. (Interestingly enough, if I right click on the Microsoft Excel 2010 shortcut over in All Apps on the left side, the same
 thing happens. But if I left click on it, Excel opens up normally. So I still have a little bug to work out)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So anyway, your idea of changing the case of the name of the executable gave me the idea of looking at the executable for Excel, even though it is simply named "EXCEL.exe" and the offending tile was called "Microsoft Excel 2010". I right clicked on EXCEL.exe,
 and lo and behold, there was an "unpin from Start" option there, instead of "pin to Start". So I clicked on it, and
<em>voilà!</em> the offending tile was gone.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Not Activated - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> budw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Not Activated</h2>
                    <p>First the equipment details. I have a Dell 1640 Studio XPS, ordered and bought from Dell's store with Windows Vista Pro 64 bit pre-installed, genuine and activated.</p>
<p>Subsequently I purchased and downloaded a copy of Windows 7 Pro 64 bit Upgrade from Microsoft store and upgraded via the ISO tool. This installation has always been genuine and activated as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I recently took advantage of the windows 10 free upgrade and was enjoying it during the setup and personalization process. I then noticed that under &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">Settings</span><span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">Update

 status was listed as &nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">Windows is not activated</span><span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">,
 My Purchased Win7 Upgrade key was not accepted and the system only gave me a link to Microsoft Store for a key or to revert back to Win 7. In Microsoft Store the only option was to pay $199.00 for my "FREE" windows 10 upgrade. Fortunately I have a full restorable
 backup of my HDD prior to Windows 10 installation.</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">I reverted to my Win 7 Pro with the revert button in Win 10 and it came back as activated. I noticed that
 it's activated key is an OEM key (ie XXXXX-OEM-XXXXXXX-XXXXX), that must have been accepted at the Windows 7 Pro Update, and not the key sent when I downloaded the Windows 7 Pro ISO of XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX. I don't remember if I had to put a key in
 or not but I don't believe I did. Also the last 5 of the Windows 10 key shown did not match either of the keys I have.</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)">So my question now is, if I were to use the Change Key button on my copy of Windows 7 Pro and put the key
 that came with the Win 7 ISO DL (i.e. XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX-XXXXX),and provided that it is activated as it should be with that, would that allow Win 10 Pro to be activated during the update process?</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)"><span>I like Windows 10 and it seems to run the&nbsp;proprietary&nbsp;programs I need but I didn't appreciate the bait and switch of "Free Upgrade" and then a $199.00 Key
 purchase.</span></span></p>

            <p>[SOLVED]</p>
<p>Update.....</p>
<p>After waiting 72 hrs instead of the 48 hrs my copy of Win 10 Pro 64 still had not self activated. I ended up going back through the "Contact Support" app and using my case number. Support was able to activate the installation after an extended remote support
 session the tech was able to enter a valid key code to activate the system. </p>
<p>The claim was that at the time of my first chat session their support tools were down. So they just let me stew for 24 - 48 hrs. waiting for it to self activate rather than tell me their tools were down and that after any period of time it would not self
 activate. At any rate I can now start personalizing Win 10 and decide if it is worth keeping or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To the positive side, while the installation took a very long time, when completed, I didn't have to reinstall any of my programs and all my files were still intact waiting for me.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Running into an issue while integrating Skype Interview API with stand-alone application.<br />
<br />
Getting responses randomly like,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Token error - err:1</p>
<p>Token error - err:4</p>
<p>Token error - err:6</p>
<p>Token error - err:8</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its very tedious that how to track or what would be root cause of this issue. It would be great if the community folks give theirs hands in it. Thanks in advance.</p>

    <title>Install Operating System on Windows Partition in MDT - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arvind gaba  say:</h3>
<h2>            Install Operating System on Windows Partition in MDT</h2>
                    <p>In one of the custom solution via MDT I am required to deploy Windows 7 image to that partition which already contains Windows installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It used to be simple when I defined under "Install Operating System" step to "Specify logical drive letter" - "C"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things became complex when I had to deploy this custom image solution to a machine which had System Reserved partition in which case Windows partition was assigned "D:" in Winpe and the image used to fail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to detect which drive letter has Windows installed and the use that drive letter to deploy the operating system. Any suggestion will be helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently came across the MS article in which it is mentioned that a similar variable has been defined in the latest version of Conf Mgr. Need to confirm if the same can be successfully used in MDT:</p>
<p>
</p><p>_OSDDetectedWinDrive - Beginning in Configuration Manager version 1602, the task sequence scans the computer's hard drives for a previous operating system installation when Windows PE starts. The hard drive location for where the operating system is installed
 is stored in this variable. You can configure your task sequence to retrieve this value from the environment and use it to specify the same hard drive location to use for the new operating system.</p>
