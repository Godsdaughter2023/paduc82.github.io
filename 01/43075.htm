<h2>            NEW VR-11 OPTION</h2>
                    
<p><span>I learned this today on accident, but with the VR-11 - upgraded or not. If you shoot a team member with it, he will be invincible for about 30 seconds. He will litterally have the vision
 of a zombie, so to other zombies he is a zombie, and therefore will not be attacked. I just want you guys to be informed of this!!

<p>VR11 has some usability in MP - just not in solo.</p>
<p>You can get other zombies or george to chase after humans buying you some time and space.</p>
<p>packapunched</p>
<p>You can send george away for a round or two</p>
<p>You can calm george down if he is angry anywhere by shooting him</p>
<p>So, it has some use. &nbsp;I wish it had a splash effect when packapunched though...</p>

<p>Hello Marty,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Just to confirm, since you mentioned that you no longer have the driver for the Surface cover, have you tried installing the latest Firmware and drivers for Surface yet? You may check this
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=38826" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> to download and install Surface Pro 3 Firmware upgrade pack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, we suggest that you <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023527/surface-how-to-get-service-for-surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">send your device for repair</a></strong> or you may drop by the nearest
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/locations/all-locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Store</a></strong> to have it assessed and be received should a repair be advised.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have any other concerns.</p>

<h2>            Windows Store error 0x80070015 only when trying to download to another HDD</h2>
                    <p>Pre-ordered Gears of War 4 over the weekend. Installed it on my SSD, downloaded fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Realised I was extremely low on space on the SSD so decided to uninstall, and re-download to a 2TB HDD. I can't download the game at all. Getting error&nbsp;0x80070015 as soon as I choose a hard drive. I've tried choosing a different 1TB HDD, and even the same
 SSD I initially downloaded it to and either getting the same error or it gets stuck on "Working" and doesn't actually do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really quite frustrating and completely unacceptable. It's<em> bad enough</em> I can't use Steam for this game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also as a side note, how would I go about getting refunded the price difference between my £50 pre-order with the store over the weekend and the reduced price Gears 4 is
<em>now being sold for</em> on the store on launch day??</p>

<p>
</p><p>We'd like to inform you that we have an ongoing known issue with <strong>downloading and updating games through the Windows Store app</strong>, specifically for
<strong>Gears of War 4</strong> and possibly <strong>Forza Horizon 3</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may reach our Microsoft Store Sales and Customer Support phone team for further assistance.

            <p>Thank you for your response Robert. I will get in touch with them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I go about getting a refund for the price difference between my pre-order last weekend and the game's price at launch? It was £8.25 cheaper on launch day. I pre-ordered it for £49.99 and it launched at £41.74. Every other store I use guarantees you
 a refund if the price is reduced between pre-order and launch (Steam, Origin, even Sony have this with PSN purchases).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Kind Regards,</p>
<p>

            But why? What is is there in the drivers or in MS OS that is causing the complication. Seems a little to partucular. My cousin is having a similar issue with another optical burning/optical emulation software tool.

    <title>Activate Touch Screen with WINDOWS 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paultreso  say:</h3>
<h2>            Activate Touch Screen with WINDOWS 10</h2>
                    <p>Please help.&nbsp;&nbsp; I loaded the free Windows 10 and now I can't make my screen magnify with the use of my hands.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything else works on the touch screen but that feature and that would be the feature I LIKE the most.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I miss the ease of making the text larger with the simple use of the touch screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a HP Envy if that makes any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you ahead of time.</p>

    <title>File History is making duplicate &#34;Copy&#34; files on my primary C - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            File History is making duplicate &#34;Copy&#34; files on my primary C drive.</h2>
                    <p>I don't know why, but File History is creating duplicate files on my primary C drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, it will backup file.txt. I can look at the drive where the backup data is and see the backup, and confirm its working. For reasons I don't understand, it then makes file - Copy.txt on my primary&nbsp;C drive. In some cases, it makes file - Copy(2).txt
 and file - Copy(3).txt and so on, typically until I shut file history off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its not just limited to one file, the behavior seems to happen to most if not all files it backs up.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://i.imgur.com/PxG4gCU.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Here's what I'm talking about</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on a Surface Pro 3 265gb, 8gb. With Windows 8.1. As far as I am aware, I am patched and up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The backup drive is a shared drive on my network. I shared a space on a server, and mapped it to a drive letter on my SP3. I use that as the drive to backup to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know what's going on and how to fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, this line deletes the duplicate files in Power Shell (and anything else with Copy. in the file name so be careful.)</p>
<p>Get-Childitem . -recurse -include<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Copy.</em><span>&nbsp;</span>| rm</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:&nbsp; I found lots of errors in the error log. <br />

            <p>I'm not sure this issue has anything to do with Surface Pro 3 - I don't think this is a hardware issue.&nbsp; This is a problem with File History creating duplicate files.&nbsp; Is there a reason you think&nbsp;this somehow relates to a Surface Pro 3?&nbsp; Why would this be
 an SP3 problem?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>My error logs are a mess.&nbsp; I keep seeing the message </p>

<p>
</p><p>When I use Powershell to cd to that directory above - it doesn't exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I use the File History control panel and click "Restore Personal Files" FileHistory.exe just crashes.&nbsp; "Unhandled exception at 0x00007FF9A456871C (KernelBase.dll) in FileHistory.exe: 0xC000041D: An unhandled exception was encountered during a user callback."</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to be an issue with File History - its a bug or a misconfiguration problem.&nbsp; It seems to be similar to this:</p>

<h2>            Fable 3 &#38;&#35;191&#59;Glitch ilegal&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hola!</p>
<p>Como ustedes sabrán, hace un tiempo hubo un muy popular glitch en el juego en donde se podían sacar millones de monedas en cuestión de minutos usando un segundo perfil de jugador. He visto que al parecer, con todo y actualización sigue existiendo el glitch.
</p>
<p>Pregunto: ¿Es ilegal seguir usando el glitch siendo que ya sacaron una actualización para evitarlo (y por lo que veo, no lo pudieron corregir del todo)?</p>

<h2>            FIX YOUR FLAWED REP SYSTEM</h2>
                    <p>My rep says avoid me and I can't get into any online games, why can players that are worse than me the abuse the system and ruin my rep. I play Gears of War that's about it on my xbox. It is my favorite game but has a huge toxic community if you are better than someone they report you for anything to get your account banned. My rep is at avoid me for legit no reason because other players can't handle losing. I can't get into a game because of it. Your system is flawed and garbage I pay good money for my xbox and my account. Fix my rep and your garbage system, it's honestly pathetic to be apart of something so broken. I'm ashamed for you guys on how bad your system works.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 won&#39;t start on Dell Inspiron laptop</h2>
                    When I turn on the laptop, the Dell logo comes up, then a "Windows Error Recovery" screen asking to start normally or launch startup repair. With either option, then it says "windows is loading files", the microsoft bar comes up, and it goes to a blue
 screen with the bird and leaf (like the wallpaper on the logon page). When I try safe mode, it says "windows is starting up", but then it goes to the blue wallpaper page just like before. I tried F12 at startup and ran diagnostics, and it came up with error
 code 2000-0142. Dell says it's a software problem and wants to charge me $150 to talk to a tech. No matter what I do, I don't see the Windows logo, and I wind up at the blue wallpaper screen.

            If you are unable to boot the machine with your installation DVD then there is a strong suspicion that it has a hardware problem, if only because this boot process is largely independent of what is on the hard disk. I would test the DVD boot process on
 some other Windows 7 machine in order to build up confidence, then discuss the matter once more with Dell, in particular if the machine is under Warranty. Saying things like "I can boot up an Acer machine with my Windows 7 installation DVD each and every time
 but the Dell machine locks up consistently. Why is this?" creates an impression of technical competence, which reduces the likelihood of you being given the run-around.

<p>Actually I hear double Fine are being a problem not MS as Double fine don't want to change the name and want to take it to court as the dispute is of the copyrighting of "trench" for both board and console games and Double fine want to dispute it as its
 not the full game name thats copyrighted so as its not the specific name they want to claim the copyright doesn't apply.</p>

<p>its not actually MS's fault or Double Fines as the claim was only filed for the copyright in 2007 for "Trench" and its only "Trench" thats copyrighted not "Trenched" its only this damn company holding the copyright claiming its breaching it despite the names
 not being the same nor the concept behind the games </p>
<p>Its Mc Donalds Suing Mc Munches sandwich bar all over again except this time MS are on the side of the little guy that is Double fine.</p>
<p>My guess is depending on if they have to debate the copyright in each part of europe or get a blanket ruling it could be out in 3-12 months</p>

<p>issue being its claiming copyright because they have copyright for part of the games name. its the equivalent of me comprighting the name "Gears" then claiming "Gears of War" was breaching the copyright. the amount of copyrighted stuff in differen countries
 its pretty hard to find out if some-one will sue before its too late and you're being sued, the best a lawyer can do really is make sure the story and concepts aren't copyrighted as pressumably double fine owns a copyright for the name "Trenched" but the copy
 right dispute is over the use of "Trench" in the name so it would be hard for a lawyer to pre-empt this kind of copyright.</p>
<p>Its like using the $ sign in theory Gene Simmons could sue MS for using a symbol he owns the copyright on. With copyrights its a risk you have to run and the best you can hope is no-one files a claim or if some-ones does you can prove your product is clearly
 different from theirs. The Only similarity other than name is its set in World War 1 / around that time. MS will win the question is how much the company behind trench will push as theres the initial court then possibly an appeal and depending how the work
 it the company could drag it out and fight it territory by territory which for MS would be a worst case idea.</p>
<p>This isn't about upholding copyrights and stoping people stealing your interlectual property its purely about them trying to get some money.</p>

<p>and fair play to them for doing so, MS and the lawyers behind this arcade title dropped the ball when registering the name of choice.....anyone would do the same, I would. Now its going to take time for the matter to be resolved. Your analogies are intriguing

    <title>How can i connect a new laptop to existing wireless router&#63; Have - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> philmscribe007  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can i connect a new laptop to existing wireless router&#63; Have tried various forum ideas but no solution.</h2>
                    <div>Right, I shall do my best to give sufficient info...<br />
<br />
Just bought a new laptop for my mother - a Packard Bell Easynote TS with Windows 7. Attempted to connect it to our home's existing router, but have run into problems.<br />
<br />
We have two other computers in the house, both linked via ethernet to the router (a Netgear DG834Gv5) although one sometimes goes wireless with no problem whatsoever.
<br />
<br />
I have been on various forums to find ways of solving this issue; I have turned off the router and laptop and rebooted both; I have checked at the router IP address to see if the SSID name is broadcasting, it is; I have added the correct MAC address to the
 access list as we are on WPA2-PSK (wifi protected access 2 with pre-shared key); I have tried disabling this security option in the hope it allows a connection but no; I have even tried copying the existing network configuration from the laptop than can connect
 wirelessly and via USB stick pasted across to the new laptop, this also failed to help.
<br />
<br />
I have also been into the Device Manager to check the network adapter (ATHEROS AR5B97) is working properly and it has the latest drivers installed - it has. There is no yellow warning symbol on it.
<br />
<br />
When I run a diagnostic check it results in: "Investigate router or access point issues."<br />
<br />
Any thoughts so far?<br />
<br />
To fill you in on what actually happens...<br />
<br />
Booting up the laptop reveals that there are wireless network connections available - the home one. It has a good-to-excellent signal strength, radio type = 802.11g, the SSID is showing. But when I click on 'connect', it brings up: "WINDOWS WAS UNABLE TO CONNECT
 TO [our SSID]"<br />
<br />
When I connect this new laptop using the ethernet cable that I sometimes run my existing laptop with, it connects to the internet with no problem at all, so it is definitely just a wireless issue.<br />
<br />
The only thing that I am aware I haven't tried is to uninstall the pre-installed 60-day trial of Norton which some suggest may block the signal (is that right?) but I have temporarily disabled it and that did nothing to help.<br />
<br />
Apologies for the rambling message - wanted to give as much info as possible. I would be hugely grateful if someone with a far better understanding of these things than I would be able to give me some help on this.<br />
<br />
Many thanks. </div>

            <p>Do NOT use WEP because its terribly insecure...</p>
<p>Here are my wireless security guidelines for home users...</p>
<p><a href="http://theillustratednetwork.mvps.org/LAN/SoHoWirelessSecurity.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://theillustratednetwork.mvps.org/LAN/SoHoWirelessSecurity.html</a></p>
<p>As I noted earlier go into the router and disable MAC address authentication. That is more than likely the problem your having, ie. the MAC address is not correct in the access list. Use WPA2-PSK (AES), aka WPA2-Personal or at a minimum WPA-Personal. Just
 make sure all of your clients can use whatever type you choose.</p>
<p>If you have a Win 7, Vista or XP machine connected wirelessly to your network now you can use Windows Connect Now [WCN] to copy the wireless profile to a flash drive then plug the flash drive into the new computer.</p>

<p>Hey Shane!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for bringing this issue to us bud! Unfortunately we suggest getting in contact with the Internet Service Provider or the Router manufacturer since they would be better qualified to assist in the matter since every router has its specific steps to
 follow. Give it a shot and let us know if we can further assist with this or any other matter!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Besides their getting money from you for doing nothing of any value,<br />
if you let them into your computer, who knows what they did there or<br />
what confidential information they stole.</p>
<p>So since you did, I highly recommend that you do both of the following<br />
immediately:</p>
<p>1. Do a clean reinstallation of Windows.</p>
<p>2. <strong>After</strong> reinstalling Windows, change all of your passwords,<br />
especially any for banks or other financial sites.</p>
<p>Since they <strong>might</strong> have installed a key logger, simply changing your<br />
passwords without first reinstalling Windows may not be good enough.</p>

Ken, unfortunately I do not know how to do a clean reinstallation of Windows (I use Windows7 and it came already on my computer).&nbsp;&nbsp;I do not have&nbsp;the CD.&nbsp; I have a Dell 2320 wireless and Dell and I are no longer on speaking terms.&nbsp; They have ripped me off so
 many times.&nbsp; So what do you suggest I do?&nbsp; I failed to mention that I changed all my passwords when I was in my frenzy of scanning, deleting programs etc.&nbsp; I&nbsp;feel that I still am at risk and I am not very computer literate.&nbsp; I can't believe I did what I did
 -&nbsp;I know better!&nbsp; Thanks for your&nbsp;input.&nbsp; Ruthe&nbsp;

            <p><span>Hi T138,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that you are facing the issue with Microsoft keyboard stating that Windows cannot start
 this hardware device because its configuration information (in the registry) is incomplete or damaged. (Code 19).</span></p>
<p><span>Have you made any changes to the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>What is the make and the model of the computer and the keyboard?</span></p>
<p><span>This can occur when more than one service is defined for a device, if there is a failure opening the
 service subkey, or if the driver name cannot be obtained from the service subkey. Here are some things that you can try to resolve this problem.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to refer the link and check.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Run the Hardware troubleshooter
</span></b></p>
<p><span>a) Press the ‘Windows + W’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Type troubleshooter in the search box and then press enter.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click hardware and sound and run the hardware and device troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the keyboard drivers and check.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps provided below to uninstall the graphical drivers.</span></p>
<p>
<b><span><span>A.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>Sleep option missing from windows 7 power options - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mr soup  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sleep option missing from windows 7 power options</h2>
                    My computer is missing the sleep button option from the power options in the control panel. &nbsp;It used to have "choose what the power buttons do" and had options for both the power button and the sleep button. &nbsp;Now it displays "choose what the power button
 does" and only has options for the power button.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>To make matters worse, if you press the sleep button the computer sleeps but cannot be woken up. &nbsp;powering the computer up results in a black screen, with the cooling fans on high, &nbsp;there is not even the ability to get into the BIOS. &nbsp;The only way to recover
 the computer is to remove power and the CMOS battery for about 2 hrs, then the computer will boot up.</div>
<div><br />

            When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key. 
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary.  or use the reset function in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />You can directly install Windows 10 and it should reactivate automatically instantly or sometimes within a few days.
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />If you do experience an activation issue, you can use your Windows 7 key to reactivate:

            No, it will not affect your Activation at all!
<br />
<br />In fact that is the correct way to clean install Windows 10, you will have a much cleaner and more responsive system!

You will want to ensure that the <strong><span>Desktop Window Manager Session Manager</span></strong> service (and)
<strong><span>Themes</span></strong> service are both started. If they were stopped or disabled via an application that limits startup items Aero will not be an option. Please try manually starting both of these services
 to see if you are then presented with the options to enable Aero from the Personalize menu.<br />

                    Today I was called bij a man who said that he was from the Windows rechnical department. He knew my name and said that he had information that my computer was hacked 10 to 15 days ago, which would have distrastrous consequenses foor me. He said his name
 was Loboth Liew and couldn,t speak to me in my own language'(Netherlands). Het wanted me to put on my computer en mention the programs I use. As I found this very suspicious I told him that I would discus the matter with my son and that he could call me back
 later. What can I do now?

<h2>            Is cortana not available for samsung NP300E5C-A03IN model in India&#63;</h2>
                    I called M/S to troubleshoot my Cortana issue. However, they redirected me to Samsung to check for the drivers. Samsung says all the Windiws10 drivers are Compatible with my laptop (Samsung-

<span>NP300E5C-A03IN). Again M/S told me that my laptop is not compatible. Whom to trust? My Windows10 is up to date and still receiving an error "Cortana is not available for the region and Language you have selected", even after changing
 to India(English). Please help. I'm very excited to use this feature in my laptop. Also I strongly feel that M/S customer care technical executives are not knowledgeable to resolve these kind of issues. They just escape from the call by redirecting and confusing
 us. Please help...</span>

</p><p>The links you have provided were useful and I was able follow those instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have set my Region to India (English). However, when I click on Speech option, I can only see&nbsp;(United States)English and (United Kingdom) English. Not India (English). Also there is no way to get rid of these two languages. Please find screenshots for
 your reference. To some extent, I have reset my PC last night, just to see if resetting PC might prompts me to change the language preference. However, that did not work. Please let me know if you need any other information. Very exited to use Cortana in my
 PC. :)</p>

<span>Hi Divyeshdarji,</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>1. Have you made any recent changes on the system?</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may try to manually change the file extension to jpeg.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Open the files you want to change.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click Edit and then click Select All.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Right click on the first file in the list and then click Rename.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Type the new extension (.jpeg), and then press ENTER.
</span></p>
<p><span>Windows will warn you that changing the file name extension might cause the file to stop working properly. If you are certain that
 the extension you typed is one that the program you are using will understand, click Yes to confirm the change.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Hope this information is helpful.
</span></p>
        </p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows updates may fail to install due to a lot of reasons. Containing corrupted system files may highly contribute to the issue. For initial troubleshooting, let's run the System Update Readiness tool. Follow the steps outlined in this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/947821/fix-windows-update-errors-by-using-the-dism-or-system-update-readiness" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

            Hi, thanks for responding.&nbsp; I followed the steps for System Update Readiness tool but I am still experiencing exactly the same error message.&nbsp;I did sort of try for the manual install for this same error message but was unable to find it in the list supplied.&nbsp;
 Any other ideas that might work?&nbsp; I am not even sure if I need this update as it does not exactly say what it will do or does?

            Got it. Does it tell you what update it was? There's usually a KB number for every update. You may also follow the steps outlined in this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p><p>Hi, sorry about that and I meant to send a reply earlier but the steps to this issue are just going on and on and&nbsp;are getting progressively more&nbsp;complicated for me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have decided to just give up and&nbsp;I will just not install this one Update as it is just
 too much work for me and so far&nbsp;all the other updates&nbsp;work fine.&nbsp; Thank you so much for your help so please consider this problem resolved.</p>
