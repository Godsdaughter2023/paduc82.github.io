<h2>            Error reading Asus DVD writer Win10</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>&nbsp; I bought a new Asus UX360CA laptop running on Win10, try to install a brand new Asus DVD-RW ext. USB writer (SDRW-08D2S-U Lite), but encountered error with the software CyberLink power2Go.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Error message : "Cyberlink power2go does not support the current screen resolution and DPI setting". The screen resolution and DPI setting were as per factory setting, nothing was done to the original setting.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I tried install and re-install, error still persist, anyone can help?</p>

    <title>Microsoft mouse 3600 undetectable - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> boubaas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft mouse 3600 undetectable</h2>
                    <p>I bought the Microsoft mouse 3600 bluetooth yesterday. First time it paired up with my Asus T300 Chi laptop. But when I wanted to use it the second time it was not detected. Uninstalled it already from my bluetooth list. Tried pushing the button at the bottom
 for 5 seconds so it will get into connect mode. But none of these actions worked. Mouse remains undetectable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I however can connect the mouse to my Samsung note 4. Also can connect my samsung Note 4 to my laptop. So the issue is between the microsoft mouse 3600 bluetooth and my T300 Chi laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully someone can help me!</p>

            <p><span>Hi Boubaas,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The issue you are facing it could be due to the Bluetooth device driver is outdated from the system, since the mouse is working with other device. Let’s try simple troubleshooting steps and check if this helps in resolving the issue.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to run hardware troubleshooter to diagnose the exact issue. It will automatically detect the problem and fix it.
</span></p>

</li><li>Click on&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>&nbsp;and follow onscreen instruction complete the&nbsp;<strong>Hardware troubleshooter</strong>.</li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Method 2.</strong></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If the issue still persist, I recommend you to uninstall/reinstall the Bluetooth driver and check if this helps.
</p>

<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> and click on <strong>
Device Manager</strong>.</p>

</li><li>Once you are done uninstalling the driver, restart the computer. It will automatically install the generic Bluetooth driver.
</li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Method3.</strong></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If that does not helps, I recommend you to go to the computer manufacturer website download the latest updated Bluetooth driver and install the same. Click on the link, select Windows 10, download the Bluetooth driver and install the

<h2>            Reinstall Windows 7 Starter Acer Aspire One D257</h2>
                    <p>I have an Acer Aspire One D257. It does not have a built in DVD/ Draw. &nbsp;It came pre-installed with "windows &nbsp;7 starter" I do not have a recovery disc etc. for this program. Last year I used widows any time upgrade to install "windows 7 Home premium upgrade,"
 which was installed via the internet by a technician of Microsoft. I then had the upgrade key sent to me by e mail, which I still have. &nbsp;I later had problems with the computer and decided to re-in stall windows 7. I visited Microsoft site and downloaded to
 a USB key the windows 7 home premium program (32 bit). &nbsp;I successfully installed this into the Acer D257. However I was unable to activate with my Windows 7 Home premium upgrade key, for some reason it does not accept it ?. &nbsp;So now I have a dilemma, I have
 a key which cost about £76.00 for the upgrade which appears to be useless. &nbsp;Also I am unable to get back to the original "windows 7 &nbsp;starter" as system restore will only let me go back to a point in time which is after I installed windows 7 , about 2 weeks
 ago. How can I resolve this without having to buy yet another new program. P.S. I do have use of an external DVD draw if I need it. Can anyone help please.

            Hi Thanks for the info. Unfortunately The recovery was wiped when I installed the new windows 7. However I have now resolved the problem by buying a new Product key which was successful so now have windows 7 home premium installed and fully activated.
 Thanks to all who tried to help me.

<h2>            Windows feature update 1903 fail</h2>
                    <p>I have been offered 1903 by update on my computer, it downloads and runs install to 100% but when I restart I find I am still on the previous version 1809 17763.557.</p>
<p>In update it says it failed to install and try again Ox8007007f I tried many time with the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two long chats with MS support has resulted in them loading my computer with ISO and telling me that would not fail, it did! They found nothing wrong with my computer that would cause the fails.</p>
<p>

            Hi Colin.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Use the same ISO they loaded for you and follow the steps here for Overcoming Version Upgrade problems:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If it won't install then you can create the bootable media if you want to do the gold standard Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has millions of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media (if necessary on another PC) install the Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key here:  <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, skip the Product Key screen and choose your licensed version only if offered.  On second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Col, the problem is that they're doing an in- place reinstall with these version Updates due to the new approach of keeping the same operating system Windows 10 but just upgrading it's features via the version update twice a year.  An Upgrade is quite a bit more than just an typical Windows Update, which is the reason why it's better to install it yourself from the installed Media Creation Tool or downloaded media than trusting Windows Update or its Update Assistant to do this for such a big bite.  
<br />
<br />If you want to follow the steps in the tutorial for Overcoming Version Updates I will help you as much as you need until the Version Upgrade is installed or you decide you don't want it, in which case I can help you block it.   
<br />
<br />Doing the Clean Install is quite a bit more, but if you're interested after looking it over I am the author of the tutorial and will help you with that as much as you need.  It's a great learning experience that makes you permanently the master of your PC because you learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.

<p>Hello Greg,</p>
<p>I was reluctant to do a clean install for fear of loosing stuff even though I had backups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried many, many things suggested by you and others on this forum, all to no avail. I used the ISO that the MS support tech had sent and the ISO on the hard drive that the second tech had sent, again all seemed to go through the process but at the very
 end failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One rather curt MS tech had a quick look and said it was because the BIOS was out of date, it was the original 2014 one when new. Best advice that I read said this should not be a problem and if flashed incorrectly could brick the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fortunately the weather has been terrible so I had plenty of time to "play".</p>
<p>My laptop, about 10 years old had not been offered the update at the time this computer was but late last night it popped up in updates. I had no confidence that it would install but clicked on, and much to my surprise after a long time it did download and
 install. It stuck at 99% download so I rebooted and it then continued.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning I had another go on the desktop computer, all my tinkering had cleared the pending update that would not install so clicked on update and it once again started to download. I have a reasonable connection but it took ages. Install took even longer
 but after some auto restarts, Bingo! I have 1903 installed.</p>
<p>Having tried previously with antivirus disabled and any USB disconnected also router off when trying to install, this time everything was connected and left running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I write this waffle because it may help others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am wondering if Microsoft has done something with the update because it did install on both machines, even though it took in excess of two hours! When previously it failed each time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to go on a bit. but thank you very much for you help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Colin</p>

            Colin -
<br />
<br />Yes, a 2014 BIOS is too old and makes the PC old before its time.  I would find the latest one on the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, read the download information, included Read Me file, and also all of the FAQ and other information on the Support web pages to find exactly how to install it.  It may be a simple WIndows files you run, making sure that there is no chance of losing power.  I've probably advised 10,000 people in forums doing this and not one has ever failed.  But you do want to follow the steps closely because it might have a different method, like Asus which puts the file on a stick and had you run it from within the BIOS/UEFI setup flash utility.  
<br />
<br />A 10 year old laptop is at the end of it's life.  I've had one last 10 years, but the longest I want to push any others is 5-7, as a rule of thumb.  Then they become more trouble than they're worth.  You can get a Core i5 with 8gb RAM and 256Gb SSD for $400 on sale.  With a great install it runs as well as a $1200 gaming laptop (if you're not a rabid gamer).
<br />
<br />As long as you tried all of the steps in the Overcoming Upgrade Problems tutorial I linked you, then you've done everything short of the Clean Install - which is always the best choice and the only thing I'd trust on an older laptop since it is far and away the superior install.  Millions of consumers have completed my tutorial here without a single one who has ever come back with a follow up issue as long as they follow the methods given:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

            <p>The Surface RT runs Windows RT which cannot run Apple iTunes. Apple iTunes is a x86 application which can only run on Intel/AMD processors. The Surface RT is using a ARM/nVidia based processor.
</p>

<p>You will need to install iTunes on a computer running Windows 8 or Windows 7/XP/Vista</p>

</p><p>I wanted to leave my feedback, but I can't because it says as below.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I called "Microsoft Korea customer service center", but the representative answered that I have to pay about $500 to replace with a refurbished one. I told her that I found the same case in other countries and had been offered a exchange without payment,
 but she said there's no such an option available in Korea.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I bought the first MS mouse in 1990's, I have been a fan of MS hardware product.</p>
<p>After I bought my Surface Pro 4, I recommend it to my brother and bought another one for my son, he is happy with his college class. In total,
<strong>3 </strong>pcs of surface pro 4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nevertheless, I am not welcomed as a good consumer of MS.</p>
<p>should I stay with this ugly screen, or I have to pay $500, while I only paid little over $600 for my son's one last year.</p>

            <p>First, once a device starts separating because of a bulging battery, it is NOT<br />safe to use. <br />You originally said "I told her that I found the same case in other countries<br />and had been offered a exchange without payment, but she said there's no such an<br />option available in Korea. " - I know that the SL*2* was officially launched in<br />Korea, but can't find a listing for the original Surface Laptop. Where did you<br />purchase it? <br />There is no international warranty on Surface. When some people can't buy in<br />their own country from Microsoft or a Microsoft authorized reseller, sometimes<br />they buy in a different country than the one where they live. They find that<br />they can get software support, but not hardware because the device they have was<br />not officially sold in their country. The only solution is to find someone in a<br />supported country and have them handle the exchange. It becomes nearly<br />impossible with a bulging battery device as these requ

            So one issue leads to another. I updated from win 7 and didnt have a problem till the fall creaters update. Now no updates will install without erroring and guess what, what else could go wrong you ask, well now my computer is in an infanite loop. The
 loop is right after the POST and for .5 sec it trys to fix what ever is wrong then for .5sec it trys to find last known good configuration then bamo REBOOT. So from again watching endless videos to try and resolve without any luck my computered is bricked.
 There is no way to get into the os, no way to get to safe mode, no way to get to the repair utility. What does MICROSOFT in there infinite wisdom want me to do? Oh do you know hard hard it is for a person to type and research on an smart phone because oh yeah
 my computer is worthless now

            Any 3rd party virus/malware programs installed running or not?&nbsp; you can try and run in safe mode by forcing a shut down hold the power switch down until it shuts down reboot you may have to do this 3 or 4 times to get it in the safe mode, if you can get
 into the safe mode you may have to do a reinstall using an ISO from the&nbsp; W10 media creation tool site.

<h2>            problem after upgrade, system thread exception not handled</h2>
                    I have a lenovo G-50 80 laptop, with two graphics cards, one an AMD Radeon HD 8500M and another the intel internal graphics, i have upgraded to windows 10, and recently I got the cortana upgrade, after the upgrade however, whenever my PC starts, it shows
 a blue screen with the error system thread exception not handled, it then automatically restarts and starts running normally more or less, however it has become slower too after the boot, I tried upgrading the drivers from the device manager, but the problem
 was not solved, please help

            <p><span><span>Hi,&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand the inconvenience you are facing currently. Let me help you in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The Blue Screen error usually occurs when a serious problem causes the computer to shut down or restart unexpectedly. This type of errors usually happens when there are some driver issues on the computer. However, it might also
 be due to some other software/hardware reasons.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In this case, the <strong><span>System Thread Exception Not Handled</span></strong> error seems to be due to the incompatible or old graphics card drivers on the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In order to fix this issue, the computer must be restarted in safe mode. Once after booting the computer in Safe Mode, you have to uninstall the incompatible graphics card driver from the Device Manager and then download and install the latest drivers
 from the manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Boot the computer in Safe Mode </strong></p>
<p>Safe mode is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer with limited drivers necessary to run Windows. The words
<strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong> appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you are using.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Use the power button on the sign-in screen to <strong>
Shift + Restart</strong>. This will take you to the recovery boot menu. </p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> Click <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>,
<strong>Advanced options</strong>, <strong>Startup settings</strong>. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You then see a list where you can choose&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong><span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Safe Mode with Networking</span></strong><span>&nbsp;(depending on whether you think you’ll need the Internet).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: Update drivers.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Step 1: Press <strong>Windows key + X key</strong> and click on <strong>
Device manager</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Step 2: Search for <strong>Display Adapters</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Step 3: Right-click on the <strong>graphics</strong> <strong>card</strong> and click on
<strong>Update driver</strong> software.</span></p>
<p><span>You may also download and install the latest graphic drivers from the manufacturer’s website.</span></p>

    <title>What are the default settings for ClearType in Windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pollsmor  say:</h3>
<h2>            What are the default settings for ClearType in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Earlier today I tinkered around with the ClearType settings and the font looks different or weird in some places now. I want to set it back to default, but I never bothered to memorize the default selection for all 5 ClearType screens and I can't find any
 button that sets it back to default. Yes, I've checked all over the web but they were either 1) The answers to the questions did nothing to help or 2) They were for Windows 7/8/8.1, which only had 4 ClearType screens to select from. I believe Microsoft has
 added a fifth one in Windows 10. If anyone has the default settings on Windows 10, it would be greatly appreciated if you shared them :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, I'm not sure if the ClearType tinkering also affected the font of the text in the search box below&nbsp;the URL bar, but occasionally,&nbsp;when I type something into it,&nbsp;the text&nbsp;definitely isn't Calibri and is smaller. Maybe this is just a bug in Windows
 10 or changing ClearType settings really screwed up something?</p>

            Have you checked the ClearType Text Tuner?&nbsp; That generally controls most of the places in the system that might use ClearType.

            Everywhere else the font seems to be normal now (more on that later) besides the search box below the URL bar in Edge. If you mean turn off ClearType and turn it back on again, I did that, and either I am on the default settings right now or&nbsp;it did not
 reset with the turning off and turning back on.&nbsp;I decided to check a Windows 7 video displaying the 4 default ClearType screens and randomly picked the one that looked best to me for the 5th screen that is not in that video. Oh well. Its' not like&nbsp;the weird
 font appears in Edge every time I search in it. Maybe its' an issue with the OS and not ClearType. Thanks for the help nonetheless :)

<h2>            Microsoft apps fail to launch in Windows 10</h2>
                    Microsoft store and photos apps won't launch. I haven't tried other Microsoft apps to see if this is a general problem. I've tried troubleshooting, resetting, updating, powershell ('Deployment failed with HRESULT: 0x80073CF6, Package could not be registered.<br />
An internal error occurred with error 0x80070005.') I've tried everything I've been able to find in forums and advice pages over the last several hours. This happened when I download S Plan from the Store as the recommended program for opening a document created
 in Soft Plan 2014. It failed to launch so I uninstalled it, then noticed other apps failed to launch eg photos when the document was resent to me as a jpeg. Can you help. Thanks

            Hi Anthony, thanks for the suggestions but unfortunately neither worked - the Store app failed to launch in the new profile, and the system override failed. The app that appears to have caused the issue came from the Microsoft Store. I can't check the
 name of the app now (because I can't access the store) but Microsoft might want to take a look at it. It was a recommended app for opening a .spd file. I have some restore discs but I'm not feeling confident about using them.

<h2>            Windows 10 Customizations Dissappear Frequently</h2>
                    <p>I have a network environment that is running Windows 10 Education 1803 Build 1734.376.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have a GPO's to force partial start menus, but still allow for customization.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>We run roaming profiles with Folder Redirection.</p>
<p>I have also pushed the following registry key.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>SpecialRoamingOverrideAllowed = 1</span></p>
<p>Seems like about every 2-4 weeks I loose all my start menu customization's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking through my event log, I have a Event ID 522 in my Application Log:</p>
<p>
</p><p>ShellExperienceHost (3744,P,98) TILEREPOSITORYS-1-5-21-3394192641-2219854386-3001753716-3967: An attempt to open the device with name "\\.\C:" containing "C:\" failed with system error 5 (0x00000005): "Access is denied. ". The operation will fail with error
 -1032 (0xfffffbf8).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas why this would happen on a frequent basis? But not happen daily?</p>

<p>I am trying to load XP but it load part of the way and then can't find certian files from the CD drive. The drive seems to work at times then I'm not so sure at other times. If I format the hd and load the XP OS shouldn't this be it or is something software

<p>Do you mean you are installing from Microsoft Windows® XP™ installation media or are you using the HP recovery process?&nbsp; i.e., were you using F12?</p>
<p>Telling us (in the title) that you have an HP laptop is hardly sufficient information.&nbsp; Please provide the model, or, better yet, the full HP product number.&nbsp; Please read:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/555375" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">KB555375 - How to ask

<p>Generally, in situations like yours, we suggest going to the manufacturer's support web site, in your case&nbsp;<a href="http://www.hp.com/#Support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.hp.com,</a> and going to the driver and downloads page for your model.&nbsp; You will need to download
 and install&nbsp;<em>all</em> pertinent drivers, updates, utilities, etc. for your system.</p>

 I had to wait 1 minute until it unfroze, and after that it was slow as sh*t and I couldn't even restart it, it would stay stuck on my desktop wallpaper. Then I just got impatient and removed my laptop battery and unplugged the AC cord. Then I restarted my

 inside the laptop got dislocated or something. And yes it was the only time I've dropped it. Also, when you let the black screen on for about 15 mins it goes into System Repair but that doesn't do anything at all.</span><br />

<p>Why is my screen black when I start Windows 7?<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/why-is-my-screen-black-when-i-start-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/why-is-my-screen-black-when-i-start-windows-7</a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong></p>
<p>Saving any needed data and re-installing Windows 7 might be the best option though here are a<br />
few others.</p>
<p>You can save your files by putting the drive in another computer or an external drive case and then<br />
backing them up. Do so using several methods in a redundant manner. Of course a real computer<br />
shop or your System maker can help recover the files.<br />
<br />
Or you could use an Ubuntu boot CD to back up the data.<br />
<br />
Use Ubuntu Live CD to Backup Files from Your Dead Windows Computer <br />
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/use-ubuntu-live-cd-to-backup-files-from-your-dead-windows-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/use-ubuntu-live-cd-to-backup-files-from-your-dead-windows-computer</a><br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Can you access Safe Mode? Repeatedly tap F8 as you boot? If so you can try Control Panel<br />
- Device Manager - Display Adapter - Double Click on - Driver tab - click UPDATE driver -<br />
then Right Click on Device and UNINSTALL - REBOOT.<br />
<br />
A method to try to access the desktop (try in both regular&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;and Safe Mode) is to CTRL +<br />
ALT + DEL - Task Manager and on Process Tab find EXPLORER.exe and END PROCESS on it - then<br />
on Applications&nbsp;Tab - lower right - New Task - type in EXPLORER.exe. Safe Mode is reached by<br />
repeatedly tapping F8 as you boot up. CTRL + SHIFT + ESC also starts Task Manager.<br />
<br />
First check this thread in case its a simple one and if not come back to this thread.</p>

<p>Black screen issues are extremely tough to repair and any fix is usually on a hit or miss<br />
basis. That there is no information on a black screen like there is on a blue screen just<br />
adds to the difficulty. Often using a restore point nor startup repair will have any effect.<br />
<br />
You can try a google to see suggested repairs some of which have worked however these<br />
cover a wide field of efforts.</p>
<p>Here is a video of one fix.</p>

<br />
Do you have a&nbsp;Window 7&nbsp;Disk? You can try System Restore from it. If you do not have the<br />
disks your system maker will sell them cheap. Or try from Safe Mode if you can get<br />
there.<br />

<h3> papa ron  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Media Player error&#58; Cannot play protected content. Protect content cannot be played in the selected display mode. </h2>
                    When I play a blu-ray movie on my new HP computer with the HDMI cable connected to my tv, after 30 seconds I get the error message discribed.&nbsp; It works in the store (Walmart) only when they selected projector output but not all on my Polaroid LCD TV. I
 was told by the tech at the store that it only works in projector mode because of copy protection on blu-ray.&nbsp;&nbsp;The movies don't&nbsp;display in any mode at home,&nbsp;(windows 7&nbsp;auto selects duplicate monitor).&nbsp;When I select projector both screens go black. I have set
 the display resolution on the tv to match my computer screen and it works fine as a external monitor but not with&nbsp;movies in&nbsp;media center.<br />
I am at a loss here, is there a setting I am missing?&nbsp;

<p><span><span>Hi papa ron,</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forums.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>We would like to get more information from you, to help troubleshoot your issue. Please answer the
 following questions as best you can.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Are you able to play the movie in the Windows Media player?</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Did you purchase the movie online?</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Are playing the directly from a website?</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Is the movie protected with the DRM?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>DRM stands for digital rights management. DRM is a technology used by content providers, such as
 online stores, to control how the digital music and video files you obtain from them are used and distributed. Some online stores sell and rent songs and movies that have DRM applied to them. A file that has DRM applied to it is known as a
<em>protected file</em>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Windows Media Player, as well as some online stores and devices, support or use a type of DRM known
 as Windows Media Digital Rights Management. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Media usage rights are permissions to use a protected file in a particular way. Content providers,
 such as online stores, can specify how you can use the protected files that you obtain from them. For example, a content provider can grant you the permission to play the file on your computer (a
<em>play right</em>), to burn the file to an audio CD (a <em>burn right</em>), or to sync the file to a portable device (a
<em>sync right</em>).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Each right can have certain qualities. For example, the content provider might grant you the following
 usage rights:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<span><span>The right to play a particular song on your computer an unlimited number of times</span></span>
</li><li>
<span><span>The right to sync that song to two portable devices five times per month</span></span>
</li><li>
<span><span>The right to burn the song to an audio CD twice</span></span>
</li></ul>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Media usage rights are sometimes called licenses.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the movie is not protected with the DRM would suggest that you update the display adapter driver
 with the latest driver available in the manufacturer website.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>How to update the graphics card driver on the machine</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click
<span>Start</span>, click <span>Control Panel</span>, and then double-click
<span>System</span>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the
<span>Hardware tab</span>, and then click <span>Device Manager</span><strong>.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>NOTE:
</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.</span></span></p>

    <title>Is Windows 10 much better than Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Is Windows 10 much better than Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ok I hope some of you might help me in deciding if I should upgrade to Windows 10 or just stay with Windows 7.&nbsp; I know that now that Windows 8 came out there has been a lot of people who don't like it and wish the would have stayed with Windows 7 and
 I know my former boss switched&nbsp;from Windows 7 to Window 8 and they do not like it at all they have so many problems with it and when&nbsp;Windows 8 came out I wanted to upgrade to it and asked a member from the Geek&nbsp;Squad from Best Buy if I should upgrade and he
 told me no don't do it just stay with Windows 7. Now I know that times change and so does technology and of course things do get better but my concern is this upgrade to Windows 10 I don't want to upgrade to something I don't know nothing about I only know
 Windows 7 and I think I'm right by saying that if I do upgrade to Windows 10 I will no longer be able to go back to Windows 7 so I hope you all understand where I'm coming from with this issue. I hope&nbsp;that you all can help me make the right decision.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks Armando</p>

</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Is Media Center supported&nbsp;in Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>No. Persons who need to use Media Center should consider carefully before upgrading from their previous version of Windows. The Windows 10 upgrade will automatically remove any installations of Media Center.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So what are the alternatives if I need Media Center?</strong></p>
<p>Your best option is to continue running your existing version of Windows with Media Center.</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows 7 editions that include Media Center will continue to be supported until January 2020.</li><li>Windows 8 Pro with Media Center will continue to be supported until January 2023.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Will Windows Media Center be available in Windows&nbsp;10?</strong></p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Windows Media Center is not part of Windows&nbsp;10 and won’t be available after upgrading to Windows 10. If you use Windows Media Center, we will alert you during upgrade that Windows Media Center is not available on Windows&nbsp;10. We know that some users use Windows
 Media Center to play DVDs, and we are providing a free DVD playback app in Windows&nbsp;10 for Windows Media Center users.</p>

<p>Microsoft,</p>
<p>I already have a dedicated email set up for my xbox live account, I am sick and tired of having to set up multiple accounts just to access my xbox live.&nbsp; If you want to add the OPTION to add another one then by all means do so but it is getting beyond ridiculous
 to keep multiple email accounts to use this service.&nbsp; It is <strong>[MOD REMOVED]&nbsp;</strong>ANNOYING, KNOCK IT OFF!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey there, are you referring to the secondary email you add to your account as a security proof? Have you done this through the PC or console because if it's still asking for you to add an email there's a good chance it hasn't worked properly.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Please follow the link and click 'Manage your security info' and sign-in to add security proofs and also verify them. Once that's done you shouldn't be asked to add another email:

<p>The issue is that XBOX may want to consider adding a feature to allow people who played old consoles and then went online to sign up and now we have secondary console accounts not linked to the Live account. We ought to be able to merge these consol accounts
 into master XBOX live account. It would be easily done as this is only a Database issue on the games played and rewards to be merged... I'm sure that there are many out there like me who would love this. Please consider this as a very much needed update for
 us old school gamers.</p>

            Uninstall the printer drivers.<br />
<br />
Try - Right click on the driver installation program and select Troubleshoot Compatibilty. Follow the prompts.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, it may be that you will have to accept that your printer is now obsolete.

    <title>windows 10 fail automatic repair fail - cant choose keyboard layout - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kevinbell220859  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 fail automatic repair fail - cant choose keyboard layout</h2>
                    <p>48 hours ago I downloaded windows 10. It was a Microsoft recommended upgrade from (I think) windows 8.</p>
<p>It briefly worked but when I returned home today it was attempting an automatic repair. However it stalled immediately at the "choose keyboard layout" page as neither mouse or keyboard are operational so I cannot get beyond this page.</p>
<p>I am essentially a non technical man but I have done my research, changing keyboard and mouse and even (strange advice it seemed to me but I tried) unpluggng my ethernet cable withou success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All other fixes seem to rēcommend reinstallīng windows 10 from the installation disk (which I dont have - it was a download) and although the Dell desktop pc is only about 3 years old and I bought frōm new I do not have the previous windows installation
 cd either. So to be clear I have no installation cd.<br />
Can yoū help please?</p>
<p>thanks</p>
<p>kevin</p>

            <p>Hi Hannah,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for sharing your concern on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To assist you better, I like to know; what is the make and model of your Computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to remove all the external devices connected to your system, except Keyboard and mouse and check if it helps.
</p>
<p>If the issue persists, try using the different keyboard and mouse to check if it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps, reply to us with the status of your issue We will be happy to assist you.</p>

<p>I have an HP, windows7. Ultimately I went to HP's website and was able to get to a restore program on my computer, that allowed be to return to factory default. Windows 10 is definitely not for every computer.</p>

            Hi, &nbsp;I hope you can help me. I too have the same problem and your suggestion, albeit very informative, will not work since I can not get to my desktop start screen to do anything. It is permanently stuck on the "choose your keyboard layout" screen. I have
 tried multiple suggestions, new keyboard, new mouse, f8, f9 10 11 12...etc. NOTHING is working. I have a 2nd job working from home on my HP Pavilion pc and have not been able to work for 2 weeks now! Please help. I am having to try to do things from my old,
 slow android phone.
