</p><p>Sorry if you don't need all the information above to answer the question, thought i'd add it just in case. Basically my problem is that some Windows Apps such as Windows Mail, Calendar etc. stop responding whilst I'm using them and just randomly force close,
 this is a random event as sometimes it works fine. An example of when it mainly force closes is when I am creating or viewing a email, it will suddenly stop responding, wait maybe 10 seconds then force close.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Display issue after upgrade to windows10 from windows7</h2>
                    <p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the free upgradadation of windows OS from 7 to windows 10, I am facing display issue with my laptop. The monitor display changed to black &amp; white mode as same as earlier days we get screen display once&nbsp;windows is installed. The same continuous upto
 few seconds and it changed to its color display afterwards. I had checked installed driver details and found OK. what needs to be done to correct this issue, is it software or driver related one or hardware related one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 has no system drive, so I cannot repartition it . - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kittycat&#35;123  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 has no system drive, so I cannot repartition it .</h2>
                    Surface Pro 3 using a Recovery Image USB drive says "NO SYSTEM DRIVE FOUND"!&nbsp; So RePartitioning will not work from a downloaded Recovery Image on a USB Drive!&nbsp; Drive letter C is reassigned to the USB drive, since no system drive was found!&nbsp; Without a system
 drive being recognized by the Recovery Image Downloaded Software on my USB drive, how can I install anything?&nbsp; It seems I am in a "Catch 22" situation and can't do anything by using the Recovery Image downloaded from Microsoft then unzipped and moved files
 to a USB drive as per Microsoft's instructions.&nbsp; I have done this with both Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 system images also, but neither works and both state the same thing, NO SYSTEM DRIVE FOUND and/or A SYSTEM PARTITION IS MISSING!&nbsp; Please reply to below address
 because I am working on this Tablet Unit belonging to my wife.&nbsp; I had to log in under her name and email, but don't reply back to her as she needs me to fix this for her.&nbsp; Les&nbsp; *

<p>Using DOS command the Surface Pro 3 shows that it has reassigned the letter C to the 32GB USB Drive that I have installed Microsoft's Recovery Image for this S/N'd Unit from Microsoft's Site.&nbsp; When it allows me to try RE-PARTITION using the Recovery Image
 Drive it tells me NO SYSTEM DRIVE FOUND.&nbsp; So I can't load or install anything and can't create a partition which it says is missing, if it can't find the SYSTEM DRIVE. Consequently I'm in a catch 22 with this Surface Pro 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, from what I have seen by using several DOS commands, I am thoroughly convinced that the SSD is operating and in good health and would be able to boot IF IT HAD A GOOD PARTITION AND DRIVE LETTER ASSIGNED TO IT, which would then allow the Windows
 8.1 or 10 Recovery Image to re-load the original operating system program; BUT HOW CAN I DO THAT?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I firmly believe there is nothing wrong with the system drive and hardware and believe it is all software related. The operational problems happened when Windows automatically forced Hardware Updates onto this machine around Sept. 9th or 10th of 2018.&nbsp; All
 I have is the Recovery Images from Microsoft&nbsp; on USB Drives, both Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 on separate brand new FAT32 formatted USB drives.&nbsp; And, neither of them will help in this situation.&nbsp; Any and all help appreciated, thanks in advance, Les&nbsp; *** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />

 similar) on the One.</p>
<p>Any plans for this in the future?&nbsp; Seems like it should be a no brainer now.</p>

<h2>            Windows Movie Maker 2.6 half black screen after recent Windows Update</h2>
                    All of a sudden my finished movie edit is half black.&nbsp; I tried a system restore after reading about an update causing the problem even though I didn't see that specific one installed.&nbsp; I went back a month and it was fine..then the stupid computer automatically
 installed the updates again that causes the problem. &nbsp; So I did it again and turned off automatic updates.&nbsp; Now my Zune software doesn't work either.&nbsp;
<br />
Do I have to leave the updates off forever now? Or will Microsoft issue a fix?&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried to choose install but select to download but that did nothing..windows installed them anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp; So uninstalling the update does nothing because eventually it will get installed
 again.<br />
I am using WMV format with XP and 2.6 windows movie maker<br />
I have .net framework 2.0,3.0 service pack 2 <br />
3.5 sp1<br />
framework 4.0 client profile and extended<br />
I thought I had some other service pack on my computer but I don't see it now.<br />

            When you uninstall it visit Windows Update, run a custom scan and when it shows up, uncheck and check don't show again then click review and install updates. It should no longer download and install after that.<br />

<p>Hi BARYE,<br />
<br />
I understand how important it is for you to transfer your Windows Media Center upgrade pack to your new Windows 8.1 Pro PC. However, your license/key is tied to the first PC on which first installed. Therefore, transferring it alone is not possible. You need
 to transfer it together with the licensed computer. Please check the <strong>PDF</strong> below for full documentation of the Windows 8 Media Center Pack upgrade agreement. In addition to that, Windows 8 and 8.1 Pro Pack and Media Pack are no longer available
 for purchase from Microsoft. You may check this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3107057/windows-8-and-8-1-pro-pack-and-media-pack-are-no-longer-available-to-b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> for more information.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Anytime Upgrade- reinstallation problems</h2>
                    A while back I upgraded my computer from Win 7 Home Prem to Win 7 Pro via the 'Windows Anytime Upgrade' download path from the MS Store.&nbsp; The computer originally came installed with the MS Windows 7 Home Premium which did not include a Windows 7 product
 installation disc.&nbsp; How can I reinstall the software via the upgrade path without having the install disc?&nbsp; I tried doing it via the Anytime Upgrade path, however, I received an 'invalid product key' message when I attempted to do so.&nbsp; My computer is acting
 a wee bit strange, and I'd like to try this route first to hopefully remedy the problem rather than commit to a clean install.&nbsp; (I've already verified that the product key is valid and activated.)<br />

            <p>You must first reinstall Windows 7 Home Premium, reactivate it then do the Anytime Upgrade again to Windows 7 Professional, then reactivate by telephone:</p>
<p><strong>First you need to find your Anytime Upgrade key:</strong></p>
<p>An e-mail containing your Product Key will be sent to the e-mail address associated with your Windows Live ID or to the e-mail you provided if you skipped account setup. Note: If you are using an e-mail spam blocker tool or junk mail filter, make sure you
 can receive e-mail messages from microsoft.com.</p>
<p>What happens if I lose my Product Key?</p>
<p>If you lose your Product Key you can return to <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_install/windows-7-anytime-upgrade-reinstallation-problems/www.windows7.com/getkey">www.windows7.com/getkey</a>
 and sign in using the 'Sign In' link in the top right corner of the page. This will retrieve your Product Key if you established your account with your Windows Live ID. If you did not setup a Windows Live ID account initially there is no record of your Product
 Key online. Check your e-mail since this is the only record of your Product Key.</p>
<p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows 7 often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>If your recovery partition is not available or damaged, you should contact the manufacturer of your computer and request a recovery disc set you can use to reinstall Windows 7. They might charge a small shipping and handling fee.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don't have a Windows 7 Home Premium recovery disc or partition, you can download and burn a .ISO image and use it to reinstall Windows 7 Home Premium using the product key located on the coa sticker at the bottom of your laptop;</p>

<p><em>Preparing Disk cleanup </em></p>
<p><strong>Disk Cleanup – </strong>This is always a favorite place to start, because it list many of the common locations where old unused files that are often not needed any more are stored. To find Disk Cleanup, click Start, type: Disk Cleanup. Alternatively,
 you can find it under Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools. When Disk Cleanup is started, you are prompted to select the drive on which you would like to do the cleanup. In this case, its the operating system drive where Windows 7 is installed,
 usually C:\. If you are running Windows 7 in a dual boot configuration with another operating system, click in the list box and select the drive on which it is installed. Click OK.</p>

<p><em>Disk Cleanup dialog</em></p>
<p>An initialization wizard will scan you hard disk to check for areas of the system you will be able to run the clean up on. After the scanning is complete, the Disk Cleanup dialog appears. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up
 safely. The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures
 Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.

<td>When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as
<em>System error memory dump files</em> to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review.

<p>In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from Windows Vista
 or clean install, Windows 7 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.

<p>A folder you might be familiar with is the Windows.old, in a future article I will be taking a closer look at this directory. Its basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971760" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">reinstall Windows</a> if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings.
 The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space and reduce the systems performance. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 7 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories
 and ensure that everything migrated successfully to Windows 7. </p>
<p><strong>System Restore</strong> – The Windows Team has added some nice enhancements to Windows 7′s System Restore feature, allowing you to keep a larger collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your

System Images of Windows 7</a>. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 7 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that
 System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of disk space to keep System Restore Points.</p>

<p><em>Configuring System Protection settings</em></p>
<p>To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the
<strong>Configure </strong>button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the
 amount allocated. Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System
 Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance,
 if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file.

<p><strong>Performance Information and Tools</strong></p>
<p>Introduced in Windows Vista, it provides a lists of your computer’s Windows Experience Index base score, which indicates the performance and overall capability of your computer’s hardware. If you look under the Task pane in Performance Information and Tools,
 you will see Tasks where you can make further adjustments to improve the performance of your computer.

<p><strong>Visual Effects – </strong><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/11/10/making-windows-7-your-own-personalize-and-themes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Back in November</a> I discussed some of the theming capabilities built into Windows 7. Some of these themes
 are designed for PC’s with limited capabilities. Microsoft calls these Basic and High Contrast themes. To access them, right click your desktop, click Personalize.</p>
<p><em>Windows Aero Basic</em> – For computers that cannot support the minimum graphics requirements of Windows Aero Glass. Aero Basic features the standard elements of the Windows 7 interface except for the translucent effects and animations. Instead, areas
 such as the Taskbar, window borders display a blue/grayish color scheme. Other unavailable features include the inability to choose a Window Color, see and interact with thumbnail previews, Alt-Tab Preview, Flip 3D and Aero Peek.</p>
<p><em>Windows Classic</em><strong> </strong>- First introduced with Windows 95, this experience was the flagship theme for Windows for many years and was replaced by Windows XP’s Luna in 2001 but is still included in Windows for persons who are not quite ready
 for the changes in Windows 7. Microsoft has made some changes to Windows Classic in Windows 7 where menus are concerned. The standard look and feel still exist, but Microsoft has decided to remove the Standard Classic Menu that was available as an option in
 both Windows XP and Vista. Personally, I agree with this, since the new Start menu offers so many benefits such as Instant Search, easier access to programs, better control (no cascading/off screen sub menus), ability to search HomeGroups, Public directories
 and detailed results when presented. The new Start menu also introduces support for features unique to Windows 7 such as Jump List providing access to task and recently accessed files associated with a program.</p>
<p><em>High Contrast themes</em><strong> </strong>- If you have difficulty reading or viewing your screen, Windows has for years included high-contrast color schemes that heightens the color contrast of some text and images on your computer, making those items
 more distinct and easier to identify.</p>
<p><a href="http://byfiles.storage.msn.com/y1pXYOMtvelY4ZuY3_AidJT9Z6uVeOAW0BZ3ULlyxtVIIhM1BLc3MQVhpptfnlpQzxGT9khwxsmQnc?PARTNER=WRITER" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fbyfiles.storage.msn.com%2fy1pmwhndRmMupmAiVvTgFQQfGJehu2cTfV2ebVltvM03V-LOhHewxYge-aGocUFm0fV5S8G-Kb15Yc%3fPARTNER%3dWRITER" /></a></p>
<p><em>Indexing Options</em></p>
<p><strong>Indexing Options – </strong>Instant Search makes it quick and easy to find personal files and folders you commonly use. To improve the performance of your search experience, make sure the Index is not set to search the entire computer, searching
 areas such as System and Program Files directory can greatly slow down the performance of your searches and provide less reliable results. You can instead add folders you often search or store files.</p>
<p><strong>Power Settings – </strong><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/12/02/environmentally-friendly-decisions-for-todays-pc-user/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">In December</a>, we talked about some of the energy efficiency improvements built into Windows 7 that allow
 you be more productive on the go and also provide better performance in certain scenarios.</p>
<p><em>Windows 7 extends battery life for your mobile PC, helping you be productive longer while still getting great performance. Power-saving enhancements include increasing the idle time for the processor, automatically dimming the display, and more power-efficient
 playback for DVDs. With Windows 7, you’re also kept better-informed about battery status.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Get Idle and Stay Idle Longer.</em></strong> An idle processor reduces battery life. Windows 7 reduces background activities and supports the trigger-starting of system services, so your computer’s processor can be in an idle state more often.
</p>
<p><strong><em>Adaptive Display Brightness.</em></strong> The display on a typical mobile PC consumes more battery power than any other part of the computer. Windows 7 automatically reduces display brightness after a period of inactivity, much like cell phones
 do today. And Windows 7 intelligently adapts to your activity. For example, if the screen dims after 30 seconds and you immediately move the mouse to brighten<br />
the display, Windows 7 will wait 60 seconds before dimming the display again. <strong>

<p><strong>Startup Performance</strong></p>
<p>We install a lot of applications on our computers. Sometimes, those applications will place special files in areas of the operating system such as the Startup Folder to make launching the application faster. Sometimes a program might even create a special
 Service that prepares itself when Windows is starting up. If you have a lot of these types of programs installed, some of them can have a adverse effect on your systems performance. To resolve this, you can simply launch the Microsoft Configuration Utility
 (msconfig). MSCONFIG provides a host of options for managing how your computer starts up and also for diagnostic purposes when your system might not start properly. To launch MSCONFIG, click
<strong>Start</strong>, type: <strong>msconfig.exe</strong>, hit <strong>Enter </strong>
on your keyboard, or click <strong>msconfig.exe </strong>result in the Start menu.

<p><em>System Configuration Utility (MSCONFIG)</em></p>
<p>When msconfig is displayed on your screen, you will see the main interface, General (tab), which manages how your computer starts. The main tab we need to go to is
<strong>Startup. </strong>At this tab, we will see a list of items that startup with the system when Windows is loading. Now, there are some programs in here that are essential, but some might not be needed when the computer starts, check out the following
 table of some of the applications I have that load programs during start up and the ones I have unchecked:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Program</td>
<td>Description</td>
<td>Check or Uncheck</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kmaestro (x64)</td>
<td>This program is associated with my sound card, so I will keep it of course. Yours will be listed under a different name, for instance Creative Audio products might be listed as Creative or diagent.</td>
<td><strong>Check</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Microsoft Security Essentials</td>
<td>This is my security program of choice, yours might be different, you can easily identify your security software under the Manufacturer column, Symantec, Microsoft, McAfee, Kaspersky, ESET or a number of others.
</td>
<td><strong>Check</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Microsoft Windows Operating System</td>
<td>This item loads commands associated with essential areas of the system such as Program Files and Windows Directories, definitely keep these checked.</td>
<td><strong>Check</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Microsoft Encarta Dictionary</td>
<td>If you have Microsoft Encarta installed, it also installs a program called Encarta dictionary. I use it a lot to make sure I spell words correctly. If you don’t use it often, then you can uncheck it.</td>
<td><strong>Uncheck</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Logitech</td>
<td>A manufacturer of various input devices such as Mice, Keyboard, video cams and Game controls, this is often associated with an input device of some kind, definitely leave it.</td>
<td><strong>Check</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Quicktime</td>
<td>Apple Computers multimedia software for viewing and listening different types of content such as movie trailers, its rarely used, but usually comes bundled with other popular software from Apple such as iTunes</td>
<td><strong>Uncheck</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Bluetooth software</td>
<td>This is often used by devices such as cell phones to transfer files and some wireless input devices such as keyboards and mice to communicate with the system.
</td>
<td><strong>Check</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Adobe Acrobat</td>
<td>Used for viewing Adobe’s Portable Document Format (PDF), this program is not something you are regularly doing I am sure and having it checked does not necessarily add any convenience to viewing PDF’s any faster.
</td>
<td><strong>Uncheck</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>NERO Home</td>
<td>Aheads popular program used for burning content to optical disks, Nero Home is just a quick way to access certain aspects of the program. Personally, its pointless, you could easily at a Shortcut to the Taskbar.</td>
<td><strong>Uncheck</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>iTunes</td>
<td>iTunes is a very popular jukebox software created by Apple Inc. In addition to being a music player, its used with the ubiquitous iPod, one of which I own. Personally, the faster this program starts up, the better for me. If you don’t own a iPod or iPhone,
 having it checked for start up does not add any significant benefit unless you are using it as your default music player and you have a large library.
</td>
<td><strong>Depends </strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Yahoo! Messenger</td>
<td>Popular instant messaging, I rarely use it, but even if I have to, storing it in your Notification Area and startup items is just using up precious CPU cycles and memory, definitely remove it. If you do use it, simply pin it to your Taskbar.
</td>
<td><strong>Uncheck</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Daemon Tools</td>
<td>I use this program to mount .ISO files which are virtual disk images of programs that are offered in that format. So instead of installing from a physical DVD or CD I just point to the .ISO file of that program and it shows up like a regular disk in the
 Computer environment. This is not a program used by the average PC user, even if you are not the the average PC user, having it in your start up is not gonna load those .ISO files any faster.</td>
<td><strong>Uncheck</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Windows Live Family Safety</td>
<td>Installed as a part of the innovative suite of products and free services – Windows Live Essentials, it provides parents with thorough parental control capabilities that go beyond what is included in Windows 7′s Parent Controls, allowing you to keep track
 of your child’s online activities. If you are a parent who shares a PC with a child and already utilize Windows 7 Parental Controls, then definitely keep this checked.</td>
<td><strong>Depends</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Groove</td>
<td>Included as a part of the Microsoft Office Enterprise and Ultimate edition suites, Groove is used for collaboration with colleagues, team work and brain storming. If you are not involved in such activities, then you can certainly uncheck it.
</td>
<td><strong>Uncheck</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Java(TM) Platform SE 6 U12</td>
<td>Developed by SUN Microsystems, Java is a popular applet used by many applications on the Internet or desktop. Certain programs require that Java is installed before they can work. Having it as a Start up item I personally notice does not add any significant
 benefit except alert you to new versions of the applet. </td>
<td><strong>Uncheck</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>RealPlayer </td>
<td>An alternative media player juke box, I use it to download videos from the Internet. Having it as a start up item is unnecessary. RealPlayer has a tendency to pop up annoying notifications too.
</td>
<td><strong>Uncheck</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>VMware Workstation</td>
<td>I use this program to manage virtual instances of other operating systems. This program simply enables quick access to the VMware interface. I don’t have it checked and the program continues to function just fine.</td>
<td><strong>Uncheck</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>OneNote</td>
<td>Another Microsoft Office family program, it is used for note taking, organization and management of information. Its also a handy application if you use a Tablet PC or computer with inking support. If you are in need of those capabilities, I would leave
 this unchecked. I use it to gather snippets of information I come across on the Internet or need to take a note of. So even though I don’t own a Tablet, OneNote still comes in handy.

<p>There is my list, of course yours will vary because of the hundreds of millions of configurations that exist and the millions of applications available for Windows. If you are unsure about a program, do a search on the Internet about it before unchecking.
 Keep a small inventory of the programs you are using, look in the notification area of the Windows Taskbar to see what is displayed. Hover the mouse pointer over the icon, which will display a balloon about that program. Also,
<a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/24/how-to-backup-your-installation-of-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
do a backup</a> before unchecking anything. If you do get confused, the Startup tab displays a button near the bottom of the window called
<em>Restore Startup Programs…,</em> which will restore the startup items to their default configuration.

                    I downloaded Windows 10, since doing so I cannot upload any file attachments into anything. I have tried uploading Word Docs, and&nbsp;Pictures on various websites. This is wasting my valuable time. Then there are no real solutions coming from Microsoft as

<p>
</p><p>Please check the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>With the Surface connected to the Docking Station and network, unplug the Docking Station from the power outlet, leave it unplugged for 30 seconds to a minute, then plug it back
 and see if the network is recognized.</span></li><li><span>After, please&nbsp;check for&nbsp;Windows updates&nbsp;one&nbsp;last time,&nbsp;while the Docking Station&nbsp;is connected to the Surface.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Do you have the possibility to test a different Surface Pro Docking Station? If you have a Microsoft Store in your area, please try to do so. This is the best way to determine
 if the issue is indeed with the Docking station or hardware related.</span></li></ul>

<p>Hi Somnath,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype for Business and Skype are two different services. Skype for personal accounts cannot be used in Skype for Business. Meatnime, it is not feasible to set up two accounts in Skype for Business in iPhone at the same time. We recommend you submit feedback
 via the link below to improve Skype for Business features:</p>

<h2>            Headphones detected, but says they aren&#39;t plugged in</h2>
                    So I just reinstalled windows 8, and updated my drivers VIA_9500A, and my speakers now work. But, now I can't figure out why my front panel jacks aren't working. I have my 3.5mm headset jacks plugged into the proper spots, and my computer shows the microphone
 in the settings, but says they aren't plugged in. I have ran a sound troubleshoot, which it finds nothing wrong. I can disable them and check properties, but that is it. I can't set as default or anything. I have plugged my Blue Microphone I use for recording,
 and that works fine which is a USB. Help would be greatly appreciated so I can solve this little annoyance.

            Ok solved the issue. I needed the Gigabyte-GA-Z77X-D3H-rev-11-VIA-Audio-Driver-10800a driver. I kept getting the 9500A which wasn't compatible with windows 8. Go ahead and set this as solved :D<br />

<p>I posted the following question: <span>
Adobe Flash Player. Whenever I play a video on Adobe flash player it stops and then starts again....this happens every 10 seconds or so. Why doesn't the video play without these
 pauses....I don't know what to do.....it drives me crazy.&nbsp; </span></p>

<p><span>I received an answer that seemed to correct the problem but now Flash Player is doing the same thing again.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I tried un-installing and re-installing Adobe Flash player 10.1 but this doesn't take care of the problem.&nbsp; It also doesn't matter what site I am playing the video, AOL news, youtube, etc. or whether I use IE 8 or Mozilla Firefox as my web browser.&nbsp;
 I tried contacting Adobe about this problem without success.&nbsp; Does anyone know what causes this problem?&nbsp; I would appreciate any solution.</span></p>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>I have just finished creating my xbox live account online on the computer and i know this may sound silly but i have absolutely no idea how to get it to apply to my console, when i connect my xbox 360 to the internet box and go to the live section it just
 tells me to create an account i don't know if i am in the wrong menu or what ? my xbox has never been connected to xbox live befor and i would be gratefull of any help or advice.</p>

 to log on with my console to xbox live with the account i created here. it is exceedingly anoying me and i really would be gratefull of any information because i really don't want to create a new hotmail account just to be able to connect to xbox live</p>

<p>Thanks for answering my message, &nbsp;i've just gone and tried to follow your advice but here is what happens : &nbsp;i have tried to be as precise and as clear as possible and sorry if the text is rather long to read.</p>
<p>I turn on my xbox and arrive at the play game menu i scroll up and arrive at the xbox live menu here i have the choice of join xbox live for free and joining various xbox live applications like games market and video market ect...</p>
<p>So i press A on join xbox live for free and arrive at menu which has two choices one of the is titled frre registration and gives the only choice of join xbox live and the other option is titled join xbox liuve and receive a present and gives the same only
 choiice of join xbox live i press A on either of them</p>
<p>They both bring me to a menu "called welcome to xbox live" and lower down is a text saying "this process can take a few minutes" folowed by "add your email adress" ; "verifie settings" and "accept the registration conditions" the only choice i get given
 here is "continue" so i press A</p>
<p>Then i arrive at a menu asking me to type in my name i validate and then get a menu asking for my email ID i enter the one that i used to join this site then validate, it the askes me to put in a password like the one i use to login to hotmail i validate
 and then the signe pops up saying "this windows ID is associated to another gamertag. Specifie annother Windows Live ID and the password that goes with it"
</p>
<p>the only choice i have here is OK so I press A which brings me back to the menu asking for my windows id i put in the same id and the same ting happens again, ect...</p>
<p>I have tried scroling up and down or to the sides and the left and right buttons i have looked in other menus and have found no-where that lets me retrieve my gamertag i am sure of this because i repeated the entire process 6 times.</p>
<p>The ironic part is that on the head of the message telling me that this windows ID is associated to another gamertag... there is a yellow exclamation mark with recuperate the gamertag written next to it but it is clearly the title of the message and there
 is no way of selecting it so i press OK which is highlited in green at the bottom of the message.</p>
<p>It's as if a menu or an option is missing</p>

<p>Okay, at that "Play Game" menu (known as the 'My Xbox' channel), you will have the option to scroll to the right. There, you should either see the option to sign in, or, if you're already signed in, the option to sign out. If you select the sign in menu
 and scroll to the right again, you should see the option to recover a Gamertag. Please let me know if this helps!</p>

            Hi NongJin
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />This is not currently possible in Windows 10. You have to scan, save it to your Pictures folder, then manually attach it in your e-mail program or web mail service. 
<br />
<br />In earlier Windows versions and depending your scanning software, it was possible, but its not available in Windows 10.

            Hi Andra, thank you for quick response. Probably I didn't described it clearly. The scan to email setting is done in Canon's web based software.
<span>I think it is independent of OS version. </span>All it requires are email server info as I listed. I wondered what the correct webserver info is to enter into the Canon's printer software. I attached the screen shot here to illustrate. I have
 a hotmail account and want to see if hotmail serve can be used for setup scan-to-email function on my Canon all-in-one printer. Hope it helps clarify my question. Thanks.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ffacdda2-834e-4dec-855f-77b6414e44a6?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ffacdda2-834e-4dec-855f-77b6414e44a6?upload=true" /></a>

            Is this supposed to launch your web browser and open hotmail.com and attach your scanned image?
<br />
<br />Which web browser do you have set as your default in Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Default apps?
<br />
<br />This might be a factor why its not working.

<p>No. What you described is a different function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The function I tried to set up is that the user scan a document on the scanner and the scanner sends the scanned document to an email address the user enters on the scanner itself. It has nothing to do with any computer. To use this function, the scanner
 must be setup using an mail server. For my Canon all-in-1 printer (MF628cw), the setup is conducted through a website similar to setting up a router. The data is then transferred to the scanner through network. The screen shot I sent to you is what the scanner
 requires to be setup for the scan-to-email function.<br />

<p>I bought GTA V and when I try to install, my console returns with the message "Disc Unreadable". I returned to the retailer and they exchanged the game twice. I even cleaned the system cache many times, but the problem persists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've also tried contact with Rockstar with no success.</p>

<p>This is most likely a bad disc drive. &nbsp;Are you having issues with any other discs?</p>
<p>If so, I would call 800-469-9269, and they will provide you the options for repairing your drive.</p>

<p>Yes try different discs (games, dvds, etc) and see if you get the same results. If they all fail then your drive is going or has gone bad.

<p>Hi Neon,<br />
<br />
<strong>What size is your HDD? Is it an official Microsoft Xbox 360 Hard Drive?&nbsp;</strong><br />
<br />
If the HDD is official and has plenty of space, it may just be a bad disc. <strong>
Do you have a friend with whom you could test their disc?</strong> <br />
<br />
Let us know how that goes, or if you have anymore questions. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, Mr. Ohnaka,</p>
<p>My HDD is an official 250GB, and has 160gb of free space. I've exchanged the game disk twice and the problem still happening. I also tested the game on the vendor's console and it worked.</p>
<p>So, I think the problem is in my console, but, like I said, I can play other games with no problem. :(</p>
<p>tks for your help</p>

<p>Hi Neo,<br />
<br />
<strong>Alright, let's go ahead and remove your HDD, and recover your Xbox Live profile onto another storage device, such as a USB.</strong> Then attempt to play GTA V as normal.&nbsp;<br />

<p>I have the new xbox 360 slim (250gb) and&nbsp;I have the newest dashboard for the 360 and i cant find my mac address. I am
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>NOT</strong></span> connected to wifi because in order to get onto my schools network they need my MAC address. But I cant find it anywhere. I was told I have to connect to a network first to get my MAC address.
 There is nothing under advanced options for network settings. Please HELP!</p>

<p>@SoulDogWarrior, I told you I can't connect to wifi unless i give them my mac address</p>
<p>@taidara, i cant do any of that. this is what happens to me...i go to network settings&gt; then it lets me pick wired or a wireless network that if found or i can choose advanced options, but the only things in advanced options is "specify unlisted network"
 or "create ad-hoc network." And thats it, it wont let me choose wired/wireless or configure network.</p>
<p>All i need is to find my mac address to give to my school so they can let me access their network. But without it im stuck offline, not being able to connect to a network.</p>

<p>@awdrive You may not be able to connect to the wifi but you can still click on it. When you click on it is going to run the test anyways. Theres no way your school can stop you from testing the connection. once your in the connection screen you can do my
 steps above to find the mac address.</p>
<p>To further atest to this the MAC address is a physical Address and not only available when you connect to the internet so even if the connection fails you can still go into the configure network options and find the mac address there... I'm serious do it.</p>
<p>Just click on a wireless network that shows up enter a fake password and once it goes to test the connection it will fail. Press b. and then go thorugh the configure network steps above. If no wireless networks are found then use the advanced to connect
 to an unlisted network. Create a fake name a fake password and test. Again you will get the fail screen and can still go through the steps....</p>
