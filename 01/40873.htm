<h2>            Windows could not complete the installation.  To install windows on this computer, restart the installation.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know this is posted elsewhere - I did do a search, but I'm not having any luck with the instructions provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My friend turned his computer on and this error message appeared:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows could not complete the installation.&nbsp; To install windows on this computer, restart the installation."</p>
<p>
</p><p>With an "OK" button that simply reboots and throws the same error message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried running secpol and gpedit from the prompt, but neither works.&nbsp; I can run mmc, but I cannot get the "Local Users &amp; Groups" item to appear, despite adding the Computer Management snap in.&nbsp; (I believe this has something to do with security/accounts).&nbsp;
 Doing a winver show Windows 10 home, but I have a feeling this might be stuck in an accidental upgrade from windows 8 maybe...?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone offer any assistance?&nbsp; I hope I don't need to wipe the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<h3> joanjoselson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 version 1709 stopped Intel Real Sense 3D Camera from working</h2>
                    <p>Since automatic upgrade to Windows 10 version 1709 my Intel Real Sense 3D Camera in Dell Inspiron 15 laptop does not work.&nbsp; I've checked device manager and have the latest driver installed. Under settings, security, camera every app has is enabled to use
 the camera.&nbsp; This started after the upgrade and now the error message reads camera unavailable and Windows Hello doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before going back to the earlier version of Windows 10, I'd like alternatives, if possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Cameras
<br />Right click the camera, then click Uninstall
<br />
<br />Note: If you don't see it under cameras, look under Imaging devices. 
<br />
<br />Exit device manager then restart.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 should redetect it then reinstall it.
<br />
<br />Check if the camera is working again.
<br />
<br />If you have a third party Antivirus utility installed, please remove it.
<br />Also check the manufacturers website for updated driver. 
<br />
<br />Option 1. Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc or right-click empty space on the toolbar.
<br />Open “Task Manager” and go to the “Processes” tab.
<br />Carefully analyze what programs are currently running in the background of the system.
<br />If you found an app that uses Camera, for example, Skype running in the background, click it, and select “End Task.”
<br />
<br />Option 2. Try a Clean Boot
<br />Click “Windows key” and type msconfig.
<br />Click “System Configuration” and open “Services” tab.
<br />Mark “Hide all Microsoft services” box and select “Disable all.”
<br />Open “Startup” tab and click “Open Task Manager.”
<br />Click on each startup item and select “Disable.”
<br />Close Task Manager and click “OK” on the System Configuration window.
<br />Reboot the system.
<br />
<br />If Clean Boot helped to fix error, we would recommend you to enable apps one by one. After each enabled app, check if the Camera is working. This way, you will isolate the problematic application.

<p>After receiving your reply, I deleted the camera driver, restarted the pc and then Windows Hello worked along with the camera. This lasted for 6 days, when suddenly no more camera and no more Windows Hello.&nbsp; I tried the same procedure but it did not work.
 I went to the event log and instead of "device install requested, device migrated, device configured, device started, device installed", which occurred the first time (when it worked), the only events listed were "device deleted, device configured, device
 started and then the message below:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device USB\VID_8086&amp;PID_0A66&amp;MI_00\6&amp;36c1684f&amp;0&amp;0000 requires further installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What went wrong the second time, and why did the fix only last 6 days? &nbsp;</p>

            Hi Joan,<br />
<br />
A corrupted camera driver is one of the possible reasons why your 3D camera is not working. Have you tried to download and install the latest driver from the manufacturer's website of your webcam?
<br />
<br />
Let us know so we can further assist you.

<p>I visited the Intel web site and download an updated camera driver just after posting my former message.&nbsp; The next day everything worked again and today things worked as well. &nbsp;My fear is that the third party anti-virus software may cause problems in the
 future, but when I bought the laptop I prepaid for two years' worth of anti-virus protection and if I disable it they'll make me pay again to enable it so I'm afraid to mess with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, thank you for your help.&nbsp; I don't yet own a smartphone and use my laptop as a standalone, so I have not begun to use some of the new features in the latest Windows 10 update.</p>

<p>Just as before, the fix worked for 24 hours, I didn't use the computer the following day, and the next day no Windows Hello and no camera.&nbsp; I again deleted the camera driver and nothing changed.&nbsp; Then again I went to the Intel web site to download the most
 recent driver and it did not work this time.&nbsp; The device driver event log again reads that the driver was installed but that: "Device USB\VID_8086&amp;PID_0A66&amp;MI_00\6&amp;36c1684f&amp;0&amp;0000 requires further installation."</p>

</p><p><span>I'm sick of this and ready to go back to the earlier version of Windows 10 without all the new features that I don't use or need.&nbsp; I actually own Microsoft stock and it has always annoyed me that the company introduces upgrades as if they
 are mandatory and 50% of the time the upgrade works less well than the earlier version.</span></p>

<p>I did nothing to my Dell Inspiron 15 5000 series 5559 laptop (6th generation Core i7 6500U processor) since my last post and now not only does Hello not work but the camera application independently won't work and gives the error message "Sorry...camera
 error code: 0xA00F4271 (0xC00D36D5)." &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is unacceptable for your Windows 10 operating system to prevent built-in hardware from working altogether.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You guys NEED to give me a fix that won't potentially screw up the entire machine.&nbsp; If I go back to the previous version of Windows 10, will the camera work again?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I went to the Intel web site to download the latest driver, when the download was running the installation stopped with the error message that it could not detect the existence of the camera and therefore would not continue.&nbsp; I don't want to spend another
 10 hours trying to fix a problem that YOU GUYS CREATED with an update I didn't even want or need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The more time I've spent reviewing other customer's postings, the more of the exact same errors appear, including the Intel download stopping because the software can't detect the hardware anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Gil and Eric and Andre can't help me, I want an answer PRONTO from a higher level manager.</p>

<p>Twice already (with at least 2 days between the attempts) I downloaded the most recent Intel RealSense 3D Camera Front (F200) driver and left it on my local drive.&nbsp; The first time I opened the camera and then downloaded it because otherwise it aborts the
 installation claiming it can't detect a camera.&nbsp; Device manager ignored the update and listed the original driver date of 2006 in the details section, despite my purchasing the new laptop in 2016 directly from Dell.&nbsp; The second time I went inside device manager
 and told it to locate the most recent driver from the internet and it installed (again I had opened the camera in advance, because all along device manager states that the camera is working properly.&nbsp; Once again, device manager ignored the updated driver,
 still listing the old driver from 2006 (the newest is from 2015) and Hello does not work because the camera does not turn on when it boots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You guys need to find a fix.&nbsp; I just want to go back to the originally installed Windows 10 home edition which worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you give me safe instructions to do that?</p>

    <title>Game Controller in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bryanrussell2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Game Controller in Windows 10</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
I have a Piranha Fire PC controller for Windows 10. It is supposed to work once it is plugged in but I cannot get the PC to assign a driver for it. I tried to update drivers and also download the ones that Piranha suggested from the Microsoft Store but still
 cannot use to play games. I had the controller changed in store thinking it may be a fault in the controller but the replacement does the same. All USB ports work fine for other devices but none for this one.<br />
Any help would be greatly appreciated. Attached is what I get from Device Manager, recognised device but not running.<br />

<p>
<span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>A Reader can view shared files, but not add, alter, or delete them.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
<span><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>After you receive confirmation that your folder is shared, you should send a link to your shared files to the people you are sharing them with, so they know the files are

<p>
<span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click

<p>
<span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<span><strong>copy</strong></span> to automatically copy the link displayed on this screen to the
<span>Windows</span> Clipboard. Then open a new e‑mail message and paste the link into the message.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Manually copy and paste the link displayed on this screen into an e‑mail message. Right-click the link and click
<span><strong>Copy Link</strong></span>. Then open a new e‑mail message and paste the link into the message. You might want to do this if you don't use
<span>Windows</span> Mail as your e‑mail program.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If you don't want to send an e‑mail message to the person you are sharing files with, click
<span><strong>Done</strong></span>. They won't be able to find the shared files, however, until you give them the network location of the files.</span></span></p>

            all the setting you spoke of are good,&nbsp; what would cause other computers in the workgroup to be able access the shared files on this laptop (the one with the problem) but this laptop cannot access theirs?&nbsp; the other computers in the workgroup can all get
 along nicely and see each others files.&nbsp; Ive hav no problems the past 2 to three years with this workgroup.&nbsp; also when I open go to Start, Network, and click on this laptops name I get the same error message. also i am no longer able to map a network drive
 when I select the computer name i want to access to view the shared drives i get the same error message,&nbsp; I also cannot even select this computer when I try to map a network drive.

<h2>            Free Games With Gold - NOT FREE</h2>
                    
<p>I just spent way too much time trying to get a Free game, and still didn't get it for free. What is going on with MS? Customer Service has gotten to be at an all time low. If you go into a store and grab an item for, say $12.99, and at the register they
 try to charge $15.99 and you brought it to their attention, what price would you expect to pay? Any person, including the employee's of the store would charge you the price marked on the item. With that being said, I understand that mistakes happen, I get
 it, but at the same time I wouldn't expect anyone to pay the higher price whether I was the store owner, or the customer. Why is it so hard for MS outsourced Customer Service people to get this simple business model?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The game in question is MAX: The Curse of Brotherhood. &nbsp;Clearly on the Games for Gold screen it is showing up as "Free", but when trying to download, it shows it costs $14.99. After contacting customer support, I'm still without a free download because it's
 not on the "free download list". I guess my eyes aren't what they used to be, because it sure looks like it's on the list on my TV.</p>

<p>Nomad2001, this was a problem and not an intentional offer.</p>
<p>The problem was highlighted on Eurogamer <a href="http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-12-16-max-the-curse-of-brotherhood-free-for-xbox-live-gold-subscribers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.eurogamer.net/.../2015-12-16-max-the-curse-of-brotherhood-free-for-xbox-live-gold-subscribers</a> , it was accidentally set to be free for a brief moment yesterday before being put back at its normal price.</p>
<p>Definitely not part of Games With Gold promotions.</p>

            I'm not sure there is a way to do this, but I also think that only the dGPU versions had fans. Hope this helps.

    <title>Windows 10 Upgrade Scam - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> acsh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade Scam</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After months of being inundated by Microsoft about upgrading to Windows 10 I did so only after I was told that if I wasn't satisfied with it I could revert back to 7. Well I was don't like anything about 10 and lost some programs that were installed
 and now told are no longer available. &nbsp;I can't revert back to 7 because according to Microsoft that is not available. Microsoft defrauded me into thinking that if I didn't like their new product I could go back to what I had. Now I find that if I want to transfer
 files I need to subscribe to an outside vendor,</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Easy Transfer program is not available on 10. I lost my Microsoft Office in the upgrade and told that the one I had is also not available but I can subscribe to the New And Improved Office. I happened to like the old version, especially since
 I had somethings on there that I can't get back. They were lost in the upgrade of the New And Improved Microsoft 10. If there were another company out there other than Microsoft to work with I'd go there. Being a monopoly has some advantages: You put out a
 service or product, and if it doesn't work for everyone, well, too bad. You'll just have live with it. That's the last time I'll take the word from their customer service centre. It's obviously a sale service rather than customer service.</p>

    <title>Out of Region Console&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sec 750  say:</h3>
<h2>            Out of Region Console&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, while filling out a service request to have my xbox repaired, I received this message during the process:&nbsp; "You have been identified as owning an Out of Region Console.&nbsp;This means that you are attempting a repair in a different region than the one
 in which your console was initially purchased. Microsoft will still honor your warranty if one exists. Select a service option below for a repair; please read the descriptions of your choices carefully and select the service option that best fits you needs."</p>

<p>What does this mean? This is a refurbished Xbox bought from Best But in the US (Pennsylvania).&nbsp; I had immediate problems with it so maybe I'll just add a region problem to the list?</p>

<p>Problem is I dont know what to select in the next step. It says:</p>

Select a service option:
<div>
<div>

<div><strong>Xbox 360 Console Service - Out of Region - In Warranty (SKU 188)</strong><br />
Your console will be repaired and returned to you without changing the Game Region. .</div>
</div>
<div>

<div><strong>Xbox 360 Console Service - Out of Region – Localize my Console (SKU 259)</strong><br />
You will receive a repaired console coded to the Game Region in which you requested the repair .</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It means the Xbox you purchased was probably from a different region than you, because it was refurbished by a company that probably bought it from another region. The first option means they'll repair it for you, but not change the local settings. The second
 option means they'll take your console, code it to the localized version so that it is compatible with more things, and change it from the localisation of the place the Xbox is originally from.

            I just installed Explorer 9 yesterday so I should have the latest version, and did not think I needed to do the updates mentioned. My Internet is connected through Brighthouse cable. &nbsp;I am using Google and Windows 7 Home. All Micrsoft software is up to
 date. I was using Explorer this morning for some searches. Then I left for about a half and hour, and when I came back it was gone, no message, it appears it just closed. Just for info, when I got back on it did not ask about re-loading previous session, which
 I had problems before with Exlporer 7 and it would ask that question. Also, with Explorer 7 occasionally I did have problems with it just hanging and "not repsonding". Appreciate any help you can give.

<p>I have an alienware area 51 pc. I upgraded to windows 10. When my computer goes into sleep mode it basically powers off and boots from start like it had been powered off by shutting down windows. This happens either when I do start - power - sleep or if
 it goes into sleep mode after the default time set by windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can wake the computer by pressing the keyboard or mouse but again it boots from scratch, unlike my work pc where it just wakes up and I enter my password and keep working. I have hit windows + x and clicked on the command prompt and typed in powercfg -restoredefaultschemes
 and hit enter and then exited and it was of no help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the power troubleshooter and it detected no problems. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like my home desktop to be like my work pc and not boot from the beginning like I had powered it off.</p>

<p>It could be a bad battery, or it could be a bad AC adapter/charger.&nbsp; Have both tested.</p>

<h2>            Skype says I&#39;m offline, won&#39;t send or receive messages, white screen</h2>
                    <p>Skype has been impossible the last three days!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently moved to a dorm building and when i sat up my router skype worked perfectly fine. My wi-fi is good, works on every device, skype even works on my phone, just not on my macbook anymore. I'm able to log in on skype, but then it shows a white window
 where everyone is offline, including myself. I found out that if I just turned my wi-fi connection off and then on it says I'm online and I'm able to send and receive messages, but only for about 2 minutes! Then I have to turn the wi-fi off and on again to
 keep it working multiple times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already tried reinstalling skype and deleting all caches to no use. Every time i try to quit skype I have to force-quit it because it's having problems quitting on it's own. Works wonderfully on my iphone though.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help?&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Rename Skype Folder:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press Command+Shift+G at the same time and the Go to the folder will show.</li><li>Type ~/Library/Application Support</li><li>Search for Skype and rename it to SkypeOld </li></ul>

<p>Unfortunately it's still not working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did all the steps you mentioned (though i have already done them before i reinstalled skype), no .xml files and all the folders where empty (maybe this is the problem?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before i moved into my dorm building i did a clean up on my macbook where i deleted a lot of old
<em>useless</em> files, maybe this can have done something? Anyways, skype worked perfectly fine after that clean up until about three days ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any more advice? :(&nbsp;</p>

<p>Same exact thing happening to me, and my husband. Did you ever solve this problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's very frustrating because we are both showing active on our apps, but when we try to call each other it says 'user is offline'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also we are not showing up on active users in contacts either, although in our profile we are shown as active.</p>

    <title>EDGE memory leak - W10 Version 1809 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            EDGE memory leak - W10 Version 1809</h2>
                    <p>I've been trying to use Edge for several years, and still cannot keep it running a full day.&nbsp; I've reverted to only using it now to stream music and video, but am going to take a 6 month vacation (again) from Edge to see if the MS team can get it right.&nbsp;
 (Although IE11 was never right, currently it runs better than Edge)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Screen shot when I noticed the PC is running dog slow (again)</p>
<p>Notice I only had one app open, streaming from a radio station..........&nbsp; <br />
<strong>almost 7gb of memory?&nbsp;&nbsp; Really?</strong><br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f7c65a1c-13e0-4037-aa2c-de288c9a2f74?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f7c65a1c-13e0-4037-aa2c-de288c9a2f74?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Closing the web page actually raised the memory usage.&nbsp; 5 minutes later, EDGE is still doing ?something?.&nbsp; Not done logging all my data to MS borg I guess.&nbsp; Memory utilization rose by another 5%</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3adecbfa-b85d-4106-8d80-43e68cfab23a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3adecbfa-b85d-4106-8d80-43e68cfab23a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to End Task three times to finally get it to close, then my Hard Drive utillization spiked, so maybe Defender thought a virus closed the windows and started scanning all my stuff at 4:45 PM on a Wednesday afternoon.&nbsp; WTH, I just want to get a few calls
 and emails out before the end of the day.&nbsp; Can I ever have Virus Scanning and Windows Updates on MY TIME?&nbsp; Not when it is convenient for Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3cd5f0e0-1e99-4141-83e7-b2afd0bec3fc?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3cd5f0e0-1e99-4141-83e7-b2afd0bec3fc?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And... How come there is no drop down selection here for BROWSER or EDGE... </p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f9c1b0ae-af1e-4507-b8dd-c680324e6ce1?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f9c1b0ae-af1e-4507-b8dd-c680324e6ce1?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Please just fix it and let me work and earn a living. </p>

            Hey Dude669,
<br />
<br />Since you have Windows 10 Pro, you're at least able to see if you can turn off the Group Policy associated with Real-time Protection, and if it works or not. Hit Windows key + R to go into Run and enter: gpedit.msc
<br />
<br />Navigate to the following: Computer Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Windows Components &gt; Windows Defender Antivirus &gt; Real-time Protection.
<br />
<br />There should be a policy named "Turn-off real-time protection", enable that, and restart your computer if you feel it's necessary.
<br />
<br />Let me know the results of this, good luck.

<p>Why do you want to turn it off?&nbsp; You need a functioning antivirus program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you install a third party antivirus program doing so should disable Windows Defender...</p>

<h2>            A related set of questions regarding problems with kb2949927, kb3033929, and kb3035131</h2>
                    <p>This is&nbsp;a related set of questions regarding problems with kb2949927, kb3033929, and kb3035131.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This post&nbsp;contains a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">long</span> description of&nbsp;the issue(s) I am having,&nbsp;because&nbsp;the situation&nbsp;is a little complicated, and I want to be as clear as I can.&nbsp; (Sorry in advance for the length!)</p>
<p>------</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently there was a problem with kb2949927 that was issued in october 2014.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>It&nbsp;was installed on my laptop as soon as it appeared in the Windows Updates for that month, and it still shows up as installed on my laptop now.
</p>
<p>However, Microsoft took&nbsp;this update&nbsp;out of Windows Updates on Oct 17, 2014<span>
</span>(according to: &nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2949927" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2949927</a>), but I was not aware of that.</p>
<p>Apparently, Microsoft rescinded kb2949927, and they&nbsp;may even have wanted&nbsp;customers to uninstall it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I did not uninstall it, though, because I didn't see&nbsp;that&nbsp;advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In March 2015,&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;published kb3033929, apparently&nbsp;to supersede kb2949927.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To complicate things, in March 2015, kb3033929 and kb3035131 were released at the same time and they happened to affect the same "binaries", and if 131 was installed after 929, it caused some customers problems, because&nbsp;the installation&nbsp;should have happened
 the other way around -- with 929 being installed before 131. </p>
<p>(SEE: <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/3033929.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/3033929.aspx</a>:<span>&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p>"This update (3033929) shares affected binaries with the 3035131 update being released simultaneously via
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=526462" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
MS15-025</a>. This overlap necessitates that one update supersede the other and, in this case, advisory update 3033929 supersedes update 3035131. Customers with automatic updating enabled should experience no unusual installation behavior; both updates should
 install automatically and both should appear in the list of installed updates. However, for customers who download and install updates manually, the order in which the updates are installed will determine the observed behavior as follows:
</p>
<p>Scenario 1 (preferred): Customer first installs update 3035131 and then installs advisory update 3033929.
<br />
Result: Both updates should install normally and both updates should appear in the list of installed updates.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>Scenario 2: Customer first installs advisory update 3033929 and then attempts to install update 3035131.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Result: The installer notifies the user that the 3035131 update is already installed on the system; and the 3035131 update is NOT added to the list of installed updates."]</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp;do not know what order&nbsp;I installed kb3033929 and kb3035131 in, but&nbsp;I am 98% sure on that date that&nbsp;I simply selected "all updates" and let Windows Update determine its own order of installation, because that is what&nbsp;I always have done with my computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless, kb3033929 caused me reboot problems (which happened to many others, as reported on Krebsonsecurity.com and elsewhere).<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;It</span>&nbsp;caused the update installation process to hang for 1 hour, and then when I turned the computer off manually
 and turned it back on,&nbsp;I got a BSOD.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;I</span> had to do a system restore, which forced me to reinstall my Norton Security and several other programs too (which was annoying and time-consuming).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my update history, it says that kb3033929 "failed".<span>&nbsp; (This</span> is the only update that shows as "failed" in my update history.)</p>
<p>kb3033929 it is not in my list of installed updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per discussions&nbsp;going on about this problem on various IT forums, I "hid" the update for kb3033929&nbsp;(at least until there is a replacement or a fix for it) because I don't want it to screw up my computer&nbsp;again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other update that affected the same "binaries" as kb3033929 did, kb3035131, is not showing up&nbsp;in my update history...
</p>
<p>but that update history was screwed up by the system restore&nbsp;that I described above, and most of&nbsp;my update history was mysteriously deleted, so I can't&nbsp;trust what it says now.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>kb3035131 is not in my list of installed updates.<span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p>I&nbsp;then tried to install it directly from the microsoft download site, and a window popped up that said that it was&nbsp;not needed on my computer (or something like that).</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a different internet&nbsp;forum (sorry, I did not&nbsp;save the link), someone wrote,
</p>
<p>"If you install 929 first only 929 will install.... KB3033929 supercedes KB3035131
<span>so 31 is not needed </span>and will not install"</p>
<span>so 31 is not needed </span>and will not install"</p>
<p><span>[Question from me:&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>A.&nbsp; Is that true?]</span> </p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Microsoft forum, someone wrote, </p>
<p>"KB3033929 is a re-issue of the previously Issued-<span>FUBAR-ed- Rescinded</span><span>&nbsp;</span>KB2949927.
</p>
<p>KB3033929 is also quite ... busy superseding several previous updates including (but not limited to):</p>
<p>KB3009736, KB3004394, KB3001554, KB2847077</p>
<p>this Super-Duper Update not only supersedes... a bunch of... previous updates,
</p>
<p>it supersedes its "twin" KB3035131 born the same day? </p>
<p>No wonder Windows Update Cleanup is "confused""</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally,&nbsp;PA Bear MS MVP&nbsp;wrote on the Microsoft forum on March 18, 2015</p>
<p>at:<span>&nbsp;</span><em>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_update/kb3023607-repeatedly-removed-by-deepclean-after/e2866511-7299-4574-ba6d-bdcb29919eb5?page=2
</em></p>
<p>"1] KB2785220 [Jan-13] was superseded (replaced) by KB3023562 [Feb-15] which, in turn, was superseded by KB3035131 [Mar-15].
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">If <strong>none </strong>of those Kernel updates is installed,
<strong>something's very wrong </strong>with your install of Windows</span>." </p>
<p><span>Question from me:&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>B.&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't seem to have any of those three updates on my list of installed updates!<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I</span>s this a bad thing?&nbsp; </span><span>How can I fix this?&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p><span>They do not come up as new updates when I refresh the current Windows Updates to-be-installed list.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>This thread also talks about&nbsp;some of these issues:<span>&nbsp; </span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_update/kb3033929-fails-to-install-and-cause-a-minor/4c56d5d5-a66c-4865-8ccb-d36f7c314c33?page=6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_update/kb3033929-fails-to-install-and-cause-a-minor/4c56d5d5-a66c-4865-8ccb-d36f7c314c33?page=6</a>&nbsp;
 (i have not quoted from it here)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This I found from Microsoft:</p>
<p>"If you manually install the security update that is described in advisory 3033929 and then manually install security update 3035131, you receive a message that states that update 3035131 is already installed. In this scenario, security update 3035131 is
 not added to the list of installed updates. <span>Update 3033929 includes the security updates that are provided by update 3035131. Therefore,
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">the system is not in an unprotected state in this scenario</span>, even though update 3035131 is not added to the list of installed updates.</span> Customers who plan to manually install both updates are advised to install
 the 3035131 update before they install the 3033929 update. If customers manually install the updates in this order, the list of installed updates will include both updates. "</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Other questions from me:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>C.&nbsp;&nbsp;Should I uninstall kb2949927, which was rescinded by Microsoft a few days after it was issued in October, but which is still showing up in my installed updates?<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>(Why did they not automatically fix it with a subsequent windows update for the people like me&nbsp;who had installed it in the few days&nbsp;when it&nbsp;was listed in windows updates before it was rescinded?)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>D.&nbsp; What do i do about kb3035131?<span>&nbsp; </span>it isn't anywhere on my various windows updates lists (hidden updates, installed updates, and update history) and&nbsp;I don't know if&nbsp;I need it.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>I would not worry so much about&nbsp;kb3035131&nbsp;if my kb3033929 had installed properly, but my system says that kb3033929 is a "failed" update, so presumably I don't have the protections afforded by either of those updates.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>E.&nbsp; Will they issue a revised version for kb3033929, or replace everything it was supposed to do with a newly-numbered update in the future?<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>Or do&nbsp;I need to try to install the original kb3033929 again, even though it hung upon installation and then gave me a BSOD?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>F.&nbsp; Do&nbsp;I even need kb3033929, since my computer apparently has kb2949927 from October still installed?&nbsp; Does it take care of the same issues that kb3033929 does?&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Unfortunately, it sounds like I should not&nbsp;let my computer go without it,&nbsp;since kb3033929 is said to contain new fixes that were in kb3035131 (also released in april 2015) which it immediately superseded, and it also seems to supersede
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">other past updates</span>, so it probably is necessary for my computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Note:&nbsp; Tonight I&nbsp;have checked my "view update history" and there are suddenly only 5 updates listed there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;prior time I checked "view update history", there were about 20 updates&nbsp;listed there, including the "failed" update of kb3033929 that I mentioned earlier&nbsp;in this post&nbsp;-- but now&nbsp;that one&nbsp;is&nbsp;NOT in the current list.</p>
<p>The time before that&nbsp;when I checked "view update history", all my updates for the last year or so were listed there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not sure why that list has further diminished, because I have not done another system restore, nor have I run disk cleanup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Background, in case any of this is pertinent:&nbsp;</p>
<p>My computer:&nbsp; Windows 7, Service Pack 1 -&nbsp;this is what the laptop came with (no upgrades&nbsp;have been&nbsp;done)</p>
<p>My anti-virus:&nbsp; Norton Security (2015)</p>
<p>My registry cleaner:&nbsp; I have CCleaner installed, but&nbsp;I do not run its specific registry cleaner part, and I run just a conservative subset of its main cleaning part</p>
<p>My anti-malware:&nbsp; free versions of Malwarebytes and SuperAntiSpyware installed - they have not found anything suspicious, so no changes have been made due to them</p>
<p>Prior problems with windows update:&nbsp; none, as far as I know</p>
<p>Have I run the windows update troubleshooter or the windows update fixit:&nbsp; no</p>
<p>Have I done the aggressive "administrator-level" disk cleanup of windows update files that are no&nbsp;longer needed?&nbsp; yes, once, a few weeks ago&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for your help.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hello, and thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; I do not know what the error message was when kb3033929 put my computer in&nbsp;an updating limbo for an hour and then caused a blue screen after I manually turned off and on the computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think there were one or two error messages that flashed up, but
 I did not take the time to record them on paper&nbsp;because I was so concerned that my computer had been permanently damaged.</p>
<p>Is there a list somewhere that the computer keeps of past error messages that it has encountered?&nbsp; I would be happy to look for you, if you tell me where to look.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; The date and time of the computer are correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; When you say to do a "clean boot" and install the update again, which of the&nbsp;updates that I am having a problem with should be installed first?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>------</p>
<p>I do not just have a question about one update that failed and messed up my computer (kb3033929).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>My overarching question&nbsp;is about&nbsp;3 updates which are interlinked.&nbsp; (I wish they were not all interlinked, but that is how Microsoft designed them.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given what I have read about how these 3 updates are interlinked, and about how many other people have&nbsp;had trouble with the update that failed for me (kb3033929), I am not sure that it is so simple as to try again to update that particular update, when&nbsp;kb3033929
 probably will simply fail again and will&nbsp;put my computer into a vulnerable state once again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps I can try to explain my situation a different way:</p>
<p>
</p><p>A.&nbsp; kb2949927 </p>
<p>- kb2949927 was issued in october 2014.</p>
<p>- I installed it when it appeared on Windows Updates.&nbsp;&nbsp;This update&nbsp;is still installed on my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Microsoft decided that this update was causing problems, and it took&nbsp;this update&nbsp;out of Windows Updates on Oct 17, 2014,&nbsp;rescinded it, and&nbsp;may even have&nbsp;wanted customers to manually uninstall&nbsp;this update.</p>
<p>- I did not uninstall it, because I&nbsp;never saw&nbsp;that&nbsp;advice from Microsoft (because they did not publish it widely).</p>
<p>- This problem with kb2949927, apparently, was not corrected by Microsoft automatically from within Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>B.&nbsp; &nbsp;kb3033929 and kb3035131 (inextricably linked)</p>
<p>
</p><p>- In March 2015,&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;published kb3033929, to supersede kb2949927 (mentioned above).</p>
<p>- Does installing kb3033929&nbsp;automatically delete kb2949927 from the computer, if kb2949927 is already installed?&nbsp; I have no idea.&nbsp; This information would be great to know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- kb3033929 and kb3035131 were released at the same time and they&nbsp;affect the same "binaries", so one needed to be installed before the other one.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>- I&nbsp;let Windows Updates decide how to install all of the updates for March, but its internal installation ordering must have been messed up, because it tried to install kb3033929 before kb3035131</p>
<p>
</p><p>- installing kb3033929 caused my computer to hang and then get a blue screen, and I had to do a lot of work to make my computer usable again</p>
<p>
</p><p>- after that,&nbsp;kb3035131&nbsp;was also unable to be installed</p>
<p>&nbsp;- I tried to install kb3035131 manually by downloading it from&nbsp;Microsoft,&nbsp;but&nbsp;my computer&nbsp;said that&nbsp;it is not needed</p>
<p>
</p><p>-&nbsp;Unfortunately, now my computer does not have kb3033929&nbsp;or kb3035131, so my computer is unprotected from whatever they are supposed to protect it from</p>
<p>
</p><p>- According to internet news articles and discussion forums, many people around the world have had problems with kb3033929 and kb3035131.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some people have tried multiple times to install kb3033929&nbsp;without success, so they&nbsp;put it in "hidden" updates until Microsoft can fix it.</p>
<p>Because of the common experience of having&nbsp;one's computer get stuck in a reboot loop and/or crash when trying to install kb3033929, I am afraid to crash my computer again&nbsp;by trying to install&nbsp;the un-repaired kb3033929 because I believe that it is not so
 simple as a standalone failed update, I believe that&nbsp;kb3033929 is linked to the other 2 updates I have mentioned here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also do not want to spend the time it takes to do a system restore and reinstall other&nbsp;necessary programs that are important for my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Since kb2949927 was meant to be replaced with kb3033929, I am wondering if I should uninstall kb2949927, since Microsoft rescinded it after only offering it on Windows Updates for 3 days in October, yet it is still on my computer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>- I am wondering if having kb2949927 on my computer was part of the reason that kb3033929 and kb3035131 failed to be installed correctly&nbsp;last month.</p>
<p>- I am wondering if I should continue to "hide" kb3033929 until Microsoft announces a fix for it.</p>
<p>- I am wondering exactly how my computer is vulnerable today, if it does not have&nbsp;kb3033929 on it, and if it refuses to install kb3035131 because it says that kb3035131 is not needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I have spent several more hours looking into this, and I thought I'd leave some more information here for any Microsoft customers who have run into the problems that I have described above, and have stumbled across this thread.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many articles about this, from all over the internet, and I referred to some in my original post.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another good article about it that I just found this evening is from Woody Leonhard at Infoworld.com:
</p>
<p>"The reissued patch that's supposed to bring SHA-2 code signing abilities to Win7/Server 2008 R2 is
<strong>causing havoc</strong>"</p>
<p>"...Now I see different reports from all over the Web, with a wide variety of problems with the patch."</p>
<p>"...The problems have not been acknowledged by Microsoft. There's no Known Issues listing. As best I can tell, the patch is still being offered on Windows 7 machines."
</p>
<p><a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/2895906/patch-management/new-kb-3033929-patch-install-fails-at-72-complete-with-errors-80004005-800b0100-80070002-80070005.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.infoworld.com/article/2895906/patch-management/new-kb-3033929-patch-install-fails-at-72-complete-with-errors-80004005-800b0100-80070002-80070005.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>There&nbsp;is an earlier&nbsp;thread about this problem on this forum that is 9 pages long:</p>
<p><span>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_update/kb3033929-fails-to-install-and-cause-a-minor/4c56d5d5-a66c-4865-8ccb-d36f7c314c33</span></p>
<p><span>and I found this post from that thread to be interesting, since it is similar to what I&nbsp;have described here:</span></p>
<p>"I believe I had the exact same problem on the same machine with the <strong>previous update KB2949927
</strong>mentioned in the KB3033929 advisory last October.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In October I found I had to reinstall Windows and all application software on that machine to finally install KB2949927.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It gives me no joy to learn from the KB3033929 Advisory that Microsoft has apparently not found the installation problem and chose to release a similar broken update a second time."</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is also a thread about this problem on a different Microsoft forum:</p>
<p><span>https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/a08ad884-6b05-4632-8f28-2568eb97b636/update-kb3033929-fails-with-error-code-80004005</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;These three observations from that thread are interesting to me:</span></p>
<p>"I speculate that the patch installation failures are limited to systems where the previously released version of the patch had been applied.<span>&nbsp;
</span><strong>Note that the October release was SO problematic that MS had to rescind the patch.</strong><span>&nbsp;
</span><strong>I suspect that the original patch created the folder with flawed permissions and was left behind in an altered state</strong>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>In such a case, the new version of the patch finds the existing (flawed) folder and therefore does not created it.<span>&nbsp;
</span>It also fails to insure that the folder permissions are in fact correctly set "</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">and</span></p>
<p>"This update is known for reboot loop. Do not install it until Microsoft correct it.
<strong>There is no reason for testing current version of update as there is a massive failure is variety of users</strong>."
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">and</span></p>
<p>"<span>"If you're not running a dual-boot setup and you're encountering problems installing KB3033929, then it may be due to a manufacturer-installed recovery partition, though this is only a theory
 of mine.<span>&nbsp; </span><strong>I'd suggest waiting for a newer version of the update, as it may do more harm than good if you try anything else</strong>."
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The reason that last quote is interesting to me is, on this problematic laptop that I bought in the fall of 2013, it does not have a dual-boot setup, but the manufacturer-installed recovery partition
 has caused problems before.&nbsp; I had to reset the&nbsp;laptop to factory settings twice in&nbsp;the first month that I owned it, in&nbsp;order to correct the&nbsp;problematic manufacturer-installed recovery partition, which&nbsp;arrived with too much "stuff" in it, which&nbsp;caused several
 error messages and&nbsp;strange behavior,&nbsp;and entirely prevented the system restore from operating.&nbsp;</span> [The laptop&nbsp;was supposedly mailed to me directly from the factory after I bought it from the manufacturer's website, yet the recovery partition setup it
 had when it arrived at my house was not the&nbsp;same setup it had after I used&nbsp;the&nbsp;recovery&nbsp;disks to take it back to "factory condition", which I thought was odd, but I am no I.T. whiz.]&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the various discussion forum threads and news articles about this, it&nbsp;seems to be clear that a lot of people who are much more knowledgable than I am about computers have tinkered massively in the bowels of their systems to try to make this update work,
 and even then, many of them have concluded that the best thing to do is to not attempt the update and to hide it in Windows Updates until there is a proper, full fix publicly available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still not&nbsp;sure if I should&nbsp;uninstall KB2949927 from October, since I don't think that I have seen any absolutely&nbsp;clear direction on this directly from Microsoft,</p>
<p>but I&nbsp;am&nbsp;leaning towards it,&nbsp;since Woody Leonhard&nbsp;wrote on&nbsp;Infoworld.com&nbsp;in October, "In my opinion, if you have the patch installed, it'd be worthwhile to pull it."&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 10 April 2018 Update - - Where Can I send my Invoice&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> djones_987  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 April 2018 Update - - Where Can I send my Invoice&#63;</h2>
                    <p>OK, after spending 10 hours on Thursday, 10 May 2018, and another 4.5 hours yesterday, 12 May 2018, I am unable to get Windows 10 to update successfully.&nbsp; A pop-up window assertst that it has failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has happened seven times.&nbsp; I have DONE EVERTHING that was suggested by the Link:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4089834/windows-10-troubleshoot-problems-updating</p>
<p>
</p><p>And...this is FROM MICROSOFT, which naturally tells us that Windows 10 is NOT able to be successfully installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a result, I missed payroll this past Friday and I am facing liquidated damages.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have also spent my personal time as Company Owner and my rate is $475 an hour before net bonuses paid to me from my own Board of Directors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, I am asking where I might send my invoice to Microsoft for my wasted hours which will allow me to partially off-set my lost income and damages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My invoice will be prepared as soon as I hear back as I want to correctly address this to the department head in charge of Updates.&nbsp;&nbsp; I am concerned that if I send this invoice to Microsoft Headquarters, it will be lost in the shuffle of incompetence that
 I am seeing in their flagship software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My invoice will be for 14.5 hours times $475 an hour or $6887.50, not including postage, handling and transportation and frustration penalties, the latter which could easily treble my personal damages. &nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am requesting the name and title of the person who will be responsible for this payment.&nbsp;&nbsp; Penalties will be assessed should the this request not be handled by the 30th of May. &nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p>I trust that Microsoft will step up and pay me back for the countless hours of frustration that I have encountered.&nbsp; Even the Help Modules, such as Windows Update assistant, are failing.<br />
</p>
<p>Thanks, </p>
<p><br />

<p>=============================================</p>
<p>Hello, I find your reply to be flawed in AT LEAST THREE different ways:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; &nbsp;YOU ASSUME that I am NOT an expert at Windows.&nbsp; WRONG.&nbsp; &nbsp;I AM SIX SIGMA CERTIFIED.&nbsp; &nbsp;I can access and correct registry issues, and know how to use Services.msc, etc.,&nbsp; etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;I MAKE A LIVING using Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp;You are suggesting that a simply WINDOWS UPDATE REQUIRES an expert.&nbsp; &nbsp;Wrong again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; &nbsp;You are suggesting that I cannot crawl under a car and perform a simply task, similar to a Windows Update and that might involve changing my oil or replacing spark plugs or adjusting a clutch slave cylinder or to go as far as a CAR SYNC on a Motorcycle,
 all of which I can do on my own without experts.&nbsp; &nbsp;AND, those takes do not require an expert.&nbsp; &nbsp;I can change my own Six-Speed Transmission Fluid in my Prevost Bus.&nbsp; &nbsp;IT IS TOO SIMPLE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A windows update, in contrast, is SUPPOSED to be seamless and we DID have that ability with Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is a disaster and the fact that there are UPDATE TROUBLESHOOTERS tells the entire story.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mean not offense by this reply, by the way, because simplicity is in the reduction of assumptions and I have now reduced your position to a past tense situation and I wish you the best in your pursuits.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This forum, however, is not a good place to make
 such observations.</p>
<p>Go out there and help someone else who needs an expert.&nbsp; I simply want my time back or money from Microsoft.&nbsp; If you know the name of the department head who is now in charge of updating efforts, then you will have answered a simple and straight-forward
 question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am an advanced user of a Networked series of PCs in my business, can NORMALLY handle updates but the process is broken and Mr Softie owes me some money.</p>

            If you ever get that address let me know.&nbsp; I too would like to send Microsoft a bill for wages lost due to forced updates breaking previously working software, computer slow down, etc.<br />

            I too need their address; and i agree that an update shouldnt put you out of business and is a simple task. &nbsp;A client was prompted with the update; elected to install it later AFTER WORK!!!! Came in the next day and it was stuck at the keyboard layout
 screen in an infinite loop. &nbsp;Spent two days reading useless articles, nothing worked; so now the hard drive is at a data recovery center to get his lost files for $1200. I am a tech; smh ; they build backdoors so the government can spy illegally, hackers exploit
 the same back door; then updates, updates, uodates, constant updates. &nbsp; WE NEED THESE COMPUTERS FOR BUISNESS!!!!! CLASS ACTION!!!! LETS GO!!!!!

<p>I absolutely agree of course.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have yet to get any of my Three PC's, all modern, full loaded, as well as my Father-in-Law's PC to update properly.&nbsp; In all five cases, I have entered Services.msc, scrolled down and disabled Windows update and disabled
 attempts&nbsp; as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, this forum has yet to take any of my complaints seriously - - this should tell us something (they are mired down with thousands of problems with updating).</p>
<p>
</p><p>NO ONE in the mainstream press is covering this, acting as if all is well.&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft has entered a stage of complete incompetence with updating.&nbsp;&nbsp; We need an updated Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also would like to add that you can set all of your connections to "metered" and look this up as this will repress auto-updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MICROSOFT:&nbsp; are you listening?&nbsp; IS ANYONE going to fix this and how will you handle this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>YOU NEED TO HOLD YOUR HAT IN YOUR HANDS and apologize for this mess!</p>

<p>Come on.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your point is flawed.&nbsp; NO ONE should have to re-load windows!&nbsp;&nbsp; THIS IS AN UPDATE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why can you not understand this?&nbsp;&nbsp; Of course, if I need a ENGINE OVERHAUL, I would not take on that task.&nbsp; UPDATING IS NOT AN OVERHAUL.</p>
<p>And, your assumption is flawed, because let's argue that I would have paid someone to re-load.&nbsp;&nbsp; What happens the next time and the next time after that?&nbsp; DO WE PAY A TECH EVERY TIME we need a simple update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are in the wrong place for such comments.&nbsp; You are not qualified to comment at all and I would ask that you move on to another forum.&nbsp;&nbsp; You are of no help at all.</p>

            I also have been plaged by forced win 10 updates on hundreds of customers machines and yes I am a computer expert with many of Microsoft's own certifications specalizing in Active Directory and Group Policy on your windows software.&nbsp; I have an MCTS and
 a MCP and many more technology certs outside of Microsoft that are for advanced networking.&nbsp; I keep having issues with file and printer sharing after each update.&nbsp; I have also seen updates completely lose installed software as if it was never installed.&nbsp; I
 would like the address to send my invoice to because today microsoft support could not fix my issue after remoting into my machines for over 5 hours then tried to blame it on my network.&nbsp; I have recorded all calls and live in a 1 party consent state so it's
 admissible in court which is where im going with this next if i dont get my time paid.&nbsp; So where do I send it?&nbsp; If I don't get a reply I will sue you in small claims court and you can spend the expenses to
