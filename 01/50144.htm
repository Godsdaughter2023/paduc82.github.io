            My cpuid hw monitor ans cpu-z icons disappear too. It seems when you install these programs, the icon files get corrupted and you have to delete this files. I tried to install them on a windows 8 computer and the problem is the same, so it is not windows
 10 issue, but cpuid issue. The other problems, thank god I did not have them and I wish they will not appear to me.

<p>You should not have to figure out a Fix for this. Seems Microsoft has once again released a buggy Windows and there is no support except being told to Reset or Refresh. This is not what we were promised. I have four down machines from 4 different manufactures
 Including Surface Pro 2. The ONLY thing that seems to work is the return to 8.1 which I suggest everyone do as Microsoft does not have a clue and is overwhelmed by their own mistakes.</p>

            DO NOT follow the instructions to reset permissions this way. Eventually you will not boot. Return to 8.1 while you can.

<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update your major drivers and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is preferred<br />
to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

==========================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<p>Thank you for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you cannot export the chat conversation beyond January 6, 2018, it's possible that it is stored in the previous Skype version and&nbsp;it's not possible to export the conversations from the 8.19 Skype. You can only export chat history that was captured and
 saved on the 8.19 Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can install the classic Skype and export the chat history from there. To install the classic Skype, follow the steps below:</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a little confused what you are saying. Are you saying that in January I downloaded a different version of Skype that no longer offers exporting?</p>
<p>
</p><p>With your method to fix this, will I get the entire history if I download this new version? Will I lose anything?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The Skype version 8.19&nbsp;utilizes clod storage hence, there is no option to export existing messages.</p>
<p>Messages sent and received after installing version 8.19 stay on the cloud for 30 days only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you wish to keep your message and saved on your local drive then you'll have to install the latest version of&nbsp;<strong>Classic Skype

<h2>            Windows 8 not user friendly</h2>
                    This windows 8 is not user friendly.&nbsp; When are you going to make an update that makes it work like Windows 7.&nbsp; This is causing a lot of frustration.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a family member with a new computer with Windows 8.&nbsp; She is basically computer illiterate.&nbsp;&nbsp; I
 am very good with computers and I can't even help her.&nbsp; I would have advised her not to buy the computer if I had known she was buying one with Windows 8 on it.&nbsp; This is rediculous.&nbsp;

The OP said that another family member was having difficulty, not himself. &nbsp;I can sympathise with the family member - I can negotiate around W8 but hate it! &nbsp;I don't have a tablet, just my laptop which doesn't have a touch screen therefore it's necessary to

The OP also said THEY couldn't be help. I have been using Win8 since the pre-release version and have found it to be intuitive; and is on an ultrabook with a normal mouse. I find you have use the Win key more, almost back to DOS days! You do get used to the
 mouse reaction at the edge of the screen. Don't give up, it's like getting used to the ribbon menus in MS Office.&nbsp;

            The problem for me, about win 8 is not getting used to it. After some time using windows 8, i find that the OP is just more unhandy for the reason that "start" fills the whole screen. Start is suddenly not this little handy window in the down-left corner,
 which makes it more difficult to multitask with the desktop. As you use start the whole time and have to switch screen all the time, this OP is not very user friendly. UNLESS you have a tablet.

            Windows 8 is frustrating. It is not at all user friendly. For example I was using Google Chrome, I clicked on the tools menu and out of curiosity clicked on "Relaunch Chrome in Windows 8 mode". I didn't like it being launched in "Windows 8 mode" and could
 not find a simple easy, "user friendly" way to open it back up on my desktop. I was able to click on Google Chrome in the Windows 8 app section and click reopen on desktop, but that did absolutely nothing. I had to uninstall Google Chrome, and then re-install
 it for it to work again on my desktop. This is just one of many non-user friendly problems with Windows 8.

            <p>To tell you the truth, Win8 is the most hatred OS I have ever come across. My friends bought laptop and realized that it came with Windows 8. Its not just seems easy to get along. The best OS to date for me would be Win7 is it is just user friendly in everyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will still stick with Win7 cos it is too much head ache trying to make my way around in Win8.</p>

            Definately win7 is best. I don't know why Win8 was created for. I will assume that Win8 was created to chase Windows users away. Its very hard, and I mean very hard and time consuming trying to find the normal icons, programs and tasks I am used to with
 Win7 or XP. Come on Microsoft, you can do better than that.

                    <p>This is the 2nd computer in 2 years that has been destroyed IMMEDIATELY after a Microsoft update.&nbsp; My hard drive is totally ruined and I've lost my $200 microsoft Office and all of the programs that were downloaded and everything that had not been backed
 up since the prior back up.&nbsp; There are comments all over the internet about computer's that have been destroyed.&nbsp; Why don't you destroy your own computers and leave ours alone until you know the update is safe?&nbsp; If any attorneys know a way to file a class
 action suit, there are thousands upon thousands of people who would participate.&nbsp; I'd say I've lost $2,000 with the multiple computer failures and program losses.</p>

            Windows 10 1709 has been experience serious issues with flawed cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Here is what you can do to manage Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Option 1:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Windows Update
<br />Select it then right click it
<br />Click Properties
<br />Under the General tab, choose Startup type to DIsabled
<br />Click Stop
<br />Click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.
<br />
<br />                           net stop wuauserv
<br />
<br />                           net stop cryptSvc
<br />
<br />                           net stop bits
<br />
<br />                           net stop msiserver 
<br />
<br />
<br />Option 3:
<br />
<br />Upgrade to Windows 10 Pro which can pause updates for up to 35 days or block them for a year.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation
<br />Click the link ‘Go to the store to upgrade or enter a product key’
<br />Click the $99 button to make your purchase (the price might vary by region or depending on the edition you are upgrading from or upgrading to).
<br />Follow the on screen instructions to make your purchase.
<br />Within 5 to 10 minutes, your system will be upgraded to Windows 10 Pro, your personal files, apps and settings preserved. 
<br />You won’t get a product key, you get a digital license, which is attached to your Microsoft Account used to make the purchase. 
<br />
<br />As for your apps, if you are signed into your Microsoft Account, you can reinstall previously installed apps:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Download-and-install-or-reinstall-Office-365-or-Office-2016-on-a-PC-or-Mac-4414eaaf-0478-48be-9c42-23adc4716658" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />Microsoft Store apps:
<br />
<br />Click the ellipsis in the top right corner of the screen (...)
<br />	Click My Library
<br />	Scroll through the list then click the app if its listed there, then click the download button.
<br />
<br />	If doesn't help, let us know and we can explore more options.

<p>So you're saying that Microsoft will allow us to block the updates for a year if we pay $99???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, it doesn't matter antyway I am without a desk top computer until I save up the money to buy a new one.&nbsp; The one with the update is totally fried.&nbsp; I have a tablet for basic internet but it's not the same as having the desk top.and none of us should
 have to buy new computers because Microsoft is pushing out updates that have been well publicized as corrupting computers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            You can purchase a new drive and reinstall Windows 10 and your apps.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 Digital License
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />BIOS/UEFI Setup Guide: Boot from a CD, DVD, USB Drive or SD Card
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setu...</a>
<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.
<br />
<br />Out of Box Experience
<br />
<br />The Out of Box Experience page is where you get to configure detailed settings in Windows, which includes creating a user account, configure privacy, sync PC settings and install modern applications.

 lost Office which I will have to pay for again, I've lost documents, it's trash.&nbsp; I guess $250 to get hard drive and $200 to get Office plus whatever else has to be fixecd.&nbsp; A new computer is $600

<p>Even IF the hard disk is trashed (physically), a new&nbsp;hard disk, depending on the size, is 50-100$, the replacement a matter of 10 mins.</p>
<p>Windows and MS Office will need a reinstall, but as you (as I assume) have bought legal&nbsp;licences, all you need is the serial key. You do not need to purchase a new Office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to your documents...yes, if you did not back them up (or use OneDrive or another cloud storage to store them), they are most likely lost.</p>

<p>The technician's time in trouble shooting and trying to salvage it, is part of the $250.&nbsp; If this doesn't solve the problem it could be more.&nbsp; Immediately after the update, the computer went to a white screen with a Dell error message and code.&nbsp; I had called
 Dell before I took it to the IT guy.&nbsp; Dell seemed to think there was a way to save everything so there seemed to be some hope.&nbsp; They wanted to charge $140 to do a diagnostic, but it was difficult to understand them and I'm techno illiterate so I opted to take
 it to someone who is respected and trusted in our community that spoke English well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There were also some other issues from previous updates -- flashing screen during the summer that I finally found help on line to resolve, AMD corrupted early January.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone answer this?&nbsp; May I assume the new hard drive and new windows install will eliminate the AMD corruption and other issues?&nbsp; I quit using Microsoft Edge about 2 months after I bought the computer because updates caused it to be slow and lock up.&nbsp;
 Chrome and Firefox don't lock up so I solved that problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft will let me reload Office from the key I have,I'll be less upset.&nbsp; It was an Office 2013 that cost close to $200 and my understanding is it was a 1 time load because the key says it is for 1 computer.&nbsp; Is the key tied to the hard drive or to
 another component of the computer?&nbsp; I assume it's tied to the hard drive and they won't let me reload because it will be a new hard drive.&nbsp; If they let me re-load, I'm only out the $250 if nothing further needs to be done.&nbsp; Hopefully not too much lost data
 because I was backing up fairly regularly after the flashing screen error during the summer.&nbsp; I thought my computer wax friec during the summer</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Office won't reload for free, I'm not going to buy it again.&nbsp; I'm not going to buy another computer.&nbsp; I'll term internet, term netflix and save my money if this new hard drive doesn't fix the issue.&nbsp; I'll go to the library like I used to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a very simple solution&nbsp;</p>

<p>Assuming you are speaking of an internal HDD\SSD or partition on the drive with C:\ ...</p>
<p>I stopped installing most software/games in the default location - Program Files (X86) -&nbsp; many years ago.</p>
<p>However, I do make exception for things that are closely tied to Windows such as my Browser, email client, and Anti-Virus software,</p>
<p>and as Dave mentioned, those few other programs that will only install in C:\ .</p>
<p>- A lot of software installs data folders in one of the three C:\Program folders by default as well, even when the main program is</p>
<p>installed on another Partition or HDD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Make a new folder on your D:\ drive for your program (a precaution in case the program does not make one automatically).
</p>
<p>You can make multiple folders if you have several programs of the same type&nbsp; eg- I have a folder titled Multi-media for all software</p>
<p>that is related to audio, video, Photo, and 3D modelling.</p>
<p>I also have my Steam client and games installed on another HDD as I found that some games don't like being installed outside the
</p>
<p>main SteamApps folder (two of the first three I tried doing this with, so I gave up on that trick - maybe just bad luck).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having said that, aside from games, most software doesn't use a lot of space, so you may still need to move some of your</p>
<p>personal data to D:\ anyway. Things like Video, music and hi-res photos can us a lot of drive space.</p>
<p>As with my Steam experience, I don't trust changing location of any of my User folders, so I just make a new folder on the other</p>
<p>drive and move my data there manually. I use a keyboard hot key or Start Menu shortcut for quick access to those 'custom' folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you haven't done so in a long time, or have recently done a Win10 version update run
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Disk Cleaup</span></em>, and after</p>
<p>it first opens select the <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Cleanup System Files</span></em> option. This has potential of freeing up several GB's space</p>
<p>(only do this if you are satisfied you won't need to roll back the update though).</p>

<h2>            My USB driver needs updating, but Windows Update doesn&#39;t list it</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the past couple of days, whenever I plugged in a USB device such as a USB flash drive, the USB drive to my wireless mouse, or the USB cable to my cellphone, it would not connect and Microsoft did not say whether it recognized it or not. It would not
 show up in the 'Computer' folder.</p>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I went to Device Manager, and I saw that Intel(R) 6 Series/C200 Series Chipset Family USB Enhanced Host Controller - 1C26 needed an update due to the yellow-triangle-with-an-exclamation-mark icon. I updated it and the troubleshooter said that there
 was an update available via Windows Update but Windows Update didn't show an update related to it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My Windows Update also stopped working, so I had to download standalone updates from the Microsoft Update Catalog and I managed to install most of them, but a few are either a cabinet file or they have multiple installation packages and I do not know which
 one to pick.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p>Is there a better way to update my USB driver?</p>

            I will still use this technique to fix Windows Update, but I figured out how to fix the USB driver, I uninstalled the USB driver and plugged in the USB device and the USB drivers started working again.

<p>Maybe they will make it into a YT vid? I was in one posted last year by oTheEnd or whatever his name is (xcalizorz). Thats his second account. He played Dom, ran around with a Striker and Specialist Package and had zero caps, then whined in his vid he had
 no help. I was top of the leaderboard and he was second and I had like 8 caps. YT and killwhor3s, whatever.</p>

<p>OUK is Onlyuseknife and he started the whole knifing only thing. He was doing it in COD4 with his YT channel going since back then. Check his montage its a trip. I was playing with Woody the other day and OUK was in the party. My son didnt know him, so while
 we was playing I pulled some of his vids up and little mitch was amazed, LOL. Hes one of the only few I sub to. I think I am only subbed to Jag, Woody, Torture, OUK, Necro, maybe one or so more. Mostly old schoolers AND great gamers.</p>

            A single settings change will likely not accomplish this.<br />
<br />
Your best bet is probably the freeware program "Bulk Rename Utility"&nbsp; which has a section dedicated to changing the case of filenames.<br />

<p><span>Hi B_Flatkat,</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 steps do you follow when you say “have to reboot via the Vista service pack 1 cd just to have my PC back”?</span></p>

 you in a bootable state as of now?</span></p>
<p><span>If you are in a bootable state then, I would suggest you to run a System File Check tool on the computer to make sure that the system files are not
 corrupt:</span></p>

<h2>            Bug in Surface Pro 2 SDXC card reader driver that can easily result in dataloss&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Has anyone else noticed that Surface Pro 2 SDXC card reader can occasionally "eject" card without any apparent reason? I've noticed that this is most likely to occure when you're resuming device from standby. I've also noticed that this can actually happen
 when device is writing to memory card. Out of curiosity I tried to make Virtualbox HDD and install OS to it and two times during writes I could see Windows notification of inserted memory card and what to do with it (one that appears in right upper corner).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried this with two different SDXC cards and this could happen with both of them, so I'm almost 100% sure that this is some kind of severe bug in Surface Pro 2's memory card driver. Also obviously tried to reinsert card couple of times as I thought
 that it might be contact issue in card reader itself. But it doesn't appear to be that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's quite nasty that my SP2 could very likely corrupt 64Gb of data in SDXC cards. Brand of both cards are Sandisk which I've tested and they've worked without any problems in other devices. Acer Iconia was one the devices I've used other of these cards
 for quite a long time and other was Samsung device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope other users are aware of this possibility. Personally I'm trying to avoid any data usage on SDXC cards, but this really hinders my opinion of Microsoft as hardware device manufacturer. Please fix this issue ASAP. These kind of firmware? issues are
 the worst of kind there can be for end users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you can understand my english.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pekka.</p>

            <p>Hi Deepak,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In answer to your questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Recent Changes to my computer were the Microsoft updates that became available this past week.</p>
<p>2. Yes, I am the adminstrator of this computer.</p>
<p>3. The problem seems to be ONLY the indexing troubleshooter.&nbsp; The other trouble shooters work fine.&nbsp; If you see my original post, the error message indicates that the Microsoft Search Diagnostic file is corrupt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding the methods you outlined in your email... I don't know how to use Method 1 since I don't know where I can obtain a clean copy of the search diagnostic file that is corrupt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 2 still resulted in the problem</p>
<p>Method 3: Diagnostic policy is automatic. Diagnostic Service Host and Diagnostic System Host are set at manual.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are&nbsp;there some other methods I can try?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 Type Cover Delay - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adamski63f  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Type Cover Delay</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The initial contact between my fingers and the touchpad is always delayed if the Surface has been idle for about 6 seconds or so. I've tried changing the sensitivity and changed the delay settings to 'no delay'. Nothing has worked. I still have this initial
 delay which occurs in apps and on the desktop. Also, when using the down or up keys to scroll, the initial button press is always delayed, its as if the keyboard needs to wake up before it starts responding accurately to my movements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us.&nbsp; I understand you are noticing a delay in response from the Type Cover on your Surface Pro 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please manually ensure that all updates are installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you correlate this delay with the dimming of the backlight of the Cover?&nbsp; You may be experiencing this from a power saving feature of the device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try using a USB keyboard to test this, if you have one available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know of your results.</p>

            <p>Dear John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I visited John Lewis today and their display Surface did the same thing so the keyboard obviously isn't defective.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>All updates are installed, the backlight remains lit however the initial delay is still evident even when the lights are on. I must stress that the delay of about 0.5 seconds only occurs during the initial contact with the touchpad and works perfectly thereafter.
 It's just slightly frustrating when is sometimes swipe quickly and lose track of the cursor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Food for thought, when I plug my USB mouse in and then use the&nbsp;touchpad there is no delay whatsoever. Any ideas on this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for getting back to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you had a great&nbsp;New Year.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Problems:</p>
<p>When i want to update my windows 10 via settings it shows me an error code: 0x80070057. To solve this problem I followed some online guideline where they suggest to make a change in service.msc file. While i try to start 'windows update' service it shows
 me "The parameter is incorrect". Windows Defender also cant ne turned on though I attempt several methods as I find..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now How I can fix The Update as well as Defender issues?</p>

            I've also fixed the issue by running sfc /scannow under an Administrator command prompt., which pretty much does the same as you say regarding shortcuts.&nbsp; A log file was 'corrupted', sfc fixed it and the update installed.<br />
<br />
Users are going to customise their interface straight away.&nbsp; Updates should be designed to accommodate this, without the 'failed to install update' message that some (novice) users may find alarming.<br />

<h2>            Constant Reboot Loop in Windows 7 Home Premium</h2>
                    A few weeks ago I upgraded my Compaq Presario laptop (which was running Windows Vista at the time) to Windows 7 Home Premium.&nbsp; The upgrade process went smoothly and all of my settings and programs were intact, right down to the background image on the
 desktop.&nbsp; Everything was fine for the next few weeks until one day when I tried to boot up my computer, it got stuck in a seemingly infinite boot loop.&nbsp; It would turn on, and I could hear the fan running, but the screen remained blank, and after a few seconds,
 it would turn off and start the process all over again.&nbsp; I tried pressing F8 during the boot process but the computer never responds.&nbsp; I got the idea of opening the CD tray once, and somehow it caused a break in the loop.&nbsp; The system seemed to go back to normal
 for a few days so I chalked it up to some temporary glitch.&nbsp; However, today, I tried to boot up my computer again, only to find that it was stuck in yet another seemingly endless boot loop, a

<p><span>Hi AdeFF,</span></p>
<p><span>You can perform
<strong>Startup Repair</strong> to resolve most startup issues.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Restart your computer tapping on the <strong>F8</strong> key until you reach the
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Advanced Boot Options</span></a><span> menu and select
<strong>Startup Repair</strong>.<span>&nbsp; </span>If that does not work, reboot the computer to the
<strong>Advanced Boot Options</strong> menu again and this time select <strong>
Disable automatic restart at system failure</strong>, restart the computer and report the full error message received.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Let us know if this helps. </span></p>

    <title>Minecraft &#36;5 discounted price not available - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Minecraft &#36;5 discounted price not available</h2>
                    
<p>Have seen a couple posts about it, but not seen any answers. I own minecraft on the 360 in digitial form, and have for about a year. Yesterday, and today, the Minecraft purchase price for me is listed at $19.99 instead of the discounted price -- both in
 the One store and at xbox.com. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I qualify under all conditions of the FAQ -- and earlier in the week I saw Minecraft at the $4.99 discounted price for 360 owners in the Xbox One Store. I was in the middle of a gigantic download so I did not get it at that time and did not want to chance
 a download issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there currently a problem with the Live service/Store or a probem with the price due to the new year? I'd really like to take advantage of the discount and understand it was supposed to be good for a year from release. I went back histoically and I've
 seen perioidic issues with the pricing in the forums.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have to say, the transtion to the Xbox One has been a lot more bumpy than I expected these last couple weeks. Still playing my 360 more often.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks so much for the update, Johaan! I'm very happy to see that you are at least resolved.</p>
<p>For everyone else, if you have played the game over 48-72 hours ago (as per <a href="http://www.microsoftstudiosblog.com/minecraft-xbox-one-edition-the-big-f-a-q/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">the FAQ</a> that Mister Quimby posted), please check your price on your Xbox One or here on xbox.com again. If it is still reflecting the full price, please post back the time you saw it, as well as the time zone you are in.</p>
<p>Again, we really appreciate your patience with us while we work on getting this resolved for you all! Thanks so much for the extra information we're looking for, too. :D</p>
