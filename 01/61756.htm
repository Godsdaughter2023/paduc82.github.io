<h2>            Star Trek tidbits</h2>
                    
<p>All I know is I keep getting more and more excited for this game, and I want it now.&nbsp; Light spoilers will follow.&nbsp; From a demo preview in Gameinformer issue 220:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Being developed by <a href="http://www.digitalextremes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Digital Extremes</a>, who is working with J.J. Abrams' production company Bad Robot and God of War writer Marianne Krawczyk.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-The beginning of the game starts off with Kirk and Spock returning&nbsp; from an away mission to find their ship in disarray.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-You can play the entire game with the AI, or in co-op.&nbsp; Depending on who you play as with the AI, changes the way the game is played.&nbsp; "Spock's scientific mind and formal demeanor make him a surgeon on the battlefield, while Kirk's cowboy approach to combat
 often gets the duo into as much trouble as it gets them out of (I'm guessing co-op will be more of the latter). &nbsp; While Kirk and Spock remain together for much of the game, their experiences and goals often differ."&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-During combat, players can and must use their tricorder's multiple functions.&nbsp; They can be used to deploy portable Federation shields, hack doors, or overload computer panels to take out enemies.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Spock can perform mind melds on enemies, which then makes the person start firing on his or her friends.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-Special sequences will occur that require players to work together:&nbsp; "Kirk takes a stray hit from one of the enemies and becomes infected by the same neurotoxin that has killed much of the Enterprise crew.&nbsp; Kirk collapses, and Spock runs over to help.&nbsp;
 Throwing one of Kirk's arms over his shoulder, Spock navigates both players towards sickbay, while Kirk uses his free hand to provide cover fire...&nbsp;&nbsp; ...Kirk leaps up from the bed and grabs a Federation rifle.&nbsp; He activates
<b>its secondary fire</b> and a tiny shield shimmers to life in front of the gun. Even though Kirk holds the rifle, Spock can make use of it.&nbsp; Spock fires into Kirk's shield, building up a charge of stored energy.&nbsp; Once enemies begin to flooding the sickbay,
 Kirk discharges all this energy, knocking out their pursuers."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-"Equipment upgrades are based on each character's skill.&nbsp; Weapons won't change much throughout the game, but each character will learn new tricks and get better at using them."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The one thing I'd really like to know is who will be voicing Kirk and Spock.&nbsp; It'd be cool if they were voiced by William Shatner and Leonard Nimoy, but then again their voices today might not match the young characters depicted in the game.&nbsp; Does anyone
 know the cast yet?&nbsp; Who would you prefer, the true actors or the actors from the recent movie?

<p>Dude... up top! *Raises hand*.&nbsp; Few games get me as excited as this one. &nbsp;So who would you prefer to be the voice actors? The old school pimps or the new actors from the recent movie? &nbsp;Not saying either of the two pairs are plausible due to budget constraints,
 but perhaps. &nbsp;I would prefer the original actors but I'm having trouble envisioning their voices for characters who are young. &nbsp;Seems like it might not work. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I would rather have a ship combat simulator.</p>
<p>[/quote]You know that would fun as well, but this concept just seems too cool pass up.&nbsp; Plus they kind of did that with Star Trek Legacy.&nbsp; I almost bought that a few weeks ago.&nbsp; Right before I bought it I checked the review on
<a href="http://www.metacritic.com/game/xbox-360/star-trek-legacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Metacritic</a> with my phone.&nbsp; The average critic's review was 6.4, and the average user's review was 5.6.&nbsp; So yeah, I passed lol.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My answer to you Covert is you already kind of played one Legacy.&nbsp; I would like to here your thoughts on the game.&nbsp; It's very cheap, but is it fun? &nbsp; Is there anyone else out there who played it?&nbsp; Thoughts?</p>

    <title>Windows Backup encountered an error when accessing the remote shared - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Backup encountered an error when accessing the remote shared folder.Error code&#58; 0x8078015B with Windows 7 backup</h2>
                    <p><strong><u>Original title: Problem with Windows 7 backup</u></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have Windows 7 (64-bit) running on my laptop and used to be able to backup to an external hard drive (a 320GB hard drive, the same size as the hard drive on my laptop, and there is plenty of space on it). Suddenly, the backup process no longer works. It
 runs fine until it gets to around three quarters of the way through the system image creation, then it stops, giving me the following error message:<br />
<br />
Check your backup<br />
Windows Backup encountered an error when accessing the remote shared folder.<br />
Details: The semaphore timeout period has expired.<br />
Error code: 0x8078015B<br />
<br />
I have no other computers networked to my laptop. <br />
<br />
I have tried to perform the backup several times and also tried it with a clean bootup. To no avail. Can anyone help?<br />

            Thanks again for your reply and help. <br />
<br />
Whilst looking through my photographs, I found one corrupted jpeg file which would not open. I deleted this file and wondered whether this could have been the source of the problem with the backup. Indeed, the backup worked after deleting this file.
<br />
<br />
So this issue is thankfully now resolved. <br />

    <title>Gray jpeg thumbnails in windows explorer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robert__s  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gray jpeg thumbnails in windows explorer</h2>
                    When I open a folder full of jpeg files in Windows Explorer, some of the thumbnails are fully or partially gray.&nbsp; Also some of the images in the folder previews are also gray.&nbsp; These files are stored on a network drive.<br />
<br />
There seem to be a lot of posts on the Internet about this problem but I haven't been able to solve it.&nbsp; I have unsuccessfully tried the following:<br />
<br />
Deleting thumbnails using Disk Cleanup<br />
Ticking "Always show icons, never thumbnails" in Folder Options then unticking it<br />
Uninstalling third party codecs (FastPictureViewer)<br />
Reinstalling video drivers (ATI)<br />
<br />
Can somebody please help?<br />

            I seemed to have fixed this problem by deleting thumbnails using Disk Cleanup - I'd already done this 2-3 times without success but the last time I did it seemed to fix the problem.<br />

                    I want to use Calculator, Sticky Notes, Snipping Tool, Voice Recorder, etc... but when I search for them, they are not there. I was told to go to Turn Windows Features on and off and to turn something on or off, but whatever they had said wasn't there.
 To get to them, I have to go to System32 and manually find them and click on them. Some of the Windows Accessories like Notepad and Windows Journal can be searched for and found, but others are missing.

            <p>Thank you for replying Jammer. I am sorry to know that issue still persists. Sorry for the delayed reply as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to run <strong>SFC scan</strong>.</p>
<p>System File Checker is a utility in Microsoft Windows that allows users to scan for and restore corruptions in Windows system files. Perform System File Check (SFC), and then check if this fixes the issue.<br />
Follow the steps:<br />
1. Press Windows Key + X.<br />
2. Click on Command prompt (Admin). <br />
3. In Command prompt, type ‘sfc /scannow’ without quotes and hit enter.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It may ask for windows installation DVD to fix and to enable SFC to make more than minor
<br />
repairs. Some files saved on your computer might get deleted when fixing corrupted files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also refer, use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files :

<h2>            Windows Automatic Update won&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>The Windows Update failed to work right after I installed Windows 7 64 bits. It worked nice on Win7 32 bits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Symptoms: </p>
<p>In the 'Windows Update' I press "Check for updates" button. </p>
<p>Windows says it checking for updates, the green progress bar moves but nothing happens. I left it like that for 8-9 hours. Nothing happens. All this time the CPU goes to 100% utilization and the coolers really start to spin. In the end I have to end the
 service: <br />
<em>net stop wuauserv</em><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran "ResetWUAgent v2.0.bat" script with Admin permissions. It won't fix it.</p>
<p>Also the "<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/gp/windows-update-issues/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Fix Microsoft Windows Update Issues.diagcab</a>" tool says:

<p>
</p><p>Before you start Windows Update, if your computer has not been up and running for a few days or more, start it and let it run without using it for some hours.&nbsp; Turn off the sleep functions if they are set.&nbsp; If yours is a laptop, make sure it is powered with
 the power cord.&nbsp; Start Task Manager (right-click on the task bar) and look at the CPU % in use at the bottom of that window.&nbsp; If it is more than 10%, you have to wait until what ever the computer is doing finishes before starting Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Functions like Antivirus update and &nbsp;scans, scheduled defragmentation, updates to Java, Flash Player, Adobe Reader and others must be completed BEFORE you start Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just did this on a laptop that had not been used for about 70 days.&nbsp; It took the best part of a day to finally settle down and be ready.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update is dramatically slower than it was in the Spring of 2015, before Windows 10 began its merciless march.&nbsp; There may be nothing wrong with your computer!&nbsp; The problem is a hopelessly inadequate Windows Update service.&nbsp; Likely it is overwhelmed
 sending millions of 5 gigabyte malware Win10 files to unwilling Win7 computers, using the same equipment and network that normally services you and I.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From Microsoft’s perspective, the updates you want are an extremely low priority.&nbsp; They do not want you updating Windows 7.&nbsp; They want you replacing it with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no reason to do this upgrade unless you are a real adventurer.&nbsp; Windows 7 will be supported through January 2020.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Excellent read&nbsp; http://www.infoworld.com/article/2953655/microsoft-windows/windows-10-review-hold-off-if-you-use-windows-7.html#tk.ifw-infsb</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen cases where the green bar continued overnight and finally found the updates, then spent many more hours downloading those updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yours is a notebook PC, turn off sleep and hibernate functions.&nbsp; Leave WU running at least overnight, maybe longer</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stop trying to fix your computer.&nbsp; You are likely to make a mess of it for no benefit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to fix your computer may be pointless, when the problem is your supplier.&nbsp; Sort of like taking a part your car’s engine because it does not start, when the problem is the gas tank is empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>One tip:&nbsp; Check to see if BITS is corrupted.&nbsp; If it is, solutions get a lot tougher</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Start, All Programs, Accessories, right-click on Command prompt choose Run as administrator.&nbsp; In the black box type net start bits.&nbsp; If BITS is corrupted, you will know by its response.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If BITS is ok, it is likely simply a matter of waiting a long time — by that mean a day or so.</p>

            <p>NICE article, but I don't think this is my case because:</p>
<p>1. I freshly installed Windows (actually I have observed the problem 15 minutes after I reinstalled windows)</p>
<p>2. The computer is not downloading anything from Internet (I guess I should see a massive download if Win Update would work correctly)</p>
<p>3. The diagnostic tools says that there is a problem with Windows Update</p>
<p>
</p><p>_________</p>
<p>
</p><p>Related to bits:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"C:\Windows\system32&gt;net start bits<br />
The Background Intelligent Transfer Service service is starting.<br />
The Background Intelligent Transfer Service service was started successfully"</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I have been going through this a lot lately.&nbsp; The most common feature I have found is BITS is either not&nbsp;started or corrupted.&nbsp; If is corrupted, all of my searching has not found a solution other than restore.</p>
<p>Check this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start, All Programs</li><li>Accessories</li><li>Right-click on Command prompt</li><li>Choose Run as administrator</li><li>Y</li><li>type net start bits</li></ol>
<p>If you get a response with an error message, BITS is corrupted.</p>
<p>If you get a response that says starting bits or it already is, you know it is not corrupted, but WU may not be set up properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the latter (not corrupted), I found the steps in this thread by Karthik Vengaloor, extremely useful</p>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-update/windows-update-problem-error-code-80080008/de8114b5-1487-4b31-9b28-f11974718df1?auth=1</p>
<p>
</p><p>This thread essentially lists a series of commands the I have found frequently fixes WU.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>net stop wuauserv</strong></li><li><strong><strong>net stop cryptSvc</strong> </strong></li><li><strong><strong>net stop bits</strong> </strong></li><li><strong><strong>net stop msiserver</strong> </strong></li><li><strong><strong>ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old</strong>
</strong></li><li><strong><strong>ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 catroot2.old</strong> </strong>
</li><li><strong><strong>net start wuauserv</strong> </strong></li><li><strong><strong>net start cryptSvc</strong> </strong></li><li><strong><strong>net start bits</strong> </strong></li><li><strong><strong>net start msiserver</strong> </strong></li><li><strong><strong>pause</strong></strong></li><li><strong>Exit</strong></li></ol>
<p>This worked perfectly in 5 of the 11 cases.&nbsp; In the other 6, I had no choice but to do a restore to a prior date.&nbsp; That worked in all cases.&nbsp; Hint, once you restore check that net start bits command again.&nbsp; If it works, then proceed to update, but check
 that net start bits thing frequently.&nbsp; If you can, you need to pin down what event causes it to be corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In one case, I downloaded Microsoft’s “System Readiness tool”&nbsp; <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-ca/download/details.aspx?id=20858" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>In your case you need the 32 bit version.&nbsp; This worked in this case.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=3132" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>I ran your script and something changed. I may even say that it might have worked. The script ran ok. No errors. Now I started the updates and... what do you know... the CPU is not overheating anymore and I see some downloads. Until now I see over 10MB downloaded.
 I REALLY hope this is it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will keep you posted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>---------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update:</p>
<p>Nope. The svchost.exe is eating again a full core (100%) and the download is much slower. Only 2MB in the last few minutes. It could be any other program, like the web browser, that is generating this Internet traffic.
</p>
<p>I will let it work for a while to see what happens.</p>

<p>Why do I need the 32 bit version? I have Win7 64 bits.</p>
<p>I consider this a typo :) and I will install "System Update Readiness Tool" 64 bits. I hope it will work.

            Conclusion: If you have a 4GB computer, there is no reason to upgrade from Win 32 to a broken Win64.<br />

<h2>            The vmcompute service depends on the following service&#58; wcifs. This service might not be installed.</h2>
                    <p>Hi, so far between the (new) BSOD's, the Office products stopping several times, the System Interrupts going crazy and having my default file extensions remapped without my approval, I'm not having a great Windows 10 experience (plus it's hard to get work
 done for customers).<br />
<br />
The subject line is the latest error message I'm trying to track down and, oddly (compared to all the other issues), I wasn't able to find many that appear to have this problem after searching. &nbsp;The only ones I found proposed a BCDEDIT command to make sure
 the hypervisor is started with Windows. &nbsp;This didn't fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have all the Windows Features under the Hyper-V tree installed but haven't had time to use it yet. &nbsp;The service wcifs is not listed in the Services list so it's probably not installed, however, what should have installed it and/or what do I need to do
 to get it installed? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>

<h2>            Frozen Blue Screen Of Death</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I randomly got the BSOD ( Blue Screen Of Death) while trying to restart my computer. I’ve tried clicking on every option on the Advanced options page, but when i click on one the whole page freezes (exept for my mouse). The only way to unfreeze it so
 far is to force my laptop to shut down, but it keeps bringing me back to the BSOD. I don’t know how to fix it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The stop code is: FLTMGR FILE SYSTEM</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Please help me with this issue and kindest regards to those who do.</p>

            A. To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem
<br />
<br />If you need help to generate Minidump - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />B. IF YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO GET INTO YOUR COMPUTER -  Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be to Go back to the previous Build, if it was an upgrade to 1809 - 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Go back to the previous Build
<br />
<br />E. I would recommend that you should consider a clean install of your existing Windows 10. You can use below guide by Greg Carmack, MVP for this purpose. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)
<br />

<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

<h2>            I can&#39;t see Live Tile notification &#40;Twitter notification&#41; on the People app Tile.</h2>
                    Hello all,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Since my first installation of Windows 8 on my computer, I can't see Live Tile notification (Twitter notification) on the People app Tile.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm sad to not found help here or somewhere but well...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Today I tried to add my Twitter account in my Windows 8 People app at work and then I pinned to start a Twitter contact and... I could see (for the pinned contact, the latest tweet on the Tile -&gt; Changing between pictures to last tweet and so on...)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I right click on the pinned contact I've the option to turn the live tile off.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But when I try to do the same at home, I don't have the option to turn the live tile off on a pinned twitter contact... ?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm sad, the same app doesn't work the same way on different computer, most of post here are not resolved, there is no way to send a log file for the application to dev., ...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It's like a&nbsp;treasure hunt!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If you're lucky you'll be happy but&nbsp;if luck is not on your side you'll cry alone.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Btw, I tried apps.diagcab, uninstall - reinstall, remove account, add account,... Trust me I think I tried them all.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thx.</div>

            <p>I've been working with Fabrice for some time now on this via Twitter. We've gone over the settings and attempted multiple resolutions. It's as if Win8 doesn't recognize the Twitter Contacts as Twitter Contacts but some other kind. Out-of-the-box with a Twitter
 Contact, I'm not able to replicate this issue. If I use a Hotmail contact though, I can replicate it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fabrice,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd like to try one more time, if you're willing. I'd like to basically do a reset and start things from a relative scratch. I believe we need to force Win8 to recognize these as Twitter Contacts on first sync when it's adding your Twitter contacts to the
 People App, if that makes sense.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd like you to try these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Unlink your Twitter Account from your Microsoft Account. You can do this from your Microsoft Account &gt; Options &gt; More Options &gt; Manage your accounts. Should be a link near the bottom to remove the account.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Perform a System Refresh to get back to a clean state, pre-sync. Settings Charm &gt; Change PC Settings &gt; General &gt; Refresh your PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Log in to Win8 with your Microsoft Account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Go back to your Microsoft Account and re-add your Twitter Account to it. It will take a few moments to sync.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. Go to your People App and find a Twitter Contact once it has synced and imported them. Pin it to Start, and test if it will allow you to turn off Live Tiles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this does not work, I'll likely have to put you in touch with Tech Support to see if there is something I have missed in my testing with you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Feel free to respond back to&nbsp;@WindowsSupport via Twitter for the quickest response.</p>

<h2>            Why do I receive a message to Install IQ Updater W3i, LLC</h2>
                    <p>I received a pop-up window that said: InstallIQ Updater W3i, LLC.&nbsp; When&nbsp;I tried to install it, I received this "Error Window," stating:</p>
<p>There is not enough space in folder:\\?\[AppDataFolder]W3i,LLC\Install Updater\install</p>
<p>Please free some space and press Retry or press cancel to Abort the installation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do any of you highly knowledgeable&nbsp;computer users know what this&nbsp;IQ Updater&nbsp;W3i, LLC is all about.&nbsp; I never asked&nbsp; for it, and why do I&nbsp;need to install it? And how do I find the AppDataFolder?&nbsp; I thank y'all in advance for any assistance you may offer.</p>

            Hey, sounds like you're off to a good start removing it. I'm familiar with the software. It's actually something installed when you click "Accept" for any application installed using "InstallIQ". It seems that W3i (the publisher) uses InstallIQ Updater
 to manage software installed by InstallIQ (their support team tells you this when you email). I looked on TRUSTe and they are TRUSTe certified. (<a href="http://www.truste.org/pvr.php?page=validate&amp;softwareProgramId=46&amp;sealid=112" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">See Link</a>) My guess is
 that reputationally, they have some issues, but from what I have read, they appear to be an OK company.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>As far as removing it, I was able to uninstall through the <b>Programs and Features</b>&nbsp;in my Vista. If that doesn't work, use the F8 trick that Walter mentioned to boot to safe mode and rip it out of the program files by manually deleting it.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Quick note: you can access your app data and program files from the start menu/run command. Just type
<b>%appdata%</b> or <b>%programfiles%</b>. That goes to where ever your computer considers each folder.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hey, hope that helps.&nbsp;</div>

    <title>Lenovo Yoga 2 11 Keyboard adding extra letters - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kxailia  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lenovo Yoga 2 11 Keyboard adding extra letters</h2>
                    <p>My windows 8 keyboard just recently started adding letters when i type and I can no longer make quotation marks either. &nbsp;For example, if I type 'start' (without backspacing afterwards), it end up as something along the lines of 'staaaaaaaart'. I have tried
 restarting my computer many times, but the problem is not going away. I also ran scans for malware, but no malware showed up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help! If nothing works I am thinking of resetting to factory settings-- would this make a difference at all?</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me ask you;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Are you using external or internal keyboard/keypad?</li><li>Is the issue confined to any application (WordPad, MS word, Excel etc.)?</li><li>Do you remember making any specific change in the computer prior to the issue?</li></ol>
<p>I appreciate the effort made towards trying to fix the issue. Mouse, touchpad, and keyboard problems can have a number of causes:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p>Cables that aren't connected properly</p>
</li><li>
<p>Incorrect device settings</p>
</li><li>
<p>Missing updates</p>
</li><li>
<p>Corrupted or incompatible drivers</p>
</li><li>
<p>Hardware problems</p>
</li><li>
<p>Typing extra letters</p>
</li></ul>
<p>Let's try the following steps and check the status. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong>If you are using external keyboard, I would suggest you to use the keyboard with any other computer to ensure the issue is not the keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong>Run Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I would suggest you to run “Hardware and Devices” troubleshooter to diagnose the exact issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
a. Press <strong>“Windows</strong> key + <strong>W</strong>”.<br />
b. Type <strong>“Troubleshooting”</strong> without quotes in the Search box and hit enter.<br />
c. Select “<strong>Hardware and Sound</strong>” from the Troubleshooter Window.<br />
d. Select “<strong>Hardware and Devices</strong>” under Devices option.<br />
e. Follow the On Screen instructions.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 3: If the issue still persists, I start the computer in safe mode and check. If the issue does not persist in safe mode, place the computer in clean boot state and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1: </span></strong><span>Start the computer in safe mode</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Safe mode is a troubleshooting option for Windows that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The words
</span><strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong><span> appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you're using.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>a.</span></strong><span> When you hit the power button in Windows 8.1 (through Charms Bar), hold down the
<strong><em>Shift</em></strong> key when clicking the <strong><em>Restart</em></strong> button.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>b.</span></strong><span> The next screen will present you with three options. Click
<strong><em>Troubleshoot</em></strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>c.</span></strong><span> Next, hit <strong><em>Advanced</em></strong> options followed by
<strong><em>Windows</em></strong> <strong><em>Startup</em></strong><em> <strong>Settings</strong></em> from the next screen.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>d.</span></strong><span> Your PC will now be rebooted to enable the advanced parameters, which include Safe Mode as well. Once it restarts, you’ll get nine options whereby the following commands apply:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>F4 for Safe Mode </span></li><li><span>F5 for Safe Mode with Networking </span></li><li><span>F6 for Safe Mode with Command Prompt </span></li></ul>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:&nbsp; </span></strong><span>Perform Clean boot to avoid any third party software conflict.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)"><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></strong></a><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: <em>Refer "<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

            <p>Hi Terry,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for asking this question in Microsoft Community. I will try and help you resolve the issue; however I will need to ask you a few questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Was the printer worked fine before the issue? Do you have any security program installed on the computer? Have you made any recent software or hardware changes
 on the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a link with a
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/program_install_and_uninstall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">FIXIT</a> which helps in resolving programs which does not get installed or uninstalled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may also try the steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check and make sure that Windows installer service is running on the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click Start, click Run then type services.msc and then press Enter to open Services.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Right-click the Windows Installer service, <span>&nbsp;</span>and then click Properties.
</p>
<p>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>If the Startup type box is set to Disabled, change it to Manual.
</p>
<p>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click OK to close the Properties window. 
</p>
<p>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Right-click the Windows Installer service, and then click Start. The service should start without errors.</p>
<p>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click the File menu, and then click Exit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms681383(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a> which has information about the error codes.

            I've had the automated email from Microsoft asking me whether this matter is resolved. I'm keeping it open as it is not possible that Xbox support cannot be contacted. If someone at Microsoft can get back to me on this matter that would be great thanks

<h2>            How to prevent folders from roaming with a profile in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Did the latest two windows update cause changes in folder redirection policy? The application that I was working on has its elements transferred to network instead of local when I send the application to investigate the bug. How do I revert the folder redirection
 policy back to normal?</p>

            Due to the scope of your issue which relates to Windows 10 enterprise deployment, you would be best served redirecting this question to the dedicated Windows 10 forums on Technet. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=win10itprogeneral" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Sorry for the inconvenience of having to suggest the re-route, but Technet has a lot of experts there that know the ins and outs of enterprise issues; especially domain configurations for clients. So, they will be better able to diagnose and determine whats causing this.
<br />
<br />Thanks for your corporation.

            <p>Hi Lawson,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Do you have any issues with the computer apart from the Event Viewer error logs?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The PKU2U protocol in Windows is implemented as an SSP. The SSP enables peer-to-peer authentication, particularly through the Windows media and file sharing feature called Homegroup, which permits sharing between computers that are not members of a domain.</p>
<p>Similary the rest of the errors displayed are related to homegroup.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to place the computer in clean boot state and check if you have any issues.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Once done troublehsooting, place the computer back to normal mode by following the stes mentioned in the section "How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting"
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you receive any errors please do let us know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have also sent you a private message asking for the Event Viewer logs. Please do respond and&nbsp; provide us the Event Viewer logs.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Through previous tests I have confirmed that the only time these errors occur is if&nbsp;the Home Group Listener and Provider Services are running - even if the computer has been removed from the Home Group.&nbsp; After boot-up I can start and stop the Listener, leaving
 the Provider running, and the errors are generated.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I placed the computer in a clean boot state and examined the event viewer.&nbsp; The errors occurred if the Listener and Provider services were running.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have sent the Event Log files.&nbsp; If I did not provide what you needed, please let me know.</p>
<p><br />

<p>Thank you for your feedback!</p>

            <p>Sorry to hear that it wasn't resolved. Personally&nbsp;am getting fed up with Microsoft's lack of support, seems to that Microsoft Support Engineers give a suggestion, ask for response but don't return to thread to follow up. Will come back here if I come up
 with anything.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong><u>My solution:</u></strong> I left HomeGroup through PC Settings Network and shut down the two HomeGroup&nbsp;services and&nbsp;Network Discovery also through PC Settings Network. This was primarily because HomeGroup was interfering with Power Options and
 preventing my desktop from automatically going to sleep. Of course no HomeGroup means no HomeGroup logs.&nbsp;

Good afternoon I have similar situation </p>
<p>I went through all suggestion and problem still there...but I would like to pursue and wish to provide more relevant details so by chance someone can find a solution...</p>
<p>These errors are reported when I start or re start my PC.</p>
<p>I do not have any other errors..</p>
<p>I have a Homegroup set-up with the following details</p>
<p>My Router is a Linksys EA6500(DualBand)</p>
<p>There is a PC running Windows 7 64bits Family Edition WiFi connected to the router with no problems</p>
<p>There is a Panasonic HD TV WiFi connected to the router with no problems</p>
<p>I have&nbsp;a PC running Windows 8.1 32 bits&nbsp;(recently upgraded from Windows 7)<strong>wired</strong> connected to the router&nbsp;and that's where is my problem</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>when I inquiry about the properties of the router(Device manager&lt;Network Infrastructure Devices&lt;host name&gt;)</p>
<p>I get a message that the hardware is not connected to the computer (code45)</p>
<p>I did reconnect ,problem is still there...</p>
<p>Interesting enough I can streamed my video clips from my PC(the one with problems)&nbsp;to the HD TV
</p>
<p>Any suggestion as how I can eliminate these errors </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Many thanks for reading my post</p>

            Same problem here over a real long period of time.&nbsp; Even get calls from somebody claiming to be Microsoft Help and Support, but I cannot believe that guy.&nbsp; Wants me to download a program to scan my system.&nbsp; I checked with Microsoft and Microsoft denies
 Help and support called me.&nbsp; Would be most unusual if Help and Support did call me.

<h2>            BSOD and Google Chrome</h2>
                    I've had this problem for days and I've yet to find a solution. I'm posting here in hopes of getting this solved.<br />
<br />
I originally used Google Chrome for everything, and I love GC but it ALWAYS gives me the BSOD when I click the icon to start it up. I will attach a zip folder containing the MINIDUMP folder with two files where my laptop has BS'd.<br />
<br />
I've uninstalled GC and reinstalled it, and it didn't help. I checked to make sure all my drivers were updated. I uninstalled all of google's extensions as well and it still blue screens. Please analyze my attachment so I can get back to work. Thank you!<br />
<br />
Below is a link to the MINIDUMP download.<br />

            I'm installed SP1 now. But when I tried installing the newest driver for RTL8187Sit said it was the newest driver available. Here's the details:<br />
<br />
Driver Date: 2/26/2009<br />
Driver Version: 6.1020.0226.2009 built by: WinDDK<br />
Digital Signer: Microsoft Windows<br />
C:\Windows\system32\DRIVERS\RTL8187Se.sys<br />
C:\Windows\system32\DRIVERS\vwifibus.sys<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what to do about updating the driver. Maybe I accidentally disabled a service that updates drivers? Is there such a service that could be stopping my drivers from updating?<br />

I am fairly sure there is a newer driver.&nbsp; Did you go to realtec and download it from there, or did you just check the built in?<br />
<br />
Even if that is the newest driver you still need to re-install it because drivers become corrupt.&nbsp; If that is the newest driver (it is before win 8 was released) you will need to install it in compatibility mode.<br />
<br />
<br />

            To update that driver I went to the list of drivers in computer management and right clicked it and clicked "Update Driver." EDIT: I just had to do a system restore after downloading the driver from this link: http://www.realtek.com.tw/downloads/downloadsView.aspx?Langid=1&amp;PNid=40&amp;PFid=40&amp;Level=5&amp;Conn=4&amp;DownTypeID=3&amp;GetDown=false&amp;Downloads=true#RTL8187SE<br />
<br />
It installed correctly, but it just turned off the adapter. I wasn't able to run it in compatibility mode either so I don't know how to update that anymore.<br />
<br />
So last night I let the laptop run the windows installation and this popped up...<br />
<br />
INSTALLATION WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL.<br />
Error: ERROR_SERVICE_DISABLED(0x80070422)<br />
<br />
The computer did say during start up that it was installing the SP1, but then it said "Failure Configuration Service Pack. Reverting Changes." Then it restarted several times and eventually went back to normal.

            At one point Chrome had to have worked on your PC because you said you used it for everything. On the date that you started getting BSODs' did your PC do any updating? Did you try doing a System Restore and rolling the PC back to a date before this started
 happening? Some Anti-Virus progs add plug-ins to your browser, have you looked into those yet? I know my Skype, and Flash plug-ins crash my Chrome set-up at least once a day.

            I downloaded Chrome, disabled all extensions and plugins and it still gave me a BSOD. I updated my wifi adapter. Now it seems that the only problem I'm having is installing a windows SP1 update.<br />
<br />
I still get " INSTALLATION WAS NOT SUCCESSFUL. Error: ERROR_SERVICE_DISABLED(0x80070422)"<br />
<br />
So if anyone can help with this that'd be great. I'm thinking about just installing windows to save myself some time or just buy a mac.<br />

            <p>By installing a 3rd party AV with it's own Firewall, Windows firewall is disabled, it appears HP Support Asst. is telling you that this is so. Is there a setting within HP Support Asst. to turn of alerts for the firewall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try this; Open 'Action Centre' from 'Control Panel' &gt; select 'Change Action Centre settings' &gt; untick ' Virus Protection' &amp; 'Network Firewall' - the Action Centre only monitors the Windows AV &amp; Firewall, it does not monitor 3rd party AV &amp; Firewall.</p>

<p>I ordered a 320gb hdd for my Xbox 360s and they accidentally sent me a PAL instead of NTSC. Does this matter, or will I have to return it and get the NTSC version?</p>

            <p>Hello, alright so basically. My account was randomly suspended yesterday for the reasoning of theft? I believe it was linked to my account being breached and multiple games were purchased. I notified Xbox support and they gave me a refund of the games within a week. But the games were still in my library. That was until a few days ago. But still, 1 of the games remained, Dark souls 3. So I was like hmm. I guess they’ll get that one soon enough. Nope, randomly banned.</p><p><br /></p>
<p>So, I go to enforcement and apply for review after taking the quiz which is literally meant to be difficult as hell. I state what I stated above and within 10 minutes I am denied a suspension lift for quite literally doing nothing. The reasoning of no suspension lift is due to, and I Quote the enforcement person,&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>
<p>“Thank you for your inquiry. This account received a temporary suspension after repeated attempts to gain refunds for Xbox content.

Circumventing these rules to obtain unauthorized refunds (called ‘chargebacks’) from a financial institution (such as a bank or credit card provider) is considered fraud and is a violation of the rules of Xbox Live.“&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>
<p>I WASNT THE ONE REQUESTING ANY REFUNDS. I only notified support of the issue with the account breach. Now I can’t play WW2 for weeks. For being a victim. I’m outraged by this.&nbsp;</p>

The previous version, called the Anniversary Update was launched in August of 2016. Users running previous versions of Windows 10 will be able to upgrade to the latest revision multiple ways. One of the most reliable and convenient ways is to use the ISO file. The ISO file provides the option of upgrading multiple systems especially for users with limited bandwidth.

Since then, many users have been reporting issues trying to upgrade to the latest version; even though they are running a version of Windows 10, 1507 or 1511. The next version of Windows 10 Creators Update version 1703 is another release users will need to prepare for before upgrading. The unfortunate reality is, even though you might be able to run a version of Windows 10, it does not guarantee you will be able to run the latest version or the version after that. If you have been making attempts to upgrade without success, you probably need to check the manufacturers website for your computer model to find out if its compatible with the Creators Update or Anniversary Update or not.">Check
