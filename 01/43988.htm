    <title>Windows does not allow changes in file or folder permissions - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jorene  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows does not allow changes in file or folder permissions</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to get control of a large number of picture files in a number of folders.&nbsp; I have tried to set permissions, but no matter what I do, the os will</p>
<p>not allow me to set the new permissions or get control of the folders.&nbsp; I can add myself to the list of owners, but then I get the message that even as the administrator I am not allowed control.&nbsp; Is there anyway to get these pictures back so I can see them?&nbsp;
 They are jpg files which were put on the computer from my camera sd card.&nbsp; Is there a way to temporarily turn off whatever it is that controls permissions?&nbsp; This is very frustrating.&nbsp; Most of the folders on this drive (an internal hard drive which is partitioned
 into a Data and Storage drive) can be viewed and used.&nbsp; It is only this one folder (and its many subfolders) that is having the problem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!<br />

            Hi JoRene
<br />
<br />It might due to Controlled Folder Access, try disabling it to see if it helps.
<br />
<br />Open Windows Defender Security Center
<br />Click Virus &amp; threat protection
<br />Click Virus &amp; threat protection settings
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Controlled folder access
<br />Toggle it off
<br />
<br />in later versions
<br />
<br />Open Windows Defender Security Center
<br />Click Virus &amp; threat protection
<br />Click Ransomware protection
<br />Toggle off Controlled folder access       
        </p>

<p>I appreciate your attempt to help me with this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not have Controlled folder access turned on.&nbsp; Since this happens only within this one folder. I doubt that could be the cause anyway.&nbsp; I still have no solution for this.&nbsp; There must be some way to gain control of a folder.&nbsp; This is a desktop that has
 never been under anyone's control but mine.&nbsp; Other folders on the same drive are accessible,&nbsp; It is difficult to figure out why these particular picture folders are no longer under my control or even under the control of the administrator.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would it help to delete all the accounts that are listed on the folders...,many of which say "unknown account" with a long list of numbers after them? I do have two operating systems installed on the computer (because I need a 32 bit OS to run a program
 that I must run and that is an older 16 bit program.)&nbsp; Both OS's are unable to access the folder and it's subfolders with the same result.&nbsp; I think it is a matter of the individual pictures not giving access, as I was able to get access to another file (a
 picasa.ini file) in one folder.&nbsp; Also two folders with files that are not pictures I took were accessible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, I tried individually adding permissions and after several openings and closings to add myself, the piicture would open (though the jpg files did not show up as thumbnails.&nbsp; This could take days as there are hundreds of pictures in the folders affected.&nbsp;
 Is there any way to do this globally?&nbsp; Inheritance is already enabled but when I try to run it, I immediately get the error that the individual file cannot be changed.&nbsp; I also tried to check the "replace child object permission" box with the same result.&nbsp;
 The process will not proceed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does this need to be so difficult?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help!</p>

            Hi JoRene
<br />
<br />Sorry those suggestions were not successful. 
<br />
<br />Could you confirm if this also happens in the default Administrator account?
<br />
<br />Open Start
<br />Type: cmd
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type:
<br />net user administrator /active:yes
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Close command prompt, restart, then try signing into the Administrator account.
<br />
<br />Check if you still cannot make the same changes.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may have tried this, but in addition to adding yourself as "Owner", you then also need to add yourself to the "Users" list with Full Permissions...</p>
<p>
</p><p>A person would think that this would be automatic after taking Ownership, but it is not...</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW... When taking Ownership of a folder, be sure to check the box to "Replace Owner On Subcontainers and Objects"...</p>

            I was able to log on to the new administrator account but it did not change anything. &nbsp;I was still not able to change the access to the folders and files. &nbsp;How do i turn this account off? &nbsp;Do I repeat with “no” instead of yes at the end of the command?

<p>Yes, i already had done that. &nbsp;This is a very unusual problem. &nbsp;I tried going to the subfolders and trying to change permissions at that level, &nbsp;Also didnt work except to allow me to open the folder, but not the files. &nbsp;However, it did work on one folder
 and i havent a clue why. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After adding myself as owner and then user with full control i sometimes saw lots of other user names appear, mostly with just letters snd numbers. &nbsp;Win10 won’t allow me to delete any of these users. I have full control as owner but when i try to apply,
 i come up with the error that each individual picture file will not aLlow access.</p>

            Yes, just report the same steps then change the yes to no. 
<br />
<br />The next step I would recommend trying is a repair upgrade if possible.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason it seems your "Owner" settings are not getting to the subfolders and files... The odd "Users" may be part of the problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried checking\unchecking the "Disable Inheritance" button, and the "Replace All Child Object Permissions" at the bottom ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had a similar problem in the past, but can&nbsp;not remember the reason or resolution...</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW... You should not be seeing anything about "Administrator" regarding the Owner... The "Owner" should be your actual account...</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my cast, my user name is "Owner" and the Computer Name is "Asrock"...</p>
<p>My User Name then becomes "Owner (ASROCK\Owner"..</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I take Ownership, the Owner is listed as "Owner (ASROCK\Owner)"...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also... If the picture folders are on the root of the C:\ drive, that can cause permission issues due to changes made with Windows 10...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are logging to your machine with a Microsoft Account, that can also be a problem... That is one of it's drawbacks...</p>

<p>I appreciate your input.&nbsp; The files are not in the root drive but in a different partition entirely from the OS.&nbsp; I also do sign in with a MS account.&nbsp; How else could I sign in?&nbsp; I have had this computer for quite a while and have upgraded windows numerous
 times.&nbsp; All of the folders and files that can't be opened initially say no owner is assigned when I first open the security tab.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the most part, I am having to actually set permissions on a file by file basis (with hundreds of picture files in the folders affected.)&nbsp; But there is the odd folder that somehow is able to set permissions for the child objects and all the pictures are
 visible and can be opened once I change ownership and give myself permissions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a number of "unknown accounts" listed under the names that have permission.&nbsp; But I also have included my account, which is also the owner.&nbsp; All have full control, but I still get the warning that it "failed to enumerate objects in the container",
 which is the warning that stops the process from applying the permissions to the files in all cases.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I doubt this would help, as the problem occurs on both the 32bit and 64 bit Windows 10 which can access this folder and the 32bit is a recent clean upgrade.&nbsp; None of the files or folders affected have ownership assigned when first opened.&nbsp; Could this cause
 the problem?&nbsp; I'm not sure how they lost their ownership, but every warning states that the process "failed to enumerate the objects in the container."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again for trying to help.&nbsp; If I could just delete all these folders, I would give up, as I have most of the pictures in another location as well, but they are taking up a lot of space.</p>

<p><span><span><strong>Hi rhcorky,</strong><br />
1. When&nbsp;you say the monitor&nbsp;doesn’t come up, do you see any error message on the screen or is it just blank?<br />
2. What happens if you boot up and tap the F8 key and try safe mode? <br />

3. Since when are you facing this issue?<br />
4. Is it a laptop or a desktop?<br />
Make sure all the cables are connected correctly to the computer and then try the below steps:<br />
</span><span><span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Step 1:<br />
</strong>Login to Low Resolution mode and check if the monitor comes up.</span></span><strong><br />
</strong><span>a. Detach all unnecessary peripheral devices from your computer, such as printers, scanners and removable storage devices.<br />
b. Restart the computer.<br />
c. Keep pressing the F8 key until the Windows Startup menu appears.<br />
d. Choose Enable Low-resolution video (640*480) option, and press Enter.<br />
Starts Windows using your current video driver and using low resolution and refresh rate settings. You can use this mode to reset your display settings.<br />

<p><span><span><strong>Step 2:</strong><br />
If it is a desktop, you can try another monitor. This will tell you if the monitor is bad or if the computer has a problem.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 3:<br />
</strong>If the issue still persists, remove all RAM and try booting with one stick a time.<br />
A lot of the time this is caused by a bad memory module. <br />

            Let's first rule out whether the keyboard hardware is an issue or not. Can you use Keyboard tester and press keys to see if the keys are working correctly or not? If keys work as intended, then problem is not the hardware of Keyboard.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://keyboardtester.co/keyboard-tester.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://keyboardtester.co/keyboard-tester.html</a>
<br />
<br />If no hardware issue - Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Run Keyboard Troubleshooter
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down and click Keyboard &gt; Run the troubleshooter &gt; Follow onscreen directions
<br />
<br />2. Uninstall &amp; reinstall Keyboard Driver
<br />Windows Key+X (Or right click on Start) &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; Expand Keyboards &gt; Right click on Standard PS/2 Keyboard &gt; Uninstall &gt; Reboot the computer to reinstall

<p><span>You should boot to WinPE and set the system time there.&nbsp; Basically what’s happened is that the battery got completely drained at some point, and the system clock reset.&nbsp; SCCM checks the system time
 when it tries the deployment, which causes it to fail because the time doesn’t look right.</span></p>

<h2>            Xbox controller disconnects randomly</h2>
                    My new xbox one controller from design labs came in. I started using it yesterday. It randomly disconnects without turning off. I have reset my xbox, changed batteries, moved closer, reconneced my controller. Nothing works! I have other controllers that
 work fine, but I bought this one for the looks and the grips. I dont want to connect my controller to the xbox via cord because I bought it for the wireless functionality.

<h2>            Windows 7 and Genius SlimStar i220 media keys</h2>
                    
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I have a problem with the keyboard that I've mentioned in the title.<br />
Especially: I've bought this keyboard, but I haven't got any driver CDs, so I checked out the Genius webpage, but there's no drivers for this product either. I've also searched the Control Center but I haven't found anything related to this problem.<br />
The keyboard works fine, except that I cannot use those few media keys: mute, play, pause etc.<br />
Is there any way to get this working on Windows 7?</p>
<p>P.s.: Sorry for my english, hope You can understand me :)</p>

<p><span>Hi Jester_Racer,</span></p>
<p><span>This keyboard is a Plug-and Play device. Hence you cannot find any driver for it.</span></p>
<p><span>Try using those keys with the applications like Media Player or Itunes and check if it works. If it does not work,&nbsp;as</span><span>the
 functioning of few keys is concerned, it would be better if you contact the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.geniusnet.com/wSite/lp?ctNode=86&amp;CtUnit=90&amp;BaseDSD=7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>manufacturer</span></a> for assistance, as the issue is specific to the device.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

                    <p>Hello all:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was having issues activating Windows 10 after doing a motherboard replacement.&nbsp; I followed a chat link I found on Google (linked below), and the guy remoted into my computer, asked to see proof of purchase of the motherboard, then asked for a few account
 details (name, email address, no password).&nbsp; Then after about a 10min. wait he pasted in a number in the activation window and it was added to my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I watched my screen like a hawk the whole time and he never installed anything else or deviated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now thinking that this may have been a scam and that I should have been trying to resolve this so late at night.&nbsp; So, is the link below legit?&nbsp; Thanks all!</p>

            Hi Noah.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Yes, that's legit Microsoft chat support.
<br />
<br />What does it say now for Activation Status and Edition at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation?  
<br />

<h2>            How to install Windows 32-bit version in my surface pro&#63;</h2>
                    I have a surface. But it pre-installed windows 8 Pro 64-bit. I don't want to use 64-bit software, so I wanna install a new 32-bit Windows 8 on my surface Pro. But when I boot from my installing media, I find that surface can't get in to installing screen...
 I feel bad about it, who can tell me how to install Windows 8 32-bit in my surface?

            <p>I said this once but I'll say it again: you can install x86/32 bit software on a 64 bit version of Windows. Just download and install the 32 bit version of Office. Your key will work for both versions...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also 64 bit Office works with tons of other applications just fine. The better option is to contact those software vendors to see if they have an update to provide Office 64 bit support. I suggest you do that if Office is the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You will not solve this issue by installing 32 bit Windows. If you want a quick solution, install 32 bit Office.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your statement regarding memory/RAM for the Surface Pro is a little absurd as well. 4GB is not "too short." You're going way off topic here. 4GB is perfectly capable of running Windows 64 bit. Heck, you can only use 3GB max with a 32 bit OS.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft does not consider this a problem because it is a fact that 32 bit OSes are on the way out. Anyone still using 32 bit is doing so because of a third party vendor requiring it for some ridiculous reason or that vendor's unwillingness to provide updates
 for 64 bit support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For your initial question, it seems you are actually wanting to use x86/32 bit Office. This is the solution: install the 32 bit Office and your "other applications" will work fine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please mark as answered.</p>

            <p>Sorry, but I think you're SOL.&nbsp; My understanding of it is that UEFI has to have the same architecture as the OS you're trying to run.&nbsp; The Surface Pro UEFI is 64-bit, and so you can only run a 64-bit OS on there. &nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Surface also does not have the "Legacy Boot" option to emulate a BIOS like many other PCs have.</p>

<h2>            Surface 3 &#40;T-H-R-E-E&#41; battery drains with cover closed</h2>
                    <p>So, this morning I picked up my Surface <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>3</strong></span> off the dock, where it sat all night charging, and put it in my bag as I was leaving for work. I pull it out this afternoon when I needed to use it and find it's warm and the battery is flat. It sat all day, cooking in my bag, and
 when I needed it; it was dead. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not a Book. It's not a Pro. It's a Surface 3. I've written about this before and get nothing.
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">When will this be fixed</span></strong>. It should have been off with the keyboard closed, but it obviously wasn't. I'm so aggravated, I regret buying it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ARE YOU LISTENING, MICROSOFT?!?!?!</p>

            <p>Hi there, I'm not a Microsoft employee but I will try to have a go at diagnosing this. FYI, I have a Surface 3 as well and it will routinely last 48-72 hours on standby with reasonable battery consumption (~10%/day) so there isn't a reason why yours shouldn't
 do the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1: Right-click start, select Command Prompt (Admin) and type the following commands:</p>
<p>cd \Users\&lt;your user&gt;\Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>powercfg /batteryreport</p>
<p>powercfg /sleepstudy</p>
<p>powercfg /energy</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last command will take 60 seconds to complete. Once done you should see something like the screenshot below:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/596cdf5e-ee01-43b2-ae8f-7649c43af1c6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/596cdf5e-ee01-43b2-ae8f-7649c43af1c6" /></a></p>
<p>Once that's done you should have 3 files on your desktop:</p>
<p>- battery-report.html</p>
<p>- sleepstudy-report.html</p>
<p>- energy-report.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the sleepstudy-report.html file first and look for a table that lists all your sleep sessions. Look for the one from when you unplugged your device and put it in the bag. If you click that session it should take you to the details of what was going
 on during that sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be a bit daunting to make sense of those files at first but if you manage to upload them somewhere (like a public OneDrive folder) and link them here we can have a look and come up with more constructive feedback on what is going on.</p>

            <p>Fair enough but if you're up for it we can try to understand why. As I mentioned above, the behaviour on your device is not the norm as my Surface 3 with Windows 10 1511 behaves as you'd expect in sleep mode so more detail about your PCs sleep activities,
 battery condition and power settings would help diagnose the issue.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is really weird. There is no data for 03/09 in the Sleep Study Report when the battery failed. There is data for 03/07, 03/08 and 03/10 but 03/09 is blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Battery Report only shows the time I docked my Surface 3 after the battery had died.
</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>That is indeed weird. Looking at the various reports it looks like your device never went to sleep on the 9th. From the battery report:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/95e87792-00bf-4e5f-a698-c7000079600f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/95e87792-00bf-4e5f-a698-c7000079600f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>What you want to see there is Connected Standby but instead it was Suspended which to me looks like the OS was trying to enter sleep mode but something prevented it. Perhaps some application you were running?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is also interesting to note from the sleep study this session the day before:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55d1340f-20aa-4a6f-b84b-c05414c70942" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55d1340f-20aa-4a6f-b84b-c05414c70942" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>In that session your device was asleep for nearly 14 hours with a battery drain of 3% which is well within what I'd expect it to consume so obv. there was something different between the two sessions.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c221d48e-bdfe-4e2b-abd2-745c93236540" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c221d48e-bdfe-4e2b-abd2-745c93236540" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see above, in that sleep session it was awake only for a few seconds until you turned the device on later in that night.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you think of any applications you left open or what you were doing with the device that was different between the two sessions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing that is always going to be different between a mobile device running a desktop OS vs. a mobile OS is that the desktop OS cannot just pause applications indiscriminately and very few Windows programs are written with support for being suspended
 or working in standby states. Mobile OSes can because developers that write applications for them just have to accept that their apps can be suspended by the OS at any time with very little warning. That's one of the reasons why standby is more predictable
 on mobile OSes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obv. that doesn't help you but I thought I'd mention. What sort of applications do you run on your Surface 3?</p>

            <p>Sorry this is so long. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the apps I run are from Microsoft or from the store. The only rogue desktop app I use frequently is Corel Draw. I'm usually careful to close all the windows before I put it on the dock for the night.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I take it off the dock, I usually take a peek before I drop it in my sleeve and make sure it is off. &nbsp;I open it just enough to peek (less than 1cm) and press the power button if it's on.&nbsp;The keyboard is closed while it is on the dock. It often turns
 on when I remove it from the dock. There have been several times when I see the lock screen after I've taken it of the dock. The 9th was a busy morning and I just grabbed it and ran.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I suppose between the two I could have left something running and missed checking for it to actually be off before I left.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, again, for your help.</p>

            <p>First of all no worries, I'll be glad if I can be of any help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, couple of questions:</p>
<p>Can you give me one or two screenshots of Settings -&gt; System -&gt; Power &amp; Sleep that shows both the sleep settings and the Wi-Fi settings in that page? Also on that page click Additional power settings and in the screen that will open, make sure that the Balanced
 power plan is selected, click on Change Plan Settings and give me a screenshot of that? Finally, on the same screen, you may want to try to click Restore default settings for this plan to ensure that you are on the default settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason for that is because you mentioned that when you unplug the device it often has the screen on and you press the power button to send it to sleep and on the 9th you didn't as you were in a rush so I'm wondering if for some reason it is not going
 to sleep automatically when you unplug and by pressing the button you're forcing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I'm sure you have done this already but can you right-click Start -&gt; Device Manager and verify that you don't see yellow warning triangles over any icon on your devices? If there are, the nodes where the devices appear will be expanded to show that
 device so if all nodes are collapsed it means there are no warnings. Finally, are there any firmware or driver updates pending on Windows Update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a last resort, you may want to download the latest Surface Platform installer update from here
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-gb/support/performance-and-maintenance/install-software-updates-for-surface?os=windows-10#surfacepro3W10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-gb/support/performance-and-maintenance/install-software-updates-for-surface?os=windows-10#surfacepro3W10</a>&nbsp;and reinstall it to make sure that all drivers are up to date and settings are back to defaults.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: the link above points to driver packs for the Surface Pro 3 as well as all variants of the Surface 3 so make sure you pick the correct one in case you have LTE and/or linked to a particular operator.</p>

            <p>Your settings are all fine. Re. the option to reset the plan settings to default, you should see&nbsp;it when you click 'Change plan settings' next to Balanced as per the screenshot below:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b63a7573-cf30-48c1-87ed-2a993c3a1fde" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b63a7573-cf30-48c1-87ed-2a993c3a1fde" /></a></p>
<p>Finally, no, the Surface platform installer will only install drivers, firmware and some settings. In case you did a clean install of Windows, for example, that's the package you'd run to get all the hardware setup and the power plan created.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you wanted to do a clean install of Windows you'd have two options:</p>
<p>- Use a Windows 10 media to install it from scratch. You can generate one to a USB drive by using the tool from here (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10</a>)
 and after installing it, using the package above to install the drivers and configure the device.
</p>
<p>- Download a recovery image for your Surface from here (<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-gb/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/downloadablerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-gb/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/downloadablerecoveryimage)</a>,
 noting that it will restore your device to the factory settings, including Windows 8.1. You'd have to re-upgrade to Windows 10 after that.</p>

<h2>            Fonts are not available in some applications</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to correct an issue where some system fonts are not displaying in some programs? I thought it was the program's problem, but I was told that it's an issue with .net runtime. I wanted to use an Open Type Font, which is already installed in
 Windows, but is not available in the program that I am using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't understand how .net or things like this work as I am not a technical person. I hope somebody could shed some light.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 DistributedCOM Event ID 10016 and Microsoft Edge</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys. I followed instructions online, went to Component Services, added PCNAME\Morad and made sure Local Activation is checked. I still keep getting this error message each and every time I open the Edge browser. Any ideas how to get rid of it? I believe
 this started after the Fall Update. I even reset the Edge browser but no luck. I also tried a clean boot.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You are experiencing this error due to some broken components of Microsoft Edge. For us to provide an accurate resolution, we would need you to answer the following questions:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Which build and edition of Windows 10 is installed on your device?</li><li>What is the exact error message you are getting?</li><li>Is the error message only appearing when you are opening or using Microsoft Edge?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest running the automated troubleshooter for Windows 10 applications. This tool can scan and repair damaged Windows 10 apps components. Visit this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027498/windows-10-run-the-troubleshooter-for-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>, click on Run troubleshooter and then follow the prompts to successfully run the tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are looking forward to your response. </p>

            I forgot to mention I ran the automated troubleshooter and it supposedly fixed some errors with the Windows Store, but it did not fix the issue. I also tried repair and reset for the Edge browser and no luck. I also discovered I get the DitributedCOM errors
 each time I navigate to a website.&nbsp;

            I was able to fix the problem by doing a Windows 10 "Reset this PC". Everything is working great now and the issue is resolved. Thank you for trying!

<h2>            Is it possible to auto-enable &#40;default &#34;on&#34;&#41; the Windows 10 mobile hotspot&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I share my Windows 10 pc's wireless hotspot for home automation devices, and that part works great.</p>
<p>What doesn't quite work great is that every time the PC restarts I have to manually go into the "Mobile hotspot" settings and manually turn on the "Share my internet connection with other devices" option.</p>
<p>How can this be configured to default to "on" so that the hotspot is shared automatically after a computer restart?</p>
<p>Many thanks!</p>

    <title>Disable perflib error logging for a specific application - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Disable perflib error logging for a specific application</h2>
                    <p>How can I disable Perflib and PerfNet errors for a specific application?</p>
<p>I use glint.exe for a limited funtion, that displays HDD access indicator.&nbsp; No alternatives for this program I could find.</p>
<p>Problem is that this program accesses many perflib (which I do not need) functions at the startup, and leaves bunch of event 1008 and 2004 errors.</p>
<p>Now, I just want to disable logging by this app.</p>
<p>Thanks.&nbsp; Tak</p>

    <title>Billing Issues - Automated System - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blankman69  say:</h3>
<h2>            Billing Issues - Automated System</h2>
                    
<p>Microsoft has been trying to charge a card on my account that has been declined over 10 times due to the account being closed.&nbsp; So for 2 months, Microsoft has been trying to run my closed card once a week, on 2 occasions twice a week for a service I wasn't
 even using. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
What is even more astounding is the fact that I have received absolutely no email, phone call, or mail items from Microsoft identifying that there is a problem with my account billing. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
So now Microsoft expects me to pay for 2 months of something that I haven't even used, but continue to bill me for on a declined card.&nbsp; The only thing I seem to have received from Microsoft were a couple emails from an automated system saying they had a problem
 charging my card.&nbsp;&nbsp; Upon checking the automated email, no where does it state that they will continue service, continue to run the card, accumulate any money towards the time they have tried to charge the card.&nbsp; The email basically just states, please fix
 your payment method so your service is not interrupted.&nbsp; What I find even more concerning is that even maybe after the 2nd time the card was declined, there was no flag thrown up to have a Human person intervene and question what is going on.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Contacting customer service got me no where, other then them telling me to leave feedback on here.&nbsp; So am I thrown in a loop?&nbsp; I guess time will tell. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Another thing that worries me, as much money as I have spent with Microsoft on games, consoles and&nbsp; membership fees, I guess being a Gold Member for 7 years total means absolutely nothing to them.&nbsp; Other then the obvious, "Well look at him, he is just throwing
 money at us.&nbsp; He hasn't figured out yet that he is just another number to us."<br />
<br />
And Now I cannot even use the Sign In Button under this input box. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
GamerTag is Blankman69 Microsoft.&nbsp; I'm sure you can link that gamertag to my email to get a hold of me, or even possibly give me a call with the phone number you have on record for me.<br />
<br />
The Ball is now in your court.</p>

<p>Normally companies prefer it when you pay what is owed to them, irregardless of how many years you've been with them. &nbsp;You need to pay your bill, turn off auto-renewal and cancel your subscription then. &nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/xbox-live-membership/cancel-xbox-live-gold-subscription" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">FAQ</a></p>

<p>@Eggnogga That is correct. &nbsp;But when my bank account gets locked, loose internet, and phone due to outcome of a work injury and not receiving payment, then I come back having them repeatedly trying to charge my card, accrue a $150 charge at the bank for
 attempts, and then a bill from Microsoft for something that was out of my control. &nbsp;I have been on chat with reps for the past 2 days. &nbsp;I can't post on the xboxvoice.com website because it refuses to let me sign in to post. &nbsp;Then the 3rd rep from yesterday
 tells me to post on here, that they check and can possibly help resolve my issue.. &nbsp;So Microsoft is throwing me in a loop.</p>
<p>Phone support and chat support have both been contacted, and they just redirect me towards the forums or xboxvoice.com . &nbsp;Seems kind of suspicious to me to be honest.</p>

<h2>            TiWorker.exe &#43; SystemSettings.exe &#61; much heat and other problems</h2>
                    <p>I'm curious to know what just happened, again. I was surfing on the Facebook and then suddenly the fans of my PC got at their max speed. CPU temp rose up to 70+ C. Taskmanager showed TiWorker.exe.... CPU 80-92%. When that process stopped SystemSettings.exe
 started... CPU 80-92%. The "Disk 0" and "Ethernet" under the Perfomance tab didn't show any acitivity. Also there is no information about any updates in that time in the Windows log so I guess this wasn't caused by Windows updating. I scanned my PC with three
 malware scanners but they didn't find anything. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For the whole time my PC ran very slow and for example dragging windows accross the screen was like 1 fps movie. After reboot everything was normal.

    <title>Windows 10 upgrade stuck at 92&#37; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> scxtt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade stuck at 92&#37;</h2>
                    <p>For the last two weeks I have been trying to upgrade my computer to Windows 10. It has been a very painful, and angering experience, and I write on here seeking help and answers, with hopes of eventually running Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To start, I am currently running a real (Paid For) and activated version of Windows 7, 64 Bit. I reserved my Windows 10 weeks ago, and on the initial launch date, I inputted the line into cmd and force started the upgrade, and now I was downloading the OS
 onto my computer. When that finished I went through the prep process, and it began the actual upgrade - everything seemed to be going well, until I reached 92% of the total upgrade, and 69% of the "Copying files" portion, this is where it stopped, I left it
 on for over 6 hours, and it didn't move or change, I have since tried many times with the same result1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I have tried:</p>
<p>-Unplugging all USB devices, and Ethernet Connection</p>
<p>-Unplugging the SATA cables connecting my DVD drive to my MoBo</p>
<p>-I also attempted the "Sleep mode" tactic - but when it is stuck, hitting the power button (Which I set for sleep mode in Windows 7 control panel, doesn't go into sleep)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated</p>
<p>
</p><p>

Anybody have any idea what's going on?   P.S. This happened randomly over two years ago and I've tried various sites from time to time to get it answers but no luck.  O.S.: Windows 7 Home 64 bit

    <title>Playing Blu Ray disk crashes Windows 7 with blue screen error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marcreeder  say:</h3>
<h2>            Playing Blu Ray disk crashes Windows 7 with blue screen error</h2>
                    <p>I have a Sony Vaio Laptop VCPEA (bought in 2010) running Win 7 professional. It came with a Bul Ray drive and Corel WIN DVD software. For the first two years it played Blu Ray disks perfectly. Then without warning, whenever a Blu Ray disk was inserted into
 the drive and the Colel software started up, a blue screen "Systems Service Exception" error occurred. Since DVD's continued to play perfectly I just stopped playing Blu Ray disks and everything was OK.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently playing DVDs became a problem (skipping and failing to track) so I finally decided to replace the BD/DVD/CD drive hoping that would also fix my Blu Ray problems. The new drive plays DVDs and CDs but playing Blu Ray disks continues to crash Windows
 as before when Corel WIN DVD player starts up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thinking that I must have a software problem and not a hardware problem, I tried different software players. I installed Corel WIN DVD PRO 11 which played DVDs OK but crashed Windows the same way as before when starting Blu Rays. I installed VLC V 2.1.5,
 which played DVDs just fine but wouldn't play Blu Ray disks. On-line tutorials showed me how to enable the VLC program to play Blu Rays by downloading the necessary keydb.cfg and libaacs.dll files. After this was done I tried playing a Blu Ray disk but VLC
 gave me an error message. It didn't crash Windows, however, just wouldn't play the disk. So it is possible that I did not add the&nbsp;keydb.cfg and libaacs.dll files correctly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure how to continue debugging this problem. Is it a hardware problem or a software problem? It must not be related to the BD drive, as I just had a new one installed. Could it be a mother board problem? If it is a software problem (which seems most
 likely) is it a problem with Windows 7 or with the BD player software?</p>
<p>

            <p>I think I have solved this issue. I found out on-line that the current version Corel BD player software has some issues that may have caused my blue screen crash. I also found a new BD player (Aurora) that plays without any issues. So, even though I don't
 know why my original Corel player software started crashing my computer, it seems I am now back OK with playing Blu ray disks.&nbsp;</p>
