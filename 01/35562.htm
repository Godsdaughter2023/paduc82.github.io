    <title>Pinned &#38; Recent Folder Missing From Explorer in Start - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> head-on-desk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pinned &#38; Recent Folder Missing From Explorer in Start</h2>
                    <p>For the fourth time installing Windows 10 and following light use - the "File Explorer" object in my Start Menu has lost "Pinned" and "Recent" locations. The context menu just has "Pin to Start" and "More".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Jump List" for the Explorer shortcut on the Taskbar still shows them, as does the view of "Quick Access" - although the icons have changed from simple Picture/Video/Arrow icons etc, to scaled-down versions of the usual icons (showing the yellow folder
 around each object).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried every solution I can find online, and nothing seems to help. After multiple installs, Recoveries, reboots and profile resets - the fact that it keeps happening is actually driving me crazy!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only commonality in each install has been Windows, drivers and Skype. And every driver has been installed with-and-without any supporting software it might have had (e.g. GeForce Experience).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a fix I might not have found? A Registry or User Profile cache or config that can be repaired? Where in W10 does that Context menu read the data from and why does it keep forgetting how it's done?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help!</p>

            <p>I had tried that, Krishna - and it didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said - I've found the cause of the Bug - and it's REALLY bad coding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "File Explorer" context menu in Start populates itself with Data using a particular Path. Quite bizarrely - this path leads through the Start Menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to replicate the Bug, all you have to do is make part of that path Hidden in Explorer. Specifically:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; Open %APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs</p>
<p>&gt; Right-click "Windows System" and Select Properties.</p>
<p>&gt; Add the "Hidden" attribute. Whether you apply this to Folder Contents or not makes no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hey Presto! You've broken the File Explorer context menu! And all you had to do was try to customise your Start menu!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Start menu is a catalogue of Shortcuts and should NOT be used by Windows in its internal calls.</p>

                    <p>Hi Guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I am a Win 10 user, had this error this morning, since other things worked just fine I am wondering if its a serious issue ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;After exploring on the internet it seemed like a .Net framework problem, I have (version 1, 2, 3, 3.5 and 4 installed) so I tried to reinstall .Net framework and here are the problems:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) .Net framework didn't show up on App list (Can't uninstall)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Downloaded and tried both .Net framework verification and cleanup tool, no use, issue persisted</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Would anyone kindly advice on the issue ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Thanks a lot</p>

 you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent
 you from following these steps. Please refer to the following article on how to perform a clean boot and how to revert back the changes.</p>

            <p>Dear Andria,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your suggestion, I am able to locate the problem file following this clean boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In&nbsp;<strong>Task Manager</strong> -&nbsp;<strong>Startup </strong>there is this <strong>
Microsoft .Net Assembly Registration Utility&nbsp;</strong>program which is the one that shows up at startup. I am able to open up its location in the C drive (Normally can't find the folder otherwise) C:\ProgramData\WinDL but I don't have access to modify the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since I turned it off, the popups disappeared but only partially (CLR Error window is gone, but there is another window showing C:\ProgramData\WinDL that pops up at startup). Yesterday there were 3 popups - 2 window showing the file location and 1 CLR error
 window.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please write back when you have the chance</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would need to try the factory reset to try all the available options. That message you received is related to the Home console associations of your account and there are connection issues preventing that change, but it will allow you to continue anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the reset again and select continue anyway when it asks. Besides that I think restarting your router for at least 5 mins will help.</p>

<h2>            Forums</h2>
                    
<p>Seriously <strong>[Mod Removed - Profanity] </strong>has happened to these forums. There used to be 1000s of people on here daily. Now there is like 15 regular users and thats it with the odd random comment. The quality of posts is just boring and the forms
 have little to zero sense of fun or homour throughout. Im gonna join the bandwagon and hightail it out of here as its a waste of my mouse clicks. Shame as it did used to be a lot of fun on here and quite often actually worth a read even if you didnt post.
 Nowadays its just a constant stream of copy and pastes from the interent about some god awful game and idiotic threads about how you get the plastic off the game case. Its a truly&nbsp; embarrassing reflection on a company like Microsoft that THIS is their OFFICIAL
 forums pffttttt. To add to that when a new person comes on and ask a quesrtion or is new and mistakenly posts something in a wrong place or something the regular morons who live in here jump on them like you wouldnt believe with their stinking attitudes....
 little wonder noone comes on here.</p>

<p>The Xbox forums are more then just the UK General area....the game specific threads still see a lot of traffic, but the flow of people to the UK Gen has declined since it was relaunched, never got back to the numbers it had before but good discussions still
 take place</p>

<p>If you feel the forums are no longer what you require them to be then thats a shame but the beauty of the internet means there will be other options for you to browse till you find something you are happy with</p>

<p>I'm not having a go but to say there's just a constant stream of posts about god awful games? There's always posts about games I'm not interested in but others are, can't call them awful just because you don't like them, why not try making some yourself
 about games you are interested in, there will ALWAYS be some that will get involved in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But yes these forums are VERY quiet to what they use to be, I don't think for one minute that it's because of one thing, many reasons but there's still enough people that visit them, not as often but as someone else said a while back in a similar thread
 to this .. " It's down to the people using it to try and make it better/more lively etc " ..</p>

<p>Yep, just look at the Trials thread/leagues, great thread, people took it upon themselfs and got going some great games/leagues etc going, be great to see more games get something like this, even if only a few people could take part, gets a few more people
 posting, chances are you could make some new friends, all helps.</p>

<p>Some reasons why people left:<br />
<br />
The forums were completely broken last year, and they are still terrible to navigate.<br />
<br />
Trolls and the absence of proper moderating.<br />
<br />
Banning of discussion threads because of a couple of idiots.<br />
<br />
Splitting the UK forums into a general discussion and game discussion. &nbsp;Honestly the game discussion section is pointless, hardly anybody ever posts there.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of other better gaming communities that are more friendly, sociable, properly moderated. &nbsp;I'd recommend just looking at some other forums.<br />
<br />
Alot of people just use twitter and other social media, it's better for getting info on games and sending messages to people. &nbsp;Forums are great for discussions involving lots of people but seeing as someone made the stupid decision to ban that, it almost goes
 against the purpose of a forum. &nbsp;While that stupid rule isn't enforced anymore, there's really nobody about to discuss games now.<br />
<br />
There's less interesting games to talk about now, at least that's my opinion. &nbsp;Every year companies seem to put out the same stuff. &nbsp;There really just isn't alot to talk about. &nbsp;Even with big titles, many people just don't care, and nearly all games have there
 own dedicated section on the forum anyway.</p>

<p>I disagree with some points above. </p>
<p>There are less trolls now than there was, and more moderating. Ok I understand why some people don't like trolls, but to me they can add some fun, add a bit of a laugh to these forums, it's quite funny seeing them post sometimes and replies people come up
 with. Also you u can go slightly off topic now and the thread gets deleted, killing a lot of the fun that was there before.
</p>
<p>I kinda miss some of the anarchy that went on in past on here, at least it was fun, that's more than you can say for most threads these days.

<p>I agree in part with what 1337gamer said, that there's not the same amount of interesting games around at the moment.I only said a few days back in the F1 2012 thread on here, that the 2010 thread a few years back was one of the best threads I've been involved
 with on the forums, great chat, laughs, people setting up games, not saying the 2012 is not a good thread but a few years back it was the first F1 game to appear on consoles, third one now so alot of the excitement has gone, same for alot of games now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>( I still think though, old or not there are some stunning looking games on the way )</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't like using the word "Troll" so I'll say the ones that like to cause mishief, I more often than not find these people absolutely hillarious, I honestly can't believe the way they act sometimes or the posts they make, totally amazes me and yes they
 can liven up the forum sometimes, saying that though I don't think they have any place on here, call me boring but I come on here to talk about games, see any new news, get some help if needed, offer some if I can and that really is it, when I sign out these
 mischief makers are a distant memory whatever else they would have you believe, hey ho though if they want to come on here and act like their back in school so be it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know it's already been mentioned but I agree that when the 'Game Discussion' threads were axed, that killed alot of life on here, again though this goes back to me not understanding the way people act, I have family, good friends that play games, we very
 often like or dislike different games, do we argue about it? no, why would we, it's a game lol.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't see this forum ever being as busy as it once was, but if more people could sometimes learn to agree to dissagree sometimes and ignore the idiots when they appear ( I've been guilty myself of getting involved with them ) then I don't see why this
 forum can't flow along nicely.</p>

    <title>Headphone Port not Working on ASUS Laptop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> piperroe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Headphone Port not Working on ASUS Laptop</h2>
                    I have an Asus laptop with Realtek High Definition Speakers. I also am updated completely with&nbsp;the latest&nbsp;version of&nbsp;Windows.&nbsp;I'll plug in my headphones, which are Hot Topic/ Apple earbuds. They work on every other device I use them with. They will not
 connect to my laptop at all, or not until after a very long period of time and/or unplugging/re-plugging them in. They do not show up when I go to the devices tab, and when my computer "searches for a device", nothing will come up. They are not an option to
 set as the default playback device in my sound settings. This has been a problem for me ever since I bought my laptop.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before assisting further, did you check if similar issue persists on connecting another headphones to the PC?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You may be facing the above issue due to disabling the microphone option on your PC. If the option to use microphone is switched
<strong>Off</strong>, your microphone will not be getting detected and eventually will not be able to complete the setup wizard on the PC. The above issue may also occur due to the non-updated headphone drivers installed in the PC.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> Follow the steps below to check if the option to use microphone is enabled on your PC.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press <strong>Windows</strong> logo key on the keyboard, type
<strong>Microphone privacy settings</strong> and select the top most search result.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Check if Let apps use my microphone option is switched to
<strong>On</strong> status. If not, slide the bar to <strong>On</strong> status and check if the changes are effective.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span> Check if similar issue persists on connecting another headphones to the computer. If the headphone works fine on other PC’s,
<strong>update</strong> the headphone drivers manually from <strong>Device manager</strong> by following the steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press <strong><span>Windows logo + X </span></strong><span>keys on the keyboard select
</span><strong><span>Device Manager </span></strong>from the options.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Expand <strong><span>Audio inputs and outputs</span></strong> option and check if the headphone drivers are visible in the window.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Right-click on the <span>headphone driver and select
</span><strong><span>Update this software </span></strong><span>option.</span></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Follow the on-screen instructions and wait for the update to complete.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Close the window after the update is complete and check if the changes are effective.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>

    <title>The drive Windows is on is locked. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timothy westman-barth  say:</h3>
<h2>            The drive Windows is on is locked.</h2>
                    <p>Long story short, yesterday I stopped using my Surface Pro 2, moments before the battery was going to die. I closed the cover, it slept. After like an hour I plugged it in. I assume the battery died in the meantime. Today I tried using it and it was attempting
 to repair a problem, but wouldn't say why. After a bunch of fudging around with things I determined that I do get the error message about the drive being locked, chkdsk says the first ntfs boot sector is unreadable or corrupt. Diskpart says the C volume on
 the main drive is RAW (in the format section). I have everything backed up so I'm willing to do a complete reinstallation if necessary, but I'd rather not, even if it means I don't get to use it today. I've read that a bunch of people had this problem after
 upgrading to Windows 8, ignorant people of course just blame the new software, well that got me thinking... Maybe my problem is that the computer just happened to be in the middle of automatically installing some update when the battery ran out. No way to
 check that though. Unless of course someone knows how I can check to see when the last updates were released that my Surface Pro 2 may have attempted to install. Currently I'm running the command CHKDSK /F /V /R /B /OFFLLINESCANANDFIX C: to see what happens
 because I figure it won't hurt anything and I read that it worked for someone else. I'll admit that Imm comfortable with technical things but don't really know much about Windows commands. Also, I'll add that if at all possible I'd rather avoid reinstalling
 from a flash drive. Just because it's annoying and I don't like thinking that at any time my computer could break and not be able to fix itself without the use of some tool from something else, like a flash drive. But if that's the only way I can do that too.
 Just chose a topic, and would like to know who to talk to about adding topics, there's really not a topic relevant to my question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Editing, I should add that I've been part of the Insider Preview program for a while and would have been running the latest build released to the Fast ring at the time the problem occurred. As such I also didn't just install Windows 10 and have the problem
 then, so that's not what's wrong.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Edit: For anyone who finds this thread and reads it, noting first that I used a Surface Pro 2 and this may or may not work for other devices, I ran the command:</p>
<p>CHKDSK /F /V /R /B /OFFLLINESCANANDFIX C:</p>
<p>And restarted after it was done. That seems to have fixed the problem from everything I can tell.
</p>
<p>It's important to confirm your primary boot disk is volume C. Which is should be unless you changed it or you're not booting from your main drive. It's probably not related but I also turned off Secure Boot Control (maybe Secure Boot Mode) before doing anything.
 That can be done from UEFI settings. Probably unrelated though. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>That command completed. Additional information now:&nbsp;</p>
<p>The earlier error (which I think I forgot to mention) about errors in the uppercase file, appears to be resolved, based on the result message here:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Correcting errors in the uppercase file.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows has made corrections to the file system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No further action is required.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, there were unused index entries in file 9 of indexes $SII and $SDH.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unused security descriptors were also cleaned up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got the error code 50 about not being able to transfer logged messages to the event log. I read online that other people got that and I assume it's because I ran this from the recovery partition so the logs can't get saved properly to where ever they're
 supposed to be saved to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Making note of of all this in case any of it is helpful or may end up having been the solution. Now going to attempt to restart and boot up normally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll add that, should it be related to anything because I read people had problems with booting from the wrong disk, that I turned off secure boot mode in the uefi settings prior to all this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restarting worked successfully. Everything's back to normal. I'll add any things I notice if something seems to have gone wonky. Otherwise, considering this problem solved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit 2: Could I get someone to mark this as an Answer for me? Seems I can't do that for my own posts.

            <p>&nbsp;I have the same. I am getting multiple "Critical Error" messages. There are the two in the Topic, "Damaged hard drive clusters detected," and, "Missing Hard Drive." Also there is another that says something along the lines of, "RAM usage very high. RAM
 failure imminent." There will be an occasional set of popups saying different things about a Hard Drive failure . I'm assuming from what I've read by searching that it might have something to do with some kind of Virus or Malware, but I have not found any
 really useful information on how to fix it, and I have tried running Virus removal programs. Microsoft Security Esentials failed to defend my computer against this attack&nbsp;and running a full scan with this product failed to detect anything wrong. The malware
 appears to be&nbsp;called something like Win32Systemcheck.</p>

<p>It will definitely offer you to buy its “full” version which supposedly can delete viruses onto your PC. This is a scam and none of the information should be trusted. Malware can’t detect or terminate legitimate viruses onto your computer and should be avoided.
 System Check is able to redirect to counterfeit websites that sell the program. Ignore all notifications but use decent anti-spyware program and get rid of System Check upon detection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>edit (7/1/2012) :&nbsp;I have since had a local&nbsp;IT expert remove the malware from my computer for a fee. I feel let down by Microsoft Security Essentials which I have been relying on to protect my computer from this sort of horrible&nbsp;invasion.</p>

            <p>Hi Peter,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in using Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us first suggest you to run an System File Checker and check if it helps fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>SFC /scannow is a super-useful command you can use in any Windows version. When the SFC (System File Checker) command is used with the /scannow switch, the tool will scan all of the important Windows files on your computer and replace them as
 necessary. Missing and corrupt operating system files (like many DLL files) are arguably the biggest cause of major Windows issues.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Refer to these steps to perform a SFC scan:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a) Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong>, select <strong>Command prompt (Admin)</strong> to bring up elevated command prompt.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>b) In the command prompt type the following command: <strong>sfc<span>&nbsp; </span>
/scannow</strong> and press enter.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>c) After the scan, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If that does not help, then yes, you can try to perform a rollback and check if that helps.</p>
<p>You can refer to the section '<strong>Can I uninstall Windows 10 if I do not like it or something goes wrong?'
</strong>from this article:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/frequently-asked-questions-windows-10/5c0b9368-a9e8-4238-b1e4-45f4b7ed2fb9">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/frequently-asked-questions-windows-10/5c0b9368-a9e8-4238-b1e4-45f4b7ed2fb9</a></p>

<p>Welcome to the Microsoft Community forums. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We don't handle Xbox Enforcement Actions on this community. The best thing to do is to visit the Xbox Enforcement website here:
<a href="https://enforcement.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://enforcement.xbox.com</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will be able to sign in and submit a case review by clicking onto the orange ban hammer icon on the homepage. From there, the Xbox Enforcement team will be able to tell you why you got suspended, or a brief idea anyway.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a tip, if anyone is Violating the Xbox Code of Conduct, or Microsoft Code of Conduct, Service Agreement and Terms of Use. Please don't engage or retaliate. Just report them so the relevant team can deal with it :) - As we always say "<em>Don't feed the
 troll</em>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be aware that they will not be able to tell you exactly why in case your able to hen find out who reported you. Remember that the report feature is meant to be anonymous :)</p>

<h3> cleanuptax085  say:</h3>
<h2>            Plants vs Zombies for xBox 360 - Start Screen Malfunction</h2>
                    
<p>The start screen for the game flips over to the right - the screen with email access.&nbsp; I try to flip back to the main start screen and it immediately flips back over to the other screen.&nbsp; So, I can't start a game because it won't stay on the screen with
 the Start Game option.</p>
<p>The controller works fine, the screen just won't stop jumping over.</p>

<h2>            After KB4495620 Windows Update, Network is not working</h2>

</p><p>Today I have got an Windows Update -&nbsp;KB4495620 (Cumulative Update for .NET framework 3.5 &amp; 4.8). After installing that, my network is broken. It shows as broken as shown in the attachment. It's partially working when I connect my laptop with LAN, my chrome
 and other things expect Microsoft products (Edge, Outlook) showing me as offline. And I'm seeing an error in windows update page after the page. I tried creating the Windows 10 image of my machine using MediaCreation tool and reinstalled windows. Again the
 same windows update got installed and again the same issue!<br />
</p>

            Hi, Karthikeyan
<br />
<br />My name is Smith and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Try to repair your internet connection
<br />
<br />Restore all network adapters to repair your connection.
<br />
<br />Open the network and Internet settings in the Configuration application.
<br />
<br />The quickest way to do this is to right-click or long press the network icon in the notification tray and choose "Open network and Internet settings". The network icon looks different if you have an active cable connection or a wireless connection. The menu that opens is the same. Choose open network settings and the Internet.
<br />
<br />On the left side of the Network and Internet settings window, make sure you are in the Status category. Then, to the right, scroll to the end of the configuration list. There, you should see a link called "Restart the network." Click or tap on it.
<br />
<br />The Configuration application opens a view called Network Restart, which tells you that "This will remove and then reinstall all your network adapters, and will set other network components to their original settings. You may need to reinstall other software of networks, such as VPN, client software or virtual switches.
<br />
<br />If you agree with all that and want to continue restarting your network adapters, click or touch Reset now.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 asks you to confirm that you want to reset your network adapters. If you do so, click or touch Yes.
<br />
<br />If you went ahead and chose to reset your network adapters, Windows 10 informs you that your computer or device shuts down in 5 minutes. Close the notification and save whatever you are working on before this timer expires.
<br />

<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Keep us posted on the status for further assistance.

            Hi Karthi.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything possible to try in order of priority so that hopefully something works.  If you need help performing any steps I'll be standing by here to guide you:
<br />
<br />Enable IPv6 in the network adapter settings: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/90033-enable-disable-ipv6-windows.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/90033-enabl...</a>
<br />
<br />Run the fixit from <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/929852" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/help/929852</a> (Re-enable IPv6 on all nontunnel interfaces) and reboot.
<br /> 
<br />Right click the network icon in System Tray at bottom right end of task bar to Troubleshoot Problems.  
<br /> 
<br />Try powering off modem, router and PC and then restarting in that order with 1 minute in between each.
<br />
<br />Try all of these steps:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-settings-to-default-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/how-to-reset-network-...</a>
<br />
<br />Update your network adapter drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page using the full model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If you have the latest network driver then try on it's Driver tab also to Roll Back, or Uninstall and then restart PC to reinstall the driver.  Try also all older drivers from Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick list working backwards.
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; WIfi &gt; Manage Known Networks, highlight and remove the network having problems, restart PC to see if it shows up again.  
<br />
<br />Try plugging in by ethernet cable to the router to compare, then plug the ethernet cable into the modem (if separate) to see if this might be an issue with the router.    
<br />
<br />You also are entitled to Support from your internet provider to get online on all devices.  This is always included in the monthly bill.  If your router is less than a year old they will also Support getting it connected and optimized.
<br />
<br />Another option is you could replace the wireless adapter with an inexpensive USB nano adapter like this one:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011T5IF06/ref=psdc_13983791_t2_B06XSFPDFX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B011T5IF06/ref=psdc_1...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also add an extender.  The best one I've found is $17 at Amazon, configures itself, and so good I'd never use any other:  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-Extender-External-Antennas-TL-WA855RE/dp/B0195Y0A42/ref=zg_bs_3015439011_1?_encoding=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;refRID=Z4RSPX5MKEE88V62CSS1#customerReviews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/TP-Link-Extender-Externa...</a>
<br />
<br /> if this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version update then you can roll it back in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcabl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thank you all for you support!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that windows update, my "Network List Service" went to Stopped state! Because of that, my network was shown broken! I retried the Windows update again, and got the same service stop issue 2nd time as well. But somehow, the next time, it got installed
 that patch successfully and didn't stop the&nbsp;Network List Service.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            GeForce GTX 780 graphic card having problems&#40;custom built PC&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Updated 10/18, new post below with question.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: The warranty is expired I believe, hence why I'm asking here for possible solution before going to a nearby PC repair shop and spend more $$ then I need to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had this custom built PC for about 2-3 years now and it has for the most part been fine, however, over time it has had some minor problems. One problem for a small time was turning on and off by itself at random intervals but it mysteriously stopped(I
 believe this had to due with being too close to the wall and getting hot). Now the issue is even worse, the tower stops display to the monitor but it stays turned on(the tower) and the 2 fans on the GeForce GTX 780 Graphic card spin at full speed for any amount
 of time before returning the PC to normal. This can happen within a few mins of turning it in, or a few hours. I opened the case to dust it out best I could, I was able to clean out the back-fan which was FULL of dust bunnies and it is giving much better air
 flow however that was not the problem it seems, as when I turned it back on, it just now doesn't turn on display to monitor, only the tower turns on as if operational, but the GeForce GTX 780 graphic card dual fans go to max speed and don't stop. Any solutions
 appreciated, if worst case scenario I have to take it to a repair shop and spend some money then I will. As of now I'm unable to log onto it.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regarding your concern, we suggest that you try to boot your PC without the graphics card and use the on-board graphics.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you were able to boot your PC in Windows, it might be a possible hardware issue and you may consider replacing your graphics card.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p />

            If your PC doesn't have on-board graphics and removing the&nbsp;graphics card and&nbsp;re-seating it doesn't change the symptoms then overheating may have damaged the card. It will need replacing if that is the case.

            Updated: It turns out that we still have warranty but there's an issue, &nbsp;the graphic card I use is not being produced anymore(I switched the video cable from the graphic card to the motherboard and Windows boots up now but games frame rates DIP into non
 existence, still spinning very fast), so they are gonna do 1 of 2 things, pick a similar type to replace it with or reimburse for the amount the graphic card was worth when we paid for it($550), so in the case they end up reimbursing, can anyone tell me a
 good graphic card equal to or better then this one:&nbsp;http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130918 for $550?&nbsp;
