<br />
I've always used Windows Mail for both my Live account and several Gmail accounts. Since the last major update I did about a week ago, I have no longer been able to use any of my Gmail accounts.<br />
<br />
As you can see from the picture I have supplied, the Gmail Accounts no longer come up on the left hand side list where my Live account is. When I click on "Accounts" on the right hand side this bar appears with all of my email accounts, but I can no longer
 access them.<br />
<br />
Please help! Why can I no longer access my Gmail accounts like I used to?<br />
<br />

            Yes, but I want you to isolate the problem from another user account. I could have easily also asked to create a new user account too:

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>2. Does the issue occur only with .wav files?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Please follow the steps to enable the preview pane:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Open Windows Explorer (explorer.exe). <br />
<font>b.</font> On the toolbar, click on <b>Organize</b> and <b>Layout</b>.
</p>
<p>c. Select <b>Preview pane</b> to have it checked,&nbsp; or &nbsp;Click on the <b>Preview pane icon</b> on the far right of the toolbar.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know the result.</p>

            Yeah, I tried that, but it didn't work. When I hid the preview pane it stopped playing them when I selected a file, but when I activated the preview pane again it started to play the .wav when I selected it.&nbsp;

            <p>Sorry I did not provide a clearer&nbsp;description.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this installation of Windows 10, the DOS window on the desktop when maximized at first took up the entire screen. Now it takes just a narrow strip of it along the left hand side similar to how it&nbsp;functioned in the previous installation, Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From your link, learning to use 'SFC'&nbsp; now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you :0)</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:</p>
<p>12.33 PM</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the source controlling the window size to be in the Command Window 'properties' popup. It is under the Tab 'Font', top left-hand corner&nbsp; box 'Size'. Changing the value from low to high increases the size of the Command window :0)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure there is another way as when I first opened my, Windows 10, Command window the font was 14, but in&nbsp;a full screen maximized window.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help, links and suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>EDIT:</p>
<p>1.39 PM</p>
<p>I found that the size of the Command window in the&nbsp;'properties' popup&nbsp;is set on the Tab 'Layout', and can be as big, or as small, as the user choses.

            Thanks for your post.&nbsp;I have a large screen and I could hardly make out the type/display.
<br />
At first I was lost based on your remark "under the Tab" since no tabs appeared when I open the DOS Window.
<br />
So I tried a right-click on the title bar and up popped the menu, and after clicking on properties I saw the tabs.&nbsp;<br />
After making &nbsp;adjustments I can now read the type/display. <br />
Again, thanks for your post/solution.

 was at fault and used a Bluetooth keyboard while I procured another SP3 type cover. Which I did a week ago. Now the pain starts in spades.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Surprise, surprise... the new keyboard does not work. I panic of course, seeing that the damn things aren't exactly cheap. So I research (Side note: should've done that when the first keyboard stopped working... you live, you learn) and I find that there
 are plethora of problems recently around the cover not working all of a sudden. Anyways, the solutions went from simple (reattach...) to fatal (delete everything reinstall windows)/. I went thru EVERY ONE of the solutions.... and then the fatal one... Reset
 the Surface. The Keyboard worked like a charm. I was like ok, excellent. Two days later, the TPM update winks at me from Windows firewall. So I upgrade. And BANG! the type cover STOPS WORKING again... So ok, I know what I should do right, even though I had
 spent the last two days reinstalling and reconfiguring everything.... I say ok, I ABSOLUTELY ADORE the SP so fine... Pain is ok.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I reinstall with the image. But.... the type cover doesn't work. I go thru the complete windows configuration and reboot... and the cover doesn't work still.. Sigh, redo. Same solution. Now I am typing this from the Bluetooth keyboard while I download
 the Win 10 Install just in case its a new download that works always.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, can somebody tell me WHAT to do??????? I assure you, inspite of the obvious frustration I feel right now, I absolutely LOVE the SP. Please help me get it back to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>EDIT: July 10: Tried downloading the Surface Recovery image from here (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage) but the download says completed at 3.5G (the download is ~7GB and i tried this thrice) and then Windows says its not a valid
 zip file. (Pulling hair out)</p>
<p>EDIT July 11: So finally the Surface recovery image downloaded. Said a prayer and wiped my device. Started from Win 10 ver 1511 image. The recovery also wiped the TPM and went back to original TPM initially. The keyboard didn't even get any power. Went thru
 the whole setup and downloads and upgrades and everything (even the TPM is now ver 5.62.3126.2 which is the latest version). Got NOTHING to show for it. No lights no blinks, no flicker of life on the keyboard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I have had the same &amp; other problems with my SP4. I am from India and I bought the unit in US. I ewa told by the rep at the store that it is covered under international warranty. 3 weeks later, right side of the screen went dead touch stopped working. Pen
 works. I asked for a relacement and i was told that the particular SP4 config was not available in India. So no support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keyboard started giving problems 8 months later. It stopped working. Did 2button reset and it started working and again stopped after another week. Since then, it has worked intermittently. I have tried all the steps listed here...but that hasn't helped.
 So now the unit is useless. Touch doesn't work on 1/4 of the screen and the keyboard doesn't work as well. Not sure how one is supposed to reimage the device without a working keyboard. Bluetooth doesn't work in reset mode and your only USB port is taken up
 by the recovery drive. Can someone throw some light on this?</p>

 - see if your typecover works when you drain the battery. If it is in this condition, they have not released any fix, and it is unlikely that there will be one coming. Sorry.

            Surface does NOT have an International Warranty, and whoever told you that was incorrect. The only thing you can do is contact support&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13948/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13948/global-customer-service-phone-numbers</span></a>.
 They will most likely tell you that you will have to ship to a friend in the US or other country where your configuration launched to initiate a warranty/out of warranty exchange. Sorry for the bad news.

<p>International warranty was there...only for the configs supported in India. They did accept my unit for replacement but since this config was not available in India, they returned the unit. In any case, the rep at the store lied because I delayed buying
 the unit by one day and asked him to confirm first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bigger challenge is the issues like keyboard not working...why have they not been able to resolve this issue? Searching on the net will show that a lot of people are facing the problem - specially with SP4. I believe this to be a firmware / driver issue.
 Have they thought it thru? I dont think so. With keyword not working, how are we supposed to reimage the device using a USB drive?? Were they expecting everyone to have a surface dock having extra USB ports? So that one can connect a USB Keyboard and mouse
 and go thru the process?? It is really frustrating to do it without a working keyboard. Bluetooth doesnt work and neither does the pen / touch screen. So, how are you going to click on the options on the screen??&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, I am done with MS Surface. Support has been pathetic and so has been their response. I see there are better, more reliable options available in the market.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Update...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to reimage the device using a borrowed Surface dock. I did need a spare USB port for at least the mouse to work. The type cover is working fine now. It gets detected immediately and there seem to be no issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, that brings me to the main question: It does look like a software / firmware issue. Doesn't look like a hardware issue. Why has Microsoft not been able to rectify the issue so far? I am sure it is not a skill issue. Looks like they just have not tried
 to solve this problem. Silence doesn't work. Like I said in my post above, while reimaging the device has been suggested as a solution, and in my case it worked also, how is someone going to reimage the device without an extra USB port? Touch on the screen
 and Bluetooth do not work in the process, and the only USB port on the device is taken up by the USB drive you are trying to reimage from. So, how do you select from the options on the screen?? Has someone thought this thru? Or am I missing something?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To me it is callous attitude.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Maarten Baert,<br />
Check out this link.<br />
<br />
http://blogs.msdn.com/astebner/pages/8904493.aspx<br />
<br />
It will take you to a page where you can download a tool which will let you remove .NET. That appears to be your issue.<br />
I recommend that you download .NET 3.5 first, then run this removal tool.<br />
Install .NET 3.5 after the tool cleans out the old installation and it should repair the issue.<br />
Please let us know if you need anything else.

<h2>            Windows update won&#39;t finish</h2>
                    There are several windows 7 updates that have failed in the last day. Now it continuously asks to reboot to finish but it never finishes. This computer isn't used a lot so the updates may be older than yesterday. One is KB3156013, another is KB3153199,
 etc.<br />
I have gone through many of the troubleshooting techniques to solve it but it hasn't helped. FixIt didn't help. The need to reboot seems to interfere with the troubleshooter helping to fix windows update. I want to install windows 10 but it doesn't seem to
 be able to finish although it went through the install process twice with the % circle showing. I've scanned the computer with Norton and Malwarebytes. No problems. Just seems this issue with Windows 7 updating is the problem. Looked for a restore point but
 there are only two listed from when I ran FixIt today.

            <p>You have an update search running in the background. Before proceeding in any way, set automatic updates to "Never check for updates" and restart. Perhaps this enables installing the update readiness tool.</p>

            Well, lesson learned, perhaps. After seeing the above all day for the last couple days and restarting the computer as it says to no avail a couple dozen times.... I shut the computer down (instead of clicking the restart button in the message box) AND
 the computer supposedly installed 28 updates before shutting down. So, we'll see what happens at restart in the AM.

<h2>            Error during updating my system.</h2>
                    I turned on my laptop and after the dell logo loaded it said updating your system and it got to maybe 14%( but it varies how far it gets each time). Then a error comes up and it says Error C000003A applying operation 18828 of 111982 (appraiser.sdb) and
 its loading but it stays there for ever and it doesn't do anything. I do not know what this means but It is very annoying and I don't know what to do. I have looked all over google and every where and I can't find anything. I heard I could keep tapping f8
 and it would bring up a place where I could fix it i forgot what is called but I've tried it and it won't work. Please if anybody knows how to fix this please help I can't access my computer it's stuck at the loading screen and I can't even get to the login
 screen of windows or nothing.

    <title>Alt tab functioning automatically and minimizes the app - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Alt tab functioning automatically and minimizes the app</h2>
                    <p><em>Original title : Regular, Constant Automatic Alt Tabbing out of Everything</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>So ever since I refreshed my laptop (there was a huge performance issue), anything that I open--firefox, steam, control panel, you name it--automatically alt tabs every ten to twelve seconds. When it alt tabs, it plays a notification sound. For windowed
 apps, it alt tabs it without minimizing it (Like if you were on firefox and opened something else, the top bar turns grey) and selects it again. This process takes about one second. For fullscreen apps, it completely alt tabs and minimizes the app, without
 selecting it again. I'm not running any third party programs, and I uninstalled Norton. Again, this problem started after I refreshed my laptop. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!</p>

 from Windows 8.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides your suggestion I read about trying system restore to most recent restore point... Which should I try first and should I backup the photos to my external hard drive first ??&nbsp;</p>

<p>Good news John, I did a windows update to begin with and it fixed the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now no problem viewing photos or videos on my internal or external hard drives ! Update worked like magic and did a drive scan automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only other problem I've had is some cell phone videos are sideways video 90 degrees. I found a fix online that embeds their logo .. Freemake.com .. It flips them fine if you don't mind logo or pay them for " gold package logo free ". I figured out video
 needs to be shot horizontally not vertically...</p>

            I thank you for your help. I did a windows update first and it corrected my problem before I tried your fix. I also corrected 42 out of 50 sideways videos just by uploading them to google photos. What a relief. My son in law is going to share a video editor
 program to give me another way to fix my homemade videos. I found that taking cell phone videos in the landscape aspect prevents the sideways video problem all together. Happy Holidays John. I'm saving your suggestions too just in case.

            <p>I would attempt removal of the virus first:</p>
<b>
<p>Credit SpiritX [MVP]</p>

<p>If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do</p>
<p>a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running</p>
<p>resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detect as the</p>
<p>cause.</p>
<p>No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy</p>
<p>to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So</p>
<p>its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check with these to an</p>
<p>extreme overkill point and then run the cleanup only when you are very sure the system is clean.</p>
<p>These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also run
</p>
<p>them in regular Windows when you can.</p>
<p>Download malwarebytes and scan with it, run MRT, and add Prevx to be sure it is gone.</p>
<p>(If Rootkits run UnHackMe)</p>
<p>Download - SAVE - go to where you put it - Right Click on it - RUN AS ADMIN</p>

<p><strong>If all fails</strong></p>
<p>You can do a clean install with Windows 7 Upgrade disk.</p>
<p>Boot from the Windows 7 DVD</p>
<p>Click Install Now</p>
<p>Accept License Agreement</p>
<p>When the option is displayed to select an installation type, click (Custom Advanced)</p>
<p>Click Drive Options</p>
<p>Select the drive/s click Delete</p>
<p>Click New</p>
<p>Click Apply</p>
<p>Click OK</p>
<p>Click Format and click Next to proceed with the installation</p>
<p>Skip entering your Windows 7 product key and complete the installation.</p>
<p>Once you reach the desktop, click Start, right click Computer</p>
<p>Click Properties</p>
<p>Scroll down to Windows Activation</p>
<p>Click the link x days until activation.</p>
<p>Click the link that says 'Show me other ways to activate'</p>
<p>Enter product key</p>
<p>Click Next</p>
<p>Select Phone Activation</p>
<p>Click Next when Enter your key page displayed</p>
<p>Select your country</p>
<p>Click Next, call the number listed</p>
<p>Remember to explain to the call agent your situation.</p>
<p>Provide the generated installation ID when requested by the call agent</p>
<p>They will give you a confirmation ID in return, enter it</p>
<p>Click Next to complete the activation. </p>
<p>The requirements for upgrade media though is that you have a previously qualifying operating system such as Windows XP or Vista installed to use it. From the Windows 7 End User License Agreement.</p>
<p>15. UPGRADES. To use upgrade software, you must first be licensed for the software that is eligible for the upgrade. Upon upgrade, this agreement takes the place of the agreement for the software you upgraded from. After you upgrade, you may no longer use
 the software you upgraded from.</p>
<p>So, if you are still denied, you will have to simply reinstall Windows XP or Vista and let it do the eligibility check.</p>

<p>If you haven't removed the power from your console completely try this. Hold the power button on the console for 10 seconds or until the power shuts down completely. &nbsp;Unplug the power cord from the back of the console for 5 minutes. &nbsp;Plug the power cord
 back in and restart the console. &nbsp; Once it is back up and operational test for results.

    <title>Publisher Software for Vista and XP - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Publisher Software for Vista and XP</h2>
                    The MS Student package does not include Publisher (very surprising, since both schools use it) I have to buy it for both kids computers. I also need it for mine here at home ( I use it at work). They have Vista (which by the way we all hate) I use XP.
 Now will one Publisher work for both programs or do I have to buy one made exclusively for Vista and one exclusively for XP?

<h2>            Friend not receiving invites nor can I connect to them - please help&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>So I haven't checked to see if it's the same problem on any other games but me and my friend are having problems on Rainbow Six Siege. He invites me to a game but it will not let me connect to him at all. Then when I try to send him an invite to my game,
 he tells me that he doesn't even receive an invite and I'm 100% positive that I am sending him one. Also, when we go to the party chat and click invite party to game nothing pops at all not even an invite sent notification. So now I need to know two things.
 One - is it on his end or my end that has the problem. Two - is this an Internet/Xbox live problem or is it just a Rainbow Six Siege problem? Any help would be appreciated thanks!</p>

            Hi,
<div><br />
Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry to hear the issue you have experienced with Audio device performance upon upgrading to Windows 10. Let’s both work together to fix the issue.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer to these questions:<br />
a. What is the make and model of the PC? (I.e. Complete Model name)<br />
b. Have you tried installing the latest driver for this device?</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the below mentioned steps to fix the issue:</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1:<br />
Run built in Audio Device troubleshooter<br />
* Press Windows Key then type ‘troubleshoot’ and hit Enter<br />
* Select “View all” on the left panel and run “Playing Audio” troubleshooter from the list and see if it works</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2:<br />
Try updating the drivers and check if it helps<br />
a) Open run command by pressing Windows key + R and type “devmgmt.msc” (without quotes) and hit Enter.<br />
b) Spot and expand the “'Audio inputs and outputs'”.<br />
c). Right click on the “High Definition Audio Device” and select “Update Driver Software”. Once this is done, restart the computer to check the problem fixed.</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>If there are no update available, download the drivers from the manufacturer’s website and install it on the system by uninstalling the current driver. You can uninstall the driver by following the same steps, and select ‘Uninstall’, instead of selecting
 the “Update Driver Software” from the menu.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Please post back if you are experiencing any issue with Windows. I will be glad to help you.
        </p>

            I had this same problem with the initial update to win 10, reinstalling the driver worked for me then. However, since the last security patch it has killed my rear output for audio, and reinstalling the drivers has not worked. I can get some audio output
 from the front sound output, but not from the rear output. Any suggestions?

    <title>Removing a prior user from Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Removing a prior user from Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I just purchased a slightly used Lenovo Ideapad FLEX 14-1470 (still in its warranty period), and although I have changed the prior owner's name as Administrator to mine, his name still appears in the User Profiles, e.g., "DESKTOP-72-----\His First Name".&nbsp;
 I tried to edit the Registry to remove his user name from from the registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WindowsNT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList, as one of my online queries to Microsoft Support suggested, but I can't find a folder with his user
 name, and I don't want to remove the ProfileList key for fear of messing things up.&nbsp; I barely know how to start a computer much less deal with its software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone suggest how I can erase his fingerprints from my computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Larry</p>

<p>Hi Larry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't find a folder with the old user name in the Registry Editor, the only way for us to remove the old user profile in your computer is to remove all profiles by removing the ProfileList key in the Registry Editor. Incorrect modification of the
 registry may result to serious problems in your computer. Therefore, we suggest that you follow the steps carefully. Also, before modifying the registry, we recommend backing up the registry so that we can easily restore it if a problem happens.</p>

<p>Well, I followed the instructions exactly to back up the registry in Windows and to remove the user profiles on the Lenovo computer.&nbsp; Now I find that the removal of the user profiles has also removed a number of shortcuts on my Desktop (except for Recycle
 Bin and Windows 10 Update Assistant).&nbsp; It has also removed a number of the icons from the taskbar, and nothing happens when I click on the Start menu (the icons for the apps, power and settings do not appear) or any of the other icons that remain (e.g., speaker
 volume and network connections) and I cannot type anything in the search box, so no way to access the Control Panel or the restore point that was created.&nbsp; The only way I can access any files is through the Recycle Bin and the only way I can access a web browser
 is through the Windows 10 Update Assistant.&nbsp; HELP!</p>

<p>See my earlier note.&nbsp; P.S. I shut the computer down and did a restart, and now I cannot get anywhere.&nbsp; When I click "Sign in", I get an error message as follows:&nbsp; "The User Profile Service failed the sign-in.&nbsp; User profile cannot be loaded", with an OK button.&nbsp;
 When I click OK, it goes back to a blank screen with the date and time.&nbsp; When I click on the blank screen, it goes back to the sign-in screen, and we go through the loop again.</p>

<p>None of the above worked because there was no Cortona search box that appeared.&nbsp; In addition, an error message appeared:&nbsp; "explorer.exe - System Warning.&nbsp; Unknown hard error.&nbsp; OK".&nbsp; Clicking OK brought things to a halt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, one of the options that appeared as I followed the Start you PC in safe mode instructions (Press shift while engaging in Restart &gt;Troubleshoot&gt;Advanced Options was to Restore.&nbsp; So, I simply restored my system since I had backed it up by establishing
 a restore point per the earlier instructions, and now I have an operational computer, but one that still has the former Administrator in its system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, the question remains, how do I remove the prior User without going through the hassle I just experienced?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<h3> ahmad_hesham  say:</h3>
<h2>            slmgr &#47;xpr</h2>
                    <p>Okay so I Have A Windows 10 Original and I was trying &nbsp;to crack for a game I had to test something using a program , and the crack program had different options one of which was to crack windows, i already have an original windows that came with the asus
 rog g752, And I didn't notice I chose to crack windows until the process was finished. I was panicked so i googled and found that using 3 ways I can make sure that My windows was still (originally) activated. Using The Properties of "This PC". It says that
 "<em><strong>Windows Is Activated"</strong></em>. I also checked from the settings in the notification bar and It said the same. HOWEVER Using slmgr /xpr It said this "<strong><em>Volume activation will expire 6/12/2017"
</em></strong>So What does this mean exactly? is there a way I can revert windows prior to the point? I tried restoring the system but It just gave me an error after doing the restore saying it couldn't restore successfully,</p>
<p>Thank you in advance!.</p>

<h3> will cunningham  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows down arrow key stuck&#63;</h2>
                    I have recently built my third computer, but the keyboard or something else seems to be wrong. The down arrow is not working properly, it is stuck in place. I have tried everything to get it to not be stuck. I first tried sticky keys, but that did nothing,
 I pulled up the virtual keyboard to see if anything was being pressed without me doing it, and nothing showed up, and I even tried unplugging the keyboard, but the key was stilled pressed without a keyboard plugged in. I can't change anything in settings because
 the selection moves down too fast for me to click it in time, and for some reason, chrome is working fine with the issue. The issue first appeared when I was playing a game and the keyboard got mashed, and then my character just started running backwards without
 me touching it. My computer is practically unusable right now.

<h2>            Possible Scam</h2>
                    <p>I had an issue with my e-mail WOW, my Internet provider directed me to this company to help get it back. I signed up for a service contract; but something didn't feel right. &nbsp;Well, I took them off my computer and now I keep getting phone calls to let them
 back on. &nbsp;They are even proclaiming to be from Microsoft and working with the FBI. &nbsp;I almost feel for them again; but the site they wanted me to go to, was call anyplace control.com &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now if this was Microsoft or the FBI, wouldn't they have contacted me through snail mail or something else?</p>

<h2>            Finally converting my CDs to digital music files.  What&#39;s the best plan of attack&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I am finally going digital and preparing to rip in several hundred CDs.&nbsp; I use both an mp3 player and plan to purchase an iPod soon.&nbsp; Will also purchase music online in the future.&nbsp; I want to do this correctly the first time.&nbsp; Should I rip my music into
 Windows Media Player or iTunes?&nbsp; If I use Windows Media Player, which file format should I use (i.e. WMA, WMA Pro, WMA variable bit rate, WMA lossless, MP3, WAV Lossless)?&nbsp; I don't have iTunes yet, so not sure of the file types there.&nbsp; Also want to know which
 Audio Quality to select (48, 64,96,128,160,192 kbps)?</p>
<p>Ultimately, I want to make sure that my music has a consistent sound quality.&nbsp;&nbsp;My primary objective is not to have&nbsp;a volume or sound quality difference from one song to the next.&nbsp; Anonther objective is to be able to use both and mp3 player and an iPod without
 having to do too much extra work to use both.</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
You may use either windows media player or iTunes to rip the Audio CDs. Both do the same work. Selecting the file format is also left to you. Now most of the players play almost all types of files and well know file format is mp3. Higher the audio quality you
 select the quality of the sound also increase and also its size. <br />
<div>For consistent sound quality use the same rip settings for all the CDs.</div>
<div><br />
iTunes supports the following audio encoders: AAC, AIFF, MP3, WAV and Apple lossless.</div>

<p>I would recommend against ripping to WAV, because that format will almost certainly cause tagging problems later on, see&nbsp;<a href="http://thewelltemperedcomputer.com/SW/WMP/WAV.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://thewelltemperedcomputer.com/SW/WMP/WAV.htm</a></p>
<p>Other than that, I suggest that you choose one of the highest bit rates, 192 kbps, or even 256 or 320 kbps if possible. If you don't want any quality loss at all, then you should go with WMA Lossless, but the iPod can't play that format, so the files will
 have to be converted when syncing. If you don't mind a little bit of (probably inaudible) quality loss, then 320 kbps MP3 should be fine.</p>

            I promise that if you are a audiophile, you want 256kbps to be your minimum quality rip, and you want to use mp3 as your format if you want to maintain the tagging system for future use (believe&nbsp;me you do, nothing's more annoying than having a 30 gig ipod
 with 500 tracks &nbsp;that you know had a name, but only show up as "unknown track ") even though people say inaudible quality loss, if you are going to be archiving these songs for you to enjoy for years , Strongly consider 320kbps as your bitrate. It still is
 not as good as FLAC, but you can't use flac for most portable players anyway. I hope you have a large HDD drive and a LOT of time. Don't&nbsp;multi-task&nbsp;when ripping your music either, I hate listening to stuff I ripped while playing a video game, and hearing it
 stutter. As for as the program you use to rip, use whatever finds your album info before you rip, tagging individual songs sucks hard, and you really don't want to. Good luck
