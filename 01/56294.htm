<h2>            OneDrive says &#34;signing in&#34; but will not</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can sign into my OneDrive through the web at onedrive.com but I am unable to sign in on my computer to where my file explorer files get instantly updated.&nbsp; I have Windows 10. This is new problem, for the last 2 days, before this was not even an issue.</p>
<p>The onedrive icon does not even appear on my task bar. To make it appear I have to open the actual OneDrive App on my computer but even then when the icon appears it just says "signing in" and never does.</p>
<p>Please help as I need my onefile folder with updated files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mert</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: Also, in the "category" that you want us to fill out below in order to post a question, there is no "OneDrive" category. So I had to go with Windows which also had unrelated subcategories.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Brother HL-2130 printer refuses to print anything - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Brother HL-2130 printer refuses to print anything</h2>
                    <p>I've restarted my laptop and the printer. I've checked to make sure that all the connections are working and everything is on properly. There's no error messages or warning lights on the printer, the paper is full and the toner is nowhere near empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to print PDFs, so I tried printing a blank word document and still nothing. The process that the printer goes through on the laptop is normal, apart from when it's calculating the size and it gets stuck about a third of the way through calculating
 the size of the document. Apart from that, it soon carries on and the print job is 'complete', even though nothing happens, not even a noise that the printer is ready to print.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run troubleshooter and checked to see if I need to install a new driver, and I don't think I do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's literally nothing wrong with anything, and yet it just doesn't do anything.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Kip E.<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Windows.<br />
<br />
I will need some more information to assist you better.<br />
a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you tried using your microphone in different computer?<br />
b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Are you able to get sound with your inbuilt speakers?<br />
<br />
I will suggest you to update the driver for audio and check if you come across the same problem.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Steps to update the audio driver:<br />
i.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, type devmgmt.msc and press enter.<br />
ii.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expand Sound, video and game controllers and right click on the sub item and click update driver.<br />
<br />
For more information on updating a driver for a device that is not working properly, you may visit the link mentioned below:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
If this doesn’t help, I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below:<br />
<br />
Right-click the speaker icon on your taskbar &gt; Select 'Playback Devices'<br />
<br />
In the empty space, Right-click and select both 'Show Disconnected/Disabled Devices'<br />
Do you see icons for your speakers and headphones now?&nbsp; You may need to enable both of these.</p>
<p>You can also try the troubleshooter to discover any connection issues that may exist, instructions are below:</p>
<p>Click 'Start' &gt; Select 'Control Panel'<br />
Type troubleshooting in the top-right search field &gt; Select 'Troubleshooting'<br />
Click 'Hardware and Sound' &gt; Select 'Playing Audio'<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Hope this information is helpful.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Regards,<br />
Sujan – Microsoft Support<br />

<br />
Thank you for your reply.&nbsp; However, I have tried all of the suggestions before and after you made them.&nbsp; I have tried to use older drivers, latest driver and generic drivers.&nbsp; One item I left out of my description is that originally before I tried to solve
 the problem by updating with the latest drivers the speakers worked but not the internal mic or any external mic such as a webcam that I installed.&nbsp; Once updated to the new drivers neither the audio or the&nbsp; mic works.&nbsp; The bubble window on the red x speaker
 in the bar shows "No Audio Output Device Installed".&nbsp; There is also no information on the "levels tab" in either the&nbsp; mic or speakers properties window.<br />

            I just had this problem, maybe because I accidentally put the aux cable into the microphone output instead.&nbsp; But all i did was go into control panel, then hardware and sound, then select: manage audio devices. Under playback push/select the speakers with
 one click then push configure. Did it for me.<br />

            How old is your Thinkpad. If it has a few years behind it, the jack socket may be tarnished. If you've tried all the "tekky" stuff with no luck, then try this - clean the 3.5mm mic jack socket on your laptop, phone or whatever. I experienced the same problems
 as described in all these forums, drivers, configurations, roll back,simple volume control adjustment. After several hours with no luck I decided the internal mic was toast. So I bought an external mic with 3.5mm jack plug from a local electronic shop, plugged&nbsp;
 it in and everything worked as it should - loads of volume. Then unplugged mic and tried with the internal again - loads of volume. So my conclusion was that both the internal and external mics use the same contacts within the laptop jack plug to complete
 the signal circuit. By plugging an external 3.5mm jack plug into the 3.5mm jack socket on the laptop I had effectively cleaned/wiped the contacts. It's been working for two week now. If you have any propriety contact cleaner s

<span>The set I bought is Microsoft Sculpt Ergonomic Wireless Bluetrack Desktop - Keyboard and Mouse (English). This is a set of keyboard, mouse and number
 pad. I accidentally lost the mouse with the USB receiver and in that case I can't use my keyboard and number pad because they all linked to the USB receiver I lost.&nbsp;</span>

    <title>Windows update troubleshooter not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wonderclover48  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows update troubleshooter not working</h2>
                    <p>Four days ago my computer apparently did a reset during a windows update.&nbsp; In the morning everything seemed fine, but when I signed on in the afternoon, many of my apps were missing, bookmarks were missing from Chrome, etc., but my windows 10 system was
 up to date.&nbsp; This led me to believe that a reset happened during an update.&nbsp; In addition I was getting a "80070781" error whenever I tried to logon to Xbox or any of its associated windows 10 games.&nbsp; This morning I somehow got rid of the error and can sign
 on to Xbox and associated games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However the windows update troubleshooter indicates that I have a "Potential Windows Update data base error detected -- Not Fixed" and also a "Windows Update components must be repaired -- Fixed".&nbsp; I get those messages whenever I run the troubleshooter and
 tell it not to uninstall and reinstall the updates.&nbsp; When I tell it to uninstall and reinstall the updates, I get "Fixed" for both messages.&nbsp; However, if I run it again without uninstalling/reinstalling, I get the "Not Fixed" Message for the data base error.&nbsp;
 Obviously the problem that it says was "Fixed" was probably not "Fixed" either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the troubleshooter is not fixing my problem(s).&nbsp; Also it sometimes indicates that I have pending updates, so I sometimes tell it to go ahead and update.&nbsp; Apparently nothing is updated.&nbsp; Windows update says I am up to date and the last update recorded
 was 3/24/2018.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to correct any update file corruption so that I can avoid a future reset.</p>

<p>One way to check on whether you are up-to-date (besides what Windows Update page in settings says) is to retrieve your system's OS Build Number in format XXXXXX.XXX using the winver command, and compare it to the OS Build numbers shown on the Windows Update
 History page&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4043454/windows-10-windows-server-update-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4043454/windows-10-windows-server-update-history</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There are other troubleshooting steps, besides running the troubleshooter, listed in this guide:&nbsp;</span><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Fix
 Windows Update Errors</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>From a personal perspective, when I have encountered failures of monthly windows quality updates (not major feature updates), running the update troubleshooter, no matter whether it reports problems fixed or unfixed, has not immediately fixed update problems
 on my system. That is not a reason not to use it, but I wouldn't take what it reports as definitive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look at the pages for individual updates on the update history page above, you will see that in the known problems for the updates is the update itself causes update errors. It seems like updating problems may get fixed in later updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you look at problems updating windows questions on this site, you will see that fixing Windows Update failures is hit or miss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If my system had an op build number of one of the March or Feb updates, and the system was otherwise operating normally, I would leave things alone until MS pushes down the next month's updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just my 2 cents.</p>

    <title>Train Simulator Content - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikebrady29  say:</h3>
<h2>            Train Simulator Content</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft Train Simulator (MSTS) has been off the market for nearly a decade (since the Activision release disappeared) and closing in on two since MS itself stopped selling it, but it's still the basis for an active enthusiast community. It was the first
 and still, as a single program, most successful train simulator game, partly due to timing and partly to its relatively open attitude toward re-use of scenery and train objects in add-on content. Many add-on routes have been developed, and many (arguably,
 most) of the free ones make use of some objects in the default routes. MSTS provides, in effect, a standard library of objects and trains that are used in add-on content. That requires that one have MSTS installed, of course. To get a copy of MSTS these days
 requires getting either a used copy or a pirated copy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That huge collection of community-developed add-on content for MSTS will never be duplicated in newer train sims, much like with Flight Sim, and some are true works of art. MSTS itself (if you have a copy) requires heroic measures to run in modern versions
 of Windows (especially after 7) - it can't be just installed with any expectation of working correctly, even if the old CDs (especially Disk 2) can be read, and necessary updates are no longer available - and simply doesn't work with certain combinations of
 hardware and Windows 8 or 10. Officially, it's unsupported in Windows after XP. So what's an alternative?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a few commercial train sims that don't use MSTS content and are not compatible with MSTS routes.There's also a open source simulator that runs well in current Windows, and can run most MSTS-based content and routes though moving in different directions
 regarding realism and presentation (new content is beginning to appear for it that is too complex to work in MSTS). In order to use older routes originally designed for MSTS, though, access to the underlying MSTS route and train object libraries is still needed;
 that's a severe limitation for people who only recently have become interested in train sims and can't (legally) get a copy of MSTS. Only commercial and a few recently-released free add-ons avoid MSTS object entanglements, and most of the older free content
 will never be updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's needed (set up a petition? to whom?) to get MS to re-issue MSTS, or at least its underlying scenery and train object libraries, so new users who can't get a legitimate copy of MSTS can run the older add-ons that need them? After more than a decade
 without upgrades or patches, and having removed any support of it from the company website, MS appears to have abandoned this avenue of gaming for itself.</p>

<p>Hi Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I concur entirely with what you've written.&nbsp; &nbsp;Even though I'm not a train sim enthusiast (I use FSX), I can feel your frustration in having a great Sim and then MS, in their wisdom, deciding to halt all further development and production. Fortunately, for
 Flight Sim enthusiasts, we have some other great sims on the market now, so at least some of us die-hard FSXers, will eventually have to succumb to switching over, as newer Operating Systems and cessation of support of the older ones, compel us to 'upgrade'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Probably, as with the Flight Sims, Train Sims can still be bought from online vendors and I even saw this 'free download':</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.old-games.com/download/6717/microsoft-train-simulator" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.old-games.com/download/6717/microsoft-train-simulator</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>which may not be what you're referring to when flexibility for installing add ons, etc. is paramount to enjoying the Sim.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I doubt if any sort of petition to Microsoft will amount to anything.&nbsp; &nbsp;They too have to move forward to where the majority gaming public interest lies, rather than, in their reckoning, trying to 'flog a dead horse' to accommodate a 'few'.</p>
<p>

<p>That looks like the old game, which came on 2 CDs. If it's legit, it's a source, but it's not from MS (and therefore subject to being vanished with extreme prejudice for copyright reasons) and it almost certainly does not include the necessary patches that
 were released about a year after the main game (among other things, removing the DRM that required inserting the CD in order to play the game). I'm not sure I would recommend the site to just anybody.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'm really after is for MS to release the object libraries (tracks, scenery objects, trains - in the Global, Sound, Routes, and Trains folders). Access to the program code itself is no longer necessary because there are (mostly) compatible modern alternatives
 for both the sim and route building, but a lot of free routes require access to the default global and route folders for reuse of objects. Very recent routes and trains may not be dependent like that, but the downside is that they are a lot more work to develop
 (and much more realistic) and therefore are more likely to be payware instead of free. Logically, the newest releases concentrate on the most recent and popular items, leaving a lot of railroads covered only by the older stuff.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could MS put that old content up on Github or some similar place where people could link to it? Wouldn't take much space.

<p>Unless you can get a hold of the MSTS, I really doubt whether MS will ever release their object libraries as singular extractions from their Sim.&nbsp; &nbsp;Enthusiasts will have to make do with current offerings, even as Flt Simmers are also now doing since MS has
 pulled out of Flt Sim development after FSX.&nbsp; &nbsp;Fortunately, Flt simmers are actually getting a better deal all round with a couple of new Flt. Sims available incorporating old FSX-type libraries, which sadly doesn't seem to be the case for train simmers.&nbsp;
 What other way could there be to get those libraries apart from getting a copy of them from an existing MSTS installation?</p>

            Hi BaranPC 
<br />
<br />I am finding it hard to see what you are referring to, if it is that thin line at the bottom of your screen, please try this:
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button)
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your video card and choose Properties
<br />On the Driver Tab, choose 'Roll back Driver'
<br />
<br />Restart your PC once done . . .
<br />
<br />If that does not resolve the issue, go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the video driver they recommend, it may well be an older version to the one you are currently running

                    I've had this problem for about 1 week now and I've tried everything. I have tried to fix it using command prompt:<br />
regsvr32 vbscript.dll
<div>regsvr32 jscript.dll</div>
<div>regsvr32 wmp.dll<br />
<br />
</div>
<div>regsvr32 vbscript.dll is successful but when i do regsvr32 jscript.dll it says that,</div>
<div>&nbsp;" the module 'jscript.dll' may not be compatible with the version of Windows that you are running. Check if the module is compatible with an x86 (32-bit) or x64 (64-bit) version of regsvr32.exe."</div>
<div>I dont know how to do this!! and when i do regsvr32 wmo.dll it says,</div>
<div>"the module 'wmp.dll' was loaded but the call to DllRegisterServer failed with error code 0x8002801c.</div>
<div>For more information about this problem, search online using the error code as a search term."</div>

<h2>            Windows 8 recovery image</h2>
                    Can I make a Windows 8 recovery image and restore it to a new HD if my original fails? Lenovo support say no, that Windows 8 is tied to the original HD and I would have to purchase recovery media from them if outside of warranty. Is that correct?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can't guarantee it , but yes you should be able to do so...</p>
<p>Unless Lenevo has done something to block this, which would defeat the entire purpose of the Recovery Disks in the first place...</p>
<p>The RECOVERY disks you create now should configure a new HDD to your original factory condition...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One issue though... my experience with other machines is that the RECOVERY process won't work moving to a smaller drive such as a SSD. A equal or larger size should work...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another thing you could do would be to create an image of your entire drive with a 3rd party program...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like Acronis TrueImage for doing this, but there are others... If you keep your eye on advertisements, you can sometimes find it on sale cheap...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Acronis WILL restore the image to a smaller drive along with a few more options...</p>

    <title>Idiotic Driver Problem-Creative Xtra - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> juiced  say:</h3>
<h2>            Idiotic Driver Problem-Creative Xtra</h2>
                    I had a problem getting an updated Creative Xtra to become usable on a Win 7 system (code 10 error and it wouldn't let me install the last drivers made for it.)&nbsp; Since I had my winxp system taken apart for a motherboard replacement, I took the drive it
 was loaded on, placed it into a caddy, and plugged it in as an external drive.&nbsp; When the boot window came up, it showed it properly as a duel boot.&nbsp; I went into win7 accidently though I wanted to go to winxp to load more music onto the player.&nbsp; Since I was
 there, I figured to give it one more shot.&nbsp; Failure again of course (Code 10 Cannot start).&nbsp; Since I was already in Device Manager, I tried to do a manual install.&nbsp; Instead of going to where the drivers were stored in Win7, I went to the drive with XP installed
 and pointed it to the drivers there.&nbsp; Imagine my shock when it worked!!!!!!!!&nbsp; Drivers loaded and it was available.&nbsp; Kept it that way for 2 days while waiting for the motherboard to be delivered (properly showed up as a mtp device and continued working through
 several transfers and disconnects/reconnects.)&nbsp; As soon as the motherboard showed up, disconnected the xp drive and rebooted the win 7 system.&nbsp; It would not show up, code 10 bull again.&nbsp; Plugged in the xp drive, duel booted into 7 and it didn't even ask for
 a driver install,&nbsp; the xtra came up automatically.&nbsp; Can someone explain this one to me?<br />
<br />
I already checked the Win7 driver storage,&nbsp; the drivers that were installed from the xp drive are there with the proper date and time stamps for installation.&nbsp; But if I don't have the XP drive connected, it will not find them even when directed to them in the
 win7 driver folder......

            I tried an experiment before putting my xp system back together again.&nbsp; All the items that win7 would not load, I tried to load with xp as a duel boot drive.&nbsp; I directed win7 to the xp driver folders and they installed with no problem (5/7 installed.)&nbsp;
 Unplug the drive, and win 7 couldn't find its ____ with both hands.&nbsp; This is a very strange problem and it looks like it will not be solved (only been 12 hours on my post, but looking up and down the forums at posts not answered gives that impression.)&nbsp; When
 I turn this system off, Winxp pro is getting re-installed on it and win7 is getting tossed in the wasted money box.&nbsp; I may pull it out in a year or so and recheck it, but as of right now I'm considering it a Vista lite (not as many problems at rollout, but
 still has major issue.)

<p><strong><span>Hi Juiced,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>The drivers may have worked as Windows 7 can run older software if installed properly.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>The drivers for a particular hardware are provided by the manufacturer of the device. But as Creative does not have
 updated drivers to be used with Windows 7 you may try downloading and then installing the older drivers for Windows XP in compatibility mode on Windows 7 and check if this helps.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>If a program written for an earlier version of
</span><span><span>Windows</span></span></span><span><span> doesn't run correctly; use the Program Compatibility Wizard to change the compatibility settings for the program.
 To change settings for a program manually, use the individual program's Compatibility tab.<br />
You may refer to the below mentioned link for assistance on compatibility mode-<br />

<p>Sorry it took so long to make a reply.&nbsp; So far, on 3 Creative Xtras, I've only been able to get it to work properly by formatting it and reloading the firmware as playforsure.&nbsp; Windows 7 seems to have the problem that Vista had in picking and choosing what
 drivers it wants to load even under compatibility wizard.&nbsp; I can unzip the drivers into a folder by themselves, direct Win 7 towards it, and Win 7 will not recognize it.&nbsp; Even under compatibility it'd recognize it one sec, and the next time it won't.&nbsp; Playforsure
 was a joke, and for that type of player from that company, it has as good of a chance of "bricking" it as it does installing.&nbsp; So in this case, the cure is as bad as the disease.&nbsp; I have heard (in forums dedicated to the problem) of people able to "force"
 Win 7 to recognize the drive and force it using the compatibility wizard with non-playforsure firmware, but it has trouble staying connected, currupted data on transfer, extremely slow transfer speed. and high cpu loads.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far, the only reliable way to get it to work the way it should is using a XP system with media player removed, install the PFS and non-PFS drivers (as needed), and upgrade the firmware to PFS.&nbsp; Out of the 3 Xtra's and 1 Vision I've done this to, 1 Xtra
 and the Vision "bricked" and 2 Xtra's upgraded.&nbsp; Once you get the playforsure installed, Win7 has no problem recognizing it.&nbsp; Currently working at getting the 2 "bricked" players restored to the point where I can retry a firmware installation.&nbsp; If I had a
 choice, the firmware would not go on the players as it was a waste of space, increased loading times on the player, the risk of bricking, and the fact that it would fight you over the right to play transferred music from your work computer to home computer
 (or vice versa.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Currently, I still have a Win7 partition on my system, but still been using the WinXP and Linux partitions more.&nbsp; I'm not in the mood to upgrade everything attached to my system just to satisfy someone else's whims because of drivers.&nbsp; On another post in
 the hardware forums, I noted Win7's tendecy to not recognize USB portable drives as just that and not require a new authentification every week as the drives cycle between work and home.&nbsp; WinXP seems to recognize it better, and as non-system drives, and doesn't
 require it.&nbsp; The other fact that I can't get a re-issue of a scratched OEM disk seals the deal.&nbsp; I'll keep the Win7 partition on since it's being a pain in the nethersection to replace the disk, but only for playing around with and helping out friends who
 have trouble with their installations.</p>

<h2>            XBOX 12 month pre-paid subscripton code already redeemed</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can not find a place to contact Microsoft about this other than here. I have purchased a code from a retailer and after a month redeeming this since I can now add it to my account (since I have already got it 2 years in advance).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to redeem, it says that it has been used already. I have not done this. My retailer tells me to ask Microsoft. Microsoft, can you help unlock this code or remove it from the person that has it activated so I can have it back? I've not posted it
 anywhere, so unless someone intercepted my email I have no idea how it shows as always redeemed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            You should be aware that every code has an expiration date from the moment it was issued. I don't think support can do anything else but confirm this so your best bet would be to resolve this issue with your retailer

<p>When you say you got the code via email:&nbsp;</p>
<p>What retailer did you buy the code from? Was that an official code retailer (Like for example Amazon, where you can view your code in your customer page, instead of an email), or was that a code selling platform where you get codes cheaper than usual, where
 the retailer buys code cards, rubs them off and sends you a photo of the code or types the code from the card in a mail?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, some code sellers like G4A, Kinguin and the likes that sell codes a lot cheaper than usual, often sell codes from a different country, or are offering a marketplace for individuals to sell their codes there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe the seller that sold you the code through the retailer sold the code again, or something else went wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need to get more information about the code, you would have to contact Xbox support through
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/contact-us</a> and ask them there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, due to privacy concerns, they won't tell you who redeemed the code.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yeah, my retailer was CD-Keys, and they said I had to talk to Microsoft, however I go via the contact us page, but it keeps telling me it's offline so to try again later, or ask in the forums (hence here).</p>
<p>

            The retailer web site (CD-Keys) sends the codes via link in the email, and they resent it me with the codes (I had 2). One worked fine, the other not so... but it was after about a month I tried the codes.

<p>Hi Hemesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What was the error that it said with the second code that did not work?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it says the code was already redeemed you would still need to contact CD-keys and ask for a replacement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also suggest getting in contact with Xbox Supportsince they have proper tools to look into this code error and maybe they can assist you in some way with a proof of purchase.</p>

<p>Thanks Diego, I'll give this a try. Looks like I can speak to someone there now which is good :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>CD-Keys have said the following to me: -</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<span style="color: rgba(43, 46, 47, 1)">I understand your situation. However, once the code is redeemed, it gets linked to the account permanently, and this cannot be undone
 in any way. Our normal policy, like most other retailers, is that we are unable to issue a replacement or refund on used digital goods as they were sent to your email, valid and unused.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(43, 46, 47, 1)">
For any technical issues such as yours, please contact MS support, as they'll be able to better assist."</p>
<p style="color: rgba(43, 46, 47, 1)">
Hopefully MS can find out what the situation is with my code and do something about it.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only people that can resolve this would be the retailer, Since you bough the code through a third party they are the ones responsible for the exchange or refund. Good luck !</p>

<p>It's CD-Keys responsibility to make sure that the code they sell works. I don't think MS support can do anything about this. CD-Keys should provide you with a new code.</p>

            Yes, this is the Windows 7 forum. You would be better posting on the Windows 8 forum for problems with Windows 8. Best of luck.

            Ok so i am set. I got the problem resolved. I used a combination of what ron baker posted with the windows update diagnostic tool on my windows 7 machine. To make a very good point here, when trying to resolve these issues it's advisable to read the error
 codes that you get when updating your system, It's then a simple matter of looking up that code and the fix on microsoft website.
