            The recommendations have not fixed my problems.&nbsp; Neither of my DVD devices are recognized by the operating system.&nbsp; Device manages does not see the devices.&nbsp; Troubleshooting provides no solution to the problem even after being told to reboot after several
 attempts.

<h2>            Bitlocker&#58; Drive is locked out due to marking the selected partition as active.</h2>
                    <p>I have a laptop with windows 10 pro installed and it's D drive is encrypted with bitlocker and unfortunately its recovery key is lost but I have the correct password, a few days ago my brother marked D drive as Active and after restarting the computer it
 didn't booted up, then he reinstalled the windows 10 pro and it was working fine, but D drive was unable to be unlocked with the correct password, then I installed windows 7 pro and after that when I wanted to unlock the drive it shows a message like "<strong>Unable
 to complete the requested operation because of either a catastrophic media failure or a data structure corruption on the disk.</strong>", then I tried many ways and some third party software to repair but no one could help me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I have is just the password but it is not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help and solution that can help me to solve this problem would be highly appreciated, I should say that all of my life is in this drive.</p>
<p>

                    <p>I've tried to search for help on this problem and everything seems several years old. &nbsp;I have windows 10 and videos use to play fine on my laptop, but not anymore. &nbsp;I've tried Edge, Chrome and Firefox. &nbsp;The video sits there with the wheel spinning and it
 says if it doesn't start try restarting your device. &nbsp;I've cleaned out cookies and everything. &nbsp;I did this and it says everything is good.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
There may be several reasons why videos will not load on any of your browsers. To assist you better with your concern, kindly answer the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you experiencing any issues with your Internet connection speed?</li><li>From what specific website are you trying to watch these videos from?</li><li>What happens when you restart your device? Do the videos play afterwards?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward for your response.</p>

<li><em>Are you experiencing any issues with your Internet connection speed?</em></li><li><em>From what specific website are you trying to watch these videos from?</em></li><li><em>What happens when you restart your device? Do the videos play afterwards?</em></li></ul>
<p>As far as I can tell I'm having no issues with the internet speed. &nbsp;I'm wireless on my laptop and that's never been an issue before. &nbsp;I did find my internet speed and it seems to fluctuate between 115.?? to 144.??&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can often watch the same videos on my Kindle, which is what I end up doing most of the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It can be anything. Often it's from Youtube. &nbsp;But I read articles &nbsp;on Flipboard and those videos don't play either. The ones on Facebook are slow to load, but I don't care about those. &nbsp;Usually I try to scroll past them, sometimes it freezes the news feed
 until the video loads and I can move on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I restart the video will play with no sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying.</p>

<p>I may have solved my own problem. &nbsp;So far I've been able to watch 3 videos this morning. &nbsp;I ended up doing the following.</p>
<p>
</p><p>clicked on the "window" icon</p>
<p>
</p><p>typed "device manager" and selected it</p>
<p>
</p><p>in device manager I found my sound card and speakers. &nbsp;I right clicked on the sound card and selected update driver. &nbsp;That was up to date. &nbsp;I did the same for my speaker (at least I think that's my speaker) and there was an update for it. &nbsp;After it finished
 installing I reboot my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the same for my graphics card and there was no update for it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopefully this will help others if they run into this problem. &nbsp;Windows 10 is new to me, so I'm still trying to figure how to find things like the device manager.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; Yes I mean the Tablet PC Input Components.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wacom drivers are updated via the manufacturer's website.&nbsp; But my problem is that right click functionality seem to be over wrighted by the defaults Windows 10 tablet input commands, so right click on my pen has an odd behaivour, some times it doen't do
 anything at all, and other times, click is registered at another point in the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same thing happened with Windows 7.&nbsp; Back then I've solved it by disabling the table PC input via Control Panel / Programs and Settings / Turn windows features on and off / Tablet PC Optional Components.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10 there is not that option available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot.</p>

    <title>Transfer an upgraded retail copy of Windows 7 to a new PC Build&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> atmofunk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Transfer an upgraded retail copy of Windows 7 to a new PC Build&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Here's my situation:<br />
<br />
1) I bought a retail version of Windows 7 years ago, when it first came out, and installed on a new PC.<br />
2) When Windows 8 came out, I purchased the $39 upgrade.<br />
3) When Windows 8.1 came out, I upgraded through the windows store.<br />
4) When Windows 10 came out, I upgraded through the media creation tool.<br />
<br />
This&nbsp;was all on the same PC.<br />
<br />
Now, i'd like to transfer my copy of Windows (10)&nbsp;to a brand new PC build, and deactivate the version I have sitting on my old computer.<br />
<br />
As far as I know, my original purchase (<em>RETAIL</em> Windows 7) is applicable for the transfer, but I have no idea&nbsp;if all these successive upgrades since then have changed that.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know where I stand here?</p>

            <p>If you format and leave that PC that you did all that on (the motherboard) with NO Windows OS at all and transfer the Windows 7 license to the new computer and then upgrade directly to Windows 10 (if that is your end-desire) - you will have a new license
 for Windows 10 tied to that RETAIL license of Windows 7 based off the hardware in that new machine (and that Windows 10 license cannot move if it is the FREE upgrade.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does not FREE up the Windows 7 license. &nbsp;As long as Windows 10 (free upgrade) is running on that machine that you upgraded (even eventually) from that Windows 7 retail license - that Windows 7 retail license is tied up. &nbsp;If you build another machine
 before July 29, 2016 and want to do it again - you'd remove the Windows OS from the current machine and install it on the new one and then upgrade to Windows 10 for free there and you'd have another license specific to that hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the free Windows 10 license tied to the HARDWARE <em><strong>and</strong></em> the original FULL license you had. &nbsp;(The Windows 8/8.1 license is tied to the Windows 7 license alone. &nbsp;You could move it in a similar fashion (with the Windows 7 license),
 and it is not 'tied' to the hardware much like the Windows 7 retail license is not.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>So - you would really be transferring the Windows 7 license and getting the free upgrade to Windows 10 - leaving the original system with NO Windows OS at all. &nbsp;You can easily skip the Windows 8/8.1 path to get to Windows 10. &nbsp;You WILL have to perform the
 UPGRADE installation however, to make it work.</p>

    <title>Why does installing Golden Alwafi add An Arabic-Saudi Arabia language - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a cooperator  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does installing Golden Alwafi add An Arabic-Saudi Arabia language only on the language bar&#63;</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
<div>
<div>Whatever the added/installed input languages on the control panel are, I really found out that installing Golden Alwafi alawys results in adding an Arabic-Saudi Arabia only on<strong> the language bar</strong>,&nbsp; and not on the
<strong>installed input languages </strong>in control panel.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1e2d5a77-f70b-42f8-861a-f30a0dca3ca5" /></div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5c734f2f-1c6a-4028-8f3a-01771fffa587" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b66e79c5-d9ff-482e-9e6b-bee1aa8a3dff" /></p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Also, this language "Arabic (Saudi Arabia)" is only still activated and shown on the language bar whenever the Golden Alwafi program&nbsp;is&nbsp;opened.&nbsp;'Arabic Saudi Arabia'&nbsp;keeps functioning, and enabled in Language bar&nbsp;even if I have closed the program. To let
 it inactivated and unshown, I must log off and then log in again.&nbsp; Although there are only two languages (English(US), and Arabic(Yemen) are&nbsp;added in the input language in control panel, and the&nbsp;current location is 'Yemen'(Screen shots above),&nbsp;when I needed
 to change&nbsp;the&nbsp;text&nbsp;input from&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;Arabic </strong>to <strong>English</strong>, I would need to press on&nbsp;left/right 'Alt+Shift' twice. However,&nbsp; when I needed to&nbsp;convert from
<strong>English </strong>to <strong>Arabic, </strong>I would need to press once&nbsp;on left/right&nbsp;'Alt+ Shift'.</p>
</div>
<p>Yes, it is reasonable to convert from <strong>Arabic</strong> to <strong>English
</strong>I would need to press twice on left/right 'Alt+Shift' </p>
<p>since there are two Arabic input languages are shown in the language bar, however, only one English input language is there. But what is not reasonable is why only the Saudi Arabic Language is added/enabled/functioned in the language bar whenever Golden
 Alwafi is opened, and it is not added in the input language in the control panel? As long as&nbsp;Arabic (Saudi Arabia) is not added in the input language in control panel, I think pressing on left/right 'Alt+shift' once&nbsp;&nbsp;must convert from
<strong>Arabic to English.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>This is most strange thing. So, I am expecting that Golden Alwafi is specifically&nbsp;designed to the Saudi Arabia since whenever it is opened the Saudi Arabic language is shown, enabled, functioned&nbsp;in the language bar, although it is not added in the input
 language in control panel. The solution I only found is to disable Arabic (Saudi Arabia)(let it unshown in language bar) is log off, and log in again or even restart my Windows. When I do that, and Arabic(Saudi Arabia) got unshown in the language bar, then&nbsp;
 to&nbsp;convert from <strong>Arabic</strong> to <strong>English </strong>I would only need to press&nbsp;once on left/right&nbsp;'Alt+Shift'
</p>

            <p>Windows Mail sometimes gets the settings corrupt.&nbsp; First make sure the account is working by loggin on via webmail.&nbsp; If that works okay, then remove the mail account from Windows Mail.&nbsp; Then compact and repair the WinMail database (<a href="http://www.oehelp.com/WMUTil/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.oehelp.com/WMUTil/</a>)
 and then add the mail account back again and see if that fixes it.&nbsp; If not, contact clara.net and ask for assistance.</p>

<h2>            Setting up a task triggers &#40;scheduler&#41; in windows 7. Advanced event &#61; booting off a NAS </h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I am looking for a good tutorial on the TASK SCHEDULAR of windows 7 (especially about: trigger events). The reason why? is because i want to make a script run whenever i turn on my NAS. I have my NAS usually turned off to conserve power. (and money!) Whenever
 i turn on my nas the unc-path (ex: \\NAShome\openshare) becomes visable on my network. That's the moment that i want to sync the contents off my external harddrive to the NAS.<br />
<br />
Do you know where i can find the necessary information? (or perhaps you have a different syggestion?)

<h2>            WHERE IS MY WARRANTY REPLACEMENT &#40;&#43;2 weeks on&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I'm so aggrevated by Microsoft's POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I contacted Microsoft Support on 20th February regarding my broken Surface Book 2 and the laptop was collected for repair the following day (21st Feb) At the time Microsoft representatives told me that a replacement would be delivered to me within 2-3 working
 days which should've been the end of that week or early the following week THE LATEST.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following week still no laptop and worst of all <strong>NO follow up </strong>
whatsoever from Microsoft.</p>
<p><strong>23rd Feb: </strong>write an email to Surface Support asking for tracking number on my laptop.
<span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)"><strong>NO RESPONSE</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>26 Feb: </strong>send another email asking for update. Finally receive email reply saying the laptop should arrive by 2nd March THE LATEST (rep name Jamie); that's it.</p>
<p><strong>2 Mar: <span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">NO LAPTOP, NO TRACKING NUMBER, NO FOLLOW UP FROM MS</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">2 Mar: </span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Once again call Microsoft, wait an +1 hour on the phone to get to a representative who after I explain the situation get cut off from the phone, they don't call back and
 I need to call in again, wait again and explain again. This represnetative (Grace B.) says she will follow up on case personally and follow back on Monday (5 Mar) with an update.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>5 Mar:&nbsp;</strong>Surprise surprise NO UPDATE,</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>6 Mar: </strong>Call thru again, am told that a superior officer will take the call after long explanation; superior officer who takes the call is Jamie who replied to my email on 26 Feb. I start talking and within a few
 minutes the phone is disconnected. No call back. When I call back again about an hour later, I somehow manage to get hold of Jamie again, he told me he tried calling back but phone was engaged (not possible - wasn't on any of my phones, PLUS they all have
 call waiting). He now says to me my case has been escalated as of yesterday and we should start to see some action.
</span><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)"><strong>WHY DID CASE ESCALATION TAKE OVER 2 WEEKS
</strong></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">when laptop was supposed to be back in

<p>
</p><p><strong><em><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">I've now also been told that the reason I don't have a replacement is because support team is out of stock even though clearly on the Microsoft website my model spec has plenty of stock and

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">No one will ever know, but worst part is now he says that with case ecalation the "case escalation department" will take over and there's

<p>
</p><p>We pay a <span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)"><strong>very pretty dollar </strong></span>for these top spec surface books (I bought the top line SB2 with 1TB with GTX1060) and so I'm sure you understand that

<strong><span style="color: rgba(215, 57, 0, 1)">TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE</span> </strong>given that the return time was stated as 2-3 days before I submitted for warranty. What makes matters worse is the lack of response from Microsoft. None of the employees are willing to
 disclose a staff number just their first name at most or with an initial which lacks any way of property identifying them. As a result there is a total lack of accountability for actually taking care of support.

            Ditch it and get a lenovo or something different. Its obvious to me that Microsoft should not be in the PC hardware business. My friends told me I was crazy for buying a SB2 after they had nothing but problems with their SB1. Some even work for Microsoft
 and say do not buy Microsoft hardware. Pretty sad that Microsoft can't get their act together.

</p><p>I dont know if I would call it amazing hardware... tons of hardware/firmware issues with their first generation and looks like a new batch with their second generation... maybe some can be attributed to windows 10 but some are surface-specific either with
 the hardware or firmware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Their answer every time I contact support is run the diagnostic tool and when that does not work to go to a store for an exchange. They do not do any troubleshooting or escalations and admitted such to me.</p>

</p><p>Unfreaking believable! Try tweeting to Panos Panay. I've already decided that as soon as the new chips from Intel (the ones that have the Meltdown and Spectre fixes) are out, I am dumping my SB2 and going back to Lenovo. I dont think I have had a single
 day without issues on my SB2 since I got it in November.</p>

    <title>How can I re-activate XP Home Edition Version 2002 in VMware - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> purplesnow  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I re-activate XP Home Edition Version 2002 in VMware</h2>
                    <p>Since support for XP has ended, I decided to get a Lenovo ThinkPad Tablet 8 with Windows 8.1 Pro. However, there are many things that I don't want to lose on my old XP desktop (completely legal) which I am scrapping, so I created a VHD file from it, converted
 this to VMDK and created a virtual machine in VMware on the tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was successful but, as expected, I needed to activate Windows again.</p>
<p>Online activation failed, so I tried telephone activation and keyed in the supplied Installation ID, but was told that it cannot be activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sadly, I can't seem to find any way to get further information on this on the web site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else tried this? If so can you give me any advice on how to deal with the problem?</p>

            <p>Was the version on your old desktop retail (i.e., installed from a Windows XP CD that you bought) or OEM (i.e., preinstalled when you bought the desktop)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the latter, you're SOL:&nbsp; OEM licenses are tied to the machine on which the OS was first installed.</p>

            Hi Andy
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Microsoft has officially ended support for Windows Mobile devices and has encouraged customers to switch to a different mobile platform such as iOS (iPhone) or Android. Facebook has native apps for those platforms and they are super packed with features and functionality. 
<br />
<br />My personal take, you don't need the most expensive Android to run Facebook and Microsoft has released an app called Arrow that makes your Android phone more Microsoft like, if you prefer that.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>In Google Store the name is Microsoft Launcher … the best way is to use Settings/Phone in W10 as it's necessary to link your phone to your Microsoft account using assistant app that gives access to MS universe keeping access to Google universe … the best
 of two worlds even on a modest android phone.</p>

            All very well but when you have invested good money into a phone like the lumia 950xl and the phone works perfectly on windows 10 and Microsoft edge why would I buy an android ? Not everybody gets phones for free with a their network provider.

            That is very true Andy, but Microsoft has not control over platforms and apps like Facebook and where they choose to invest support. Right now, Facebook is invested in Android and iOS because that is where the larger user bases are.

<h2>            WLAN &#38; Wired AutoConfig not working</h2>
                    I am running Windows Vista Home Premium 32bit<br />
V. 6.0 service pack 2. on a Dell Inspiron 1720<br />
<br />
I am having trouble getting on to the internet. <br />
I have spent all day trouble shooting and it seems<br />
like there is a problem with the Wired and WLAN AutoConfig service.<br />
They are not starting.<br />
<br />
When I connect to the internet directly through the cable or wifi it does nothing.<br />
When I hover over the network icon it says Connection status: unknown. The dependency service or group failed to start.<br />
When I click on diagnose and repair, the problems that come up are..<br />
<br />
Restart the DHCP client service<br />
Start Windows Wireless Service<br />
Automatically get new IP settings for the network adapter "Local Area Connection"<br />
&nbsp;Clicking on those does nothing.<br />
<br />
Again, think it has to do with the WLAN and Wired autoConfig services.<br />
What can I do to fix this?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>You installed XP from XP SP2 media and Windows Updates says you need to install SP2? Or did you mean
<strong><u>SP3</u></strong>?</p>
<p>You uninstalled SP2? If you installed from media that was for XP SP2 you could not do this, you could only re-install XP at the SP2 level, i.e. it would not be possible to revert the installation to SP1A, SP1 or no service pack.</p>
<p>Regardless of what I perceive as ambiguities in your question, I am hoping that what I have written below may assist to get SP3 installed.&nbsp;I have included steps that, if you did install from an XP&nbsp;SP2 installation CD will not be necessary.</p>
<p><span>So first verify your current service pack level...</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Hold down the Windows key (between Ctrl and Alt) and hit the Pause Break key</span>
</li><li><span>Examine what is listed in the System: section</span> </li></ul>
<p><span>I am hoping that this reports SP2, If it does, skip to the SP3 download link.</span></p>
<p><span>If there is no service pack level designated, first you must download SP2 from...</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=28" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=28</a></span></p>
<p><span>...and then run the downloaded program to install SP2.</span></p>
<p><span>As an alternative to SP2 you could download SP1A </span><span>(xpsp1a_en_x86.exe)</span><span> from…</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://slug.ceca.utc.edu/ftp/pub/windows/patches/winxp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://slug.ceca.utc.edu/ftp/pub/windows/patches/winxp/</a></span></p>
<p><span><span>…which a fellow contributor <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/5a8f0406-1930-485b-a7f1-796a68549081">
<span>Daavee</span></a> found.</span></span><span> It is half the size of SP2 so should be quicker. However, as you can see, it is not a Microsoft web site.</span></p>
<p><span>Once you have done that, or if you were already at service pack 1, 1A or 2, then install SP3 by downloading and running from...</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=24</a></span></p>
<p><span>For&nbsp;the <em>Microsoft</em> links above&nbsp;you can ignore the text that says that it is for network installations and also ignore the text advising Windows/Microsoft Update if only updating one PC.</span></p>
<p><span>Then try and get up to date with Windows Updates.</span></p>

<h2>            I cannot delete a folder in ApplData&#92;Roaming.oit</h2>
                    <div>After moving to Windows 10 several weeks ago I have had this problem in my backup data files. I use GoodSync to sink my user data from drive C to drive L. I get an error when I sink the 2 drives that the path to: L:\wfox\Users From Office 1\Wayne\AppData\Roaming\.oit
 folder has an invalid path. When I tried to delete that folder (on drive L:) in Windows Explorer it gives me the same error. I have also gone into CMD and attempted to delete the folder and get&nbsp;an error.</div>
<div>This is not a problem except that my backup completes with errors. Now I must go into the log and sift through the log file to determine which files did not back up correctly.</div>
<div>Any ideas?</div>
<div>Thanks Wayne <br />

<h2>            Cannot link Iphone</h2>
                    <p>I installed the latest version of Windows 10 tonight.&nbsp; From Edge's welcome page, there was a button to link my phone.&nbsp; It sent me to a black screen with "Your Phone" at the top (see image below).&nbsp; I clicked the "+" sign to add my phone.&nbsp; It sent a prompt
 via text message to my IPhone (8 Plus) to install Edge.&nbsp; While installing Edge, Microsoft prompted to send a security code to my email, which I did.&nbsp; After that, it installed Edge.&nbsp; And stopped.&nbsp; There are not other prompts are anything else to indicate how
 to link my phone and my computer. &nbsp; So, I have Edge installed on my IPhone (8 Plus), but the black screen looks exactly like the one below. &nbsp; What do I do now to link my phone?????&nbsp; Hey Microsoft - NOT USER FRIENDLY!!!!! FIX THIS!!!!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you tell us what error message are you receiving on your computer and on your phone? Usually, when you connect your iPhone on your computer, you can access all of its content on your computer using File Explorer. It works just like when you connect say
 a USB Flash Drive to your computer. Your iPhone should be available on the menu and you can explore your iPhone folders to view your photos and other items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to OneDrive on iOS, you may need to download the OneDrive application from the AppStore and sign in using your Microsoft account. This way, you can sync your files from your iPhone to your OneDrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>

            There was no error message - it was just showing the iPhone drive as empty. &nbsp;It finally started working &nbsp;- I connected it today (via the cord), and after the iPhone prompted me to trust the computer, it finally recognized the DCIM folder in the iPhone
 drive (but no documents). &nbsp; The only new thing is the latest update of Windows 10, which must have fixed it. &nbsp; However, there is still no connection via Bluetooth other than the computer picking up where I have searched on Edge. &nbsp; I already had Onedrive installed
 on the iPhone with my account, so that solution doesn't work.

<p>In terms of fully syncing your iPhone to your Windows 10 PC, you may need to install the iTunes program to your computer, according to our research. Regarding this, you need to go to the Apple support site to check their article since the iTunes program
 is not developed by Microsoft, we cannot give you the exact steps on how to use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Talking about the Bluetooth connection, seems like you are also trying to connect your phone with this method as well. Resources shows that connecting the iPhone and the computer is just the same process as connecting any other devices via pairing of Bluetooth.
 By any change, have it also shown you any specific errors when pairing to Bluetooth? Kindly check the link provided here for additional assistance:

</p><p>In addition, you might want to check with Apple as well. While doing our research, we have found few forum threads from their support site regarding the same issue. Some users claim to have it resolved when they called Apple support and was asked to remove
 every Apple program, used CCleaner to clean the Apple program registry keys, and a manual reinstallation of the said programs without the iPhone connected yet to the computer. We cannot speak on behalf of Apple support, so it will be one of our recommendations
 to seek support as well to them.</p>

<h2>            computer disk hardware configuration</h2>
                    <p>Full message: "Windows could not start because of a computer disk hardware configuration problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Could not read from the selected boot disk. Check boot path and disk hardware.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Please check the Windows documentation about hardware disk configuration and your hardware reference manuals for additional information. "</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello, I'm currently running win8 and I have received this message after the BIOS and I'm unable to proceed. I have looked up solutions on how to fix this problem, but all the solutions I've come across are for win7 and older, and are completely irrelevant
 to win8.</p>
<p><br />
I have also tried using the Win8 installation CD for troubleshooting as well. And picking all the options I could non of them worked,</p>
<ul>
<li>Refresh your PC, gets the error: "The drive where Windows is installed is locked. Unlock the drive and try again."</li><li>Reset your PC; this option is out of the question, I have too much important data stored for this to happen.</li><li>System restore, gets the error: "To use System Restore, you must specify which Windows installation to restore. Restart this computer, select an operating system, and then select System Restore." The OS is locked so I can't pick this option.</li><li>System Image Recovery; I don't have any images anywhere so I can't pick this option either.</li><li>Automatic Repair: This option I have had some trouble with. The first time I ran this option it came back with a message saying something about "There is nothing to fix," I don't remember exactly what it said. I tried running it a couple more times afterwards
 and now all it does is just restart the pc and load the disk again.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After trying these options I suspected there might have been a virus on the computer, and that's why the drive was locked. But I had a USB with Windows Defender Offline on it and I ran that and did a quick and full scan and it didn't find anything. I'm still
 skeptical on this though.</p>
<p><br />
Another thing I tried doing that was odd was when I went into the BIOS to change it to boot up to the HDD, instead of receiving the initial error message, I now receive "Reboot or Select proper Boot device, or Insert Boot Media in selected Boot device and press
 a key." Now I realized that this is because it can't find an OS on the drive so it's now running my 2nd boot option, the ROM. I'm confused though to why I cannot replicate the initial error message.</p>
<p><br />
This is all I have done so far and I'm now stuck on what options I have left. Thanks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did you try the Startup Repair on the installation DVD?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might try this Boot Repair and see if it helps...</p>
<p>If your drive is actually locked, this may not work....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might try looking in your bios for a Secure Boot feature, and disable it if it is turned on...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p>1. Put the Windows installation disc in the disc drive, and then start the computer.
</p>
<p>2. Press a key when the message indicating "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD …". appears.</p>
<p>3. Select a language, a time, a currency, and a keyboard or another input method, and then click Next.
</p>
<p>4. Click Repair your computer. </p>
<p>5. Click the operating system that you want to repair, and then click Next. </p>
<p>6. In the System Recovery Options dialog box, click Command Prompt. </p>
<p>7. Type BOOTREC /FIXMBR, and then press ENTER. </p>
<p>8. Type BOOTREC /FIXBOOT, and then press ENTER. </p>

<p><strong>Hi,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I am using acer aspire notebook 5720 with&nbsp;mobile intel(r) 945 express chipset family and&nbsp;</strong><strong>Intel(R) PRO/Wireless 3945ABG Network Connection on windows 7 ultimate.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Of late my wifi is not detecting wifi signal. Internet is working perfectly fine with the cable. Also all other laptops at home are able to detect it with no problem.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I updated my driver and its running version 13.3.0.137. But still networks were not being detected. Then i had to roll back to a driver of last year and it started detecting and working for sometime. But this kept disconnecting and i had to disable/enable
 each time to get networks again.</strong></p>
<p><strong>With the updated driver i tried reinstalling multiple times and update driver but still no network was being detected. In Services, "wlan autoconfig" shows as started and automatic.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Please let me know how to fix the problem.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thank you,</strong></p>

<p>Hey there Dr kabab11,</p>
<p>I'm sorry to hear about the issue. I would suggest taking it back to the retailer you purchased it from, like what DeathBladez808 posted about. In the future since this thread is a bit old and the original poster most likely has already been taken care of,
 I would suggest creating a new thread detailing what you're experiencing.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p><span><span>Thank you for posting.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The thumbs.db is a system file.<span>&nbsp; </span>You can hide it by hiding system files but you cannot get rid of it permanently.</span></span></p>
