<h2>            How to remove the icons from the Start menu.</h2>
                    <p>I have two sets of 12 tile blocks&nbsp;on my start screen making it very difficult to get to my email client, Outlook 2007. How do get rid of these two sets of tile and get back to a normal start screen without tile. Every time I can get to my email program and
 delete a message I don't want it closes the program into the system tray. I don't need that either.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you would like to remove the tiles from the Start menu, you should right click on the desired app that you would like to remove and select

<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you also like to turn off the notification for the mail, you may follow the below steps:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Type Notifications in the Searchbar and select Notifications and action center.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Select the option “Select which icons appear on the taskbar”.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Turn off the Action center notification, so that the notification no longer be appearing in the Action center.</span></p>

            <p>Right click each one to Unpin from Start.&nbsp; Once they are all gone, the Start menu will resize from the right to a smaller size - it's expandable for those who want to pin Apps from the All Apps menu.&nbsp; Those are just starter Apps to sample.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I set up a new install, I unpin most of those and group together Mail, Weather, News, Finance news, People, Photos, Skype, MS Solitaire, mainly to see recent activity in each of those updated on the Live Tile.&nbsp; I also right click the Mail, News, Weather,
 Photos to make them double sized to see more information.&nbsp; You can pop all your webmail into the Mail app (with a large ad-free reading pane), click on the others to choose News, Photos, Weather preferences.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those who I have set it up for like this seem to like those apps and want to keep them.&nbsp; I suggest to them on rainy days to explore more apps in the All Apps menu to find others they may like and want pinned for easy access.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't want any Apps you can also delete them all.&nbsp; Most can also be uninstalled from the right click Menu.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>More choices for folders to include on the Start Menu (like Windows 7) can be found in Settings&gt;Personalization&gt;Start Menu&gt;Choose Files and Folders to Display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps! </p>

            Hi Scott,<br />
<br />
Thank you for bringing this up. There are several possible reasons as to why you're getting a mouse acceleration issue after installing the latest Windows Update on your computer. In some cases, this could possibly due to a corrupted file on your computer that
 affects the mouse acceleration. Can you tell us if the issue occurs in other games? If so, I suggest that you run the
<em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027322/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Update troubleshooter</a></strong></em> on your computer to scan and repair the recent Windows Update files on your
 computer. There's a possibility that it got corrupted on your computer. Also, please make sure that your drivers are also updated. You may refer to this
<em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong></em> on how to update drivers on your computer.<br />
<br />
Do get back to us with the results. We'd be more than willing to provide you additional help.

    <title>Bluetooth issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gonzoez  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth issue</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I have a Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit, HP Pavillion Elite. I also have a IOGear Bluetooth USB adapter (GBU-421) and cant make them work together.</p>
<p>When I insert the bluetooth adapter, windows installs the drivers, but one of them fails to install. In "Devices and Printers" i can see the adapter and it shows a yellow triangle on it. When I open the properties, there are two problems I can see:<br />
1) First line in Hardware tab in properties says "Bluetooth L2CAP Interface" and the in properties for it it says "Windows cannot verify the digital signature for the drivers required for this device. A recent hardware or software change might have installed
 a file that is signed incorrectly or damaged, or that might be malicious software from an unknown source. (Code 52):" When I'm trying to update the driver, it says that the best driver for this device is already installed.</p>
<p>2) I have an "Unknown Device" in the list at the "Hardware" in bluetooth properties. When I'm trying to update driver for it it says that windows found driver for Bluetooth device(RFCOMM protocol TDI) but failed to install it due to "Insufficient System
 Resources exist to complete the requested service".</p>
<p>Also, when I'm trying to add a bluetooth device (JBL Stereo Audio) the system finds the device, but when I'm double-click on it's icon in (the headset icon) system shows the message "An error occured when initializing this device. Try restarting your computer
 and/or the Bluetooth device".</p>
<p>I tried drivers from IOGear (bluetooth manufacturer) website, from Broadcom's webiste, and even from Lenovo's Website. Nothing helps.</p>
<p>On a side note - the same adapter works perfectly on my Netbook with Win7 Home Premium 32-bit. With the default drivers from IOGear's webiste.</p>
<p>Any help, ideas,and suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Don't think that HP support will be able to help - this PC came with windows Vista and I upgraded it to Win7 myself with clean install.</p>
<p>IOGear support is completely useless (although very polite) - i contacted them and all they could do was "we can refer you to our partners, who can get remote access to your computer and try to fix it for a small fee of $32.99". With the price of the Bluetooth
 adapter much less than that it doesn't worth it.</p>
<p>There is a lot of info in your reply which I greatly appreciate. It will take me some time to read it all and try all of the advices. I start to think now, that it might have something to do with the fact that I uninstalled Bluesoleil and Eset Nod shortly
 before I tried to connect this new Bluetooth Adapter. But it's just a guess.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you very-very much for the&nbsp; fast and very informative reply. I almost gave up on it, but now I have more info to and will keep trying to fix it.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
HP Support might have some info anyway. Especially check for drivers and on-line documentation<br />
for your system which might also help. And the HP forums can help as there probably some there<br />
that had or are having similar issues. Do not rule this source of help out just because you upgraded<br />
on your own. Those that made the hardware or have the same hardware are invaluable sources.<br />
<br />
i.e. HP often has Alerts on the driver and FAQ pages for their systems.<br />

<p>Hi again,</p>
<p>I tried all of your advices, but nothing helps so far... However, I found that I'm not the only one who has this problem (with RFCOMM Protocol TDI). There are few more individuals struggling to use the Bluetooth under Windows 7. That issue is not yet resolved.
 Could you may be take a look here:</p>

<p>If you have any thoughts on this (mostly in regards to how to reinstall windows networking protocols etc) I would greatly appreciate it,&nbsp;because&nbsp;reinstalling windows every time something goes wrong is very annoying :)</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for all your suggestions and ideas.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Sure seems like its a driver issue and not the fault of Windows 7. One problem some are<br />
having is that though there are Windows 7 drivers for most devices there are either none<br />
or poorly written ones offered by some system/device makers for BlueTooth on Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Best advice is to disable/remove the present BlueTooth and find a 3rd party replacement<br />
that will work.<br />

<p>I could agree, that windows 7 bluetooth stack is not the top of the line, but I don't think Broadcom's drivers are poorly written... And yet they don't work for me. The weird thing is that they work perfectly on my netbook which also runs Windows 7 (32-bit
 however), but do not work completely on my 64-bit system. And also this BT adapter worked fine on the XP system, so it's not the adapter to blame.</p>
<p>The problem is that there is something wrong with installing RFCOMM protocol TDI, which doesn't want to install no matter what i do and with the connection to a bluetooth headset, which windows 7 can see, can install drivers, but doesn't want to connect
 (in fact it doesn't even open the window called "Bluetooth headset operations and setup"). And the main problem is that there seem to be absolutely no way to reset all those Bluetooth related drivers to the original state other than clean install. Even repair
 install (which I just did) doesn't help.</p>
<p>The only way left to try - is to try to install BlueSoleil drivers, but they are no free to use, and also cannot guarantee that it will work. And I think that the fact that after paying for Windows and paying for Bluetooth adapter I have also pay for some
 drivers just because neither microsoft nor bluetooth manufacturer don't provide sufficient tech support is not quite fair.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for all your input in trying to solve this issue. May be one day someone will come up with a solution to this problem)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>There have been instances where Norton, McAfee, AVG, TrendMicro and other antivirus/security<br />
programs have caused BlueTooth issues. Which of those do you run and have you tried uninstalling<br />
them and running the maker's removal tools to prevent remnants (disabling them will not stop<br />
them from loading pieces of themselves into memory). Be sure to use the appropriate Removal<br />
Tool and/or special instructions from the System maker.</p>

<p>I used to run ESET Smart Security, but i removed it prior to first (or may be second) attempt of Bluetooth installation (using the same crazy "Manual" way described in the link that you provided) and installed Microsoft Security Essentials (i tried to install
 the drivers both, before I installed MSE and after).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyway, I couldn't come up with any other possible way to fix this problem, so I just installed BlueSoleil drivers and they worked fine for Bluetooth audio from the beginning, and after some minor tweaking I was even able to set up a PAN network with Bluesoleil
 drivers. So as of right now issue is... Don't want to say solved... well, not an issue anymore :) (except for the money paid for bluesoleil)</p>
Thanks a lot for your time and attention to this issue and for all the info provided. I do appreciate your help.

<p>Very interesting where 4th party drivers worked when the built-in and 3rd party would not.<br />
Sort of says something about the quality control of the device makers you are trying to run.<br />
<br />
Very good sorting that out!<br />

                    I have my old hard drive hooked up to a new PC with Windows 10 via an external hard drive adapter. I am repeatedly denied access to the files. I followed one of your old posts and changed the advanced security settings (though not sure I did it correctly)
 now the message is still a denial but it also says "failed to enumerate object in container" Please help! Thank you

            Its possible the USB adapter you are using is not powerful enough to drive the external hard disk. You need to connect directly to the USB port or a faster USB 3.0 port.

<p>
</p><p>then check the Administrator(s) permissions, if they are read and write only, delete it and ADD a new user and add admins back into the list of users with full permissions.</p>
<p>

<br />
IE11 and Edge Smart Screen Filter stops the download and marks it Unsafe. <br />
<br />
Scan it for malware and put it on OneDrive or another site such as MediaFire.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

It still will not download via IE11 or Edge due to a Smart Screem Filter security issue so I can't touch it.<br />

As I said try putting it on OneDrive, MediaFire, or other sites.<br />

<div>Probably caused by : dxgkrnl.sys ( dxgkrnl!DXGADAPTER::SetPowerComponentActiveCBWorker+2b0 )</div>
<br />
dxgkrnl.sys is a Windows component which means something else drove it into Fault.<br />
<br />
Nothing else in the minidump helped.<br />
<br />
This could be the video drivers, the games. memory, or other issues.<br />
<br />
Do all you can to troubleshoot the problem and then run Driver Verifier.<br />

</strong>Drivers could be at fault however disk issues or antivirus/antispyware/security

products are&nbsp;just as likely to be the root cause as they can force a driver to <br />

be very suspect.<br />
<br />
Be sure the drivers, BIOS, and low level chipset drivers are all updated by <br />
manually checking&nbsp;at the System maker and device makers' sites.<br />

tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
heck manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

====================================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks&nbsp;that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory.&nbsp;So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to&nbsp;show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<p>Chipset Vendor - ATI. </p>
<p>Chipset Model - ID5833. </p>

                    Hello, On Monday evening I googled Facebook Technical Support and found this phone number - 1-888-275-2174, which came back as "techgeeks'. I later found out that this fraudulent foreign (probably India) fake f******* Phone Number simply led to my Nightmare.
 They stated that they were Microsoft Technicians, and I requested verification of that. They said look at the Microsoft Logo at the top of our Logo certifying that we are Microsoft Technicians, therefore, I permitted them to 'interconnect' with me which ultimately
 turned out to be a Bad Mistake. I was calling in reference to a Facebook glitch, and the number above 'popped up i'n a random Google search. These genius hackers went through my Computer to the Nether World which I had never seen before. They were like 'Speedy
 Gunsallus' and I couldn't keep up with these super brilliant Indians from India. Then they said&nbsp;'your system is fixed', and said Goodbye. Well, within seconds after that Attack on my computer from 'Left Field',

    <title>Why does Win10 support only 3 monitors&#59; when Win7 supported at - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fred_4_monitors  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does Win10 support only 3 monitors&#59; when Win7 supported at least 4&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I used two video cards and four monitors (see below) for a year or so on Win7, without any issues. The PnP software setup the 4 monitors without any issues, and very little input from me. They easily configured to a left to right window progression, and
 the setup worked very well by expanding the available desktop. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After Win 10 installation, no matter what I did only three of the monitors will display. All four would work, but only three monitors at any one time. If I rearrange the input over the six available connections, they would all work, but still only three
 monitors at any one time. I have updated to the latest drivers for all devices. The windows update is set to automatic.</p>
<p>Why does the upgraded Windows 10operating system only support three monitors, when Win 7 did so well with all four.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you are not using the same driver that Win 10 chooses to install, it will reinstall it's choice of driver</p>
<p>when you reboot after installing your driver of choice.</p>
<p>- Because your graphics cards are just on the edge for Win10 (DX12) compatibility,
</p>
<p>you may actually do better to use the driver that worked best with your old Windows.</p>

<h2>            I can&#8217;t play online multiplayer with Xbox 360 games on Xbox one</h2>
                    <p>I just was recently able to get my hands on a disc of black ops one and after downloading it I tried to play online multiplayer and even though I had Xbox Live I couldn’t play online which is extremely annoying. Maybe it’s has something to do with the fact that I don’t have live for 360, I just really want to solve this issue and I don’t know if Microsoft tech support will be able to help me.</p>

                    I'm trying to rearrange my desktop icons in Windows 10, but they seem to be locked in place. The only way to move them freely is to enable Fences Pro and I don't want to do that. Is there a way to unlock the icons to move them?

    <title>Random BlueScreens, urgent help needed&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Random BlueScreens, urgent help needed&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello community!</p>
<p>I have a serious problem with my computer! It randomly crashes and most of the time with a BlueScreen of death.</p>
<p>It&nbsp;<strong>ALWAYS </strong>said "A clock interrupt was not received on a secondary processor within the allocated time interval".</p>
<p>I used to have these BSOD most of the times because of the Realtek HD audio driver and the AMD HDMI audio driver conflicting because they were downloaded with these weird Driver Updater softwares. This time I installed my PC with the Realtek official one
 and... well, I couldn't find the official download for the AMD HDMI audio one, it is supposed to be installed with the rest of the AMD drivers but it fails at the setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, after searching I found in this very same forum a similar error where a guy suggested to download Malwarebytes and SuperAntiSpyware to search and clean malicious software. It found like at least 277 threats! Then Malwarebytes also found some threats
 and then I downloaded Adwcleaner (familiar with Malwarebytes) and also found some threats!</p>
<p>With all the threats removed from my system, I thought I'd be fixed or at least I was hoping that, I downloaded the free Bitdefender antivirus. And I really thought I finally fixed my PC because I hadn't shut down for a long time now (like an hour or more)
 but then, bluescreen... *sigh* Powered on the PC again and, just in case, scanned it again with Adwcleaner, Malware and SAS...</p>
<p>Malware didn't found any threats, Adwcleaner found some threats again (after it was supposed to be cleaned and fixed) and SAS found 238 threats!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't know what else to do, I've heard that I should use WDK instead of BlueScreenViewer but I feel like it's gonna be the very same results... I get the info from the dump files and it says that it's (most of the times) the ntoskrnl.exe but sometimes
 it says ntoskrnl.exe and a .sys file (atapi.sys, atikmdag.sys, etc...). I also downloaded another software from the same company of BlueScreenViewer that lists the drivers and some are hightlighted in red, just like the ones who were failing at the BlueScreenViewer
 reports, and there are many (althought they also seem like the ones who are not like part of the official Windows drivers and stuff).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, in summary I don't know what the heck I should do now... are they the drivers? The CPU? The RAM memories?&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I check if I installed the best drivers? How can I check if they are not conflicting again? Why it appeared again some threats on the scans after I supposedly cleaned up my PC?&nbsp;I am really desesperate right now...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help! If you need any additional info, or if you want a screenshot of the drivers list or the versions or the &nbsp;BSOD dump files analysis, just ask me!</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>Many thanks for your reply Ronalene.</p>
<p>As far as I know, my BIOS is as updated as possible (last update was from 2013, I installed it last year) and the Chipset... well, I'll check that!</p>
<p>I'll report further malfunctions or solutions of the issue!</p>

<p>I have many minidump files and I have analyzed them but it gives me different causes of the BSOD, some about the kernel, some about some drivers. Many .sys files... It is really weird. At least that is the results given by a website that analyses the dump
 files and by BlueScreenViewer. It really freaks me out about the other program from the creators of BlueScreenViewer that highlights in red some various .sys files and some other drivers I think and stuff, but I think is just the Non Microsoft stuff (I read
 that on their dev log).</p>

<p>I'm trying to encourage the Microsoft engaged alleged "expert" to solicit the uploading of crash dump files for analysis instead of suggest various generic things to try and wild goose chases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is shortsighted and amateurish to suggest updating the BIOS unless you know what the current version is, if there is a newer version and then only if the new version corrects a problem similar to the one you are having.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You've analyzed the crash dumps with the Windows debugging tools?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot and should not depend on web analyzers, BlueScreenView, WhoCrashed and the like to reveal the true cause of a BSOD.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
Even BSV says:&nbsp; <em>Caused By Driver: The driver that probably caused this crash. BlueScreenView tries to locate the right driver or module that caused the blue screen by looking inside the crash stack. However, be aware that the driver detection mechanism
 is not 100% accurate...</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes they are right and most of the time they are wrong by implicating core Windows system files (like ntoskrnl.exe) that are never really the true cause of the crash.&nbsp; You must use the Windows debugging tools to get the real cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you share your crash dump files the Microsoft engaged alleged "expert" can analyze them and report their findings and maybe offer some suggestions that actually make sense.&nbsp; After all, they are the "experts".</p>
<p>
</p><p>First you need to tell us more about your system:</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
If a Dell system what is the Service Tag number?<br />
<br />
Do this so we can see what you have:<br />
<br />
Click the Start button/orb in the lower-left corner of your screen. Or, press the Windows logo key on your keyboard.<br />
<br />
In the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Select/click msinfo32.exe and the System Information dialog box will open.<br />
<br />
Click on System Summary, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here in your next reply.<br />
<br />
For video driver information, expand the Components, click Display, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here.<br />
<br />
For audio driver information, expand the Components, click Sound Device, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here.
<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.</p>

</p><blockquote>
<p>I'm trying to encourage the Microsoft engaged alleged "expert" to solicit the uploading of crash dump files for analysis instead of suggest various generic things to try and wild goose chases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is shortsighted and amateurish to suggest updating the BIOS unless you know what the current version is, if there is a newer version and then only if the new version corrects a problem similar to the one you are having.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You've analyzed the crash dumps with the Windows debugging tools?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You cannot and should not depend on web analyzers, BlueScreenView, WhoCrashed and the like to reveal the true cause of a BSOD.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
Even BSV says:&nbsp; <em>Caused By Driver: The driver that probably caused this crash. BlueScreenView tries to locate the right driver or module that caused the blue screen by looking inside the crash stack. However, be aware that the driver detection mechanism
 is not 100% accurate...</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes they are right and most of the time they are wrong by implicating core Windows system files (like ntoskrnl.exe) that are never really the true cause of the crash.&nbsp; You must use the Windows debugging tools to get the real cause.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you share your crash dump files the Microsoft engaged alleged "expert" can analyze them and report their findings and maybe offer some suggestions that actually make sense.&nbsp; After all, they are the "experts".</p>
<p>
</p><p>First you need to tell us more about your system:</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is your system make and model?<br />
<br />
If a Dell system what is the Service Tag number?<br />
<br />
Do this so we can see what you have:<br />
<br />
Click the Start button/orb in the lower-left corner of your screen. Or, press the Windows logo key on your keyboard.<br />
<br />
In the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Select/click msinfo32.exe and the System Information dialog box will open.<br />
<br />
Click on System Summary, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here in your next reply.<br />
<br />
For video driver information, expand the Components, click Display, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here.<br />
<br />
For audio driver information, expand the Components, click Sound Device, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here.
<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I think I found a more recent AMD Drivers for the Display and the HDMI Audio one, so I will install them and see what happens (I hope that helps).</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment I have not uploaded any dump into a Drive or link to share, I am on my way to do that right now so I will post it in a further edit! Although, I do not know how to contact an expert to analyse them, but anyways if someone pops up and knows
 how to analyse them and wants to help he will be more than welcome!<br />
<br />
I have some info from some tests that were asked to me in another forum in a Drive so... I will leave it here in case it helps (mainly these are tests ran on Memtest86, HDTune, some CPU and GPU burners and other stuff).<br />

</p><p>Again, many thanks ElderN!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit<br />
I am having some problems with some dump files. When I try to upload or compact them all in a .zip file it says that I do not have permission to open the file and that I needed to contact the administrator or the file owner (which is me, this is a only one
 account computer) or it says that the file was not found or "no read permission".</p>
<p>I could upload 4 of the 10 dump files I have.</p>

<p>Sorry for the long delay! Had to finish the semester and stuff.</p>
<p>Here are the dump files:&nbsp;<a href="https://1drv.ms/f/s!Am8kIhq3Odt5gk-SNnqWd7Hdqjct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://1drv.ms/f/s!Am8kIhq3Odt5gk-SNnqWd7Hdqjct</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll be attentive for your answer!</p>
<p>PS: I also downloaded WDK and could get some more info about the dump files (I guess), but I don't know what to do with the info, is there someone or somewhere specialized in reading these kind of stuff and getting a conclusive or helpful solution/hint?</p>
<p>

<p>Those crash dumps are a month old but I guess that's okay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your motherboard is ASUS M5A78L-M LX3 which their WWW page says has an built-in onboard AMD/ATI HD 3000 GPU video component.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your msinfo32 says you have AMD/ATI Radeon HD 7700 Series.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you using the onboard VGA port for your video or have you added a separate video card to the system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like the video is the problem but we need to be sure what you have to make the best suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally your BIOS is version 1201 and ASUS says the latest for your motherboard is 1401 but that doesn't mean you need to update it - unless you know the update will fix a specific problem and they don't really say what the update does so forget about
 that for now.</p>

<p>Woah, it's actually amazing how many info you retrieved!<br />
Ermmm... I don't know about that video component of the motherboard that you are talking about.</p>
<p>But yes, I do have a Radeon HD7770 GPU and it's connected to a PCI express (3.0 ? I guess...?) x16 (I guess too, I'll check this later and edit the post to be sure) but I need to ask you (sorry for this, bad english here) what do you mean with onboard? It's
 like the VGA port directly connected to the motherboard?<br />
In that case, then no. I do have a separate video card to the system (Radeon HD7770) because my only monitor is a Cintiq 22HD which is connected through DVI to the GPU. Sadly my mother doesn't have a DVI. But if I need to only use the onboard VGA port of the
 motherboard to fix it so I can use my GPU later then I can connect temporarily a VGA monitor that I have.<br />
Respecting the BIOS, my motherboard is kind of old for these days I guess, but I do have it updated to the last BIOS that I checked last year (maybe I searched bad, if that's the case, if you have some useful link to get to the newest BIOS update that would
 be very useful).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Btw, again, sorry for the delay, and also I am very grateful for this very useful help you're giving me ElderN. Thanks!</p>

    <title>Music streaming on Xbox One - Google Play Music - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> victor anfi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Music streaming on Xbox One - Google Play Music</h2>
                    
<p>One feature that I love is finally available on Xbox One, but no app that makes it possible. I guess I am out of luck if I expect that Google will bring a Google Play music app to Xbox One to allow for background music. Google Play Music is my preferred
 streaming service since it is £14.99 for a family account of 6 members and also allows you to upload 50,000 songs for unlimited streaming. That makes the service a winner for me. Each new phone I get, has already got all my music available.</p>

<p>My question is now, is there any smart way that I do not know, that would allow me to use my Google Play music to stream music? Currently, I just mute game music and stream my music from my stereo. If I have to, I'll just continue doing that, but you know,
 it would be so much more convenient to be able to do it all from one device. Has anybody got any ideas?</p>

            Hi ContraryMary,<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, WMP isn't gear toward audio book reading only therefore doesn't have advance functionality such as marker for audio book.&nbsp; You might want to look around the web to find&nbsp;third party audio book reader program with more completed feature for audio
 book.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
NOTE:<br />
<div>Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be solved. Using Third
 Party Software is at your own risk.<br />
<br />
Thank you,</div>

 create an association in the default programs control panel" If I download a file it will not let me install it same message pops up.&nbsp; It&nbsp; wont even let me except usb devices. I don't know what to do???

            <p>It sounds like you could have a virus or other malware. Get your antivirus program up to date and boot into
<u>Safe Mode</u>. Note that some viruses can hide themselves from your antivirus program in normal mode, so you really need to scan in
<u>Safe Mode</u>. To get into Safe Mode when you first power up, hit F8 about once a second until you get the menu and select Safe Mode. Then run a full system scan.</p>

<p>- </p>
<p>Forum moderator Keith has some suggestions along this line at </p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/windows-explorer-has-stopped-working/6ab02526-5071-4dcc-895f-d90202bad8b3"><u>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/windows-explorer-has-stopped-working/6ab02526-5071-4dcc-895f-d90202bad8b3</u></a></p>
<p>- </p>
<p>If that fixes it, fine. If not, use System Restore to go back to a date prior to the beginning of the problem. To run System Restore, click Start -&gt; Programs -&gt; Accessories -&gt; System Tools -&gt; System Restore. Click the box that says
<i>Show more restore points</i>. </p>
<p>- </p>
<p>You can check for corrupted system files. Open an administrator command prompt and run SFC if the above doesn't help. Click START, then type
<u>sfc </u>in the search box, right-click SFC.EXE and click <i>Run as administrator</i>. Then from the command prompt type
<u>sfc /scannow</u><i>.</i></p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Finally if all else fails, you can check the rather cryptic system event log. To do so click Start -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Administrative Tools -&gt; Event Viewer. Once in Event Viewer click on the system log and scroll through the entries looking for those flagged
 "error" to see if you can find hints as to where the problem could be.</p>
<p>`</p>
<p>I hope this helps. Good luck.</p>

    <title>Is Enabling Insecure Guest Logons Okay&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Is Enabling Insecure Guest Logons Okay&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have access to my NAS Drive and thats because I went to the local group policy editor and set it to enabled but I'm not sure if I should use it, I'm using it because I keep getting the error Windows Cannot access \\SERVER NAME&nbsp; And then the error code
 0x80070035, Now these are the steps I've tried and dont work.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Setting all the services to Automatic, For Example SSDP Discovery</li><li>Tried Temporarily Disabling my Antivirus and the firewalls as well</li><li>Resetting TC/IP</li><li>Uninstalling and reinstalling Network Adapters</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried contacting the manufactuer of the NAS Drive which is Western Digital and they said the NAS Drive is completely fine so its something to do the Windows 10 itself and by the way its the 1803 version I'm on and I'm using Enterprise edition<br />

<p>This doesn't really make sense from technical documentation. Look at&nbsp;what the explanation says:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you enable this policy setting or if you do not configure this policy setting, the SMB client will allow insecure guest logons.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>So, before you enabled it, it was "not configured"!</p>
<p>So, you should see the same behavior whether or not you "enable" it. Unless it was already configured and set to "disabled" which is not the default!</p>
<p>
</p><p>About the NAS: do you have set user accounts on it? I would assume that you don't have any user accounts on it.&nbsp;Maybe everybody has access to it?&nbsp;If you create the exact same user account with same password on the NAS&nbsp;that you use on your Windows machine&nbsp;and
 enable password-protected sharing&nbsp;in Windows you should be able to access the file shares just fine.</p>

<p>If you are the only one using&nbsp;it then there is no reason to use a public share. A public share is for being able to access a share from numerous PCs without authentication (and you are not able to provide everyone with a user/password access to the NAS).
 That means if someone hacks your router (which they do by the millions)&nbsp;or intrude in your network/PC by other means they can access this public share (no matter what you set in Windows). If you use it from "outside" your network (as they mention "Cloud")
 you should definitely not use a Public share.</p>
<p>You should be able to move the files to the private share area or to expand the private share area to it. No? I don't know how their devices work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also note, that "enable insecure guest logons" is not the same as enabling the guest account in Windows as the IA seems to think. It&nbsp;is *not* for allowing unauthenticated access to your (usually disabled) guest account in your Windows system!</p>
<p>This setting tells the client (your PC)&nbsp;that it can try an insecure unauthenticated login at *another* server&nbsp;(your NAS). That's all. And, as I said, it should be "enabled" by default as "not configured" means "enabled".</p>

<p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community Forum.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You have mentioned that you were unable to login into your PC without changing your Microsoft account password. It seems like you have changed the password and now able
 to access into your account using new password. We apologize for the inconvenience. I will certainly help you with this concern.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you are not comfortable using Microsoft Account as you have to change it online then you can switch to local account which will work like regular account. You can
 even enable sign in without putting password if you are comfortable without using any password.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Following are the steps to switch to local account.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press Windows + C, charms bar would appear.</span></li><li><span>Click on “Settings”</span></li><li><span>Click on “Change PC Settings”</span></li><li><span>Click on Accounts.</span></li><li><span>Choose “Switch to local Account”</span></li><li><span>Enter Microsoft Account Password to proceed further and then switch to Local Account.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can also create two accounts on your computer, one local and one Microsoft.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> By switching to Local account you would not be able to login into Apps or Windows
 Store automatically. You have to use your Microsoft Account and password for every Apps which require Microsoft Account credentials.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
