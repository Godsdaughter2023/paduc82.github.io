<br />
<br />
Regional Content via the Marketplace is Locked via the IP Address of the Local Region in which it is used and the Region of the Windows LIVE ID.<br />

Short answer, yes Games and Xbox LIVE, no Japanese DLC.</span></p>

                    To Whom it May Concern, <br />
<br />
Connecting a Windows 10 computer to a macOS computer is more complex than you would think!
<br />
<br />
I have spent the last day trying to connect from my standalone Win 10 computer through a Home LAN to a shared folder on a separate macOS Sierra 10.12.6 computer and it has been a nightmare!
<br />
<br />
It is easy to connect in reverse, but this will not work for my working requirements.
<br />
<br />
Please FIX <br />
<br />
Regards, <br />

            Hi Ralph, 
<br />
<br />You’re trying to map out to a shared folder on the Mac, correct? 
<br />
<br />If you open up file explorer and type:
<br />
<br />\\MacOS IPAddress (ex. \\192.168.x.x)
<br />
<br />And hit enter, does it at least see it and connect? Any shares pop up? 
<br />
<br />Let’s start there, and we’ll see where we are at. 
<br />
<br />I’ll do whatever I can to help!
<br />- C

<p>Hi Ralph. I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.
<br />
<br />
It's far easier to install Onedrive to the Mac, or iCloud to the PC to share files easily:

<h2>            My computer randomly stops recognizing my 2nd hard drive</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I just completed the Windows 10 update on Friday and ever since then my computer will randomly stop communicating with my hard drive. I'm having no problem with the computer communicating with my SSD. I thought I finally got it fixed, but after about
 4 or 5 hours of running today it stopped communicating with the HD in the middle of a game. This is now the error I'm getting when I restart my computer:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"D:\Users\...... &nbsp;is unavailable. If the location is on the PC, make sure the device or drive is connected or the disc is inserted, and then try again. If the location is on a network, make sure you're connected to the network or Internet, and then try again.
 If the location still can't be found, it might have been moved or deleted."</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like other people have been experiencing similar problems over the years and I tried some of their suggestions to get it fixed, but no luck. I'm not the greatest with computers and I'm really frustrated with this. Help!</p>

            Update: After trying everything here and spending 3-4 hours with Windows support, I've pretty much given up trying to get this fixed. I was told there was a file corruption that happened during the install and was a known problem with no current fix. I'm
 not sure if that's really the case or not, but I guess I'll just deal with it until the next big Windows update and hope they get it fixed. My patience is shot and I'm too frustrated with it to deal with it right now.&nbsp;

            Yes, DaveM121, that's the way it's worked in the past, but quite some time ago, it stopped working. I don't know why Microsoft can't (or won't) fix it. It's such a nuisance when I'm trying to conduct business and can't find the file I need. Someone suggested
 using quotes and typing the same search phrase twice, e.g., "search for a file" "search for a file," but that doesn't work. Neither does the single phrase with quote marks! I have wasted so much time on searches, because every search turns up every document
 with every word in the phrase, e.g., "search" and "for" and "a" and "file."&nbsp; Thousands of files are returned when all I really want is THE one document containing that phrase, "search for a file," for example.&nbsp; UGH!!!

<p>Hey Jan, no arguments here, I totally agree with you, lots of users are complaining about the search functions (both Cortana and the search in Windows File Explorer).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I can see the search in Windows File Explorer has gone backwards, it worked perfectly in Windows 7 and has been getting worse ever since . . .</p>

</p><blockquote>Someone suggested using quotes &nbsp; </blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>You could also try wild-carding the spaces you assume to exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to find out how your syntax has been interpreted and forwarded to the search engine you can use the Save Search command and then look at the resulting XML file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, unless the file you are searching for is really plain text you may have to get a search provider for it and make sure that you are indexing that file's content. &nbsp; Otherwise all that you are doing is searching its Properties, e.g. its name and type.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At least you might not have to worry about the Encoding.&nbsp; For example, when searching for strings which might be doublebyte using&nbsp; findstr&nbsp; I always have to do it again by inserting dots with each character to match its high-order byte and by inserting double
 dots to match any expected spaces.&nbsp; Note that findstr infers the same OR logic that you are complaining about when a space is used in its search expression.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, if you are searching content there are better tools than Windows Search for whatever mysteries have been deposited in its index to represent content.&nbsp; For example,&nbsp; PowerShell's&nbsp; Select-String&nbsp; cmdlet uses Regular Expressions as a default for
 its search input.&nbsp; Ironically when you use Regular Expressions OR-logic needs to be requested explicitly with an OR-bar.</p>

            Robert Aldwinckle, thanks, but your suggestion is far too complex. We should be able to search just as we always have, because it's the most user-friendly method. When I need a file, I don't have time to do something so complicated.

<p>The minidump files showed you are experiencing an UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP (BugCheck 7F) stop error&nbsp;referencing the NETIO.SYS.</p>
<p>Since you have ZoneAlarm installed in Windows 7 64-bit, the problem could be related to&nbsp;ZoneAlarm, such as in the following thread:</p>
<p><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7repair/thread/e94de527-183f-4227-9749-072ba0e7769f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7repair/thread/e94de527-183f-4227-9749-072ba0e7769f</span></a></p>
<p>You could try disabling NetBIOS over TCP/IP or uninstall ZoneAlarm and see if the BSODs resolve.</p>
<p>As an alternative to disabling NetBIOS over TCP/IP or uninstalling ZoneAlarm&nbsp;you could&nbsp;try the following hotfix:</p>

<h2>            Install issues for Gta 5 0x87e00064</h2>
                    
<p>I've borrowed Gta 5 from a mate that always installs to 40% then stops with the error code 0x87e00064. I've tried reinstalling, &nbsp;installing offline, installing something else, deleting-powercycling-installing off/online and even cleaning the disc but every
 time it's 40%. Looked online and there doesn't seem to be a fix beyond getting the disc changed but that's not really an option and it works on his machine fine. Only time I've had this problem. Any suggestions?</p>

            <p>Hi Redial03,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the suggestions listed below for a possible fix:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b> Let's first open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter to run the automated troubleshooting services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</a></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:
</b>If the troubleshooter does not fix the issue, let’s use Device Manager to disable and re-enable all the USB controllers. This lets the controllers recover the USB port from its unresponsive condition. The USB controllers represent the USB ports in Device
 Manager.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To disable and re-enable the USB controllers, follow these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>Start</b>, type
<b>device manager</b> in the Start search box and hit Enter.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Expand <b>Universal Serial Bus controllers</b>.</p>
<p><b>Note:
</b>You might have to scroll down the list to find this item.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right-click the first USB controller under
<b>Universal Serial Bus controllers</b>, and then click <b>Uninstall</b> to remove it.</p>
<p>
<b><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></b>Repeat the above step for each USB controller that is listed under
<b>Universal Serial Bus controllers.</b></p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Restart the computer. After the computer starts, Windows will automatically scan for hardware changes and reinstall all the USB controllers that you uninstalled.</p>
<p>
<span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Check the USB device to see whether it is working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, make sure you update the chipset drivers on your computer. Download and install the latest Windows 7 compatible drivers and check if that fixes the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For more information on updating drivers, see
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-drivers-recommended-links" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Update drivers: recommended links</a></p>

If the device is not recognized, then you'll need to contact Garmin. I had the same issue with another model and the device would not be recognized on my Windows 7 64-bit Home Premium or my XP SP3 32-bit Home Premium system. Garmin replaced my GPS with a refurbished
 one.<br />
<br />
I think it was a firmware update that caused the issue.<br />

 all of Nirn. It is what draws us to Tamriel, lets us explore it, and gives us the strength to in it survive, nay, thrive in it. One looks to the High Elves in the starry streets of Auridon, and sees them channeling light in their ancestors’ names. One looks
 to Skyrim and its bitter cold, and sees the heroic Nords combating mythical beasts in their lairs. One looks to the deserts of Daggerfall, and sees a Redguard scout activate an age old Dwemer construct. Just as the living machines of the Dwemer would not be
 as they are without the power of magicka, the beasts of Skyrim are sustained by it. Indeed, the High Elves in Auridon – and every last one of us – are as well. All of these things would not be possible without the force of magicka, and it is in honor of that
 magical essence that we name our guild.</i></div>

<div><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><b>DESCRIPTION</b></span></div>
<blockquote>
<div>Magicka was one of the first guilds in The Elder Scrolls Online, created during the early days of the PC beta. Continued in the full game under the leadership of
<a href="http://forums.elderscrollsonline.com/en/profile/Marginis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">@Marginis</a>, Magicka has since returned to the breadth and class it had in the beta, and then surpassed it. Now Magicka has expanded to console as well. Formed on Xbox One by Magicka's founder
 under the gamertag <a href="https://account.xbox.com/en-US/Profile?gamerTag=Marus+Umbra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Marus Umbra</a>, Magicka stands to take the place of one of Tamriel's finest cross platform guilds.<br />
<br />
While on the PC Magicka exists as a roleplaying guild, driven by story and relationships, on the Xbox One Magicka exists as a haven for all sorts of unique adventurers to assist them in all sorts of ways. Our aim on console is to provide players the support
 they need to have fun with the game, whether they want to try RP (roleplaying) in a console setting, just want to learn the game, or just need a group for a quick dungeon or some PVP (our unofficial PVP campaign is Azura's Star).<br />
<br />
Similarly to PC however, Magicka is still Magicka at it's core. We are still a teamwork driven community, with veterans helping fresh-faced recruits, Altmer fighting side by side with Khajiit, and bards entertaining even the most grim warriors. And although
 Magicka is based in the Aldmeri Dominion, where the magicka flows strongest, we welcome with open arms all races, all alliances, mages, rogues, and warriors alike – yes, even Argonians. This applies equally to players. We are based on the NA servers, but gladly
 host players all across the world, from Russia to Australia to the US to the UK.<br />
<br />
It should also be mentioned that while Magicka does not have any requirements or regulations regarding such, our guild color is
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">blue</span>, and we use the <a href="http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120311101320/elderscrolls/images/b/ba/SkillAlteration.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
symbol</a> for <a href="http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Alteration" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><b>RULES</b></span></div>
<blockquote>
<div>The guild rules are simple, and are good guiding principles for most any circumstance. Like the threads of magicka that flow through Tamriel, they can be equally separated into the elements, but once together come to be as strong as the invisible tethers
 binding Aetherius to Nirn.<br />
<br />
<b><i>Storm</i></b> - Follow guild rules, Elder Scrolls Online rules, Xbox Live regulations, and real world laws. If you support anything going against guild rules, Elder Scrolls Online rules, Xbox Live regulations, or real world laws, do not promote it within
 the Magicka.<br />
<br />
<b><i>Frost</i></b> - Magicka is a friendly guild, to all players, so be respectful of other people’s viewpoints and be mindful that you don’t start anything that could be construed as harassment.<br />
<br />
<b><i>Flame</i></b> - While we don't have any specific expectations for guild members, we do like a certain amount of effort to be put forth into being active. This means helping out other players, grouping up with guildmates every now and then, and primarily,
<b>wear a headset</b>. Communication is key to teamwork and community, so please use a headset, and mute your microphone if your end is causing disruptive noise.<br />
<br />
These only cover the basics. For anything else, the guildmaster and guild officers’ say is to be treated as official guild rule.<br />
<br />
Failure to follow the rules set here can result in a demotion, exile from Magicka, or a warning, of which there may be only one. Magicka can be a powerful blast, a gentle breeze, or a flowing river, but one must be careful when harnessing its power, or the
 backlash can prove fatal.</div>

<blockquote>
<div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><b>RANKING</b></span></div>
<blockquote>
<div>Ranking in Magicka is very simple.<br />
<ul>
<li><b>Initiate</b> is the rank given to anyone just initiated into Magicka. As soon as someone with the ability to give you a higher rank is able, you will be promoted to the appropriate level.
</li><li><b>Silent</b> is the title given to those who are as such. As a silent, a guildmember has had most of their guild privileges revoked until they are released from the title. This is the "time-out corner," so to speak.
</li><li><b>Ally</b> is the rank for anyone who is not technically a member of Magicka, but wishes to see what it is like inside the guild regardless. They lack the privileges of full members, but deserve the same respect as anyone in Magicka. This rank is often
 given to leaders and ambassadors of allied guilds. </li><li><b>Apprentices</b> are new members to Magicka. Once you have proven you are more than the average ice troll, you will be promoted, and receive full permissions within the guild.
</li><li><b>Seeker</b> is the name given to Magicka's full members. The name is from Magicka's goal when it was founded, and with that name comes all the rights of a full member of Magicka. Seekers can fully use the guild bank and guild store, can invite members,
 and manage guild resources within Cyrodiil. Be proud if you are a seeker, Magicka is a powerful force to have at your side.
</li><li><b>Keepers</b> are the veterans of Magicka. From the guild's inception keepers were charged with keeping Magicka on the right path. Keepers are those who have shown that Magicka is their home. They are mentors and leaders, and if you listen to them, you
 might just learn something. </li><li><b>Champion</b> is the rank for those who have ascended past being a keeper by exemplifying everything members of Magicka should strive to be. Those who champion Magicka have extra, honorary permissions within the guild.
</li><li><b>Guardian</b> is the name given to those who were the original keepers of Magicka. Along with keeping Magicka and its members on the right path, guardians protect Magicka. These are the leaders of Magicka in the guildmaster's absence, and because of that
 have the same authority to demote and ban from Magicka as the guildmaster. As such, they should be treated with the same respect as the guildmaster. Guardians and above are also known as the 'officers' of Magicka.
</li><li><b>Overseer</b> is the title given to a guardian above the rest. Like the guildmaster himself, an overseer sees everything, and has authority even over other guardians.
</li><li><b>Guildmaster</b> Kha'jiri is, as his name might suggest, a Khajiit. Do not view him as one might the imperial emperor - not only is he too furry to be an imperial, but his demeanor is generally much more affable. Just do not mistake this for naiveté.
 Despite his looks, Kha'jiri is very powerful, and is the leader of Magicka for a reason.
</li></ul>
<br />
Each member can also receive an honorary title in the guild, such as PVP Leader, or Lorekeeper, although these aren't officially ranks in the guild. Additionally, sometimes certain members do something noteworthy, whether it be leading the guild in the guildmaster's
 absence, taking the lead on an important part of the guild, or just helping Magicka in a way that simply stands out. Along with an honorary title, these members get special recognition in the guild, and can be listed here for all future members of Magicka
 to see.</div>

<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<blockquote>
<div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><b>RANKING UP</b></span></div>
<blockquote>
<div>Speaking of ranks, if you feel you are able to fill the sabatons of one of Magicka’s officers, there are three things you will want to do.<br />
<br />
<b><i>Storm</i></b> - Recruit new members. Magicka is always looking for new blood (blood rituals every Tuesday).<br />
<br />
<b><i>Frost</i></b> - Be active in the guild. Nobody likes a lazytail.<br />
<br />
<b><i>Flame</i></b> - Contribute to the betterment of Magicka and its members. Everyone does this in their own way, some by promoting the guild to others, some by helping the newbies. Find your own way and you’ll gain the respect of fellow members, even before
 you become an officer.</div>
</blockquote>
</div>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><b>EVENTS</b></span></div>
<blockquote>
<div>Events in Magicka are held by any member who wants to hold one. There can be regularly occurring events, but most are just set up on the fly. If you want to let the rest of the guild know about an event you want to hold, give an officer the location, time,
 and a short description about it, and they'll post it in the Message of the Day section for the guild. Just keep in mind there can only be one MotD at a time, so please be respectful of others' events and do not have anyone else's event post deleted unless
 their event has finished. Regularly occurring events will be listed below once some catch on.</div>

<blockquote>
<div>
<div><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><b>JOINING</b></span></div>
<blockquote>
<div>To join Magicka, or if you have a question about it not answered here, send a message to me (<a href="https://account.xbox.com/en-US/Profile?gamerTag=Marus+Umbra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Marus Umbra</a>) or another member on Xbox Live, or leave a comment in
 this thread, and we’ll get back to you in as soon as we have the chance with an invite or an answer! No need for a complicated application process here, as long as you abide by the rules and have fun, you're welcome among us.<br />
<br />
Because guildmaster Kha'jiri is not always in Tamriel, here are some members in the guild one can go to in regards to recruitment if you cannot reach the guildmaster:

            The first step would be to try reinstalling the Printer.
<br />Right-click Start and select Run.
<br />In the Run dialog box, type in control printers and press OK.
<br />Locate your printer in the Printers section, Right click it and select Remove device.
<br />Restart your PC.
<br />If you have a setup media of the Printer driver(This is usually a CD or Setup program supplied with the Printer), run the utility and let the Printer Install.
<br />If you do not have a setup media, try adding a printer manually using "add a printer" button in the menu bar. It should automatically detect and Install the Printer.
<br />After the Printer Installs, try printing a test page to see if it works as desired.
<br />Retry the task again.

<p><span>Hi Jaw,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I tried to access the website</span><span><span>
</span><span>http://.zone.msn.com/en/backgammon/default.htm</span><span>
</span></span><span>and was able to access it to play the game.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Before we troubleshoot the issue I need more information about the issue you are facing, which would
 help us to identify the exact nature of the issue and fix it. </span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Do you receive any error message when you try to access the website?</span></p>
<p><span>Are you able to access other games in
<a href="http://zone.msn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://zone.msn.com</span></a> website?</span></p>
<p><span>Are you able to access other websites without any issues?</span></p>
<p><span>Do you have any security software installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>However, if you have any security software installed on the computer try to temporarily disable the
 security software on your computer and check if you can access the website and play the game. Later re-enable it after checking.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If it works fine by disabling the security software, it might be the security software blocking the access and you might have to contact the Security software manufacturer to check if you can set exception for the font manager.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also you may try to Optimize Internet Explorer on your computer and check if you can access the game and play it.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Access the link below and follow the steps to optimize Internet explorer.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also you may try to uninstall and reinstall flash player and check if you can access the games.
</span><span>Access the link below and follow the steps in the article to uninstall and reinstall flash player.</span><span>

            The first step would be to try resetting Windows updates using an automatic script. See:
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows-update-complete-reset-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows...</a>
<br />Make sure you run the script as an administrator.

            So I ran the prompt as you said and it didn't&nbsp;work. on top of that, I escalated it to trying to reset windows completely and it didn't&nbsp;work at all. the error even disrupted me from doing that also. I don't&nbsp;know what else to do.....

            Hello,
<br />Try doing a repair install. A repair Install keeps everything and reinstalls Windows.

            <p>Hi Riandy,<br />
<br />
<br />
To help us identify the cause of the issue and then find the proper resolution for it, let us know if there were any changes made on your PC prior to the issue.
<br />
<br />
In the meantime, we suggest that you try the following methods to fix the issue:<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1: Install driver in compatibility mode.</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click on the driver and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Compatibility </strong>tab.</li><li>Place a check mark next to <strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode</strong> and select the operating system accordingly from the drop-down list.</li><li>Let the driver install and then check the functionality.<br />
</li></ol>
<p><br />
<strong>Method 2: Run the System File Checker tool.</strong><br />
<br />
Use the System File Checker tool to scan your system files and to repair missing or corrupted system files. The sfc/scannow command (System File Check) scans the integrity of all protected operating system files and replaces incorrect, corrupted, changed or
 damaged versions with the correct versions possible. You may refer to this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

                    <p>This morning I received the following message from Microsoft:&nbsp;<strong>After 10 years, support for Windows 7 is nearing the end.&nbsp;</strong>Followed by the dates and the sympathy line "We know change can be difficult, that's why we're reaching out early to
 help you......</p>
<p>Well Microsoft, we know it can be difficult to <strong>LISTEN</strong> to your customers, but maybe it's time before you lose even more customers to Apple and other alternatives!&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you know, Windows 8 was a disaster! Why, because you changed everything! You took away features we enjoyed and made it more difficult to use and find features people wanted to use. It also slowed down everything! To fix this, you had to give away windows
 10 and even then people rejected it because it caused so many issues. So if you REALLY care about your customers, start listening! To do that, you have to give us a way to actually contact you, unlike your ask the community post on the windows 7 ending that
 you locked out comments on. "<span style="color: rgba(35, 31, 32, 1)">&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(35, 31, 32, 1)">This thread is locked. You can follow the question or vote as helpful, but you cannot reply to this thread.&nbsp;</span>So
 it appears to me, you just don't want to listen and therefore don't really care what we have to say about Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are listening - MANY OF US DO NOT LIKE WINDOWS 10! We do not like your automatic updates. We do not like the new menu look. We do not like the new way to setup a printer. We do not like how slow it is. Many of us would really prefer the stability

 continue to use windows 7 for as long as your hardware can be made to continue to function.&nbsp; And, if you have a retail purchased licence for Win7, you can install it in a new system.&nbsp; That would bring problems of driver availability, but I have solved that
 one a few times.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The only thing that will prevent continued use is the removal of support by other Windows environment applications.&nbsp;
 The biggest, most important being Chrome.&nbsp; That is unlikely to happen any time soon, given the very large continuing presence of Windows 7 systems on the web.&nbsp; Win7 presents a large market opportunity for those who can/will take advantage of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The concept that Windows 7 updates are critical to safety is a myth.&nbsp; The reality is millions upon millions
 of systems have not seen an update in years and continue to function just fine.&nbsp; For the ordinary (non-enterprise) system, just how critical they are is a question to consider.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Xbox One Clubs - Streaming.</h2>
                    <p>I was wondering of anyone could help me. I have 3 xbox clubs. 1 club is fine and lets members stream in the watch section of the club but my other 2 clubs dont. I have all the same settings on all 3 clubs and was wondering if anyone else had this issue and
 if they found a way to fix it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried broadcasting myself and also i have tried to host other peoples streams from mixer and it always stays blank in the club watch section or displays that no one is broadcasting at the moment.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Radiant Sword X thank you for your reply. I understand all the aspects of Mixer and broadcasting and how to host etc...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue being that my xbox club will not show any broadcasts in the watch section when any memebers go live and broadcast they do not appear in the watch section of the club like in my other clubs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many people have messaged to say they are broadcasting but its not showing in the club and i have never seen a broadcast appear in the club so i tested it myself and broacast my own game on mixer which should have shown in the clubs watch feed but it didnt.
 Then i tried to host someone who was broadcasting the game live but even my host broadcast wont appear in the club.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>New Laptop - almost always 100&#37; Disk usage - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dergonu  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Laptop - almost always 100&#37; Disk usage</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I bought a new laptop 2 days ago, (HP OMEN 15-AX011NO 15.6inch) with windows 10, and the disk usage on it is randomly spiking up to 100%, slowing the entire thing down. This happens a LOT, making even just roaming on the internet a pain.
</p>
<p>This computer has twice the amount of RAM, and a better processor than my 3 year old laptop, and yet this new laptop boots up 4x as slow as my old one. I am incredibly frustrated right now, and have no idea what to do. The reason I'm posting here is that
 it seems to be windows related processes that makes the disk spike, so I figured it might be a windows related issue. Some googling seemed to suggest the same thing.</p>
<p><em>2 Screenshots of what it looks like when the disk runs up to 100%, and what processes that does it below. (My computer is norwegian, so the names of certain processes is in norwegian.)
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Things I have already tried:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>- Disabling Superfetch</p>
<p>- Updating all drivers</p>
<p>- Installing all new windows updates + windows defender updates</p>
<p>- Disabling NDU</p>
<p>- Disabling MSI </p>
<p>
</p><p>Doing all of this has caused the issue to happen a tiny bit less frequently, but it still happens often, and boot time is still way too slow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I have also ran windows diagnostics to check for errors in the RAM, and it found nothing</p>
<p>- Checked DxDiag, and it also found no issues</p>
<p>- The computer is new, and I have not installed any strange programs, so unless it CAME with a virus, that is not the problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need some help here. </p>

    <title>Microsoft Lifechat LX 3000 Not Working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Lifechat LX 3000 Not Working</h2>
                    I just bought this headset and I can not get it working. I have installed the drivers and it is recognized but it will not function as a headset or microphone. It seems that it is set as default for calls ( there is a green phone icon on the sound menu)
 but nothing else. The option to set as default is greyed out so I can not choose it. Even if I disable the speakers in the sound menu or even the speakers driver it will not work. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the driver, as well as rebooted several times.
 Any suggestions?<br />

<p>I tried those and I am still not able to set it as the default recording device or use the headphones. THe options are either greyed out or wont stick. Also as an aside I am able to use a LifeCam as a USB microphone fine. Any other tips?<br />

<h2>            LAN definition changes to proxy address of 127.0.0.1</h2>
                    <p>Coinciding with the November update, something has been inserting proxy address of 127.0.0.1. &nbsp;I've called the following:</p>
<p>ISP, Time-Warner Cable: &nbsp;they do not dynamically add proxies</p>
<p>BitDefender Anti-Virus:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they do not dynamically add proxies</p>
<p>Chrome and Firefox browsers:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they do not dynamically add proxies</p>
<p>Windows 10 Support says it is BitDefender but not them</p>
<p>
</p><p>So with that said, why every third or so restart does that proxy appear in the LAN definition despite that it is not the default?</p>

            <p>Hi Norman,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize that the LAN definition changes to proxy address of 127.0.0.1. Sorry for the inconvenience this has caused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may reset the Internet Explorer and check if it helps.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Reset Internet Explorer:</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the link below to Reset Internet Explorer:</span></p>

            <p>Thanks for your response. &nbsp;I'm using windows 10 so never thought of internet explorer as default is edge. &nbsp;I've done the reset. &nbsp;It may help. &nbsp;You never know. &nbsp;I'll report back on whether that worked. &nbsp;If it does, maybe it should still be recognized as a
 bug since IE is pretty hidden in win 10. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will let the community know. &nbsp;Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hi Norman,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the update.</p>
<p>If the issue still persist after resetting Internet Explorer, you may also&nbsp;try the suggestion given in the thread "LAN Connection settings keep changing back to proxy server after restart:" as suggested in my previous post.</p>
<p>

            <p>OK, so here's the latest:</p>
<p>Option to add a DWORD to registry had no effect</p>
<p>Option to use a configuration script, even though non-existent has worked through the first 5 attempts of re-logging in. &nbsp;If it goes 10 more, I will be convinced that this very strange fix has circumvented the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Contacting support on this problem 3 months ago led to all kinds of incorrect conclusions and tried to sell me a support contract. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So thank you to the community, even if this doesn't work longterm</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would seem that Microsoft should be able to use a sniffer to solve this problem. &nbsp;Disappointing, but I do appreciate your help.</p>

    <title>Removing ubuntu from hard drive and replacing with windows 7 from DVD - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Removing ubuntu from hard drive and replacing with windows 7 from DVD</h2>
                    <p>In the process of reinstalling windows on a laptop that had ubuntu on it, I have followed the instructions as far as "where do you want to install windows." The computer gives me Disk 0 Partition 1 512 MB 507 MB free Space/ System,&nbsp;Disk 0 Partition 2 589
 GB MB 0.0 &nbsp;MB free Space/ Primary,&nbsp;Disk 0 Partition 3 5.9 GB 0.0 MB free Space/ Primary. In order to reinstall my Windows 7 (this was a computer someone borrowed from me and returned it with ubuntu which I want to replace) do I delete all three partitions.
 If so, will this harm my computer?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Yes, you need to delete all partitions. Ubuntu Linux creates multiple partitions during installation which includes a Swap, System partitions.
