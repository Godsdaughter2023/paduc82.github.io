            You need to use your Skype ID not mail ID to login to Skype.  
<br />
<br />The other account which you want to be closed seems to be your Microsoft account. Microsoft has been moving all to a single Microsoft Account based services including Skype. Hence, a new Skype ID has been given to you on the basis of your Microsoft Account. Your old Skype ID is also preserved. So you can use either old Skype ID to login (to get into your old account) or Microsoft Account to login. 
<br />
<br />You should not cancel Microsoft account otherwise all your Microsoft services including Skype will be impacted. Just don't use this new account for Skype.
<br />
<br />Your old account is preserved and you can continue using this the way you had used it before but use Skype ID to login.

            If you have successfully merged your Skype and Microsoft accounts, this means the two accounts became one. Therefore, if you will delete the Skype account, the Microsoft account (Office 365 account) will be deleted as well and vice versa. There's no option to delete Skype account only or the Microsoft account only.
<br />
<br />
<br />Due the migration of Skype and Microsoft last October 2016, all Skype accounts are now Microsoft accounts. If you're going to close your Skype account, you will also lose access to other MS products such as OneDrive, XBOX and etc.
<br />
<br />Before you merge a Skype account with a Microsoft account, there's a multiple confirmation about this. Once you confirmed these changes, unfortunately, there's no option to unlink these accounts.

                    <p>I have been using a PC I obtained from work at my home and I upgraded it from Windows 7 to Windows 10 a year ago.&nbsp; The system has been working fine and Windows 10 Enterprise was activated.&nbsp; I upgraded some device drivers today and suddenly I get the message
 that my windows is no longer avtivated and there is an error code .&nbsp; Here is the actual message:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 180px">&nbsp;We can't activate Windows on this device as we can't connect to your organization's activation server.&nbsp; Make sure you're connected to your organization's network and try again.&nbsp; If you continue having problems with activation,
 contact your organization's support person. Error code: 0x8007232B</p>

<p>It depends on what type of license you are using. If the computer does not have access to the KMS host from the organization that handles activation, it will no longer maintain activation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need to restore the computer to a supported edition such as Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your employer likely had a Windows 7 Professional before, so, downgrade to Pro, then use the Windows 7 Professional key to reactivate.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be
 stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.&nbsp;</span><span>You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through
 the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>you
 already own&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.</span></span></p>

    <title>Xbox One Controller Keeps Disconnecting - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One Controller Keeps Disconnecting</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(215, 218, 220, 1)">
Hello all, I seem to be having a problem with my Xbox One controller. It will just keep randomly disconnecting.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(215, 218, 220, 1)">
I recently got a new xbox one controller because the right thumbstick on the one that came with my xbox broke. About every thirty seconds it will disconnect, and sometimes the xbox logo will flash, and sometimes it will remain "connected" but nothing will happen
 if I press the buttons. I have tried everything: taking my cell phone really far away from my xbox, trying a controller update, hard restarting my xbox, etc. It's also important to note that my old controller will work just fine. It will never disconnect,
 but this new one will disconnect all of the time.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(215, 218, 220, 1)">
Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Hey Interstellis!&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Sounds like the console would benefit from doing a </span><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">soft
 factory reset</a><span> (While keeping games and apps and the controller hard wired in) so everything gets updated at the same time. Before attempting this though I would recommend to make sure all the profile information(email and password) is confirmed
 since the profiles will be kicked off the console. Go ahead and try it and let us know how it goes!&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />

            Hmm if these steps have all been attempted bud, the next step would be to try and get the controller replaced through the point of purchase. The actual controller would be at fault.&nbsp;

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/26bad428-6714-4e1e-94f1-5c18f6503943" title="BlockBusterMac">
<p>
</p><p>Are you able to call using the web version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are able to call your contact from the web version of Skype, the issue is with the Skype application alone and not with your connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to uninstall and reinstall your Skype app again&nbsp;and let me know if that will fix the problem.</p>

<p>I have the same problem. I have downloaded it, reset my computer and uninstalled it over 20 times and it refuses to open. I am also running the same versions of Mac and Skype.
</p>
<p>There used to be an option to download an older version of Skype but its disappeared from the webiste</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can use it on the web, but the web version wont let me share my screen so its a big issue.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Conflict between Windows 10 and VIA HD Audio</h2>
                    <p>When I installed Windows 10, Cortana had no voice but other sounds worked.&nbsp; I'm told that you must question vocally and not typed to get a vocal response.</p>
<p>When I&nbsp;installed the mic, the system did not ask me if the device is a mic or a headsets.&nbsp; Apparently, it assumed it was a&nbsp;headset as the speakers went mute. I went to the sound device file and when it opened I got this message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows has detected that audio enhancements for the following device are causing problems:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Speakers (VIA HD Audio}</p>
<p>Would you like to disable Driver Enhancements for this device?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No"</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't matter how I respond, the system still will not identify the mic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts?</p>

            <p>Hey John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I kind of have the same problem, but I think it's just a little different.<br />
I also have the VIA HD Audio drivers as my sound drivers, but when I looked up the latest drivers, I saw that VIA HD Audio codecs are simply not yet created, so this could be a problem as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see on their site:&nbsp;http://www.via-drivers.com/viatech-sound-drivers.html<br />
The Windows 10 32bit and 64bit sound drivers are just not yet available.<br />
<br />
I think waiting is the best option here! Just as you said, Microsoft acknowledges the problem and is working on a fix! ;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings</p>

<p>Hello Rey Bel1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is not entire correct. It is available, it is just disabled with no tools available to turn it back on. One can still "turn it back on" by adding some registry entries, though making changes to the registry is highly discouraged unless you are experienced
 in doing so. Even more experienced techs make sure to research what they are changing and will often make backups before making changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found it worth it, as I prefer Windows Photo Viewer. The Photo App is very buggy, especially when it comes to rotating images. It just seems faster, more responsive, and simpler to me. If MS really doesn't want their customers to use Photo Viewer, they
 should completely remove it from Windows itself. (Not to be mean, simply to be honest.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have this activated on 5 separate Windows 10 machines, some of which (3) were from upgrades and some of which (2) were Windows 10 machines out of the box.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not trying to be rude or difficult, but I saw this and felt the need to explain. I do not work for MS and advise against making registry changes unless you've learned how to make such changes safely.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If MS is going to keep Photo Viewer in Windows, I recommend creating a page for how to re-enable it. They could even create a registry file for this, if they wish, to prevent users from making errors. It looks bad if people have to go elsewhere to figure
 this information out and even worse if their own support states these facts inaccurately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They could also keep Photo Viewer accessible and just have everything default to the app, make it something that is configurable in settings, or something else. As it stands now, it risks customers getting into things they shouldn't which is why I give the
 warnings I am giving and do not give more details other than it is possible. If a customer wants to attempt to make those changes, or get someone to help them, with it, that is at their own risk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I mean this as a matter of fact, not to complain. I can still access photo viewer, so I'm happy. I apologize if any of this seems rude, and thank you very much for your time.</p>
<p>

            Hi, Alamin1intown,<br />
<br />
There is actually a&nbsp;simple solution. You should copy a short registery code in to Notepad or other txt program, and just save it as like "*******.reg", and then simply double click on this.<br />
<br />
because i don't know is this legally, i would first ask Rey Bel1 to copy the code here.<br />
<br />
greets<br />

Hello Angelocracy,<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting in Microsoft Windows forum.<br />
<br />
Put your computer in a Clean Boot state and check.<br />
<br />
To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista or Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot."<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> When you perform a clean boot, you may temporarily lose some functionality. When you start the computer as usual, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or you may experience the original behavior.<br />
<br />
<strong>To put your computer in clean boot state, follow the below steps:</strong>
<br />
<br />
<strong>Perform clean boot</strong> <br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps. We strongly recommend that you do not use the System Configuration utility to modify the advanced boot options on the computer
 unless a Microsoft support engineer directs you to do this. Doing this may make the computer unusable.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Click Start button, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;On the General tab, click Selective Startup, and then click to clear the Load startup items check box. (The Use Original Boot.ini check box is unavailable.)<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;On the Services tab, click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box, and then click Disable all.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points.
 Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points.<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Click OK, and then click Restart.<br />
<br />
The above steps put your computer in clean boot state. Refer the below link for more details on clean boot and follow the mentioned steps:<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</strong>
<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Click Start button, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.<br />

<h2>            Internet images saving with wrong file extension, ex&#58; saving as PSP, not jpeg or png</h2>
                    When i try to save an internet image, it no longer saves in it's original format such as a jpeg or png but saves as a PSP (Paintshop Pro) image. That is the only option I am given. When I go to setting and file associations it is not set to open with my
 PSP program. How can I restore internet images to download as their default file extension?

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Why do all the microsoft tech's keep repeating the same fixes that don't work for the majority of us? This board, and many others on the internet are littered with people complaining about this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had it for many weeks now and it's very frustrating to keep reading the same fixes with none of them working, and no official word from MS when or if a patch will be issued.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only workaround I've found is to create a new user, and copy files. Of course, that means I have to reset pointers for all my programs, my backup software, everything. Hours of work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's all very frustrating.</p>

<p><strong><span>Here we go again, another "fix yourself the computer that we, at Microsoft, managed to screw up. For that, we will direct our clueless software "engineers", like Vijaya in this thread, to copy and paste nonsense troubleshooting steps for users
 so they can waste even more hours already spent on this fiasco that is Windows 10. Hence, we may appear like we know what we're doing, even though we have no friggin' idea yet how to repair the disaster we created". Isn't that correct, Microsoft?</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Here is a post I posted here in this forum last week:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>SHAME ON YOU, MICROSOFT!</span></strong></p>
<p>There are hundreds if not thousands of worldwide posts already on the internet complaining about that major issue, that is the Critical Error-Start Menu and Cortana aren't working. We'll try to fix it the next time you sign in" (which of course doesn't work,
 what a joke!).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried countless of so-called "solutions" found here and there on the net, including some suggested by your "brilliant" software engineers (who I suspect very well know the troubleshooting won't fix anything, which is quite insulting as far as I'm
 concerned), wasting hours and hours trying to figure out how to fix your mess, or even trying to revert back to Windows 7, all to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Man, I had a perfectly fine working Windows 7 before installing this piece of garbage. No wonder it's free!</p>
<p>
</p><p>MICROSOFT, you owe it to your customers to have your I.T. SWAT team work around the clock to come up with a fix ASAP via an update that automatically installs without having the end-user perform some complicated computational cyber-gymnastics to repair your
 useless catastrophic non-operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You also owe it to your customers to keep us posted about development via press releases so we know what's going on and when exactly can we expect to get our computers back to normal. Anything less would show contempt and arrogance and will guarantee you
 a PR nightmare, you can be certain of that. Simply hiding behind some vague casual statements from a brain-washed spokesperson is not enough, such as this gem from last week:&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Microsoft has acknowledged the issue and Jen, who works for Microsoft, stated that they are looking into the matter and that a fix is on the way. We've fixed many of the underlying causes for this issue, but there are still some eluding us, and I'm sorry
 to hear that this is impacting you guys" (no kidding!)."We have telemetry and crash reports that we're watching for this."</p>
<p>Thanks for the update, Jen from Microsoft. So, Jen, any news since then?</p>
<p><br />
Signed: An incredibly frustrated and angry customer</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp;P.S.: here, why don't you copy and paste this picture and slap it across your desktop screen to see what it feels like, Microsoft. Enjoy!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 allow standard users to change network location from public to private.</h2>
                    <p>After many days to searching and trying other suggestions I am unable to find a solution to my problem.</p>
<p>I am workings with windows 10 build 1803 &amp; 1809.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have&nbsp;our systems set with an administrator account and a standard user account.</p>
<p>Obviously when logged in under the Admin account everything works fine.</p>
<p>When logged in under standard user account any new network&nbsp;connections default to public and I need to be able to give the user the ability to change network details and to private.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone offer a solution to this problem ?</p>

<p>
</p><ul>

<span>Type <strong>regedit </strong>in the

<strong>Yes</strong>. </span></p>
</li><li>

<span>Double click on <strong>Profiles</strong> key on the

</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>When you find the correct <strong>
ProfileName</strong> for your network, double click on the <strong>Category</strong>

<span>Double click on it to edit the new data value number for the network location you want and click OK.

<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: Normally, software programs make registry changes automatically. You should not make

            Hi Amr.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go to another PC to create the bootable media needed to do the vastly superior Clean Install following the illustrated steps in this link which include everything that works best in Windows 10:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />To create the latest Windows 10 Installation Media (if necessary on another PC) install the Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key here:  <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, skip the Product Key screen and choose your licensed version only if offered.  On second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br /> I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi AmrGhafar 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />How to Boot from a USB Flash Drive in Windows 10 - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)

<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

                    <p>I've been running Family Tree Maker 2010 for years on Windows 7.&nbsp; Suddenly last week when I tried to open it I got a popup box that said "FTM 2010 was not properly closed the last time it was used,..........."&nbsp; When I clicked "ok", the "leaf box" for FTM
 appeared and said "Application Initializing" , but almost immediately after that another box popped up and said "FTM 2010 has stopped working" - "A problem caused the program to stop working correctly......."&nbsp; Clicking the "Close Program" box made everything
 go away.</p>
<p>

            Probably the best way to get it fixed is to install it again. But honestly, I would talk to that company for assistance first.

    <title>Dolby Atmos Headphone problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ritzy business  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dolby Atmos Headphone  problem</h2>
                    <p>It doesn't get picked up by any game I know of.&nbsp; Nier for instance with Razer surround shows a 5.1 sound setup but with only Dolby Atmos it is limited to stereo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Dolby atmos is enabled windows should be set to output 7.1 in speaker config.&nbsp; Unless this is a universal apps thing only (which makes it a waste of money)</p>

            <p>-Headphones wouldn't cause the issue, but no it is not specific to that audio output (my USB DAC)</p>
<p>
</p><p>-All I can do is enabled/disable it, try to see if it behaves differently on a&nbsp; different output device to which it does not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>-No error messages</p>
<p>
</p><p>-The sound I get when Atmos is enabled in windows is not distorted in any way, and the demos sound absolutely perfect with Dolby Atmos enabled so it is functioning</p>
<p>
</p><p>-When I started trying other games such as Nier Automata which displays when there is a surround output detected.&nbsp; It doesn't detect my Dolby Atmos enabled device as a surround sound device.&nbsp; Razer surround on the other hand works perfectly but operates
 differently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So Dolby Atmos Headphone is a Headphone HRTF function that is done in software and sends out a processed audio signal rather then a dolby atmos encoded signal.&nbsp; Negating the need for hardware, and as proven by the working demos which require Atmos enabled.</p>

<p>
</p><blockquote>You MUST go under speakers properties and then Spatial sound, then select Atmos. then download dolby&nbsp;access. Follow the prompts&nbsp;after.
</blockquote>
<p>And he's been telling you that it DOES NOT WORK. I've posted a similar feedback a while ago and the guy who answered insisted that i should contact my "original equipement vendor"... I'm going to clarify something here, both dolby atmos for headphones and
 windows sonic do not work in games (yes, even when you download the app and enable it properly) because:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Modern games decide what sound they output by looking at windows's speaker config</p>
<p>2) Atmos and sonic are seen as stereo</p>
<p>3) Most of the time you can't change the sound output to surround in games (see nier automata, titanfall 2 etc...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ergo, videogames output simple stereo and since there's nothing for atmos and sonic to work with, they simply don't do proper virtual surround. Now, i understand that there's a "handshake" that's supposed to happen between the game and the surround solution
 to obtain 5.1 or 7.1 from video games in order to downmix it into a positionnal stereo signal, but that doesn't happen (maybe with windows store bought games, but i'm not dumb enough to actually buy my games from there, i can't test).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In movies? As long as you manage to configure your video player properly to output surround sound, it works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And no, it's not hardware or driver dependent. Those two solutions do not create a surround interface for games to see, it's either a design oversight or a plain dumb mistake because people who implemented that do not know how videogames work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just for info, i've tested EXTENSIVELY creative's CMSS-3D and SBX, razer surround and sennheiser gsx 1000 (best virtual surround out there btw) and all of them work on the same principle of modifying windows' speaker setup, so yeah, i know what i'm talking
 about.</p>

<h2>            Windows Store crashes if started &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    Hi guys! I asked this question on Reddit but asking here as well wouldn't hurt.&nbsp;So, I was running Avira and it told me that there was a virus and it's name was winstore.mobile.dll and I stupidly quarantined it. I tried to restore it back but I couldn't
 for some reason. I tried to manually do it but I didn't have permissions to move files in Program Files\WindowsApps but I can see the folder's contents&nbsp;and now Windows Store won't open anymore. It just pops up and crashes. Can someone please help me because
 I'm stumped.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are unable to use Store and it get crashes. So, the issue could be if there is some corruption with the store. I would suggest you to try the steps provided&nbsp;below and see if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Method 1: </strong></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Make sure that “Allow apps to use my location” option is enabled. Follow these steps to enable it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>a.</strong>&nbsp;Press the “<strong>Windows + W</strong>” on the keyboard.</span>
<span><br />
<strong>ENTER</strong>.</span><br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2</strong>: If you are using proxy connection, please disable proxy.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>a.</strong>&nbsp;Click the <strong>Gearbox</strong> at the top right corner in internet explorer.</span>

<strong>Internet</strong><strong>Options</strong>.</span><br />
<strong>LAN</strong><strong>settings</strong>.</span><br />
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You may also refer to the link for additional information.</span></p>

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: The troubleshooting steps in the above link are for Windows 8.1, however they hold good for Windows 10 Tech Preview as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong></p>
<p><span>If still the issue persist after trying the steps provided above then, we recommend running the following PowerShell script to re-register the new Store:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>In the Search box, type <strong>CMD</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Right click on <strong>Command Prompt</strong> and choose
<strong>Run as administrator</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>In the command prompt, enter the following command:</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0.25in">
</p><p style="margin-left: 0.25in"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "&amp; {$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.WindowsStore).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest}"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform you that in Feedback app there is an option to select Store, so you can select that option while providing feedback regarding Store issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Hope this would help. If issue still persists post back with the information required, current status of your computer and result of the proposed suggestion, we will be happy to assist you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,</span></p>

            <p>I've done everything recommended here, to no avail. Also deleted the local cache folder (suggestion on reddit).&nbsp; Still cannot run the Store.&nbsp; It starts and when I select an app, I get a spinning circle and sometime later (perhaps 60-90 seconds) the app crashes.

            Good news everyone!<br />
I have found solution to this problem. It is easier than anyone could imagine.<br />
<br />
First of all, restore file "winstore.mobile.dll" into Desktop, or anywhere else where you can easily find it. Change extension of this file to ".exe". ("winstore.mobile.exe" - just rename it).<br />
<br />
Then, the easiest option is to download small program called "Unlocker".<br />
Install it (WARNING! Be careful to select custom installation and uncheck Delta Toolbar install).<br />
<br />
Make sure you have enabled option that will show hidden folders in explorer.<br />
<br />
Next, right click on your "winstore.mobile.exe" file and select option "Unlocker". When window pops up, select option "Move". Point it to the destination - Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.WindowsStore_2015.8.25.0_x86__8wekyb3d8bbwe<br />
<br />
Click OK. Twice. Then the program should tell you that it couldn't move the file now, and will ask if you want it to move the file during next reboot. Agree with that. Reboot manualy.<br />
<br />
Voila.<br />
<br />
Hope this will help you.

            <p>No help --- now I have both a winstore.mobile.dll and a winstore.mobile.exe (interestingly, the process you described changed the length of the file so the .exe is much smaller than the .dll) in the Microsoft.WindowsStore_2015.8.25.0_x86__8wekyb3d8bbwe folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But Windows store still does not work.&nbsp; Exactly the same behavior I described earlier.</p>

            Well, this is odd.<br />
<br />
It should be okay right now... And it's normal that you have both .exe (about 8 KB) and .dll (about 15807 KB).<br />
<br />
I have no idea why it isn't working. Maybe it has something to do with these procedures you did earlier, but I suppose there is no way to tell right now.<br />
<br />
Sorry. :/

            This issue started after installing the last 2 updates last night, KB3081455 and KB890830. I haven't uninstalled them yet, but I remember running the store before installing both those updates. Installing those updates also caused another issue where onedrive
 couldn't find where it was set to sync files (on another hard drive in my case) and I had to sign in again. Also had an issue where my entire computer froze this morning, which was the first time booting it up after installing the update.

            Same thing. Since installing the update today, I haven't been able to launch the Windows Store. It pops up and within half a second completely closes. I've tried multiple options listed on reddit and everything listed in this particular thread. Nothing
 seems to work.

<h2>            Cumulative Update KB4340917 Fails After Restart Error&#58; 0x800f0845 &#47; Windows Fails to Start Afterwards</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows 10 Pro version 1803 x64. I have tried to install this update&nbsp;KB4340917 (OS Build 17134.191) four times now, but every time it failed after PC restart with Error: 0x800f0845. My PC would just go blank showing a black screen without any
 disk activity no matter how long I waited. I tried to power off/on several times but Windows would neither start nor go to Recovery Environment as it should after two failed start attempts. Every time I had to do a startup repair using USB Recovery in order
 to start Windows!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This update is still pending and Windows will attempt to install it again, but surely will fail and the same startup issue will be there. Is there something wrong with this update that I should hide it, or is there something wrong with my system?</p>
                </div>

            In certain configurations, some update becomes problematic and the best way to tackle this is to skip the update and jump to the next one when it releases.
<br />No need to worry about, there are quite a large number of cases of Windows 10 updates being problematic are reported here every day.
<br />Wait until 14th when the next set of updates arrive, if that installs OK and if not post back.

                    Hello! :) So I have had problems getting my Windows store to work because it says that the time and date is incorrect, when really that's my actual time and date. So how do I fix this? Because I want to be able to still use the Windows 8.1 Store to downloads
 games,apps , books and such.

    <title>Xbox 360 Wired Controller Lights Up Then Turns Off - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox 360 Wired Controller Lights Up Then Turns Off</h2>
                    <p>After your recommended discussions popped up I realized that clearly this issue has not been resolved and that I would still post my feedback.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased a wired Xbox 360 Controller for my PC around half a year ago in order to use it with my controller-compatible games. Since I owned an Xbox 360 at the time (then purchase an Xbox One), I figured it would be a useful investment. And it worked wonderfully...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Until last week when I updated Windows 8.1 (this happened right after an update!). I started up a local game with a friend (who was using a Wireless Xbox 360 adapter which still functions perfectly fine) and we played for about 2 minutes. Then my controller
 shut off randomly with an error saying "USB Device Not Recognized." Under the device manager it then reads "Device Descriptor Request Failed" with that 'useful' status of "Code 43" that the device encountered an error. Obviously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I have used the controller before on this system, with these USB ports and it worked.</p>
<p>2) I have tried every USB port on my system (which all work, because my other USB devices function just fine). I even wiggled the cord around to make sure it wasn't a faulty cord issue, although that's not the most accurate test.</p>
<p>3) I have uninstalled and reinstalled drivers a bagillion times.</p>
<p>4) I upgraded to Windows 10 in the hopes that the driver issues clearly affiliated with Windows 8.1 would be resolved by a new, shiny OS.</p>
<p>5) I checked for viruses, cleaned up my system, and made sure everything else on my computer was updated.</p>
<p>6) I turned off Fast Start for my computer, because it was plausible that my computer wasn't properly booting all of my drivers at start-up with this option checked.</p>
<p>7) Then I plugged it into my Xbox 360, where it did the same thing. Turned on, green light, seemed fine - then shut off randomly after a few seconds. But of course, the console doesn't give you the "Cannot Recognize" popup.<br />
</p>
<p>Pretty much, my controller just up-and-quit one day and decided that it would tease me with a green light and then shut off. The only thing I haven't done is pull the wire apart and determine if there is a problem there, or check the controller internally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't even get a year of usage out of this product and all I would like to know is why. And, of course, I am 99% of the way there to sending it in a demanding a new one.<br />
