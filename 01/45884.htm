<h2>            Users May Want to Wait For Windows 10 Build 1803 via Automatic Windows Update</h2>
                    <p>Dear Users,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although Windows 10's newest Update, Build 1803 is available now through Windows Update, general users may want to wait until it is offered through automatic Windows Update.&nbsp;<strong> The reason for the wait is to insure that your computer and processor are
 ready for this release, and that any bugs with older computers are squashed.&nbsp; If you update manually, there is no guarantee that Build 1803 may meet the specs with your older equipment.&nbsp;</strong> This is even more likely to be true if your computer running
 Windows 10 has an older processor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The newest computers will be updated first through automatic Windows Update&nbsp; and than trickle down to older systems beginning next Tuesday, May 8th, 2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anything is wrong above, please correct in reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jack&nbsp;</p>

</p><p><strong>Totally false. It checks your system before updating using windows update, windows update assistant or if you create a install media using media creation tool.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>It does not matter if you try today or next week. I really suggest to wait for as long as you can so they can fix some issues basically just with the network connections between PC's.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>However, after updating 7 of my PC's and Laptops and now have done 11 for customers, there is some issues with Network connections to other PC's on your network and the network folder PC icons still has issues of them missing here.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>I suspect the issue is because HomeGroup has now been removed from the system and now causing other network sharing issues because of this.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I suggest not to use windows update and use update assistant or create install media and use that.</strong></p>

<p>The conventional wisdom has always been to&nbsp;<em>not</em> jump on a new version of Windows as soon as it has been released. And make no mistake - a feature update like v.1803 is a 'new version of Windows.'</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past, corporate users would wait several months before installing a new version of Windows. Often they would wait until the first service pack. This practice was recommended for individual users as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The idea was to let early adopters and corporate testers discover any early problems, and to give Microsoft an opportunity to fix them (or at least acknowledge them.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is even more true for Windows 10. In past there were several years between successive versions of Windows. Today there is a new version of Windows 10 - excuse me, a 'feature update' - twice a year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, Microsoft does a much better job of managing the distribution of updates in Windows 10. Updates are sent out in waves to selected groups of users. After every wave, Microsoft receives telemetry ('feedback') from updated computers which provides information
 on how the update is succeeding. This helps Microsoft identify problems with the update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes Microsoft can identify specific hardware that is adversely affected by an update, and it will stop sending the update to computers with that hardware. (Unfortunately, some people disable the telemetry in a misguided desire to stop Microsoft from
 'spying' on them.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the best chance of success, the smartest thing to do is to wait until the update comes to you. If you want to make sure that your computer will not be included in the early waves - as I do - and you have the Professional edition, you can delay the update
 by a length of time that you specify. I chose 90 days, so I'm not even going to be a candidate for v.1803 for at least that length of time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those 90 days will also give me ample time to learn about this new version of Windows - the new and improved features, the fixes, the security improvements, and even the known bugs (which Microsoft publishes) - and to learn from the experiences of the early
 adopters and corporate testers. By the time I finally get the update, I'll be ready.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, I'm not telling you what to do. You do what makes sense to you. In general, I take a conservative, careful approach to operating my computer. It may not be exciting, but I don't have any of the problems that people yell and scream about in this
 forum.</p>

<p>For what it's worth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>AU popped up the Feature Update to version 1803 (RS4) upon a manual Check for updates input on Monday April 30th 2018, I went ahead with it and have experienced no problems at all, so far, but then again I never have, the initial install (upgrade type from
 Win 7 Pro retail) was 1511, each subsequent version (1607, 1703, 1709) were also upgrade installs.</p>

</p><p>Same here. All I did was click "Check for updates" and Badda Bing! My Dell Inspiron 13 5368 2-in-1 is downloading and installing 1803. It actually went well. I went to bed and in the morning my laptop was waiting for me to reboot. Thirty minutes later the
 update was done. I did a quick check out of all the basic tasks I perform. Everything is working as expected. I only had to refresh one app and it was the Dell Help &amp; Support app (go figure).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I maybe fortunate thought, because this laptop has been fully tested by Dell to support Windows 10. I can't imagine being this lucky on my Dell Vostro 1000 which is running Windows 10 Pro. Time will time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now if Microsoft would "honestly" give privacy control back to the user and the ability to test out whether a user's privacy settings are in fact implemented. That would be a huge step forward. Currently, I'm very suspicious of the buttons and sliders in
 the privacy settings on they are actually doing anything.</p>

<p>First of all, 95% of all PC's and laptops are supported for Windows 10. Whatever the manufacturer does not supply for drivers for them, Microsoft develops system drivers for your system. as they have always done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This Privacy settings do work. There are many and many configurations. These also tie in with your Microsoft account if you use one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After updating about 35 PC's so far to v1803, over 20 of them will not connect to other PC's on the network as there is a serious issue. Or you can connect and a minute later try again and will not. I assume you do not have other PC's on your network that
 you connect to for sharing. Other than this issue, the rest appears to be OK.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Well my Dell Vostro 2000 is in the 5% because it was shipped with Windows XP SP2. I had issues just getting Windows 7 to run of the laptop. Dell has never officially said this system is supported for Windows 7 or Windows 10. Although it does work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Privacy works? The proof is in the pudding. Microsoft didn't exactly promote the availability of their Diagnostic Viewer App to the user. I want to see for myself if my privacy settings are actually working once I click off those buttons and sliders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have a home network. Sharing folder and files quite easily in an environment with W10, W7, and multiple Linux distros. v1803 made no impact to my setup. Knock on wood.</p>

<p>Put it this way. If after the install, and it works, then it is supported. And you go to device manager and check all the items for red or yellow flags. No flags and all is good. Does not matter if it ran XP in the past. Microsoft creates the system drivers
 for most every PC that the hardware can handle the OS. And basically since 2010 they all do unless you really bought a cheap piece of poo PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And some devices or system hardware can be installed by installing the drivers or software using compatibility mode. Works 99% of the time.</p>

<p>Correction, I meant to say Vostro 1000 not 2000. In my experience with this PC. I had to use a 3rd party driver to make the sound work and the OEM drivers from ATI to make the video work with both W7 and W10 installs. Microsoft provided nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I wouldn't call a Dell Vostro 1000 a "poo" PC. It's was one of Dell's most popular lines for a while there. Very reliable and flexible. That's why I still have it. It can also support Linux too (namely Mint, RedHat and CentOS). Yes, I've put this device
 through some fires and it has proven its worth for a PC released in 2007. Dell just doesn't officially own up to its capabilities. I can understand why, money! How much would it cost Dell to keep a staff of engineers around to support hardware 11 years old?
 Practically, I should not even be using this PC. A replacement battery cost more than what the PC is worth.</p>

<p>didn't say the pc was poo, I said if it was one. And by the way, Dell PC's are ......
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, You can download and try to install the audio drivers from dell for XP installing using compatibility mode for XP and see if they work.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/product-support/product/vostro-1000/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dell.com/support/home/us/en/04/product-support/product/vostro-1000/drivers</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Appears Microsoft provided all the other drivers for system board. </p>
<p>
</p><p>A BIOS Flash to newest version could help too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the video, you can try and download and install using compatibility for XP for that too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize it is a 2007 and my ASUS I built was Jan 2009 that the MB had been out for 2 years already and&nbsp;that ran XP, Microsoft has had all System MB drivers on all OS's since and 100's of PC's I have also built and worked on over the years, Microsoft always
 has all MB drivers for them. Unless the PC can not handle the next OS because it is a cheap POS and then no drivers are created for it. Especially since it is a laptop and life is much shorter for them and probably was not as popular as it appears. But obviously,
 Microsoft developed the many many drivers for all other board hardware,&nbsp;they would never then not create drivers for the Video and audio. Most every PC and laptop you see that are about 3 to 4 years old will have mostly all Microsoft generated drivers for
 their newer OS's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, rarely does the OEM refer you to a 3rd party site for newer drivers for their hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And then I noticed that this Laptop was not that popular because Dell only developed 32bit drivers for Vista and looks like for XP too. 32bit PC's or OS's are not popular and never have been. So the truth is, this laptop was a cheap low end laptop. Does
 not mean it was not a good one. Just limited on its performance and capabilities running a 32 bit OS.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Hard disk 100&#37; usage and missing start menu problems - Solution 03.2016</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,<br />
<br />
I want to share my findings, after three long, long days trying to recover my laptop.<br />
<br />
My problems began with an automatic update, that applied the following:<br />
KB3140743<br />
KB2880510<br />
KB3140768<br />
KB3114426<br />
KB2956110<br />
KB3114901<br />
KB3114900<br />
KB890830<br />
KB3114894<br />
<br />
These updates made me lose the start menu, Cortana and the store, and produced the annoying Critical Error window.<br />
<br />
My first reaction was to uninstall the most recent updates, but the problem remained.<br />
<br />
Then I read lot of pages with lots of suggestions, some of them worked momentarily (like the sfc / scannow command - that by the way takes a lot of time to execute and after some reboots loses effect), others were more complex and the effects not clear (like
 using the command Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"} ).<br />
<br />
After spending more than 14 hours trying to fix it with the commands, I took the decision to take the system to a recovery point inmediately before the updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows could do it, but the price was that I began to have problems with Visual Studio, since the XAML editor presented an error (0x080070002) with little information in Internet about it.<br />
<br />
I tried one suggested solution, that is to create a local user account. I did it, but when I used it I lost access to my original account. Horrible!<br />
<br />
Then I decided to use a recovery point dated one month ago, far away from these updates, as I recalled that at that time my system was working well.<br />
<br />
I did it, and FINALLY, I got my start menu, Cortana and the store. BUT, the hard disk began to work like crazy, making every response VERY slow. When I finally could access Task Manager I saw 100% disk usage.<br />
<br />
I searched many solutions, and the ones that I applied are:<br />
<br />
1. Mark my WiFi connection as metered (Control Panel -&gt; Networks and Internet -&gt; Advanced Options -&gt; Metered Connection), to make Windows not apply automatically the updates. Otherwise, in a couple of days you<br />
will have the updates applied, and the problem will be there again (Use the second switch to enable it)</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>2. Stop and disable Superfetch, BITS and Windows Search services.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a20cebee-bb3f-40ea-9dcf-4f5bee724816" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a20cebee-bb3f-40ea-9dcf-4f5bee724816" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Resize virtual memory: Go to Control Panel -&gt; System and Security -&gt; System -&gt; System Properties -&gt; Performance -&gt; Configuration -&gt; Advanced Options -&gt; Virtual Memory<br />
Change -&gt; Custom size (I put there initial 4,096 and max 8,192, since my system has 4 GB of RAM). You can use you RAM amount times 1 for the initial and times 2 for the max size.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a9759d7f-af06-4951-8c11-407343d46651" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a9759d7f-af06-4951-8c11-407343d46651" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>4. The most important action for me was to stop OneDrive. I used this command: C:/windows/syswow64/onedrivesetup.exe /uninstall. That took the hard disk usage to almost 2%. Amazing.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/54f0bbcd-8b92-4237-93c0-54eb29eb86f6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/54f0bbcd-8b92-4237-93c0-54eb29eb86f6" /></a></p>

</p><p>I rebooted the system, and after that reboot it was working fine, but after some minutes the hard disk began to work a lot again. I checked Task Manager and found that a process was causing this (svchost). I found comments that this process is somehow responsible
 for the updates. And you can not terminate it without causing a shutdown. So I left it work for some time, and looks after it got the updates (that I am not going to apply yet) it stopped using the disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I lost two complete days of work because of this, and the hours spent trying to fix it were around 40, so I hope my findings could help others to fix their systems in much less time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes, the forums and communities are great ways to find info for troubleshooting, I invite you to share your findings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I need a CCID smart Card Driver. The link provided by you is for ICCD<br />
driver.</p>
<p><br />
Detail requirement,</p>
<p>I have a cypto USB token named of Star Sign CUT by Gisecke &amp; Devrient,<br />
which is CCID enabled. When I plug in then the H/W should be auto detected<br />
by the windows. As my machine (32bit) is loaded with the OS: MS Windows XP<br />
with SP3. I am following the admin security policy that does not allow any<br />
random publisher when any application/driver needs to install on my<br />
machine. The application/driver should be either digitally certified by<br />
trusted source or named with a trusted publisher.</p>
<p>Hence, I can not take any random CCID driver, since Microsoft is on trusted<br />
publisher list, hence the driver provided by Microsoft can be installed on<br />
my Machine. Please help me to get the CCID driver for my machine.</p>
<p>Thanks<br />
Hans</p>

<p>The link says...</p>
<p>"This release provides support for new form factors, <strong><em>such as</em></strong> ICCD"</p>
<p>This statement does not explicitly preclude CCID. I have seen evidence on other sites that CCID is included...</p>

<p>...I cannot test this for you but, if your PC is healthy, installing should not do any harm. You can always do an uninstall if it makes no difference. Also, you might want to set a system restore point before installing...</p>

<p>i went to gamestop a month ago and traded one of my xboxs towards xbox one.They gave me 135 dollars for it.Less than a month later they have this so called extra 50% trade in offer so i bite and take my other xbox in to trade.It was the same as the first
 a 250 gb slim.I say i want to put the credit on xbox one and whats left over on a game.He says there is nothing left over they gave me the 135 the did a month ago.I say what about the extra 50% he says you got it the system trades in for 90 aqnd 50% makes
 it 135.So i say less than a month ago i got 135 with no extra bonus now im getting the same 135 with 50% he looked at me like i was crazy.What a rip off!</p>

<p>I think they are only doing double system trade in. So they would offer $70 so double that is $140. Remember, you dont have to trade it in if you dont like the price and trade in prices change daily.</p>

<p>When it comes to media &amp; entertainment technology, items will depreciate in value over time; this is why you can't buy a VCR for $100+ any more. The sooner you sell, the more profit you get; if you wait, you get less. These are items that aren't made to
 last like in the old days - they're not antiques that can make you a profit over time... Tough luck &amp; I'm sorry for your situation, but that's just how things go...</p>

<p>They weren't trying to scam you; they're simply adjusting to the market &amp; economy, which in the U.S. as of late, has been in steep decline. Don't take it personally... Besides, they were up-front with you - as Lord Dirt already said, you didn't have to sell
 your console; you had the choice to hold onto it &amp; even look for another buyer who would give you more for it (Ebay &amp; Craig's List are great for this). They didn't force you to do anything or cheat you - you did that on your own if you went for the deal. Gamestop
 is not the only choice, any savvy consumer could see that.</p>

<p>Yeah though we have 'Game' in Europe and those arseholes are just as bad...</p>
<p>I bought a copy of Gears 3 when it came out.. Got home opened it up (was a sealed copy) and inside was a disc shaped piece of cardboard. I guess someone at the pressing plant put a few copies in their pocket and the cardboard inside to make sure it passed
 the weight check.</p>
<p>Took it back and they flatly refused to exchange it for another and openly accused me of lying. This despite the fact that i'd spent thousands in there over the years and never once returned anything. I was so angry.. Wrote to their head office (they never
 even bothered to reply) So I will never set foot in one again and long to see the day they go bankrupt!

            Hi Steven, thanks for your question. Here are some steps to try troubleshooting the touchscreen:
<br />
<br />Run the Windows troubleshooter. Click Start, and type "troubleshoot". Select the first result, then select Hardware and Devices. This may automatically resolve the issue.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, perform a clean boot:

<br />
<br />Run the System File Checker tool:

<br />
<br />Hopefully this resolves your issue. Please let me know if you need more help! Thanks!

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Ok so, thanks to a fellow community member I have a few solutions for you to try:
<br />Method 1: Use the hardware troubleshooter to fix the issue.
<br />
<br />The Hardware Troubleshooter is an automated tool which will check the hardware connected to the computer for any known issues with it and provides the details and on how to fix them. Follow these steps and run the troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />Connect the devices to the computer.
<br />Press Windows + W key on the keyboard
<br />Type troubleshooting in the search tab and press Enter.
<br />Click View all on left panel.
<br />Click Hardware and devices, new window will popup
<br />Let’s follow the steps blow to show remove these ghost devices and check if that solves the problem.
<br />
<br />Method 2: Update touch adapter driver.
<br />
<br />Step 1: Check for the latest driver update through Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />At the Start screen, type Windows Update.
<br />Click or tap Settings on the right side of the screen, and then select Install optional updates from the left results.
<br />When the Windows Update control panel opens, click on “Check for Updates” on the top left corner to receive a fresh list of updates.
<br />Incompatible or not properly installed graphics card drivers are the most common cause of this issue.
<br />
<br />Step 2: Follow the steps below to update the touch drivers.
<br />
<br />Press Windows + X key on the keyboard.
<br />Go to device manager.
<br />Right-click your touch device.
<br />Click Update Driver Software and then follow the steps in the wizard that appears.
<br />Restart the computer and check.
<br />
<br />Method 3: To get rid of unwanted drivers, devices, or services, use the following steps: 
<br />
<br />Press Windows + X key on the keyboard
<br />
<br />Click on Command Prompt (Run as admin).
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type in set devmgr_show_nonpresent_devices=1 and press Enter. (Note that nothing seems to happen. This is expected. You are actually setting an environment variable which is going to help you to see hidden devices.)
<br />
<br />On the next command prompt line, type devmgmt.msc and press Enter. This will launch the Windows Device Manager Console.
<br />
<br />In the Device Manager Console, from the View menu, select Show Hidden Devices.
<br />
<br />As you expand the different drivers and devices in the device manager, you will see not only the items that Windows currently detects as installed on your PC; but you will also see drivers, devices, and services which have been loaded in the past but were not uninstalled or are not currently started. You can find your offending device, right-click, and choose uninstall to remove it from the system completely.

            Hi Rensel
<br />
<br />There is no actual max capacity on the Desktop, it is certainly advised not to have much data on your Desktop, it is better to have shortcuts to data rather than the data itself on the Desktop
<br />
<br />You are correct, it is pointless and very inefficient moving that data to the desktop!

<h2>            problem with youtube freezes in windows 8.1</h2>
                    Hello,
<div>my laptop asked me to upgrade to Windows 8.1 from the store and I did it. Now, when I use google chrome, youtube freezes when I have more than 1 tab, so now I'm not able to do something else and play music from youtube in the background. But I was able
 to do this in the Windows 8 version. I don't know how to fix this. Can anyone please help? If the solution is to go back to Windows 8, I'm willing to do that, too, as long as it will save me from frustration. My laptop model is&nbsp;HP 2000-2c25DX Notebook.</div>
<div>Thank you!</div>

<h2>            &#34;Can&#39;t get mail&#34; - System Error &#91;Solved&#93;</h2>
                    <p>Edit: While writing this post, I accidentally solved the problem. So here's the solution.</p>
<p>Click the title "Linked Inbox 2" or whatever you have it named as, and untick the system error account. That's it. Wished I found it 2 hours earlier... ):
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Original Post:</p>
<p>So the school email would not sync with the Mail app. I read online forums and they suggested removing the account and then re-adding it back again afterwards. I tried to remove it but when it did it promoted me that my PC had to be more secure with the
 button "Enforce these policies" or something like that. I clicked it, waited for it to load and now the name of the mail changed to "System Error" and at the bottom of the email address, it states in red font, "Can't get mail".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Occasionally, a banner will pop up saying "Your System error account settings are out of date." with the button options to "Fix account" or "Dismiss". When I click on the former button, nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried restarting my computer several times but the problem persists. Microsoft Online Tech Support asked me to put 'sfc /scannnow' into an Admin command prompt but it came up with nothing. "Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations."
 He also asked me to add the account back in mail again, which works, but there's still the System Error account that I can't get rid of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on the System error account, nothing pops up so I can't remove the account.</p>
<p>System error account also does not exist under settings&nbsp; &gt; accounts.</p>
<p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>The disc read error of 25 means that the program can't read your disc.&nbsp; Either the disc is scratched, or dirty or defective.&nbsp; So you need another disc, or
 you can try it on a different computer.<br />
<br />
The Visual Elements message from Vista doesn't matter.&nbsp; Vista will switch your display automatically to a compatible basic mode when the application launches.&nbsp; However, it sounds like your game is failing due to the disc error and not the Vista display issue.&nbsp;</span></p>

 hacia el. Ayudemos a que xbox sea mejor y voten a este jugador para que le baneen y poder jugar todos un poco mas tranquilos. Gracias a todos.

<h2>            Disconnecting from party</h2>
                    <p>For the past week or so I've been getting disconnected from party chats. If it's my own party I can connect until someone joins. If it's not my party I disconnect as soon as I join. When I go to network setting it tells me "all services are available" but it doesn't seem that way. My nat type is open and my network is working fine. I looked all over the internet but nobody seems to have a solution to this problem. I'd like to get back so playing with friends, but i can't with this on going problem</p>

<h3> reddoug  say:</h3>
<h2>            Print spool</h2>
                    Hi &nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a question about the print spooler. Have a printer that is causing problems. Dell 2330dn. I found files in %WINDIR%\system32\spool\printers. One is FP00000 and the other is FP00000.SHD, when I try to remove them I get a message saying they are being
 used by other programs. I remove and reinstalled the printer and everything thing is working ok at the time. The FP00000 and FP00000.SHD came back. Found in Technet libary were someone advised to use cleanspl.zip. Is this a safe program? I haven't had this
 kind of problem before.<br />
<br />
Thanks, Doug<br />

            You can use cleanspl but you don't have to.<br />
<br />
The program that is using those files is the Print Spooler service.&nbsp; Those files appear any time you print, but normally they are deleted after printing has been successfully completed.<br />
<br />
In order to delete the spool files, you first have to stop the spooler service.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
You don't specify what prompted you to go looking in the spooler's folder, but the following are my usual instructions for dealing with the fairly common "Print Spooler is not running" problem.&nbsp; The first step (after the antimalware scans) performs the deletion
 of the files you mentioned.&nbsp; The cleanspl option is discussed in the "alternative" method.<br />
<br />
<p>Often, but not always, the symptoms you described are caused by a corrupt print job stuck in the queue or a corrupt printer driver.&nbsp; However before cleaning things up, on general principles you might want
 to download, install, update, and run full scans with each of these two free programs:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MalwareBytes AntiMailware</a><br />
<a href="http://superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SUPERAntiSpyware</a><br />
<br />
Don't run both scans simultaneously.&nbsp; Each will take some time, so start it and then go do something else for a while.<br />
<br />
<b>Clean up printers</b></p>
<p><b>NOTE</b>:&nbsp; If after completing step A the print spooler still does not stay running after you have issued the "net start spooler" command, you will not be able to follow all of the steps in "Article One."&nbsp; Use the Special Procedure for Lexmark printers
 described below and then follow Article One.&nbsp; If still no joy, use the alternative method linked below.</p>
<p>A.&nbsp; Clean out the pending print jobs</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a Command Prompt window (Start &gt; Run &gt; cmd &gt; OK)</li><li>Type the following in the black Command Prompt window and press Enter after each line
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; net stop spooler<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; del /Q "%windir%\system32\spool\PRINTERS\*.*"<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; net start spooler<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; exit<br />
<br />
B.&nbsp; Clean out the old printer drivers and install the latest drivers using the directions in
<a href="http://www.coribright.com/windows/Article_One.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Article One</a>.&nbsp;
</p>
<p><b>Special Procedure for computers that have or had a Lexmark or Dell-badged Lexmark printer.</b></p>
<p>Open a Command Prompt window (Start &gt; Run &gt; cmd &gt; OK)</p>
<p>Type the following in the black Command Prompt window and press Enter</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sc config spooler depend= RPCSS<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; exit</p>
<p>note that there is no space before the =</p>
<p>If you want to use a Lexmark or Dell-badged Lexmark printer after doing the above, you'll have to reinstall it.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Temporary Internet Files (or cache) folder is used by Windows Internet Explorer and by MSN Explorer to store webpage content on the computer hard disk for quick viewing. This cache lets Internet Explorer or MSN Explorer download only the content that

            Nothing works and now well over 1 gig in tempinternet files. Nothing in disk cleanup has been cleaned up or thrown out or thrown in the bush. It used to work fine until a month or so ago when this padlock showed up in disk cleanup next to temp internet
 files. Windows 10. Edge. Getting really reallyu po'ed with this.

            Open iTunes and plug in your iPhone. On the left sidebar there should be your iPhone name (If you can't find the sidebar, go to iTunes menu bar, under View, select Show Sidebar), go to your iTunes playlist and drag the songs you want to your iPhone. For
 all of the songs, go to your iPhone music library, even if you don't have songs, and on the bottom there should be a blue-ish bar. There might be a box saying "Autofill from iTunes library" click that ONLY if you want ALL songs from your iTunes to your iPhone.
 Or you can use a 3rd party software like this iTunes alternative, easier to use, supports drag and drop.

<h3> ro66i3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 GeForce MX4000 Problem</h2>
                    
<p>I am in a fix &amp; would appreciate some insight into the matter. I installed Windows 7 on one of my oldest rig (P4 HT, 3GB RAM, 580GB HDD &amp; 128 MB MX4000 Graphics Crad) and it is running "oh so smoothly" except the graphics part. Now I know the graphics card
 is well beyond its age to run the latest OS from Redmond but I am not expecting it show me AERO &amp; I do not intend to play games on it. All this machine has to do is record live TV and stream it to the living room (and also play a few videos as I need to preview
 some of them). Now, Windows 7 says my GFX card is not supported while microsoft.com has an MX4000 card on its compatibility list with "no action required" status!!! Does Windows 7 support MX4000 only of a particular make and model??? If not, how do I make
 Windows 7 recognize my video card??? I would appreciate some help in this regard. Please.</p>
<p>PS: Please do not post comments which relate as follows:</p>
<p>i) Run Windows XP</p>
<p>ii) Get a new card<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Details.aspx?type=Hardware&amp;p=3D Fuzion GeForce MX 4000 128MB AGP Graphics Card&amp;v=3D Fuzion&amp;uid=3DFR4000&amp;pf=0&amp;pi=3&amp;c=Graphics Cards %26 Components&amp;sc=Graphics Cards&amp;os=32-bit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />

            This is a TESTED &amp; WORKING solution on x86 Windows 7. 1. Download the drivers from here: http://www.nvidia.com/object/winxp_2k_93.71_2.html 2. Do not install from the executable... extract using WinRAR (or your preferred program) 3. Control Panel, Device
 Manager 4. Under Display Adapters, right click on the standard video card and go to UPDATE driver 5. Point the search directory to the extracted folder on step 1... then it should install and ask you to restart Upon reboot, it correctly displays NVIDIA GeForce
 MX 4000. No problems after several restarts and updates. www.supertechteam.com

    <title>xbox cracked my black ops - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            xbox cracked my black ops</h2>
                    
<p>So I was playing Call of Duty: Black Ops multiplayer yesterday and was getting bored so i decided i was going to go play zombies with my friend. I backed out of the online and went to the main menu to switch to zombie mode and before I could even get there
 i got the "can't read you disc error."</p>
<p>I tried restarting the xbox, opening the tray and closing it and that was not working and I was sure there was nothing wrong with the disc because I keep mine in their cases and out of the way and do my best to never get a scratch on them myself. I checked
 anyways though and I saw nothing. Then I proceeded to try again to no avail. </p>
<p>Just as the error message said I then went to xbox.com/support to look for a potential fix. Restart game, take disc out clean with dry cloth (which actually put a ring of tiny little scratches on the disc that were not there before but definitely don't effect
 the game, thanks for that tip though ;D), take out harddrive, clear system cache. None of this worked. Then I got to trying another game. Alright, I'll give it a shot. Popped in some 2k11 and what do you know, it works. There's a catch 22 for ya. My system
 is broken but my black ops clearly has something wrong with it that my system caused and my warranty has been up for upwards of 2 years now. Bittersweet.</p>
<p>I figured I would just leave it be for the time being and played 2k for a little bit then turned my system off for the night.
</p>
<p>Next day, Today, I go to see if maybe I can find the root of the problem. Since the warranty ran out long ago and my xbox isn't worth sending in to be fixed I had no reason to fear my warranty being void because the lack thereof so I decided to open it up
 and see if there was anything I could see was wrong with even with my lack of electronic knowledge. Or at the very least clean out some of the dust that might be in the fans and around the lens.
</p>
<p>Opened it up and yes there was dust but nothing excessive. Lens seemed fine and don't wanna touch that because those are fragile. Just went to grab Black Ops to see if it might work now after the small dust busting job I just did. Took it out of the case
 and give it one more inspection and notice there's a small crack by the center of the disc. And I'm sitting here thinking "Noooo way. That wasn't there last night and definitely wasn't there before that."
</p>
<p>This is where google can be very helpful. Search, xbox cracks my discs. Oh hey. The first result looks promising to help find the culprit. I read that and take a look at the pictures provided. Look at my disc. Hmmm. the crack looks eerily similar and ok,
 i see 2 more on the disc now that I really know where to look. </p>
<p>I wouldn't mind as much either if I was sure that my xbox wouldn't do this to my other games. But we will see if I can be helped with this either on here or through 1-800-4MY-XBOX, though I doubt very much either will really help me at all</p>

<p><em>So the short version is the centre of the disc has a crack in the centre of it?.<br />
<br />
That is nearly always caused by the nipple in the game boxes.<br />
<br />
As you have opened the console MS wont touch it even if it is an issue with the console. And self repair can not be discussed on the forums.<br />
<br />
You will need to buy another copy of the game if you want to continue playing it, and risk this happening to other disc's.
<br />
(If it was the console and not the box's nipple).<br />
<br />
Or buy another console, not much of a choice either way really. .</em></p>

<p>exactly. and no it wasn't caused by the game case. it must have happened while i was playing because like i said it was working perfectly in multiplayer and even zombies the day before and i had not taken it out of the console in that time. And when I went
 to go to the games main menu that's when i got the error message.</p>
<p>i know that they won't touch it now but it doesn't make a difference to me anyways because It would have cost me a $100 to repair and I can get a refurbished console with the 20gb hdd and a controller and all the cables for the same price. Id probably switch
 to ps3 if i didn't own so many games just because this would be the 3rd time my xbox broke or caused my games damage (a few years ago my xbox was scratching all my games.) So probably just get a slim eventually.</p>
<p>I'm more concerned about the $60 i paid for black ops plus all the maps that came out thus far and now I will have to throw out another 55 or 60 for a new one because microsoft can't make all their systems function properly. I'm pretty disappointed.</p>

<p>usually cracked middle is someone tearing the DISC out of the box without pressign the middle like normal</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i'd question anyone who had access to your games</p>
<p>my 3 year old nephew did that </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>there is physically nothing in the xbox that can crack a disk</p>
<p>the magnet isn't even close to heavy enough </p>
<p>scratch disks maybe if MOVED but not cracked disks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>btw suggestion BUY extended warranties</p>
<p>as with PS3 xbox does charge for out of warranty service</p>
<p>with ps3 disk read errors and ylod do occur with ps3 it can cost anywhere from 150-250bucks</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(disk read more often due to people using the bluray player or the xbox&nbsp;&nbsp;as a &nbsp;dvd player this is wear and tear)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>selfrepair like xbox = console ban</p>

<p><em>That link is just a guy claiming the console did it!, its not proof. <br />
And did you read the replies?, a&nbsp;great deal of the&nbsp;people who replied stated the console could not do that. Even though the cracks are similar on both discs its still far more likely they were caused by the nipple in the box and maybe its possible the crack
 expanded while in the console. <br />
<br />
Either way there is very little you can do about it, you cant order a repair as you opened your unit yourself and you cant use the disc anymore.<br />
It sucks that your game is broken but unfortunately whats done is done.</em></p>

<p>i concur but i just wanted to post my story :) it COULD be from the nipple in the case but seeing as how I'm the only one that uses my xbox and games and I'm pretty sure it wasn't because I am super careful with my games, putting them in and taking them
 out of the case as to not getting scratches on them or damage them in any way. On top of that my black ops is in the xbox about 90% of the time since i got it.
</p>
<p>But again, like i said before, i just wanted to make a topic on it and share my story. I wish that there was a way xbox support could help also but that was shot a big shot in the dark and I knew that but it was worth the shot.</p>

<p>I accidentally cracked my brothers copy of Assassins Creed II last year, by taking it out of the case and putting back in again after each play. &nbsp;I replaced it for him, and it was definitely the case that caused it.</p>

<h2>            Black screen after either update or buying fifa 19. Not sure which has caused the problem.</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought Fifa 19 yesterday online. So no physical disc. When I went to check on the download my xbox one was installing some sort of update. Since then if I put in a disc it works fine but I have lost the ability to see the entire dashboard and so cannot
 access fifa 19 or anything else that I have purchsed.</p>
<p>What is going on?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>Hi, the first thing I'd try is a hard reset, with the Xbox powered on press and hold the power button on the Xbox for 10 seconds, when the Xbox powers off wait a few seconds and power on again using the power button on the Xbox.</p>

<p>Hi Linus!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to hear that is happening. By any chance have you tried anything to see if the dashboard would show up again?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest to try the steps on our article <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/system-updates-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
"I need help with system updates on my Xbox One"</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On here you're going to choose as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;<strong>Step 1: </strong><strong><em>'I need to troubleshoot a system update error.'</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Step 2:</strong> Choose <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">your <em>
<strong>Xbox</strong></em></span></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Step 3: </strong>Choose <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong><em>'I'm experiencing a startup issue'</em></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Step 4:</strong> Choose which screen you get stuck on and continue with the steps provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if this helps.</p>

<p>I'm not exactly stuck on a screen of any sort. If I hold down the xbox button I can see the options to turn off the system and turn off the controller. I just can't see anything else at all. If I put a disc in it auto loads and I can play the game but I
 have just purchased Fifa 19 and F1 2018 in the last two weeks and I have no access to them at all as I can't see the dashboard at all. Just a blank black screen. Have tried auto reset and it didn't change anything.
</p>
<p>Also finding it difficult to track down a human to talk to on live chat. The bot simply won't understand the complexity of my question/ problem.</p>

<p>You may be best trying a factory reset and keeping your games &amp; apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Power the Xbox off, then press and hold the bind button and disc eject button on the Xbox, keeping both those buttons held press the power button on the Xbox once only, you should get the troubleshooting screen up, you can let go of the buttons when that's
 open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Power your Xbox controller on and select the Reset option and the option to Reset and keep games &amp; apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need to add your account back to the Xbox after doing this so be sure you know your account login details before doing the reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good Luck</p>

<p>so you're suggesting a factory reset? I was hoping it wouldn't come to that because presumably I will have to reinstall all games and lose my game save data for all.</p>
<p>Also. Do people on the community actually work for microsoft or are you just being helpful?
</p>
<p>I've just spent quite a bit of money for me on a couple of games which at the moment I can't play.
</p>
<p>So if you are just a helpful user. Could you please direct me to someone who actually works for microsoft as this issue is financial as much as it is problem solving.</p>
<p>I have tried on the website to speak to a human but consistently get referred to AI and there is no way I can explain this to AI.</p>
<p>Anyway, thanks for your help either way.</p>

<p>As long as you choose the option to keep games and apps you won’t need to install or download those. Your game save data will be removed from the Xbox but will sync back from cloud when you next launch the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I personally do not work for Microsoft or any organisation associated with Microsoft, like you I’m just a gamer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that these days if you call Xbox support you can opt to not use the automated service and may be able to arrange a call back, if they call back is another matter.</p>

            <p>Thanks for replying, this is what I got so far:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 1: I have no computers that allow me to write a CD therefore I cannot download the file onto a CD.</p>
<p>I tried putting the application on a flashdrive, but I have no idea how to run an application from the flashdrive. If I try to boot it up with the flashdrive it says "Please remove any media and press any key", forcing me to use the harddrive.</p>
<p>Pressing F8 does not do anything so I cannot run off a command prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 2: Pressing Windows + R does not do anything&nbsp;as the screen I'm on does not go to the desktop. (It appears right after the Windows logo, right before signing into accounts).</p>
<p>It's a locked screen that just shows me an error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also tried another monitor, nothing.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to corrupt Windows startup files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>run startup repair from Windows recovery environment
</strong>and check if it helps. Please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Do one of the following, depending on whether you have installation media (such as a DVD or USB flash drive):</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you have installation media for Windows, start (or boot) your computer from the installation media. Insert the DVD or USB flash drive and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to "<strong>Press any key to boot from DVD</strong>", do
 so. If you don’t see the message, you might need to change the boot order in your computer's BIOS settings so that it first starts from the DVD or USB. When you see the "<strong>Install Windows</strong>" page, click "<strong>Repair your computer</strong>"
 to start the <strong>Windows recovery environment.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you don’t have installation media, use the power button to restart your computer three times. This will start the
<strong>Windows recovery environment</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b. In the <strong>Windows recovery environment</strong>, on the "<strong>Choose an option</strong>" screen, click "<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>c. Click "<strong>Advanced options</strong>" and then click "<strong>Startup Repair</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS
 settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You may <strong>download Windows 10 upgrade files and&nbsp;create an installation media.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer this article:<br />
