<p>I have had no problems with game until now. All my downloaded puzzles went away. I tried to uninstall and reinstall and it still doesn't work. Some one please help me get this fixed. The game is one of the very few ways I can rest my mind.</p>

<p>Hi, all :-).</p>
<p>Well, over 2 hours of testing, including some very unorthodox attempts at solving this problem, and... As promised, I MAY have a solution for you :-).</p>
<p>I will tell you the main things I did, just in case it was a combination of fixes, it worked for me, so I hope you all get the same result.</p>
<p>Firstly, run SFC (System File Checker) - </p>
<p>Hold-down Windows key and press X.</p>
<p>Select "Command Prompt (Admin)".</p>
<p>In the command prompt window, type the following</p>
<p>sfc/scannow</p>
<p>Press Enter.</p>
<p>This will take a while, but bear with it ;-).</p>
<p>After this completes, if it finds errors (it did on mine), close the command prompt and restart your PC.</p>
<p>Uninstall and reinstall Microsoft Jigsaw.</p>
<p>Open Settings and select "Privacy", choose "Background Apps" at the bottom of the list on the left. &nbsp;This needs to be turned on.</p>
<p>Run MS Jigsaw, and try to download puzzle packs again,.</p>
<p>Hopefully, you will see the downloads start almost immediately :-).</p>
<p>Hope this help you out. &nbsp;If you need any help with doing this, please let me know, and I will be happy to help you out :-).</p>
<p>Kind regards.</p>
<p>DJM.</p>

<p>Hi Gerald,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a fairly common problem, especially if there is a corrupt entry in your logbook that is preventing further entries being entered (at least not being entered in the Log Book within FSX).&nbsp; &nbsp;Here is the recovery tool that is generally used, but first
 rename your original logbook, e.g. to logbook.bin.old (found in My Documents under Flight Simulation files), before you use this tool.&nbsp; &nbsp;You may need to put the old file back in, if the tool doesn't work for you.&nbsp; Also read up on it first;&nbsp; using the tool
 won't affect your FSX installation, though there could be a possibility that you could lose your logbook entries, hence the renaming of the file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://flyawaysimulation.com/downloads/files/1675/fsx-logbook-recovery/</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a side comment:&nbsp; I stopped using the FSX Log book a very long time ago, for this reason.&nbsp; &nbsp;Found it just as easy to maintain my own spreadsheet with all the details I required.&nbsp; &nbsp;Obviously, entries such as the Instrument hours that you have flown, etc.
 cannot be easily calculated unless you physically time it when doing instrument approaches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you have success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chris</p>

            Hi volt64bolt 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />1. Try to reset your display driver and reboot your computer
<br />Windows Key+CTRL+SHIFT+B
<br />
<br />2. If above doesn't work - Take actions related to Display Driver as the first level of troubleshooting
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; Expand Display Adapter &gt; Right click on entry below &gt;
<br />
<br />A. Rollback the Driver 
<br />Click Properties &gt; Go to Driver tab &gt; If there is rollback option, click it
<br />
<br />B. Update driver from manufacturer's website
<br />Go to the website of the driver's manufacturer or computer's manufacturer &gt; See if some driver is released for your model and OS &gt; If yes, download that &gt; In previous option, click Uninstall &gt; Install the downloaded driver &gt; Restart your computer
<br />
<br />You will need to restart your computer after the above steps.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<h2>            Windows 7 wont install because of BIOS error</h2>
                    I just bought Windows 7 and was able to download without any problem, when I get to the Installation part it comes up with an error saying I need to update my BIOS. I tried looking up places to download and followed other forums but have not been able
 to find one that works. <br />
<br />
This is the specific error message that comes up. <br />
<br />
Windows cannot be installed on this computer with the current system BIOS version. Contact your computer manufacturer for a BIOS update, install the update, and then start Windows installation again. OEM Name: Dell Inc.; OEM Model: Latitude D630 ; BIOS Version:
 Phoenix ROM BIOS PLUS Version 1.10 A09; BIOS Date: 20080403000000.000000+000 <br />

<p>Yeah I was pretty hyped for Nightfall when it came out and I got MCC (around Christmas time a few yrs ago), I redeemed the code but nothing ever happened. Apparently there is armor you get for watching it now. Bummer I can't watch it, I was jumping up and
 down like an excited little girl at a One Direction concert when I saw the leaflet.</p>

<h2>            Windows keeps swapping my keyboard layout</h2>
                    <p>This is getting silly now. Ever since update 1803 in this month (May 2018), my English (UK) keyboard is being swapped for English(United States).</p>
<p>I tried a little test tonight. When I finished the evening session, I made sure the keyboard was set to English (UK) - by keyboard English(UK), I mean the language appearing on the bottom right of the taskbar next to the time and date and notifications.
 I left it for a couple of hours without touching a key and sure enough it had all on it's own changed back to English(United States).</p>
<p>I've been though all the settings, looked at as many articles as possible, and nothing works.</p>
<p>I'm fed up to the teeth with this problem as it's causing problems with e-mails and passwords and that's just for starters.</p>
<p>Language has disappeared from the old Control Panel and in the new settings Windows display language only has English (United States) as an option - the English (UK) language pack only has support for text to speech and speech recognition.</p>
<p>This has wasted hours and hours. None of this is my doing and only happened since 1803. This is a MICROSOFT problem. Instead of worrying about Cortana and that sort of frivolous stuff, get the basics right - some Windows users/customers still use keyboards,
 mice and bog-standard kit.</p>
<p>One update can very rapidly destroy any confidence in MS. If it wasn't for all the programs and applications that have to run in Windows, I would ditch it right now. My venerable Linux machines never miss a beat, backups done in a flash, never have to touch
 settings, no anti-virus and no keyboard issues.</p>
<p>If anyone can tell me how to permanently delete the US keyboard, I'd be pleased to hear - I only want/use English (UK). If MS is aware of the problem and is going to address it soon, I would also like to hear</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            Hi tigger11, there is a known bug in the 1803 version of Windows 10. Microsoft are aware of this issue and hopefully are working on a patch . . . 
<br />
<br />For the moment, please use this workaround to set your preferred input language:
<br />
<br />Right click your Start Button, choose Powershell (admin) 
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />$1 = New-WinUserLanguageList en-GB 
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter
<br />
<br />Set-WinUserLanguageList $1 
<br />
<br />Close Powershell and restart your PC       
        </p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            You should do following - 
<br />
<br />Right click on Windows Start &gt; Windows Powershell (Admin) 
<br />Copy and paste below and Enter in Powershell 
<br />Set-WinUserLanguageList en-GB 
<br />
<br />This will make other languages disappear. (In case, you want to add again or other languages, you can add again from language settings)

<p>Thanks DaveM121 and E for Excel</p>
<p>I have had a look in Powershell some hours ago using Get-WinUserLanguageList and there are entries for English (United Kingdom) and English (United States). English (UK) is the first in the list. Interestingly enough, an identical PC that was updated with
 1803 at about the same time, has not shown any of these symptoms.</p>
<p>My problem is that even after years of using PCs etc., this PC in particular has a lot riding on it and I'm wary of doing something that is out of my comfort zone. For another thing, for the hundreds of thousands of users at Microsoft's mercy who must be
 getting this problem and have absolutely no idea what to do next, it's a shame that MS can't send a notification for something so basic and essential, that they are looking into it. I've noted your suggestions and will use them if MS don't provide a fix in
 the next round of updates.</p>
<p>Right now, the way I see it, is if I mess my PC up, it's my problem to fix - if MS enforces updates, then that's another matter. Unfortunately, MS isn't like the local builder who messes up who you can get hold of, MS is subterranean with layers of corporate
 defence systems.</p>
<p>Grateful for your help</p>
<p>

<h2>            Win10-&#34;Move To&#34; and &#34;Copy To&#34; menu</h2>
                    <p>Hello Community,</p>
<p>I successfully customized various items in explorer / navigation pane, e.g. removing useless OneNote, Libraries or Workgroup icons, and since I have only the system on "C" drive, I moved also all personal folders to "D" drive and removed them from the Navigation
 pane under "C".</p>
<p>
</p><p>However - there is one thing I cannot figure out, hoping for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win10 took "Send To Folder" and "Copy to Folder" out of right-click and instead introduced "Move To" and CopyTo" at the top ribbon - that's fine.</p>
<p>But how can I customize the drop-down-menu in those?</p>
<p>It contains mostly useless (to me) stuff - as the described items earlier, plus Bluetooth or Send to Fax, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- How can I delete certain items in there and replace them with destinations / folders of my choice? (all in "D" drive)</p>
<p>
</p><p>With proper instruction I'm confident in altering the registry (after backup of course) ... any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help in advance</p>

<p>Hi <em>Sunburst55</em><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It is a cool and unique idea to change, or replace the <em>default drop-</em><em>down content</em> of the "<em>Move to and Copy to</em>" context menu. We also understand your willingness to dig deeper, even modifying the registry to make your Windows Explorer
 more personalized. However, the default contents of those 2 context menu are yet to be replaceable in the OS - while the system can automatically add the folders that were being used often. Plus, modifying the registry for this is to complex for Microsoft
 Community, since the issue you described is about the File Explorer design. <br />
<br />
<br />
Would you have some time to raise this as a feedback to our Engineers? Please refer here:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4021566/windows-10-send-feedback-to-microsoft-with-feedback-hub-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Send feedback to Microsoft with the Feedback Hub app - Windows 10.</span></em></a><br />
<br />
That is the fastest way on reaching to the Windows 10 developers to raise a feedback about the OS design. We never know, they sometimes able to reply with solutions, so hopefully they might know something about how the context can be modified.

<p>Hi Marc,</p>
<p>thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes - I can certainly live without that particular mod.</p>
<p>As I said-I'm VERY happy with Win10-just escaping a horrible, awkward and combersome</p>
<p>Mac working environment. It's wonderful how I could personalize Win10 to my needs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will reply to the developers as well since it should be considered by Microsoft</p>
<p>that MANY users have machines with 2 (or more) drives, where ONLY the system is on C (SSD)</p>
<p>and all personal data on another - so the need of My Documents, Pictures, Video, etc. ... and&nbsp;</p>
<p>the automatic download or saving defaults to C drive make no sense - and should have&nbsp;</p>
<p>an alternative ... the un-detachable from- and always pionting towards C drive with these items should be done away with</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi Keith,</p>
<p>the user folders, as in Documents, Pictures, etc., but also Wrokgroup, Oneone etc. ... attached to C:\ do still exist but with the help of articles available I was able to make them invisible in the Navigation Pane.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So - my Navigation Pane only shows what I need to work:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- Quick access - also customized - only containing what I use</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- My PC, under which only C:\ drive and D:\ drive shows (plus USB devices if connected)</p>
<p>
</p><p>nothing else!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It expands to sub-folders though if want it to (set in folder options)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The personal user folders (pictures, music, etc. .. and folders of my creation, as e.g. "Pending" or "Clients", etc.</p>
<p>are newly created and reside in D:\ and show under that location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works great for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I never access C:\ drive, ever, unless I have to go there for some system reason (e.g. AppData/Photoshop, etc)</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Keith,</p>
<p>I did not actually remove / transfer the personal user folders to D:\, even though that is possible according to some sources - I just made them invisible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to actually change the location of these folders but it created havoc.</p>
<p>And since these folders are so stubborn in their naming and association (Music, Videos etc.) I do not want them anyways where I work - rather have my own MyMusic, MyDownloads, MyDocs etc.</p>
<p>(I never do anything in C:\ - except a rare check in AppData&gt;Photoshop Preferences etc. - C drive (Samsung 850 SSD) is strictly for system)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I left then alone - they are empty and I don't see them in most what I do.</p>
<p>However - when I follow the regular path C&gt;Users&gt;Username...I still see those folders there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>- I just don't see them in navigation panel. incl. Libraries, Homegroup, OneDrive and other junk.</p>
<p>- Nor are they in Quick Access. Quick access only hold what I put there.</p>
<p>- The top bar - with the exact 6 or 7 user folders I have no use for - is gone as well.</p>
<p>I got advice for this from a number of posts online. It works well - without actually re-locating the actual C folders.</p>
<p>Now I see my newly created / similar ones under D:\<br />
</p>
<p>Back to the original question: why cant I do the same in the "Move To" or "Copy To" drop down list at the top - ?&nbsp;replace / remove destination folders.&nbsp; It's full of junk and only at the bottom I can click to find other destinations in D:\....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I typed Shell:Documents in what you call the address bar in an explorer window ... let's say I open My PC &gt; Local Disk ... and click on top where it says Local Disk (C) ... it changes to just C:\ (highlighted) ... then I type Shell:Documents - press enter
 - I get: Windows can't find 'Shell:Documents'.....?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time so far, Keith</p>
<p>I appreciate any new insights</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Hi Keith,</p>
<p>aside the explanation below, I'm still trying to figure out what you mean by "Address Bar" in an explorer window.</p>
<p>......?</p>
<p>An address bar to me only exists in a web browser - do you mean the bar at the top in explorer that lists the tree-structure of folders I'm in?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again - when typing in it: Shell:Documents....I only get: windows cannot find...&nbsp; ...check spelling...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>I'm sorry, that should have been <strong>'Shell:Personal' </strong>to open the
<strong>Documents </strong>folder. But that area where you see the path to the folder you are viewing and can select dropdowns to navigate to other locations is known as the Address Bar:
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=parts+of+File+Explorer+window&amp;newwindow=1&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=iu&amp;ictx=1&amp;fir=rCGWO3CTrR3mlM%253A%252CyAiE8f35EDWgNM%252C_&amp;usg=__6e9U97HvhvGhpjSSgmj-1Za9efU%3D&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwimgqTmqeraAhWLy4MKHWmYDUoQ9QEwAXoECAAQMg#imgrc=_&amp;spf=1525377309210" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Parts of the File Explorer Window</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I imagine that when you tried redirecting the first time, you selected the parent folder where you wanted&nbsp; the folder &amp; instead&nbsp;inadvertently designated the parent as Documents or Music or whatever (there's no shortage of "My D:\ Drive is Now a Music Folder"
 posts out there!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though it's not your core concern, I would recommend pointing the Shell folder entries to your folders on the D:\ drive. It will allow you delete the folders you don't use on your C:\ drive. Also, many programs/apps query these values to determine default
 Open/Save locations when displaying a dialog, so less typing/navigation if they open to your preferred locations. These are found in the registry under:</p>
<p><strong>HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\User Shell Folders</strong></p>
<p>You would, for example, under the <strong>Personal </strong>value, replace:</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>%UserProfile%\Documents</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center">with</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>D:\Users\Klaus Rossler\MyDocuments</strong></p>
<p>Most of the names are obvious, with the exception of <strong>Downloads</strong>, which is labeled as:</p>
<p><strong>{374DE290-123F-4565-9164-39C4925E467B}</strong></p>
<p>Other user folders that can be redirected but don't appear here until redirected (or you create the entries)can be found here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/windows-10-shell-folders-paths-defaults-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.winhelponline.com/blog/windows-10-shell-folders-paths-defaults-restore/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But as to your core concern, I hadn't used those dropdowns before and just started looking at them after reading your post. Mine seem to be populated by folders pinned to Quick Access, frequent folders (both that appear in Quick Access and a few more that
 I assume lay beyond the Quick Access cutoff, and then the 'core' set of User Shell folders. I
<em>don't</em> see items such as 'Send to Bluetooth' or 'Send to Fax' which you mention, making me wonder why yours would use the SendTo folder as one source and mine doesn't.</p>
<p>But I'm really vexed by the User Shell folders that appear here. Even after apply the registry mods that change their display names under both Quick Access and This PC, these remain unchanged.&nbsp; I'm still trying to figure it out.</p>

<p>Thanks you Keith for the detailed reply.</p>
<p>I typed Shell:Personal and I get the C &gt; User &gt; Documents folder, which only had 2 items I didn't know of - just an Adobe and a Custom Office Template folder.</p>
<p>I deliberately called the replacements in D drive MyDocuments or MyMusic, etc. - to not being confused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are right on - when trying to re-direct C folders to D it seemed to be reversed and I ended up with lots of folders in the wrong Documents or a new Music folder - as you mentioned.</p>
<p>Again - I'm not concerned about those folders in C - I just don't see/use them at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next thing you mention sounds tempting to me in regards to be able to delete C-User-Folders and in the process eliminate the default save to, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However I'm not computer-tech savvy enough to follow your advice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>..."<span>pointing the Shell folder entries to your folders on the D:\ drive." ... etc.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You mention the core User folders - in Navigation Pane and basicall in the first window that opens tp me when entering Explorer is pretty clean and I'm happy.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>btw. - I posted another thread about doubled fixed drive D under/outside of This PC and</span></p>
<p><span>fixed drived C and D showing in Taskbar &gt; Remove Hardware Safely..? (in case you are interested)</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>was just my abstract way of describing what you do when you redirect the User's folders to another location. It can be accomplished via the Location tab in the folder's properties dialog or through the Registry edit I described. You've mentioned
 doing other registry edits, so you should at least take a look at the key I mentioned earlier --- I think you'll have an "A-ha!" moment.</span></p>

<h2>            Programs not responding out of safe mode</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Problem</span></strong></p>
<p>About a month ago I experienced &nbsp;a program not responding . I proceeded to re-install it and realized the same issue was still there. A few programs weeks before the incident exhibited this symptoms but nothing that persistent. I tried opening up my computer
 properties but it will keep saying not responding and restart over and over.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Issue</span></strong></p>
<p>I boot into safe mode with networking and all my programs work. So I go into msconfig and disable all start-up and non Microsoft services and boot up into normal desktop and the same issue occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have posted on multiple forums seeking help for this but have been told to reset my computer .I have precious data that cant be backup(backup crashes) on the computer and need a way to fix my computer without erasing the data.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Attempted Fixes</span></strong></p>
<p>Any antimalware or registry booster I could find (including windows offline defender etc)</p>
<p>reinstalling windows 7 SP1 ( insufficient space [even though hard disk &gt;50% empty])</p>
<p>Any help of any sorts would be greatly appreciated , I am at my wits end trying to fix this issue for quite some time now.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A word of advice:</p>
<p><em>Never, ever use Registry Cleaners, Boosters, etc as they may do more harm to your Operating System than any good that they claim to be able to do</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>You say it works in Safe Mode.</p>
<p>In Safe Mode limited services are started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use this to&nbsp;see if there are any&nbsp;corrupted System files causing problems in Normal Mode;</p>

            I know on windows phone you can link inboxes into one. On the windows 8.1 it was easier to see the individual accounts but on the windows 10 mail app it's quite a complicated affair to view each inbox.&nbsp;

<p>Outlook for iOS does have an unified Inbox, and it's just great. I actually made me drop the default Mail app.</p>
<p>Why don't you use just as is? Even the Desktop Outlook app is way more complicated (no unified calendars?!)</p>

    <title>Steelseries H Wireless Compatibility - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cb crunch  say:</h3>
<h2>            Steelseries H Wireless Compatibility</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I own a Steelseries H Wireless headset and I am having difficulties with the ability to chat when using it on my Xbox One. I know for a fact that the mic is working because I use the headset on my PS4 regularly and it works flawlessly. When I try to use
 it on the Xbox One however, I can pick up game and chat audio, but my friends don't hear anything that I say. I have been in touch with support multiple times on this, but they always say that I have NAT issues because my NAT type is moderate. I do not believe
 this is the case though because I can talk fine in the chat when I use my incredibly cheap skullcandy headphones. Correct me if I am wrong, but I am fairly certain that a NAT issue means I wouldn't be able to talk under any circumstances in the chat.</p>
<p>I have made multiple attempts to try and make my headset work with the Xbox One (and I have gotten close), but nothing has worked so far. Since I have an Xbox One controller with a 3.5mm slot on it, I have not purchased the adapter (and I do not want to).
 My headset has a 2.5mm "chat" port and a 3.5mm "share" port. The closest attempt I have made was to plug a 3.5mm analog cable in from the "share" port to the controller. In that instance I was able to hear my friends, but they were very quiet and they were
 able to hear me just fine. I was even able to turn the headset off and I could still talk to them which was strange.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone been able to get this headset to work with Xbox One? One option I was considering was to plug the 2.5mm cable into the "chat" port on my headset and then buy a 2.5mm female to 3.5mm male converter and plug that into my controller. Is this something
 that could feasibly help? Please advise. I am not open to buying a new headset either because mine is very expensive and it works with every other electronic device that I own which means Microsoft has something they need to fix. I shouldn't not be told that
 my only solution is to spend a chunk of money on another headset.</p>

            <p>Hey CB Crunch!</p>
<p>To narrow this down have you by chance tried a Skype echo test on your console? To do that open up the Skype app and give the "Skype Test Call" contact a call to see if you're able to hear your echo. If you're able to hear yourself this definitely sounds like it might be on the side of your network, in which case you would want to run through this <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/nat-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">NAT Type Troubleshooter</a>.</p>

<p>Some of my friends use this headset with no problems andhave just purchased one my self. your issue can be easily resolved by purchasing a cable (On Ebay for a few quid). with a 2.5mm plug one end and a 3.5mm plug the other.
</p>
<p>The share port on the headset is exactly that. you need to use the 2.5mm chat port for your chat to be heard. hope this helps &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you very much, Gerry!<br />
<br />
I updated the network card from the device manager screen and the PC has not restarted ever since. I used Device Manager to look for every hardware piece's driver update, because DELL's Update Application said everything was up to date.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, I am downloading the drivers you mentioned and will install them. I will do it next Monday (my work place is about to be closed today and will not open until next Monday). I will install the 64 bits version of the Realtek driver, since my OS is
 64 bits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll let you know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again!</p>

            <p>Dear Gerry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I applied the updates and now I have:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intel(R) 8 Series/C220 Chipset family SATA AHCI Controller<br />
Driver Date: 6/3/2015<br />
Driver Version 14.5.0.1081<br />
<br />
Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller<br />
Driver Date: 10/1/2015<br />
Driver Version: 10.6.1001.2015</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the USBs in device manager and:</p>
<p>
</p><p>No yellow question marks in Device Manager, even when showing hidden devices.<br />
<br />
USB drivers report to be working ok.<br />
</p>
<p>I forgot to mention I am connecting to the internet via the wireless NIC, which has the following driver data:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell Wireless 1704 802.11b/g/n (2.4GHz)<br />
Driver Date: 7/30/2015<br />
Driver Version: 7.35.295.0<br />
</p>
<p>The PC is still restarting. I uploaded the last minidump to the same One Drive folder (file name 122115-6125-01.dmp).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you please check it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like the restarting is occurring if I try to download big files. At this time I am connected only to file this report, but the last time it restarted (and on several previous restarts) while donwloading a 1 GB file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to try the download again after filing this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: I called DELL support since the PC is still under warranty and their solution is to provide me with an installation media for the OS the PC came out of the factory and forget about Windows 10. :(&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you, EckiS!</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no reported solution. I looked for an updated driver and found none, but I also found that the last approved wireless driver for my PC Brand and Model is version 6.30.223.227 from 1/28/2014. I downgraded my driver to this version and now I am trying
 to download the 1 GB file... I'll let you know if it works. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit 12/23/2015.<br />
It seems that installing the driver 6.30.223.227 (that is advertised for Windows 8.1 64 bits) solved the problem. I was able to download the 1 GB file and haven't had a restart. :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit 12/30/2015</p>
<p>I tried to connect a bluetooth device and as soon as I asked to connect, the pc restarted.</p>
<p>I am on vacation now, I will try deleting the device, adding it and pairing it again before trying a new connection. That will be on January the 4th.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll let you know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit 01/05/2016</p>
<p>I deleted the bluetooth device and added it again. I was able to conect it without problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also downloaded a 2 GB file and had no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess the issue is solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit 01/08/2015</p>
<p>I was wrong. The problem persists. I have had two more restarts trying to use a Jabra Talk bluetooth device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The network driver seems to work fine, but if I try to connect the Jabra Talk, the PC restarts.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>windows 10- no audio output devices installed - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            windows 10- no audio output devices installed</h2>
                    <p>Please bear with me this could be quite verbose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I made and run a custom built desktop computer. The mother board is an Asus m4a785td-v evo.</p>
<p>It has an amd athlon IIx2 250 processer @3Ghz.</p>
<p>It runs 2x2gb kingston ddr3 1333 (pc10600) ram.</p>
<p>I run a Galaxy Nvidia gts450 , 1gb ddr5 hdmi video card.</p>
<p>I have been running a 5.1 speaker system on this unit for several years with win 7 ultimate perfectly.</p>
<p>I very recently accepted to upgrade to win 10. </p>
<p>After installation and a few updates from windows My new system is running sweet as, except that there is no sound.</p>
<p>I have tried very many of the fixes suggested on these forums and others, all to no avail. When I right click the volume icon &nbsp;and click on playback devices it opens the playback devices window but there are no entries listed, right clicking in this window
 reveals that both "show disabled" and "show disconnected" devices are both checked.</p>
<p>As a temporary workaround I popped in a creative labs soundblaster 5.1 vx pci audio card, now, the computer recognizes this card and installs drivers for it , but this is also not listed in the playback devices window, and you guessed it, still no sound.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The mother board has its own hdmi out jack, and on board high def sound, so what is happening that the computer now doesn't recognize it's own hardware devices.</p>
<p>All and any suggestions will be perused and tested so if you think you might be able to help, please post.</p>
<p>p.s. :- I have tried most if not all of the normal ways to solve this, so try to be innovative, thanks.</p>

<p>OK, so after logging in to MS to do some more research on my win10 build I realised that I had installed the rtm(release to manufacturing) build and thought, I wonder if I can go back to the insiders build and start again. I did just that, installed insiders
 build #10240 and when it finished and rebooted everything was working as it should be. I now once again have full sound functionality, go figure. I was up for hours figuring this out, so I hope although it sounds over simple it worked for me. My faith had
 wavered, but it is returned. I'm finding "10" to be a quite agreeable OS. Thanks for your input PP, it made me wonder. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

            I am currently experiencing the exact problem, I attempted all of these steps at least three times but none of them seem to solve the problem. Do you have any other solutions?

    <title>Win7 HD corruption&#47;disappear&#47;reappear - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> angelsix  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win7 HD corruption&#47;disappear&#47;reappear</h2>
                    Lately my HD seems to have become unstable, although I doubt it is a physical hard drive problem. I'll be working on my computer, then a directory will be reported as "Documents not accessible. The file or directory is corrupted and unreadable". When I
 re-boot, I get to the Win screen, then Win7 reverts to a DOS screen and says my drive needs to be checked, and will be checked unless I press a key. Here's the weird part -- if I do press a key (aborting the scan), when Win7 restarts, the folder usually will
 be back, just fine &amp; dandy. However, I think there have been a couple of times where the file didn't come back until I let Win7 do it's disc check &amp; repair. This has been going on for several weeks. At first I was frightened by the problem, but since I always
 get my files back after a re-boot, I've been putting up with it because I've various other problems I've been dealing with.<br />
<br />
If I let Win7 do the disk check, it will usually claim to find and restore some orphaned photo files. I noticed Win7 seemed to be recovering some of the same files over and over again (i.e. the file would be recovered, then when chkdsk runs subsequently, ut
 finds &amp; recovers the same file) from the same folder, so I just took them out of that folder and put them in a new folder.&nbsp; Since then, when Windows runs chkdsk, none of those files have been reported as recovered orphans.<br />
<br />
The folder disappearance is weird, in that it seems to be random. E.g., a subdirectory of my Documents file will become unavailable. But, it will still show in Windows Explorer -- just gives me the error message when I click on it. Or, the whole Documents folder
 will become unavailable. Or, my Pictures folder will become unavailable.<br />
<br />
I usually notice the problem when my Microsoft Outlook 2010 data file that becomes unavailable. Then when I try to open it, Outlook will say it can't open because the file is corrupted or unavailable. My primary Outlook data (.pst) file is 3.7 gb. It was bigger,
 but I've archived 3.3gb of it into an archive folder. With the modern trend for people to send me giant attachments, I am worried about this file being so huge, but am not finding any clear indication Outlook isn't supposed to be able to handle monster files.
 I preferred the Eudora approach, of having email folders each as a separate file, with attachments all stored separately, but ... I digress.<br />
<br />
I've tried Googling for this problem, without success.<br />
<br />
I run Norton anti-virus, fully up to date. Have also run a couple of free Internet virus checks -- don't seem to have a virus.<br />
<br />
I've tried disabling a few of my background programs to see if they were causing the problem, but no luck with that so far.<br />
<br />
I have Raid1 (dual, mirrored) Hitachi 2tb hard drive as my secondary (D:) drive for all my data. I use the Win7 RAID. I just ran the Western Digital /&nbsp; Hitachi DFT diagnostic program, running it's long test. The test reported no problems.&nbsp; When the test was
 done, I had to re-boot -- because I had directories that had become unavailable.&nbsp; The Windows Explorer properties for my D drive(s) says I've used 493 gb of 181 tb capacity.&nbsp; So, it doesn't seem that replacing the hard drives will solve the problem.<br />
<br />
My computer is a mongrel -- I've been building (and re-building) my own computer for decades.
<br />
<br />
BTW: Several months ago Win7 started reporting potential failure of my SSD primary drive. That seemed odd (they do tend to last a long time), but I'd been meaning to replace it anyway, as 128gb had turned out to be too small (after ~ 2 yrs), so I replaced it
 with a 256gb SSD, and have gotten no complaints from Windows about it since. I never had the problem with my D: drive before reinstalling Win7 on my new SSD. There always seem to be infinite possible solutions to my computer problems, but the possibility that
 there's something wrong with the Win7 installation is one of them.<br />
<br />
Because I've put off dealing with this problem, I don't know when it started, or whether I installed any software just before it started.&nbsp; I do know that when I first restarted my computer, after replacing the C: SSD a few months ago, I did not have this problem.<br />
<br />
I know Windows does some error logging, but don't know where to find those files or how to interpret them.<br />
<br />
Help?<br />

            SOLVED, I guess.&nbsp; Instead of just intermittent files/directories being unavailable until I re-booted (usually being able to have chkdsk skip it's run and I still got whatever it was back) ... suddenly my D drive was completely unavailable.&nbsp; The hardware
 showed up, but chkdsk couldn't find it.&nbsp; Then started having problems with my C drive.&nbsp; Gave up -- reinstalled Windows.&nbsp; Eventually also got error about Marvell drive controller, but I think that got avoided by installing Gigabyte drivers.&nbsp; Anyway, have been
 busy completely restoring everything.&nbsp; Don't think I lost anything, thanks to SyncBack Pro and my external (USB) drive.&nbsp; Still, a gigantic pain.&nbsp; Coulda' been a million other software issues, no way to tell, but the problem seems gone now.<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
1. Are you using a Kodak printer? If yes, what is the model number?<br />
2. Did you make any hardware or software changes to your computer prior to the issue occurring?<br />
<br />
I'd suggest you <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Printer-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
open the printer troubleshooter</a> and check if that helps.<br />

    <title>Xbox One digital games not working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One digital games not working</h2>
                    
<p>Could anybody help me with the following issue?</p>
<p>I can't access most of my digital Xbox One games.</p>
<p>Everytime I try to start one of those games (Batman: Arkham Knight, The Witcher 3) a prompt shows up asking me whether I own the game or not. I bought these games online via kinguin.com and they used to work normally. A few games bought in the same way are
 still working perfectly.</p>

<p>I contacted Xbox Support, but we couldn't resolve the issue.</p>
<p>These are the things I've already tried:</p>
<p>- removing and re-adding account;</p>
<p>- factory resetting console;</p>
<p>- checking for updates (negative);</p>
<p>- deleting game and reinstalling (did not show up on ready to install);</p>
<p>- hard resetting console;</p>
<p>- begging my console to behave.</p>

<p>Nothing worked, the support chat worker checked my account and confirmed that I owned the licenses for all of the games that weren't working, but that my console failed to recognise those licenses.</p>

<p>Do you own the game or are they obtained through Home Xbox sharing? If you own the game I suggest contacting Xbox Live Support again and ask them to remove the license from your account to one of the games that's not working, then add it back. Just to see
 if it works. since you've pretty much tried all other troubleshooting methods</p>
<p>I've had a similar issue in the past and that was the solution to it, let me know how it goes</p>
