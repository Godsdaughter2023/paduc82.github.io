            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
Every time you open a picture in Paint, it will show its original size. Zooming affects how you view the image; it does not change the size of the picture in the file or how it will print. If you zoom in or out on pictures in Thumbnail view, you will zoom in
 or out on all pictures at once. There is no option in Paint to format the view of a picture on one specific size. However, if you have any suggestions, you may send it to us through the

<h2>            trace ip address</h2>
                    I'm receiving nuisance emails from someone claiming to be me. I need to trace their IP address to find who or at least where in the UK these emails are being sent from. I think I know who the culprit is but I need some form of identification before proceeding.

            <p>Hello KatieP11,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unless the IP address is a static one you will find that the IP address will change everytime that that person comes online. It is usual for businesses to have static IP address, all other mortals have disposable ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could try this site: <a href="http://whatismyipaddress.com/ip-lookup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://whatismyipaddress.com/ip-lookup</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You need to make a complaint to the IP provider, they, in turn, can usually trace the original IP address and who the people it was issues to on that day.</p>

<h3> bash7  say:</h3>
<h2>            WMC Error</h2>
                    My <strong>WMC</strong> has started giving <strong>error messages</strong> when trying to use Live&nbsp;TV and Set up TV Signal. When Live TV selected it does not work anymore and gives
<strong>Mess#1:</strong> "Set Top Box Error, To fix set up&nbsp;TV signal" on gray screen;&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>Mess #2:</strong> " TV Tuner Viewing or Listening Conflict, do I want to take control (yes or no)? When trying to Setup TV Signal in settings, I get to Downloading
 TV Options then <strong>Mess #3:</strong> "Media Center not working, close and restart media center" on gray screen.<br />
<br />
I worked on the phone with Dell&nbsp;and we tried&nbsp;a lot such as viewing problem reports, running fixes, turning things off, restoring system to previous dates,&nbsp;and ultimately reconfigured my OS.
<strong>After OS reinstall</strong> everything seemed fine. I was able to go through the Set Up&nbsp;TV Signal and Program remote w/IR and finished. Everything worked incl TV but one button on remote needed to be reset and when going back through Set Up TV Signal
 again to redo the #1 button. <strong>It happened again</strong>, <strong>Mess #1:</strong> "Media Center Not Working, close and restart media center" on gray screen.&nbsp;<strong>Trouble Report</strong> info says that
<strong>capability problem</strong> with <strong>rc_Vista.exe</strong> and <strong>
ehshell.exe</strong> <strong>files</strong>. Tech also worked with these files before redo of OS. Some update must be doing this but don't know. Help please,&nbsp;I checked other questions and answers and none helped. Thank you.<br />

            Hi Bash7,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting to answers.microsoft.com<br />
<br />
We've - I've been researching this to find of further solution.&nbsp; To me it appears that when changes or additions to the IR setup takes place, an overwrite of the ehshell.exe remote event is handled by a different app.&nbsp; The specifics, of certainty, &nbsp;I'm not
 aware of and that I am sorry to state. <br />
<br />
You may want to escalate this case to a Customer Service Representative.<br />
<br />
The support numbers can be found by following the information listed at <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/319726" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/319726</a><br />
<br />
This might be a paid for service so verify that before contacting them.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Thanks for posting to our forum and best regard involving this.<br />
<br />
If you do not want to go that route, instead of reinstalling you might try an INPLACE UPGRADE to see if you can get the&nbsp;WMC file back in&nbsp;control over the third party app that I believe has seized it.<br />
<br />
Here&nbsp;is&nbsp;information involving the INPLACE UPGRADE -&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
<p><span><em><strong>How to complete an In-Place Upgrade</strong></em></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Note: After performing In-Place Upgrade, your personal data and installed programs will not be removed but we may need to run Windows Update to install all the available updates
 for your system to update these system files to the current version. This troubleshooting process is time consuming. Your patience is highly appreciated.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you would like to perform the In-place Upgrade, let’s refer to the following steps.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Start the computer by using the current Operating System.
</span></p>
<p><span>2. Insert the Windows Vista DVD in the computer's DVD drive.
</span></p>
<p><span>3. Use one of the following procedures, as appropriate:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>• If Windows automatically detects the DVD, the Install now screen appears. Click Install now.
</span></p>
<p><span>• If Windows does not automatically detect the DVD, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click Start, click Run, type Drive:\setup.exe, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>Note Drive is the drive letter of the computer's DVD drive.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click Install now.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4. When you reach the "Which type of installation do you want?" screen, click Upgrade to upgrade the current operating system to Windows Vista.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please run Windows Update again as you will need to download and install the most current updates.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you do not have the Windows Vista Installation DVD, I suggest contacting your PC manufacturer to order a backup disk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3> tyrellmd  say:</h3>
<h2>            CPU capped at 0.99GHz - Surface book 2 HELP&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Just bought the surface book 2 two days ago (i7 8650u, 8gb ram, 256gb SSD, 1050 GTX) and noticed it was super slow compared to my desktop (i7 4790k, 16gb ram, 250gb SSD, no GPU).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is literally 8 times slower than the desktop and it takes forever to load programs (for instance when I open task manager on desktop it takes 1 second to load, but on the surface book 2 it takes 8 seconds) . So I went into task manager (task manager&gt;performance&gt;CPU)
 and realized the CPU actual speed stays at 0.99 GHz or lower no matter what. Even though it is supposed to be 1.90 GHz and turbo boost of 4.2 GHz. In addition to this the base speed says 2.11 GHz even though it is advertised as 1.90 GHz which I found weird.
 My "desktop" actual speed goes to 4.4 GHz often and base speed says 4.00 GHz. So I think something is definitely wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also in all battery modes CPU stays at 0.99 GHz or lower.</p>
<p>CPU, Memory, Disk, GPU are nowhere near 100% utilisation either so these are not causing the performance issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HELP?&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi steve_499,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks for writing to Microsoft Communities. Before starting with the troubleshooting steps, I need the following information:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This problem is due to one or more profiles under
<b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows</b></span></p>
<p><b><span>NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList with missing ProfileImagePath</span></b><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>To check whether you have missing profiles:</span></p>
<p><span>a) Open
<b>regedit</b>, navigate to the above registry key. (<b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList</b>) Expand the list</span></p>
<p><span>b) Click on each of the profiles listed. The first 3 profiles should have ProfileImagePath value of respectively.</span></p>
<p><b><span>%SystemRoot%\System32\Config\SystemProfile,</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>%SystemRoot%\ServiceProfiles\LocalService, and</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>%SystemRoot%\ServiceProfiles\NetworkService</span></b></p>
<p><span>c) Starting from the 4 profile, the ProfileImagePath should contain path to the user profiles on your machine, such as<b>C:\users\Christine</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>d) If one or more of the profile has no profile image, then you have missing profiles.</span></p>
<p><span>To work around this, delete the profile in question (<b>Caution: The registry contains critical settings
 that are necessary for your system to function properly. Take extra caution while making changes</b>)</span></p>
<p><span>a) First, export the
<b>ProfileList</b> key for safekeeping. (Right click on the key, choose “<b>Export</b>”, and save it to the desktop.)</span></p>
<p><span>b)
<b>Right </b>click on the profile in question, choose<b>delete</b>. Try backup again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> This section, method, or task
 contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify
 it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following link.<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Back-up-the-registry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Back-up-the-registry</a>

<span>I looked at the ProfileList and my profile image path has my one user profile OK. That does not seem to be a problem.<br />

<p><span>This is&nbsp; a new computer and I applied all windows updates and installed some other software before I attempted to create the system image.</span></p>

<p><span>Hi steve_499,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks for writing to Microsoft Communities. Before starting with the troubleshooting steps, I need the following information:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This problem is due to one or more profiles under <b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows</b></span></p>
<p><b><span>NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList with missing ProfileImagePath</span></b><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>To check whether you have missing profiles:</span></p>
<p><span>a) Open <b>regedit</b>, navigate to the above registry key. (<b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList</b>) Expand the list</span></p>
<p><span>b) Click on each of the profiles listed. The first 3 profiles should have ProfileImagePath value of respectively.</span></p>
<p><b><span>%SystemRoot%\System32\Config\SystemProfile,</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>%SystemRoot%\ServiceProfiles\LocalService, and</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>%SystemRoot%\ServiceProfiles\NetworkService</span></b></p>
<p><span>c) Starting from the 4 profile, the ProfileImagePath should contain path to the user profiles on your machine, such as<b>C:\users\Christine</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>d) If one or more of the profile has no profile image, then you have missing profiles.</span></p>
<p><span>To work around this, delete the profile in question (<b>Caution: The registry contains critical settings that are necessary for your system to function properly. Take extra caution while making changes</b>)</span></p>
<p><span>a) First, export the <b>ProfileList</b> key for safekeeping. (Right click on the key, choose “<b>Export</b>”, and save it to the desktop.)</span></p>
<p><span>b) <b>Right </b>click on the profile in question, choose<b>delete</b>. Try backup again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully.
 For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following link.<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Back-up-the-registry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Back-up-the-registry</a>

The native image creation tool is the first of its kind in Windows. It is immature in several ways in that it lacks reliability and has poor functionality. Third party products such as Acronis TruImage that have been around for a while run circles around it.
 I prefer to spend a little money on such a solution rather than being let down by this marginal tool.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Removing the Reparse point from the library is only the solution for your backup error. You can also perform a scan on your computer. Even after
 scanning, this problem persist then you have to remove the Reparse point. There are some issues of backups in Windows 7
<br />
<br />
<br />
Before removing the Reparse point try to take the back up by stopping the Antivirus, SQL, etc. Many times the anti virus causes the issues. So stop the running processes and then take the backups. I know there is very less chance for success but before removing
 the reparse point from the library you should try this once. If you are not able to take backups even after stopping the process, then there is only way by removing the Reparse point.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A file or directory can contain a
<em><span>reparse point</span></em>, which is a collection of user-defined data. When an application sets a reparse point, it stores this data, plus a
<em><span>reparse tag</span></em>, which uniquely identifies the data it is storing. When the file system opens a file with a reparse point, it attempts to find the file system filter associated with the data format
 identified by the reparse tag. If a file system filter is found, the filter processes the file as directed by the reparse data. If a file system filter is not found, the file open operation fails.<br />
<br />
<br />
If the reparse point points to a location that contains any compressed file format (multimedia files, .zip files, and so on), you receive an error message that resembles the following: To work around this problem, remove this reparse point from the library,
 and then run the backup wizard again. To back up content for this reparse point, select the absolute path of this location from the Windows Backup configuration user interface.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Just check whether your library (windows user&nbsp;library ,u can find it on your my computer left side pan) contains any zipped &nbsp;files from backup location (that is your external drive)<br />
<br />
<br />
Windows Backup and Restore problems that you may experience when a reparse point folder or its subfolder is added to a user library in Windows 7.<br />
<br />
By design, Windows Backup does not traverse reparse points on a computer. However, if a reparse point is directly added to a Windows 7 Library, or if any of the child nodes of a reparse point is directly added to a Windows 7 Library, Windows Backup traverses
 these locations. This could cause several issues during the backup process.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Have
 you tried to disable User Account Control (UAC) temporarily and check if you have the same issue?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can try the below methods to fix this issue.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest that you disable User Account Control (UAC) temporarily and run the programs.</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/Turn-User-Account-Control-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows7/Turn-User-Account-Control-on-or-off</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>This can also be caused by User account corruption. I suggest that you create a new user account and check if you have the same issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To create a new user profile, follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: To create a new profile, you must first create a new user account. When the account is created, a profile will also be created.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Open User Accounts by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking User Accounts and Family Safety
 and then clicking User Accounts.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Click Manage another account.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Click Create a new account.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Type the name you want to give the user account, click an account type, and then click Create Account.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: Do not give the existing user name for the new user account.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check out this article that will give you information on ‘How to Fix a corrupted user profile’:</span></span></p>

<p>Hi <span>Serendipitocity,</span></p>
<p>If it is a compatible ReadyBoostdrive, Vista will detect it and display a prompt asking what you would like to do with this drive.<br />
The ReadyBoost&nbsp;service&nbsp;is started automatically. If you stop, or disable, this service Vista will not prompt for whether or not you want to use this drive to speed up your Computer using ReadyBoost. &nbsp;If that is happening to you, do the following to enable and
 start the ReadyBoost service.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the <strong>Start</strong> button. </li><li>In the search field on the Start button type <strong>services.msc</strong> and press the enter key.
</li><li>When User Access Control asks if you would like to continue, do so or provide administrative account credentials to do so.
</li><li>Scroll down to and double-click on the <strong>ReadyBoost</strong> service. <br />
<ol>
<li>Change the Startup Type drop down menu to to <strong>Automatic</strong>. </li><li>Then press the <strong>Start</strong> button to start the service. </li><li>Press the <strong>OK</strong> button. </li><li>Now close the Services console. </li></ol>
</li></ol>
<p>The ReadyBoost service should now be started and if you reinsert the flash drive it will prompt you to use the drive for ReadyBoost.</p>
<p>If this is not happening, then go into Event Viewer and see if there are any errors in the application or system logs.</p>
<p>You can also use the <a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial136.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article here</a> and the section on Whether ReadyBoost is working or not.</p>
<p>Please reply back and give an update on whether ReadyBoost is working for you.</p>

<p>Hey Rhino, so far as I am aware there is no compatibility as of yet. I cant wait for them to add it though, I just get curious as to how it will arrive and in what form. I say this all the time but an embedded smartglass wont go a miss.

<p>Agree Tzar and Lofty, that and I just like comparing with random people when I am on the site.</p>
<p>Rhino, thanks dude. It does seem like the only logical explanation. Smartglass tracks pretty much everything that the site does for 360 and more. If it was my choice, I would embed smartglass into the site and whenever a forum card is clicked it just takes
 it to there.</p>

<p>It's completely ridiculous that Trueachievements can track both Xbox One and 360 activity, and Micorosoft's own website can not. It's not like the launch of the console sprang up on them and they had no time to prepare. The fact that we're going on 5 months
 in to this new generation and there is still no signs of compatibility, is irrefutable proof that Microsoft just doesn't give a crap.</p>

<p>i assume the gamerscore jaz is because they pretty much wanna get you on smartglass but i agree, it needs better forum software and the one should definitely be the main focus of the site, just update the gamercard based on what they have, if its 360 keep
 it 360 if its xbox one change it to xbox one, but the forum definitely needs bringing right upto speed even phpbb looks better and its free :/</p>

    <title>Folders do not remember their desktop location when reopened in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> srenovo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Folders do not remember their desktop location when reopened in windows 8</h2>
                    <p>This is difficult to explain but here goes - </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a vast music collection and it is backed up in four different locations on my wired network.</p>
<p>I bought a new computer with windows 8 ( more power - newer I-7 processor, more ram, and a bigger internal HDD and Windows8.</p>
<p>Each of the four computers in the network has a copy of each of the albums that I have ripped over the past 11 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until Windows 8, I have always been able to manage those files with relative ease.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have always been able to open a copy of the folder containing new files to be distributed in a details view window and after windows 7 or XP learned where I wanted it to pop up in DETAILS View on the monitor screen the folder would pop up in that location.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use a 27" monitor so imagine 5 detail view windows lined up side by side.&nbsp; Left to right they would be New files window, HTPC window, NAS window, Laptop Window , And Desktop window.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once I trained these earlier versions of windows the folders would almost always pop up in this order and only occasionally would a folder pop up on top of wrong destination folder - BUT -
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>With windows8 that feature seems to be gone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am sure someone will respond - try this piece of software for doing what you do or here is the correct way but at 65 I find learning new things more tedious.&nbsp; I suppose there is a better way but this is my way and if at all possible I would like to stick
 with it as it has worked for me for 11 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So can any one tell me how to force windows 8 to act like XP or windows 7 for this issue.&nbsp; Constantly rearranging folders wears thin because of course the music files are separated into types to a small degree.&nbsp; i.e. each drive has A folder marked LOSSLESS
 MUSIC which each have folders with the following five categories:</p>
<p>1. Artists</p>
<p>2. Compilations</p>
<p>3. Christmas</p>
<p>4. Groups</p>
<p>5. Whitburn</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So when I open D drive on the HTPC I see the folder LOSSLESS MUSIC.&nbsp; when I double click on that folder up pops a window in details view that list the 5 folders I have described and if I double click on one of those&nbsp;daughter folders then I expect the new
 window to land on top of its mother folders.&nbsp; The same thing is true for each of the other computers on my network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I have to give up on windows 8 I will spend another $100+ to go back to windows 7 but MS made a mistake - because my friends look to me for advice on what to get for a new computer and unless MS comes out with a service pack that puts back the features
 one expects on a desktop w/o a touch screen - I will be "hard pressed" to recommend an OS that is really suited to tablets.&nbsp; I can see where this OS might be as good as or better than IOS but Apple isn't putting iOS on MacBooks or their desktops only on their
 phones and iPads. Not having the option for "Traditional Windows Layout" is a bad thing for older computer users.&nbsp; Apple knows better - they have two OSes
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated and if It can't be fixed back I go to windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi Srenovo,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft community!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Q 1: What operating system has been installed on other Computers?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2: Is everything connected to workgroup?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would recommend you to try the below given Method and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method:
</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Change folder permissions in order to share
<span>system folders. You will notice that
<em><span>Share</span></em> option in File Properties –&gt; Sharing tab is disabled for system folders; you can only use
<em><span>Advanced Sharing</span></em> option to share system folder with Homegroup users. It’s advisable to join a Homegroup (or other network group) before start sharing system folders
 .</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Open desktop from the start screen, right-click network icon in Windows 8 system tray, and select
<em><span>Open Network and Sharing Center</span></em>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the left pane, Click HomeGroup followed by Join now.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>It will open Join a Homegroup wizard, asking you to specify types of files that you want to share with Homegroup users.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Once you’ve specified the types of files, enter the Homegroup password to connect your PC to Homegroup network group.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Once you’re connected to Homegroup users, it shows all the shared libraries, devices and file types</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Now, right-click the system folder you want to share with others, and from
<em><span>Share with </span></em>menu, select
<em><span>Advanced sharing</span></em>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>It will take you directly to
<em><span>Sharing</span></em> tab to customize the sharing permissions. Now, click Advance Sharing</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<em><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></em><span>Enable
<em><span>Share this folder</span></em> from top-left corner of dialog box, and then click
<em><span>Permissions</span></em></span></p>
<p><em><span>&nbsp;</span></em></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>After clicking, it will open
<em><span>Permissions</span></em> window</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>To begin, click Add.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>This will open
<em><span>Select User or Groups</span></em> dialog. Here, you need to enter the object name(s) that you want to add to permission list. In order to easily include the homegroup user object
 name, click Advanced.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>It will open advanced view for selecting
<em><span>Users or Groups</span></em>. Click
<em><span>Find Now</span></em>, and then select
<em><span>HomeGroup User </span></em>from search results. Once done, click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>This will add
<em><span>HomeGroup User</span></em> object to
<em><span>Select Users Or Groups</span></em> window. Now, click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Upon click, it will add the HomeGroup User object to File Permission list, allowing you to configure file access permission. Just select the
<em><span>HomeGroup User </span></em>group, and enable
<em><span>Full Control</span></em> checkbox from
<em><span>Allow</span></em> column, present in
<em><span>Permission for HomeGroup Users
</span></em>section.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Once done, click Apply followed by OK. It will take you to
<em><span>Advanced Sharing</span></em> dialog. Clicking OK will share the system folder across the network. You may need to reboot the PC to let Homegroup users access shared system folder</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If you get ‘Windows cannot access the &lt;shared folder name&gt;’’ message while accessing the shared system folder from a remote location, make sure that
<em><span>Network Discovery</span></em> and
<em><span>File Sharing</span></em> options are enabled in
<em><span>Advanced Sharing </span></em>(accessible from Network and Sharing Center).</span></p>

<p>So can any one tell me how to force windows 8 to act like XP or windows 7 for this issue.&nbsp; Constantly rearranging folders wears thin because of course the music files are separated into types to a small degree.&nbsp; i.e. each drive has A folder marked LOSSLESS
 MUSIC which each have folders with the following five categories:</p>
<p>1. Artists</p>
<p>2. Compilations</p>
<p>3. Christmas</p>
<p>4. Groups</p>
<p>5. Whitburn</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So when I open D drive on the HTPC I see the folder LOSSLESS MUSIC.&nbsp; when I double click on that folder up pops a window in details view that list the 5 folders I have described and if I double click on one of those&nbsp;daughter folders then I expect the new
 window to land on top of its mother folders.&nbsp; The same thing is true for each of the other computers on my network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I have to give up on windows 8 I will spend another $100+ to go back to windows 7 but MS made a mistake - because my friends look to me for advice on what to get for a new computer and unless MS comes out with a service pack that puts back the features
 one expects on a desktop w/o a touch screen - I will be "hard pressed" to recommend an OS that is really suited to tablets.&nbsp; I can see where this OS might be as good as or better than IOS but Apple isn't putting iOS on MacBooks or their desktops only on their
 phones and iPads. Not having the option for "Traditional Windows Layout" is a bad thing for older computer users.&nbsp; Apple knows better - they have two OSes
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated and if It can't be fixed back I go to windows 7.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

The versions of the operating system are as follows</p>
<p>1. some form of Linux on the 2TB NAS - it is a Seagate go-flex and I do not use their software to access it - I just have it appear as a computer with a HDD over the network</p>
<p>2. one HDD is a 2TB HDD attached to a new HP dv7 - 7247 laptop widows 8 - the problem machine!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>3. the HTPC has an internal 2GB HDD and it is windows 7</p>
<p>4. The final computer is also an&nbsp;HP laptop with an external 2TB and running Windows XP</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything seems to be connected to a workgroup&nbsp; BUT&nbsp; the windows 8 machine never mentioned a workgroup like the windows 7 machine&nbsp; - it just saw everyone on the network and allowed access to the files as they are all shared with each other since the network
 is wired and insulated from the internet.</p>

                    I received an Acer Aspire One (D250-1325)&nbsp;Netbook for Christmas with the following applying....Windows 7 Starter 32-bit; Intel Atom processor N270; 1 GB Memory; Multi-in-1 Card Reader.<br />
<br />
Before I start the process of trying to upgrade to Windows 7 Home, I want to know if this is even possible with the amount of memory I have on this netbook.&nbsp; Thanks in advance for any suggestions.

Becareful of how you word your responses. The OP has to purchase a Anytime Upgrade product key, they will not be given a product key simply by 'filling in the blanks'.

                    <span>I recently reset my windows 10 to factory default which is located on a 120gb Kingston SSD which i have had for around 2 and a
 half years, along with my other two drives a 1tb hybrid hard(3-4 years) drive and a 240gb SSD the kingston SA400S37/240G SSD A400 240 GB Solid State Drive (2.5 inch SATA 3) from amazon which i bought around a month ago. The SSD which i bought would be mainly
 for games and the hybrid for all other programs (streaming/office programs etc), both the Hybrid and the 120gb SSD are fine to my knowledge, i have not yet installed any thing onto the hybrid but the 120gb SSD has Discord/Chrome and runs without any problems,
 however the 240gb SSD does not wipe when it is formatted or cleaned through the CMD. If i was to delete all the files manually by selecting them all they do not show up in the recycling bin and when i refresh the SSD they reappear. This is also the case for
 formatting and cleaning the SSD through the CMD but the files re-appear over a short period of time rather than at once, i have also attempted to clean the SSD through the CCleaner program, which i believed to be successful as the files have not yet appeared
 to although a problem is still present, when i attempted to install the battle.net launcher to the SSD it was unsuccessful and upon trying to delete the folder i am given the error 0x80070570, which i believe is fairly simple to fix, but with this being the
 only file on the SSD it shows that 181gb is free of 223gb which is weird when the launcher is only around 300mb. I have attempted multiple virus scans for the SSD, although no viruses are detected. Although in the device manager the harddrive appears with
 the name 'SATAFIRM S11' which is new. I am running windows 10 at 64bit. </span>

<p>Hi <strong>Roadrunt</strong>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is one unusual behavior. If formatting the drive by normal means and through Command Prompt does not resolve the issue, I would suggest deleting the entire drive partition and recreate the partition using the
<strong>Disk Management</strong>. To do so, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Right-click</strong> on the <strong>Start</strong> menu, and select <strong>
Disk Management</strong>.</li><li><strong>Right-click</strong> on the partition that you want deleted/formatted, and select
<strong>Delete volume</strong>. This would make the entire disk unallocated.</li><li><strong>Right-click</strong> on the unallocated disk below and select <strong>
New Simple Volume</strong>.</li><li>Follow the instructions, configure your disk space allocation, drive letter assignment, tick
<strong>Format this volume with the following settings</strong> and <strong>Perform a quick format</strong>,
<strong>Next</strong>, then <strong>Finish</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, I highly recommend using the SSD manager software from the hardware manufacturer
<strong><a href="https://www.kingston.com/en/support/technical/ssdmanager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">website</a></strong> to utilize your SSD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>

            Hi Mary,
<div><br />
Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that you would like to enable the touch screen feature on your Windows 10 PC. We’ll certainly help you with this.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Refer the following link and follow the suggestions provided by Cyber_Defend_Team on Oct 5, 2014.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_update/how-to-enable-touch-screen-mode-in-windows-10/3ad4af72-524a-4972-96cd-dc1131f3ea45">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_update/how-to-enable-touch-screen-mode-in-windows-10/3ad4af72-524a-4972-96cd-dc1131f3ea45</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong></p>
<p>Try the following steps to enable touch screen.<br />
1.&nbsp;Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong>, open <strong>Device Manager</strong>.<br />
2.&nbsp;Search for <strong>Human Interface Devices</strong>. Expand it.<br />
3.&nbsp;Right-click on <strong>HID-compliant touch screen.</strong><br />
4.&nbsp;From the list of options, select <strong>Enable </strong>and click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before enabling the touch screen feature, I would suggest you to update the drivers to avoid any issues.</p>
<p>Please refer the article “<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293">How to: Install and Update drivers in Windows 10</a><strong>”

            <p>Thank you, I followed these steps and was surprised to find that the touch screen was already marked as "enabled". &nbsp;However, touch screen is still not working at all. &nbsp;So I went ahead and looked for any update to the drivers. &nbsp;The Wizard responded that the
 most up-to-date driver was already installed. &nbsp;So I disabled the touch screen, rebooted, then enabled the touch screen again and rebooted again. I hoped this would resolve it. It did not. &nbsp;My touch screen is marked as "enabled" but still does not work! &nbsp;I
 guess I'll have to give up unless anyone has any ideas? &nbsp;Is there some other way the touch screen would be disabled even though it shows as enabled in the device manager? &nbsp;</p>

                    It used to be possible to add mobile phone numbers to Skype contacts. This functionality is still there in Skype desktop, but I am not able to find an option to add a mobile number to existing Skype contact on mobile anymore. Neither am I able to access
 mobile numbers that I have previously added to my Skype contacts. Am I missing something, or is this option now gone?

            Hi Rommell. I will send the feedback, sure. However, this is not a recommendation for improvement. Rather, it is functionality that has gone missing. The removal of this feature, along with burying user Skype wallet data, has driven my switch to rival
 VOIP software and made me cancel all Skype subscriptions because of the amount of frustration that came with the update. I hope that Skype team takes this into account and focuses more on user experience rather than the looks of things going forward.

            I had the trouble finding it too but this option is still there, Right click on the contact and select view profile. This will open a window which allows you to add a number in the ususal way. I hope this helps avoid frustration for other people.

Skype on my laptop has alternative mobile numbers for many of my contacts. &nbsp;I cannot access these on the new version of Skype on my iPhone, crazy! &nbsp;Further, getting support is like putting a camel through the eye of a needle, impossible!

 tried using a previous system restore point earlier today but that was only a temporary fix. &nbsp;Can somebody help me? &nbsp;Did the latest update cause this or do I have malware that turns blue text yellow in order to hurt my eyes? &nbsp;If the former, do I have to wait
 for a new update or would upgrading to Windows 10 fix it? &nbsp;If the latter, how do I find it because I have used Norton and Malwarebytes and they have come up empty.</p>
<p>*Edit*</p>
<p>So I tried switching to a new wallpaper/theme and the yellow text went away. &nbsp;I then deleted my old theme and recreated it and the yellow text is still not present, but I have no idea if this is a permanent or temporary fix.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have mentioned that after changing the wallpaper/screen saver the issue went away. The issue could be if the old wallpaper&nbsp;image get corrupted or&nbsp;there is some change in its setting. Just for satisfaction you may try to check if there is some system
 file corruption. As you have mentioned that security software didn't find anything. So, there might be a chance that there is some system file corruption.</p>

 &nbsp;What is the cause? &nbsp;Can updating to Windows 10 also fix the problem?
