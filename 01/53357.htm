<h2>            Recovery error code&#58; 0xc000000f</h2>
                    <p>My laptop is showing the error message in the photo.&nbsp; I do not have the recovery tools to repair my laptop, nor would I be comfortable doing it myself.&nbsp; &nbsp;So I took it to a computer repair service and they say that they tested it and there is "No Drive Detected",
 and that I need to buy a new hard drive.&nbsp; Is it possible that I need a new drive or are they just trying to sell me something?&nbsp; I would appreciate any assistance regarding this.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

            Hi DHS#1 
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Your Windows 10 installation is currently in an inoperable state. 
<br />
<br />Here are some things you can try...
<br />
<br />Power on and off your computer three times
<br />
<br />How do you do that?
<br />
<br />Power on, when you see the Windows Logo - power off
<br />
<br />Power on, when you see the Windows Logo - power off
<br />
<br />Power on, it will then your computer will boot into the Advanced Recovery environment
<br />
<br />You might be asked to sign in with your Microsoft Account or Local Account password. 
<br />
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />
<br />Click System Restore, see if you can go back to an earlier time.
<br />
<br />If not, boot into the recovery environment again, then try performing a startup repair.
<br />
<br />Perform the startup repair a couple more times then restart again to see if you are able to boot to the desktop successfully. 
<br />
<br />If that does not work, boot into the recovery environment, then click 'Go back to previous version of Windows'
<br />
<br />If that does not work.
<br />
<br />Power on and off your computer three times
<br />On the third time, your computer will boot into the Advanced Recovery environment
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Reset this PC
<br />Click Keep my files
<br />Choose your account
<br />Enter your password
<br />Click Continue
<br />Click Reset
<br />
<br />If that does not work.
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />My name is Fernando.  I am an Independent Advisor.  I am here to guide you with question about mirroring your laptop and tv.
<br />
<br />To be able to do this depends on the input capabilites of your TV and video output capabilities your laptop has.
<br />
<br />What is the brand and model of your TV and laptop?
<br />
<br />Respectfully,

            Hello May_I_C 21
<br />
<br />You can do it through  cable hdmi or vga, it is depend what connection your tv or computer support.
<br />
<br />Keep in mind that if you tv include wireless conection may be it is possible to connect your pc without cable, it is more confortable that way, review your TV manual.
<br />
<br />Also you can purchase some wireless device for your tv to make a conneccion with you computer through the hdmi port in case that it is not supported.
<br />
<br />Let me know if I can help you further!
<br />
<br />Thanks

            Hi Susan.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />We have no way to know what all you tried, so may repeat some things since you didn't bother to tell us:
<br />
<br />
<br />Update your Chipset and USB drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page for your full model number, HP Serial Number, or Dell Service tag from the sticker on PC.
<br />
<br />  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br />
<br />If no newer or this doesn't help, then go to the USB category in Device Manager, open each Enhanced, Hub and Host controller, from Driver tab select Roll back if available, or if not choose Uninstall.  
<br />
<br />If your keyboard and mouse are USB, first program the power button to effect the needed restart after Rolling back or uninstalling the driver.  Go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do to choose Shutdown. 
<br />
<br />Run the Hardware Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.
<br />
<br /> Recent Windows Updates are causing device problems in Windows 10, including USB flash and external drives.  You should be able to access and back up your files on another PC.  Then here are some things to try:
<br />
<br />You can check which Updates were installed just before this happened, then uninstall them at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History - look first for installed drivers.  Then you can hide these Updates using the Hide Updates tool:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also try to System Restore to a point before this happened, then check for Updates using the Hide Updates Tool to block the Updates offered:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            The $200 price has kept me away.&nbsp; If anyone can confirm that it works I will give it a go.&nbsp; Currently using the Kingston 64 gig which set me back about $50.&nbsp; If I see one for sale at Costco ill buy it and give it a try because I can always take it back
 to Costco even if opened.

            <p>I have a Surface Pro 2 and have been using Sandisk 64gb Micro SDXC card with it without any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Last month I thought I would try out a Sandisk 128gb Micro SDXC card - despite it being pretty pricey in my city.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I found the card to be working intermittently. When inserting the card it&nbsp;was recognized and usable,. But frequently the card was unreadable after a short period of inactivity. The only way then was to reboot or eject and re-insert the card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I complained to Sandisc- who asked me to return the card and arranged for shipping a new card from the US.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I find that same problems that I faced earlier were recurring with the new 128gb card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a solution to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I look forward to responses on this issue</p>

            <p>I had a 128 GB card, marked as SanDisk, packaged as such, that had similar problems. Got it really cheap on Ebay. Had similar problems. Also dropped data during a copy (write operation). It was formatted as FAT32. Tried to format as extFat and NTSF. Really
 got things screwed up. Became unreradable and unable to reformat. Good thing it was really cheap. Waiting for Black Friday after Thanksgiving. Maybe the price will come down locally.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I'm the opposite. &nbsp;I love opening my laptop and seeing a different, often awe inspiring, image. &nbsp;My problem is that some of these images are of landscapes and although I can sometimes 'print screen' and do an inverse image search to get a clue to where the
 photograph is taken, often this fails. &nbsp;Is there &nbsp;anywhere this information is stored or is their anyway Microsoft could incorporate a title/location in these opening screens.</p>
<p>

<div>Are you joined to a domain? Sometimes group policy and/or firewall rules prevent</div>
<div>Miracast from working (Charms, devices, project...)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also VPN software and virtualization software might interfere.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Can you clarify your environment as you mention W 8.1 Enterprise.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;Also, some Samsung TV's (most?) aren't Miracast certified and implement a part of the Miracast standard. But let's start with your environment.</div>

<h3> kirinax11  say:</h3>
<h2>            Want to change Windows Ultimate 32 bit to 64 bit</h2>
                    I&nbsp;received&nbsp;a Windows 7 Ultimate during the Windows 7 IT launch event a couple years back, but it didn't come with a 64 bit version and I now wish to upgrade it to a 64 bit. So I have two questions: Will I be able to use the same key if I obtain a Windows
 7 Ultimate 64 bit System Builder? Am I able to get a disk replacement to get the 64 bit version of this from Microsoft?

<p>Also note that if you use a System Builders DVD to install the 64Bit version of Windows you will be agreeing to the License terms presented during the install AND the System Builder's license does not allow you to keep the PC for your own use, plus other
 limitations that you don't want to box yourself into. Use the 64Bit download I listed, it a retail version.</p>

He's using a retail key, which is&nbsp;what determines the license agreement, not the installation files. Stop confusing the user.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why waste band width downloading the same thing? See the following from the Windows 7 OEM license agreement, I don't see anything remotely different from a retail end user license:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>(What ultimately determines your license is the Product ID which will ultimately be from a retail channel because it was generated by a retail key.)</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MICROSOFT SOFTWARE LICENSE TERMS<br />
WINDOWS 7 PROFESSIONAL SERVICE PACK 1<br />
These license terms are an agreement between you and<br />
·&nbsp;the computer manufacturer that distributes the software with the computer, or<br />
·&nbsp;the software installer that distributes the software with the computer.<br />
Please read them. They apply to the software named above, which includes the media on which you received it, if any. Printed-paper license terms, which may come with the software take the place of any on-screen license terms. These terms also apply to any Microsoft<br />
·&nbsp;updates,<br />
·&nbsp;supplements,<br />
·&nbsp;Internet-based services, and<br />
·&nbsp;support services<br />
for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those other terms apply.<br />
If you obtain updates or supplements directly from Microsoft, Microsoft, and not the manufacturer or installer, licenses those to you.<br />
By using the software, you accept these terms. If you do not accept them, do not use the software. Instead, contact the manufacturer or installer to determine its return policy. You must comply with that policy, which might limit your rights or require you
 to return the entire system on which the software is installed.<br />
As described below, using the software also operates as your consent to the transmission of certain computer information during activation, validation and for Internet-based services.<br />
If you comply with these license terms, you have the rights below for each license you acquire.<br />
1.&nbsp;OVERVIEW.<br />
a.&nbsp;Software. The software includes desktop operating system software. This software does not include Windows Live services. Windows Live services are available from Microsoft under a separate agreement.<br />
b.&nbsp;License Model. The software is licensed on a per copy per computer basis. A computer is a physical hardware system with an internal storage device capable of running the software. A hardware partition or blade is considered to be a separate computer.<br />
2.&nbsp;INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.<br />
a.&nbsp;One Copy per Computer. The software license is permanently assigned to the computer with which the software is distributed. That computer is the “licensed computer.”<br />
b.&nbsp;Licensed Computer. You may use the software on up to two processors on the licensed computer at one time. Unless otherwise provided in these license terms, you may not use the software on any other computer.<br />
c.&nbsp;Number of Users. Unless otherwise provided in these license terms, only one user may use the software at a time on the licensed computer.<br />
d.&nbsp;Alternative Versions. The software may include more than one version, such as 32-bit and 64-bit. You may use only one version at one time. If the manufacturer or installer provides you with a one-time selection between language versions, you may use only
 the one language version you select.<br />
3.&nbsp;ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS.<br />
a.&nbsp;Multiplexing. Hardware or software you use to<br />
·&nbsp;pool connections, or<br />
·&nbsp;reduce the number of devices or users that directly access or use the software<br />
(sometimes referred to as “multiplexing” or “pooling”), does not reduce the number of licenses you need.<br />
b.&nbsp;Font Components. While the software is running, you may use its fonts to display and print content. You may only<br />
·&nbsp;embed fonts in content as permitted by the embedding restrictions in the fonts; and<br />
·&nbsp;temporarily download them to a printer or other output device to print content.<br />
c.&nbsp;Icons, Images and Sounds. While the software is running, you may use but not share its icons, images, sounds, and media. The sample images, sounds and media provided with the software are for your non-commercial use only.<br />
d.&nbsp;Use with Virtualization Technologies. Instead of using the software directly on the licensed computer, you may install and use the software within only one virtual (or otherwise emulated) hardware system on the licensed computer. When used in a virtualized
 environment, content protected by digital rights management technology, BitLocker or any full volume disk drive encryption technology may not be as secure as protected content not in a virtualized environment. You should comply with all domestic and international
 laws that apply to such protected content.<br />
e.&nbsp;Device Connections. You may allow up to 20 other devices to access software installed on the licensed computer to use only File Services, Print Services, Internet Information Services and Internet Connection Sharing and Telephony Services.<br />
f.&nbsp;Remote Access Technologies You may access and use the software installed on the licensed computer remotely from another device using remote access technologies as follows.<br />
·&nbsp;Remote Desktop. The single primary user of the licensed computer may access a session from any other device using Remote Desktop or similar technologies. A “session” means the experience of interacting with the software, directly or indirectly, through any
 combination of input, output and display peripherals. Other users may access a session from any device using these technologies, if the remote device is separately licensed to run the software.<br />
·&nbsp;Other Access Technologies. You may use Remote Assistance or similar technologies to share an active session.<br />
g.&nbsp;Media Center Extender. You may have five Media Center Extender sessions (or other software or devices which provide similar functionality for a similar purpose) running at the same time to display the software user interface or content on other displays
 or devices.<br />
h.&nbsp;Electronic Programming Guide. If the software includes access to an electronic programming guide service that displays customized television listings, a separate service agreement applies to the service. If you do not agree to the terms of the service agreement,
 you may continue to use the software, but you will not be able to use the electronic programming guide service. The service may contain advertising content and related data, which are received and stored by the software. The service is not available in all
 areas. Please consult the software information for instructions on accessing the service agreement.<br />
i.&nbsp;Related Media Information. If you request related media information as part of your playback experience, the data provided to you may not be in your local language. Some countries or regions have laws and regulations which may restrict or limit your ability
 to access certain types of content.<br />
j.&nbsp;Worldwide Use of the Media Center. Media Center is not designed for use in every country. For example, although the Media Center information may refer to certain features such as an electronic programming guide or provide information on how to configure
 a TV tuner, these features may not work in your area. Please refer to the Media Center information for a list of features that may not work in your area.<br />
4.&nbsp;MANDATORY ACTIVATION.<br />
Activation associates the use of the software with a specific computer. During activation, the software will send information about the software and the computer to Microsoft. This information includes the version, language and product key of the software,
 the Internet protocol address of the computer, and information derived from the hardware configuration of the computer. For more information, see go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=104609. By using the software, you consent to the transmission of this information.
 If properly licensed, you have the right to use the version of the software installed during the installation process up to the time permitted for activation. Unless the software is activated, you have no right to use the software after the time permitted
 for activation. This is to prevent its unlicensed use. You are not permitted to bypass or circumvent activation. If the computer is connected to the Internet, the software may automatically connect to Microsoft for activation. You can also activate the software
 manually by Internet or telephone. If you do so, Internet and telephone service charges may apply. Some changes to your computer components or the software may require you to reactivate the software. The software will remind you to activate it until you do.<br />
5.&nbsp;VALIDATION.<br />
a.&nbsp;Validation verifies that the software has been activated and is properly licensed. It also verifies that no unauthorized changes have been made to the validation, licensing, or activation functions of the software. Validation may also check for certain malicious
 or unauthorized software related to such unauthorized changes. A validation check confirming that you are properly licensed permits you to continue to use the software, certain features of the software or to obtain additional benefits. You are not permitted
 to circumvent validation. This is to prevent unlicensed use of the software. For more information, see go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=104610.<br />
b.&nbsp;The software will from time to time perform a validation check of the software. The check may be initiated by the software or Microsoft. To enable the activation function and validation checks, the software may from time to time require updates or additional
 downloads of the validation, licensing or activation functions of the software. The updates or downloads are required for the proper functioning of the software and may be downloaded and installed without further notice to you. During or after a validation
 check, the software may send information about the software, the computer and the results of the validation check to Microsoft. This information includes, for example, the version and product key of the software, any unauthorized changes made to the validation,
 licensing or activation functions of the software, any related malicious or unauthorized software found and the Internet protocol address of the computer. Microsoft does not use the information to identify or contact you. By using the software, you consent
 to the transmission of this information. For more information about validation and what is sent during or after a validation check, see go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=104611.<br />
c.&nbsp;If, after a validation check, the software is found to be counterfeit, improperly licensed, or a non-genuine Windows product, or if it includes unauthorized changes, then the functionality and experience of using the software will be affected. For example:<br />
Microsoft may<br />
·&nbsp;repair the software, and remove, quarantine or disable any unauthorized changes that may interfere with the proper use of the software, including circumvention of the activation or validation functions of the software; or<br />
·&nbsp;check and remove malicious or unauthorized software known to be related to such unauthorized changes; or<br />
·&nbsp;provide notice that the software is improperly licensed or a non-genuine Windows product;<br />
and you may<br />
·&nbsp;receive reminders to obtain a properly licensed copy of the software; or<br />
·&nbsp;need to follow Microsoft’s instructions to be licensed to use the software and reactivate;<br />
and you may not be able to<br />
·&nbsp;use or continue to use the software or some of the features of the software; or<br />
·&nbsp;obtain certain updates or upgrades from Microsoft.<br />
d.&nbsp;You may only obtain updates or upgrades for the software from Microsoft or authorized sources. For more information on obtaining updates from authorized sources see go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=104612.<br />
6.&nbsp;POTENTIALLY UNWANTED SOFTWARE. If turned on, Windows Defender will search your computer for “spyware,” “adware” and other potentially unwanted software. If it finds potentially unwanted software, the software will ask you if you want to ignore, disable (quarantine)
 or remove it. Any potentially unwanted software rated “high” or “severe,” will automatically be removed after scanning unless you change the default setting. Removing or disabling potentially unwanted software may result in<br />
·&nbsp;other software on your computer ceasing to work, or<br />
·&nbsp;your breaching a license to use other software on your computer.<br />
By using this software, it is possible that you will also remove or disable software that is not potentially unwanted software.<br />
7.&nbsp;INTERNET-BASED SERVICES. Microsoft provides Internet-based services with the software. It may change or cancel them at any time.<br />
a.&nbsp;Consent for Internet-Based Services. The software features described below and in the Windows 7 Privacy Statement connect to Microsoft or service provider computer systems over the Internet. In some cases, you will not receive a separate notice when they
 connect. In some cases, you may switch off these features or not use them. For more information about these features, see the Windows 7 Privacy Statement at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=104604. By using these features, you consent to the transmission of
 the information described below. Microsoft does not use the information to identify or contact you.<br />
Computer Information. The following features use Internet protocols, which send to the appropriate systems computer information, such as your Internet protocol address, the type of operating system, browser and name and version of the software you are using,
 and the language code of the computer where you installed the software. Microsoft uses this information to make the Internet-based services available to you.<br />
·&nbsp;Plug and Play and Plug and Play Extensions. You may connect new hardware to your computer, either directly or over a network. Your computer may not have the drivers needed to communicate with that hardware. If so, the update feature of the software can obtain
 the correct driver from Microsoft and install it on your computer. An administrator can disable this update feature.<br />
·&nbsp;Windows Update. To enable the proper functioning of the Windows Update service in the software (if you use it), updates or downloads to the Windows Update service will be required from time to time and downloaded and installed without further notice to you.<br />
·&nbsp;Web Content Features. Features in the software can retrieve related content from Microsoft and provide it to you. Examples of these features are clip art, templates, online training, online assistance and Appshelp. You may choose not to use these web content
 features.<br />
·&nbsp;Digital Certificates. The software uses digital certificates. These digital certificates confirm the identity of Internet users sending X.509 standard encrypted information. They also can be used to digitally sign files and macros, to verify the integrity
 and origin of the file contents. The software retrieves certificates and updates certificate revocation lists over the Internet, when available.<br />
·&nbsp;Auto Root Update. The Auto Root Update feature updates the list of trusted certificate authorities. You can switch off the Auto Root Update feature.<br />
·&nbsp;Windows Media Digital Rights Management. Content owners use Windows Media digital rights management technology (WMDRM) to protect their intellectual property, including copyrights. This software and third party software use WMDRM to play and copy WMDRM-protected
 content. If the software fails to protect the content, content owners may ask Microsoft to revoke the software’s ability to use WMDRM to play or copy protected content. Revocation does not affect other content. When you download licenses for protected content,
 you agree that Microsoft may include a revocation list with the licenses. Content owners may require you to upgrade WMDRM to access their content. Microsoft software that includes WMDRM will ask for your consent prior to the upgrade. If you decline an upgrade,
 you will not be able to access content that requires the upgrade. You may switch off WMDRM features that access the Internet. When these features are off, you can still play content for which you have a valid license.<br />
·&nbsp;Windows Media Player. When you use Windows Media Player, it checks with Microsoft for<br />
·&nbsp;compatible online music services in your region; and<br />
·&nbsp;new versions of the player.<br />
For more information, go to go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=104605.<br />
·&nbsp;Malicious Software Removal. During setup, if you select “Get important updates for installation”, the software may check for and remove certain malware from your computer. “Malware” is malicious software. If the software runs, it will remove the Malware listed
 and updated at <a href="http://www.support.microsoft.com/?kbid=890830" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.support.microsoft.com/?kbid=890830</a>. During a Malware check, a report will be sent to Microsoft with specific information about Malware detected, errors, and other information about
 your computer. This information is used to improve the software and other Microsoft products and services. No information included in these reports will be used to identify or contact you. You may disable the software’s reporting functionality by following
 the instructions found at <a href="http://www.support.microsoft.com/?kbid=890830" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.support.microsoft.com/?kbid=890830</a>. For more information read the Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool privacy statement at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=113995.<br />
·&nbsp;Network Awareness. This feature determines whether a system is connected to a network by either passive monitoring of network traffic or active DNS or HTTP queries. The query only transfers standard TCP/IP or DNS information for routing purposes. You can
 switch off the active query feature through a registry setting.<br />
·&nbsp;Windows Time Service. This service synchronizes with time.windows.com once a week to provide your computer with the correct time. You can turn this feature off or choose your preferred time source within the Date and Time Control Panel applet. The connection
 uses the standard NTP protocol.<br />
·&nbsp;IPv6 Network Address Translation (NAT) Traversal service (Teredo). This feature helps existing home Internet gateway devices transition to IPv6. IPv6 is the next generation Internet protocol. It helps enable end-to-end connectivity often needed by peer-to-peer
 applications. To do so, each time you start up the software the Teredo client service will attempt to locate a public Teredo Internet service. It does so by sending a query over the Internet. This query only transfers standard Domain Name Service information
 to determine if your computer is connected to the Internet and can locate a public Teredo service. If you<br />
·&nbsp;use an application that needs IPv6 connectivity, or<br />
·&nbsp;configure your firewall to always enable IPv6 connectivity,<br />
Then, by default standard Internet Protocol information will be sent to the Teredo service at Microsoft at regular intervals. No other information is sent to Microsoft. You can change this default to use non-Microsoft servers. You can also switch off this feature
 using a command line utility named “netsh”.<br />
·&nbsp;Accelerators. When you click on or move your mouse over an Accelerator, in Internet Explorer, any of the following may be sent to the service provider:<br />
·&nbsp;the title and full web address or URL of the current webpage,<br />
·&nbsp;standard computer information, and<br />
·&nbsp;any content you have selected.<br />
If you use an Accelerator provided by Microsoft, use of the information sent is subject to the Microsoft Online Privacy Statement. This statement is available at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=31493. If you use an Accelerator provided by a third party, use
 of the information sent will be subject to the third party’s privacy practices.<br />
·&nbsp;Search Suggestions Service. In Internet Explorer, when you type a search query in the Instant Search box or type a question mark (?) before your search term in the Address bar, you will see search suggestions as you type (if supported by your search provider).
 Everything you type in the Instant Search box or in the Address bar when preceded by a question mark (?) is sent to your search provider as you type. Also, when you press Enter or click the Search button, the text in the Instant Search box or Address bar is
 sent to the search provider. If you use a Microsoft search provider, use of the information sent is subject to the Microsoft Online Privacy Statement. This statement is available at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=31493. If you use a third-party search provider,
 use of the information sent will be subject to the third party’s privacy practices. You can turn search suggestions off at any time. To do so, use Manage Add-ons under the Tools button in Internet Explorer. For more information about the search suggestions
 service, see go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=128106.<br />
·&nbsp;Consent to Update Infrared Emitter/Receiver. The software may contain technology to ensure the proper functioning of the infrared emitter/receiver device shipped with certain Media Center-based products. You agree that the software may update the firmware
 of this computer.<br />
·&nbsp;Media Center Online Promotions. If you use Media Center features of the software to access Internet-based content or other Internet-based services, such services may obtain the following information from the software to enable you to receive, accept and use
 certain promotional offers:<br />
·&nbsp;certain computer information, such as your Internet protocol address, the type of operating system and browser you are using, and the name and version of the software you are using,
<br />
·&nbsp;the requested content, and<br />
·&nbsp;the language code of the computer where you installed the software.<br />
Your use of the Media Center features to connect to those services serves as your consent to the collection and use of such information.<br />
b.&nbsp;Use of Information. Microsoft may use the computer information, accelerator information, search suggestions information, error reports, and Malware reports to improve our software and services. We may also share it with others, such as hardware and software
 vendors. They may use the information to improve how their products run with Microsoft software.<br />
c.&nbsp;Misuse of Internet-based Services. You may not use these services in any way that could harm them or impair anyone else’s use of them. You may not use the services to try to gain unauthorized access to any service, data, account or network by any means.<br />
8.&nbsp;SCOPE OF LICENSE. The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights to use the features included in the software edition you licensed. The manufacturer or installer and Microsoft reserve all other rights. Unless applicable law
 gives you more rights despite this limitation, you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply with any technical limitations in the software that only allow you to use it in certain ways. You may not<br />
·&nbsp;work around any technical limitations in the software;<br />
·&nbsp;reverse engineer, decompile or disassemble the software, except and only to the extent that applicable law expressly permits, despite this limitation;<br />
·&nbsp;use components of the software to run applications not running on the software;<br />
·&nbsp;make more copies of the software than specified in this agreement or allowed by applicable law, despite this limitation;<br />
·&nbsp;publish the software for others to copy;<br />
·&nbsp;rent, lease or lend the software; or<br />
·&nbsp;use the software for commercial software hosting services.<br />
9.&nbsp;MICROSOFT .NET BENCHMARK TESTING. The software includes one or more components of the .NET Framework (“.NET Components”). You may conduct internal benchmark testing of those components. You may disclose the results of any benchmark test of those components,
 provided that you comply with the conditions set forth at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=66406. Notwithstanding any other agreement you may have with Microsoft, if you disclose such benchmark test results, Microsoft shall have the right to disclose the results
 of benchmark tests it conducts of your products that compete with the applicable .NET Component, provided it complies with the same conditions set forth at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=66406.<br />
10.&nbsp;BACKUP COPY. You may make one backup copy of the software. You may use it only to reinstall the software on the licensed computer.<br />
11.&nbsp;DOCUMENTATION. Any person that has valid access to your computer or internal network may copy and use the documentation for your internal, reference purposes.<br />
12.&nbsp;NOT FOR RESALE SOFTWARE. You may not sell software marked as “NFR” or “Not for Resale.”<br />
13.&nbsp;GEOGRAPHIC RESTRICTIONS. If the software is marked as requiring activation in a specific geographic region, then you are only permitted to activate this software in the geographic region indicated on the software or computer packaging. You may not be able
 to activate the software outside of that region. For further information on geographic restrictions, visit go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=141397.<br />
14.&nbsp;UPGRADES. To use upgrade software, you must first be licensed for the software that is eligible for the upgrade. Upon upgrade, this agreement takes the place of the agreement for the software you upgraded from. After you upgrade, you may no longer use the
 software you upgraded from.<br />
15.&nbsp;DOWNGRADE. Instead of using the software, you may use one of the following earlier versions:<br />
·&nbsp;Windows Vista Business,<br />
·&nbsp;Microsoft Windows XP Professional,<br />
·&nbsp;Microsoft Windows Professional x64 Edition, or<br />

16.&nbsp;PROOF OF LICENSE.<br />
a.&nbsp;Genuine Proof of License. If you acquired the software on a computer, or on a disc or other media, a genuine Microsoft Certificate of Authenticity label with a genuine copy of the software identifies licensed software. To be valid, this label must be affixed
 to the computer or appear on the manufacturer’s or installer’s packaging. If you receive the label separately, it is invalid. You should keep label on the computer or the packaging that has the label on it to prove that you are licensed to use the software.
 If the computer comes with more than one genuine Certificate of Authenticity label, you may use each version of the software identified on those labels.<br />
b.&nbsp;Windows Anytime Upgrade License. If you upgrade the software using Windows Anytime Upgrade, your proof of license is identified by<br />
·&nbsp;the genuine Microsoft Certificate of Authenticity label for the software you upgraded from, and<br />
·&nbsp;the genuine Microsoft proof of purchase label from the Windows Anytime Upgrade Kit you used to upgrade. Proof of purchase may be subject to verification by your merchant’s records.<br />

            <p>Yes, the product key is valid for both 32 and 64 bit versions of Windwos 7 Ultimate, if you have a installation disc for Windows 7 Ultimate system builder, you can indeed use it. Or you can download the 64 bit version linked by JW stuart and burn it to a
 blank disc. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is no need to separately download OEM or retail version of Windows 7 RTM installation DVD ISO, as the retail version of Windows 7 installation can be easily converted by simply using the correct product key (e.g OEM_SLP product key can convert a retail
 Windows 7 installation to OEM version), as product keys issued by OEM has different base from retail product key. For the DVD ISO images, the only difference between a Windows 7 RTM retail ISO and Windows 7 RTM OEM ISO is at source/ei.cfg file [Channel] heading,
 which specifies either Retail or OEM channel.</p>

<p>If the license was previously in use, you will need to reactivate by telephone:</p>

<p>You will have to do a clean installation, there is no in place upgrade path from Windows 7 32 Bit to 64 bit.</p>
<p>Using the Windows 7 64 bit disk, install the Windows 7 Windows Easy Transfer Utility from the DVD (To find it, just navigate to x:\support\migwiz, 'x:' represents the name of your disk drive. In this folder, you will see a collection of files, the important
 one you need to look for and double click is 'migsetup'.) , run it and create a WET file (Windows Easy Transfer file), if you have an external hard disk, you can have it stored there so you can access it later when you do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit
 disk.</p>
<p>Once you have done that, simply do a clean install of Windows 7 64 bit disk. In Windows 7 64 bit disk, launch Windows Easy Transfer, follow the on screen wizard, point to where you stored the the WET file (external hard disk), and it will restore your personal
 files and settings. Reinstall any necessary applications.</p>

<h3> sulpicia  say:</h3>
<h2>            After uninstalling 3rd party security and turning on windows defender, Windows 10 computer disconnects from internet randomly</h2>
                    <p>I bought an HP desktop computer that came with Windows 10 Personal in January. The computer came with a free trial of McAffee. I'm not a fan of McAffee and I really didn't want to pay for it, so I decided to uninstall it and run Windows Defender instead.
 Unfortunately, Windows Defender started disconnecting me from my network randomly (all webpages, troubleshooting doesn't work, and I can't reconnect without restarting the router and the computer_, without warning, and with increasing frequency. No other computer
 on the network INCLUDING a laptop running Windows 10 and running Windows defender has the same issue (nor does a kindle, chromebook, android phone, or windows 8 computer). After the last Windows Defender update, the problem abated for about 5 days. Now, it's
 started randomly disconnecting me from the internet again. &nbsp;If I turn off Windows Defender, the internet stays connected for as long as it's off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked the IT office on campus and they told me to reinstall McAffee, but I don't know if that will work and I vastly prefer Windows Defender. I also don't want to turn off Windows Defender because I don't want to have my computer unprotected. Can anyone
 help with the issue.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
The update may not have been installed properly. To troubleshoot this issue, we recommend that you perform a clean boot. This will help eliminate software conflicts that may have occurred when you updated Windows Defender. To perform a clean boot, follow the
 steps on this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

                    In the System Icon Behavior screen, the ability to turn on/off the volume icon has been disabled. The volume icon therefore will not appear in the task bar. How do I change this to be able to turn the system icon back to the on position?

<h2>            SkyDrive is temporarily unavailable. Try sending your photo e-mail later.  Windows Live Mail Error ID&#58; 0x8CCCD052&#34;</h2>
                    <p>For years I have been sending photos using my live.com e-mail account through Windows Live Mail. A week or so ago, I started receiving an error message saying that "Skydrive is temporarily unavailable." and that I should try again later. When I do, I get
 the same error message. I've logged into my skydrive directly and erased all my previously uploaded files thinking maybe it was full but I keep getting the same message. I've read that others have had this problem and that a tech person had to go into their
 account to adjust something to resolve the issue. I'm hoping the same can be done for me. If there is a way to get it fixed myself, please let me know. The exact message I get is this: "SkyDrive is temporarily unavailable. Try sending your photo email again
 later. Subject 'Kepek- Harmadik probalkozas'<br />
Windows Live Mail Error ID: 0x8CCCD052" </p>
<p>Please help!</p>

<h2>            Facebook Messenger App sound not working in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the default Messenger app on windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The page - contacts - sending written messages is all fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But when it comes to make and/or receive a call - I get a small icon showing the pic of who I'm call - so camera's working fine but no sound.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click to expand to full screen - I get a message saying to check my sound settings. When I do that - I go to the settings pages &amp; click on the sound settings - but don't know what to adjust/change on there. In the meantime my call has failed &amp; I get
 cut off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone help please? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using the Dell Studio17 laptop - on my ipad it's all working correctly - so when I get a call - I transfer to that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>here is the tutorial about doing system restore :<br />
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/create-a-restore-point-for-windows-vistas-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/create-a-restore-point-for-windows-vistas-system-restore/</a><br />
<br />
<strong>You</strong> <strong>can only go as far back as the list of restore points gives you</strong>.<br />
<br />
When you are at the system restore window. click the box in front of " Show restore points older than 5 days ". That&nbsp; will give you the list of all the restore points you can use.&nbsp; see screenshot...<br />

    <title>Activation after changing machine SID - Config Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> h5678  say:</h3>
<h2>            Activation after changing machine SID - Config Error</h2>
                    <p>By miscommunication between aide and self, I find that 4 PCs we built and loaded with OEM W7 Pro 64b some months ago were given identical machine SIDs; we did not use the proper utilities and just cloned. Although MS article claims that same SIDs should
 never make a difference, it does: Carbonite only sees and backs up only one system in this LAN of 4 cloned PCs, even though all have unique hostnames and IPs. Carbonite support says they want unique machine SIDs. QUESTION is:
</p>
<p>[1] - What difficulty if any will I have reinstalling (and activating if necessary) the O/S if I change the machine SID on three of the systems?
</p>
<p>[2] - Is there a major trick to changing the machine SIDs, or other repercussions? The MS/Rossinovich utility is no longer posted. My tech says no problem, he can just do it... Is that likely or are we leaving out anything? The systems are currently in production
 use?</p>
<p>[3] - Given the poor method of original installation, is there anything else we ought to do to make up for past sins at this time? Of course, each system has unique O/S and S/W license numbers.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Restart does not work</h2>
                    <p>Hello all together</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer <strong>wont do</strong> a proper <strong>restart</strong>. It always stops loading when starting up again and the small loading wheel made out of turning dots. They stop turning and the only thing I can do if this happens is to long press on/off
 button to shut the system down. Afterwards I can start it up just normal. <strong>
Shutdown works</strong> as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am facing this problem since at least a year from now and no update did change anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Alienware Aurora R3 with its thermal control and FX Controls. Otherwhise its quite a normal PC (2600k i7, GTX 970, 16 GB RAM, 3HD's and one SSD where
<strong>Windows 10 Version 1607 Build(14393.1593) </strong>is installed.</p>

<p>It could be a possible hard drive issue since the issue still persists after performing the reset.<br />
