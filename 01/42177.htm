<h2>            Need some help with activation and clean install and such...</h2>
                    <p>Hello, so I recently bought a used laptop from ebay, and it apparently came with a pirated version of windows 8.1 pro. So I want to upgrade to windows 10 or at the very least have a legit copy of windows 8.1. Anyways after searching around I found out that
 this laptop originally came with windows 8 and laptops that come with preinstalled versions of windows 8 or 8.1 have their OEM keys configured into the bios. I installed an aplication that let me look at the bios OEM key and I was able to write it down. So
 my question is if I do a clean install of win 8 on this laptop will I be able to activate it to a legit version? Also is there any way to make sure the OEM key actually works and it wasn't altered or something? I assume if it can be activated legitly I would
 be able to upgrade to 8.1 or 10? Also one last thing i'm thinking on swithing the hdd for one with a higher capacity will this in anyway affect the activation?</p>
<p>-Thanks in advance</p>

            This was a huge help! I'll try to clean install to windows 10 first and if that doesn't work i'll try the windows 8/8.1 clean install. I have to backup some files first but i'll make sure to update this post after the install. Thank you very much!!

<p>So I have successfully installed windows 10 and am currently using the latest insider build (10565), and I am glad to report that my windows was successfully activated using the embedded windows 8 key. When I went to check the activation it was already activated
 and it said that it was activated from a digital entitlement (from which it means the embedded windows 8 oem key&nbsp;I assume).</p>

<h2>            Windows VISTA&#33;&#33;&#33; update will not download updates - stuck at 0&#37; downloading - Restart of Discussion &#40;now&#41; Dec 2016&#58;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all - I understand there is another post related to this question that started in 2010. However, that discussion thread is now so convoluted with many of the responses not focused on Windows Vista and many others in which it is unclear if at all helpful.
 So, I am restarting here in the hopes for clarity and a simple solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer is running Vista Home Premium on an HP Computer with Pentium Dual Core CPU E5300 @ 2.6 GHz, 6MB of Ram and a 64 bit operating system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are 65 updates identified waiting to download but it hangs at 0% downloading. These identified downloads are 3-9 months old now, and the update process gets hung up and does not identify any new updates even though the last updates were some time ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has Norton 360 running (which has been installed for years with no issues), but I have recently disabled the firewall in an attempt to fix the MS Update download issue, but to no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance for your advice for a fix.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<p>First off, this is the second time Im asking this.. As a important note I AM NOT ASKING HOW I CAN SUBMIT THIS AS A FEEDBACK, I HAVE DONE THAT. I AM ASKING IF THE FUNCTION SHOULD BE PRESENT AND IS NOT BECAUSE OF PROBLEM FROM MY SIDE OR PROBLEM FROM YOUR SIDE?
 SHOULD IT BE THERE AND FOR SOME REASON ISNT?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Photo app has face recognition but I cant give the faces/people names. I press at the picture and all the pictures come up under that person but I cant give that face a name so it looses pretty much its use?</p>
<p>
</p><p>There hasnt come up any errors or anything and Im fully up to date, It didnt work normally so I even updated to the Fall Creators Update</p>
<p>
</p><p>And for the love of God dont say I need to send a feedback or something, I already did that. Either tell openly that it is not possible or show me how to solve my problem. Please dont retell how the function works or what photos app is just to fill the post.
 I want to know if there is a solution for this and how I can do it or if when it will be available/fixed.</p>

<p>The function is not there. You can't give names to the people, and you can't merge them or tell the app that someone is not someone else. Also, it does not seem to work with photos in OneDrive when files on demand is turned on. I am having the same issue
 and I have been investigating it for months now...</p>

    <title>Black Screen After Startup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> siypher48  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black Screen After Startup</h2>
                    <p>I am part of the Xbox Preview Program, so I believe I am on the newest update. This version of Xbox has a revamped Xbox Guide/Sidebar that includes things such as who has gained the most achievement points&nbsp;for the month&nbsp;(I haven't fully checked all of the features&nbsp;out yet and also I am not sure when the update was rolled out. From a quick Google search, it seems like the update was a few days ago). I am not sure if most of the Xbox Community has the update.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have talked about my issue, which will be discussed into detail later on, for over an hour&nbsp;with an Xbox Support Staff through text chat but was unable to resolve it and was diverted to the forums.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So my issue started when I powered on my Xbox. This was around five hours after I fully shut it down (holding the Xbox logo on the console for around 10 seconds) after a couple games of&nbsp;Rocket League. There was not an update going on at the time of shutting it down. The normal, green Xbox startup screen came up when it started. After a few seconds, I was able to see "Hi (insert first name)!" on the bottom of the screen, indicating that the Xbox has logged me in. After this has occurred, all I was able to see was a black screen. So to recap, I started Xbox, showed the green startup screen, went to a black screen and showed me being logged in at the bottom and then it stayed as a black screen.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There were only two things I was able to do. I was able to insert a disk into the Xbox. This loaded up the game so I can actually see the contents of the game, in this case, I loaded up FIFA 15 and was able to see the startup screen and do all of the other things in the game. I tried to open up the Xbox Guide by double tapping the guide button but all that did was freeze the game for about 1/4ths of a second. The sidebar never showed up. The second thing I was able to do was hold the Xbox Guide button. That gave me the basic options of shutting down the console/controller, report a problem, enable narration, etc. I turned on the narrator to see if it would work and it did, but turned it back off afterwards. I go and try to report a problem and when I click on it, the Xbox tries to open a separate app and when it tries to do that, I receive "Sorry, that didn't work for some reason (0x80070002)".</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When I told this part to the Xbox Support, I was given several possible solution that we tried out. First, I turned off the Xbox by holding down the Xbox logo for 10 seconds on the console, unplugged all of the cords and waited two minutes After that, I plugged it back in and started up the console. Unfortunately, I was met with the same thing as previously stated. I saw the green startup screen, saw my name on the bottom indicating me logging in, and just stayed as a black screen afterwards. The individual from Xbox Support suggested to try a different TV screen or monitor but I was unable to complete that task. Also, I believe that was not the issue, since I was able to see the contents of a game from the same TV.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So, as a summary, I am unable to see the Xbox Dashboard or the Xbox Guide/Sidebar, completely limiting my ability to use the console. I am only able to play games that I have a disk for. I can't see my feed, friends, games and apps, etc. Even after doing the power cycle method, the problem still persists.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>My speculation&nbsp;to this problem is that there could be a possible bug in the latest update that I received from the Xbox Preview Program that was overlooked. This bug has a small chance to cause a malfunction in the startup process of the Xbox One, where it doesn't load the essential components that are needed to see the Xbox Dashboard and in turn, just shows a black screen.</p>

    <title>How do I email a complaint to Microsoft&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> garnett13  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I email a complaint to Microsoft&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've been staggered by how awful Microsoft remain in terms of customer service.<br />
<br />
They really couldn't care less about their customers.<br />
<br />
I bought a "signature" product from the Microsoft store, which was wrongly described in terms of its hardware (it wasn't as good as they claimed) and which they said could be upgraded to Windows 10.<br />
<br />
I then called support who laughed at me for buying a poor product and expecting it to be able to upgrade!</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Despite them being that uniquely American combination of stupid and condescending, and categorically stating it couldn't be upgraded, I eventually managed to do it via a complex work-around)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I complained and was given the email address of a "manager" - Jonathan Fleischmann - *** Email address is removed for privacy *** - who was just as rude and useless on the phone and who has never responded to the emails I sent.<br />
<br />
I've been looking for an email address to write to. It's telling about how useless Microsoft are - they're supposed to be a technology giant and their global website says to contact them via a US telephone number! So far behind the times!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know an email address I can write to?</p>

            Leave it to Microsoft to not be of any help or answer any questions. I purchased three surface pro3s as a tester to see if we wanted to purchase a bunch more for our company. Two of the three didn't work, would shutdown automatically, wouldn't read the
 keyboard properly and would all of a sudden become a tablet without switching back. I went to the store 5 times, and no help at all.&nbsp;We got the full warranty, and they still refused to let us send it back - WORST customer service ever. I ended up buying the
 rest of the company Macs... They just WORK.

<h3> allen7261  say:</h3>
<h2>            Two msiexec.exe are running</h2>
                    
<p>I cannot install or uninstall any&nbsp;programs because I get the famous 'error code 1500 An installation is in progress'.&nbsp; I note that&nbsp;two msiexec.exe's are running in task manager.&nbsp; If I right click both and select End Process, they both will end, however they
 both reappear in about <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">3 seconds</span>.&nbsp; I cannot use the Installer Cleanup Utility because I cannot install it.&nbsp; Reregistering the msi does not help. Rebooting does not help. Searching the INTERNET or this site has
 not yielded any solutions. I tried or reviewed most all the suggested solutions. I have no idea what is causing the msiexec to run constantly.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

            You should do following - 
<br />
<br />Right click on Windows Start &gt; Windows Powershell (Admin) 
<br />Now, Copy and paste below and Enter in Powershell 
<br />Set-WinUserLanguageList en-US 
<br />
<br />This will make other languages disappear. (In case, you want to add again or other languages, you can add again from language settings)

<p>I followed the instructions. After that, the second language disappeared. I added languages. But @ Winlangdb.dll did not disappear. I again executed the command above described. I rebooted the OS. Without adding languages. After the launch, the second language
 appeared by itself.&nbsp;But next to the second language @ Winlangdb.dll disappeared. And the name of the language came to the place. But in the settings, the system shows only one language. What to do with it?</p>

                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently purchased a new SSD drive and wanting to upgrade my computer which is Asus R500A.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have done so far is download Media Creation Tool and with a 4GB USB stick I went through the process and Media Creation Tool did its thing.</p>
<p>I swapped out the drives and when through the install process and I got an error.</p>

<p>I concur,&nbsp; typically with that error, the iso is corrupt in all my cases and what is striking, i have mounted without it giving an error that it is corrupt or can't read the ISO.&nbsp; In doing so, one would think, if it mounts then it isn't corrupt, which isn't
 always the case. I also found errors while navigating thru folders and and trying to look at files of an ISO images&nbsp; that have&nbsp; mounted successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if you don't have the md5 of the ISO to check the checksum, then advise future readers to use something like 7zip to test the archive. Right mouse click your iso and choose your compression tool that is listed and select TEST Archive or just test the Archive
 while running your compression tool.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>I trust this method when not having a checksum to compare to.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Onscreen keyboard pops up in Word even when I do not want it there. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kathylofflin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Onscreen keyboard pops up in Word even when I do not want it there.  Can I reset it to control it manually&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am new to touch screens and do a lot of writing, editing, and marginal comments.&nbsp; When I am working on writing and editing documents&nbsp;in Word, the&nbsp;touch keyboard pops up constantly, even when I don't want it.&nbsp; It fills almost the whole screen, and I have
 to keep constantly x-ing it out to make it go away.&nbsp; Even the slightest tap&nbsp;within the&nbsp;document&nbsp;makes it come up.&nbsp; I use speech recognition a lot, and like to tap the screen with a stylus to make positioning the speech text quicker and more accurate than the
 voice commands are, but with that darn keyboard always popping up, it is frustrating.&nbsp; I don't want to shut off the touch keyboard entirely, because sometimes I do want it.&nbsp; I just want to be able to manually control it so it only comes up when I specifically
 ask for it.&nbsp; I don't mind touching an icon each time for that and would prefer that to the thing always coming up on its own and covering up most of the page of the document.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            <div>Thank you for the prompt response!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Answers to your questions:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;My device is an Asus VivoTab RT.&nbsp; I have both the tablet and the detachable keyboard that goes with it.&nbsp; Sometimes I use it as a detached tablet and other times I use it attached to the keyboard dock.&nbsp; The problem with the touchscreen keyboard occurs the
 same in both modes (touchscreen keyboard comes up persistently when the external keyboard is attached as well as when it is detached).
</li><li>I have not made any changes yet, at least not intentionally!&nbsp; I have been fiddling in various Settings screens to try to solve this problem, but I have tried not to change anything permanently.</li><li>So far the problem has been in all Word documents when I am composing new documents or in editing mode on existing ones.&nbsp;
</li></ol>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Footnote that might also help you advise:&nbsp; I am a full-time working professional who also has a progressive condition that is gradually limiting my hand functionality and also means I fatigue easily and must conserve energy.&nbsp; Add to that the fact that
 in my work we have periodic crunch times when we are on deadline (about to enter one of those this week!).&nbsp; Any keystroke saved makes a difference!&nbsp; I have difficulty using keyboards.&nbsp; Either my touch is too weak to make the input register (I’ve been locked
 out of sites because I simply could not get all my password characters typed in to log on), or it is unreliable so I get a string of repeated keystrokes (I often inadvertently type a long string of a’s before realizing it). So far keeping my hands off the
 keyboards and using a stylus, both on touchscreen and regular keyboards, along with Speech Recognition (often simultaneously) looks like a promising solution--that is, except for this pesky keyboard thing!
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>So far I love Windows 8, but the learning curve has been steep in the last month, with new device, new OS, and new Word version.&nbsp; I’ve tried to follow suggestions given in other threads about onscreen keyboards by using the Search charm and Settings, and
 putting in the various terms given, but I tend to be able to follow suggested steps&nbsp;only to a point before hitting dead ends.&nbsp; For example, your Method 1 suggestion sounded promising, but I got as far as the Mouse Properties screen and no further. At that
 point the choices you suggested did not appear.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thanks for your help,</div>

            <p>I am having a similar problem, but please notice that she is using a Touch Screen, NOT a touch pad or mouse pad. &nbsp;I am using a tablet which has a touch screen, and which has no keyboard EXCEPT the on-screen touch keyboard. &nbsp;We are looking for a way to stop
 the on-screen keyboard from popping up every time we touch the screen in a place that the software interprets as a text-entry point. &nbsp;She touches the screen in the place on her doc where she wishes to add text using speech-to-text instead of a keyboard. &nbsp;I
 keep having to x my on=screen keyboard when I activate a drop-down menu or am filling in check-boxes on a list.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi tterlyn,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for taking the time to post.</span></p>
<p><span>Iaanotif.exe is the IAA Event Monitor User Notification Tool from Intel. It installs with Intel's Application Accelerator. This program improves performance on PCs using certain Intel chipsets.</span></p>
<p><span>The below link will take you where to download the software. Please note Windows Vista is not an option for the Operating System.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://downloadcenter.intel.com/Product_Filter.aspx?ProductID=663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://downloadcenter.intel.com/Product_Filter.aspx?ProductID=663</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This link below talks about the program and the end of support for it.</span></p>
<p><b><span>End of Interactive Support</span></b></p>
<p><span>Intel has announced the end of interactive support for the Intel® Application Accelerator.
 See the <a href="http://www.intel.com/support/chipsets/iaa/sb/CS-021766.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">End of Interactive Support Announcement</a> for details.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest maybe reaching out to Intel and seeing if there is a replacement for Vista or what the best course of action you can take.</span></p>
<p><span>Are you seeing any types of issues on the system or is this just a message you see at startup? You might be able to uninstall the program from Control Panel</span><span>à</span><span>Programs
 and Features but I would suggest contacting Intel to make sure.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks,</span></p>

    <title>How can I know for sure if I have Service Pack 3 for Windows XP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> es12_40  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I know for sure if I have Service Pack 3 for Windows XP installed on my PC&#63; I am getting conflicting info.....please help&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    I have been having some difficulties with my desktop PC of late. Anyways, I went to check what programs are installed by going to the Control Panel's "Add/Remove Programs" option.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I selected this option and scrolled down to Windows XP - Service Pack 3 -- there was no information next to it and it said "for support please go...." (and it linked me to the download center on Windows for XP SP3; HOWEVER -- when I check my computer's
 properties by going to the "Start" menu, then going up to "My Computer", right clicking on it and looking at it's properties -- THEN it indicates "Windows XP Professional - Service Pack 3".</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So bottom line -- I am totally lost -- how do I know if I really have SP3 for XP installed or not? and is there danger to downloading and installing SP3 for XP again?? (or will it stop in the installation process and detect if I already have it installed??)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>SOMEONE PLEASE HELP!!!</div>
                </div>

            <p>Unless something happened during the install, you should have SP3, if it shows it under start, right click computer, properties, or as the other person stated, start/run and type in winver..&nbsp; You can try reinstalling it, and it won't hurt anything, though
 it might come up and say you already have it installed, and fail out.</p>

    <title>Unable to Detach Clipboard from Keyboard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> austints  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to Detach Clipboard from Keyboard</h2>
                    <p>When I first got my surface book I could detach it without any issues, however I am no longer able to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when trying to detach it the detach button's light blinks green but nothing happens. When I hover over the software detach option it says "Surface Detach: Detached" and when looking at the battery status it say "Battery 1 not available." Everything appears
 to indicate it does not think it is currently attached to the keyboard, when in fact it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did confirm the&nbsp;battery is&nbsp;fully charged. Also, I just did a factory reset, again no change in this. With me doing a reset I'm assuming it's some sort of hardware issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts on this? Is there some sort of service or app I could reset?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>RESOLVED:</strong></p>
<p>I got this issue resolved. To give credit where credit is due I referenced information from the following two pages:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfbook-surfdrivers/surface-book-thinks-the-keyboard-is-not-attached/85fd37bf-5fb3-4708-ab2b-8c537ddae506</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E47f7n8N4PA</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I believe many people previously&nbsp;suggested doing a two button shutdown, but maybe I was doing something incorrectly. Essentially you need to enter the Surface Book Bios, then exit.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Here are the steps I took to resolve the issue:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Shutdown the Surface Book.</li><li>Hold down the power button just long enough to turn it back on.</li><li>Hold the volume UP button until you enter the bios&nbsp;(this is the left side of the volume control, if you are facing the screen. This is also the side of the volume control closest to the power button).</li><li>You do <strong>NOT need to make any changes in the bios.</strong></li><li>Exit the bios, you will be prompted that changes will be saved.</li><li>The computer should restart.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>After doing this the behavior for my button completely changed and it gave some errors about needing elevated permissions which wouldn't go away, but I was able to restart it again and before I logged in I was able to detach it completely from the device
 without any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normal operations have now been restored and I am able to detach and re-attach it like normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Something I forgot to include, which <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/63125af2-1548-4b8e-8f4a-24372a221d79" title="olykwik">
<span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">olykwik</span></a>&nbsp;pointed out in another response, is that you may need to reset windows prior to performing this fix. I say "may need to" because I did not test this prior to resetting windows, so I don't know if resetting windows
 is required or not, but I did reset windows before I did these steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest first attempting this <strong>BEFORE</strong> resetting windows (as this will cause you to lose all files/applications, depending on your selection), but if it still does not work you might need to reset windows, then follow these steps.</p>

            <p>FIXED</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution:</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, instead of just going into the BIOS but pressing the power button, releasing, then holding the volume UP button. When the device is powered down, I held the power + the volume up button at the same time. After a few seconds, the keyboard detach light
 blinked a bit, then the device quickly powered on then off. Then, after I powered on, I was able to get normal function. YAY!!</p>

            <p>What was the purpose of the cleanup?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on what exactly you did, you might be able to undo the damage like so:</p>
1. Keep tapping F8 during the early boot phase.<br />
2. Select Repair from the menu.<br />
3. Select an admin account, then enter its password.<br />
4. Select System Restore when prompted.<br />
5. Set Windows back to a point before you started the cleanup effort.<br />

<p>Maybe you waited too long before taking action, allowing Windows to overwrite all good Restore Points.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a good version of the problem file then you can put it back into the System32 folder from the Command Prompt while in Repair mode. Note that the folder could reside on a drive other than C: but it won't be drive X:. You need to go looking for
 it.</p>

                    I just went out and purchased a new headset, and I came home and tested it and all 4 of my headsets don't work with the one controller I bought but they work with my brothers controller. My controller is only around 2 months old and I need either a way

<h2>            Cant fix failed windows update &#40;KB2989647&#41;. It won&#39;t let me uninstall the update.</h2>
                    <p>Hi, at the time of this update there were 2 that failed but one was automatically re downloaded and installed two days later as found under installed updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However this update shows it was installed on the same day the 11/09/2014.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I right click on the update I don't get a option to uninstall this failed update every other update has this option to uninstall except update (KB2989647).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe it was corrupted so won't let me uninstall it. If I try and install it manually it says it's already installed but obviously it wasn't installed correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I uninstall manually so I can re install it properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help! Some additional info below.</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi Astrix_au, </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This issue might occur if some system files associated with the Windows Update folder are either missing or broken. Sorry to know that you are facing this issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let us follow these methods and check if this helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You might be able to solve some problems by running a troubleshooter that will automatically fix some common issues with Windows Update. After running this troubleshooter,
 restart the computer and check if you are able to uninstall that update.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>Open the Windows Update troubleshooter by swiping in from the right edge of the screen, tapping
<strong>Search</strong> (or if you're using a mouse, pointing to the upper-right corner of the screen, moving the mouse pointer down, and then clicking
<strong>Search</strong>), entering <strong>Troubleshooting</strong> in the search box, tapping or clicking
<strong>Settings</strong>, and then tapping or clicking <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>. Under
<strong>System and Security</strong>, tap or click <strong>Fix problems with Windows Update</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to this article to know more.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Troubleshoot problems with installing updates:
</span></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/troubleshoot-problems-installing-updates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/troubleshoot-problems-installing-updates</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Let us boot the computer in Safe Mode and check if you are able to uninstall this update. Safe Mode starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and services.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>If you're not signed in to Windows, tap or click the power icon from the sign-in screen, hold the Shift key, and then tap or click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)</strong><span>:
</span></span></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>As you are unable to uninstall or remove this update, you may perform a system restore to a previous date when the computer was working fine.</span></span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer to the section “<strong>To restore your PC to an earlier point in time</strong>” from this article.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>How to restore, refresh, or reset your PC</strong><span>:
</span></span></span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/restore-refresh-reset-pc</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Important:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> System Restore will not revert any of the non-system files like documents,
 email, music, etc. to a previous state. These types files are completely unaffected by System Restore. If your intention with this tool was to recover a deleted non-system file, try using a
</span><span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">file recovery program</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> instead of System Restore.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>After system restore, access the Windows Update and change the settings.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may change the update settings to “Check for updates but let me choose whether to download and install them” and save the settings. With this option the updates will
 not install automatically and will notify you regarding the list of updates to be installed.</span></span></p>
<span>Reply with the status of the issue and we will be glad to offer our assistance.</span>

<h2>            Xbox&#47;Proofs</h2>
                    
<p>Whenever I try to sign into my xbox live account, it says I need to add security proofs, however I cannot remember the email address used to access that account. When I try to find that account information by going to settings -&gt; account, it won't allow
 me to access account because I can't sign into xbox live. How to fix this?</p>

<p>Notes: I'm writing from an older live account because I remember it's password/email.</p>
<p>Incase I'm not clear: Lets say my account that I'm trying to access is X. So I try to sign into X and it says "Need to update proofs" or something and "sign in". Then it asks for my email/password. I can't remember X's email address basically. And I can't
 find it cause it wont allow me to sign into xbox live.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your account's e-mail and password are your responsibility to remember, unfortunately in this case. If you have a payment option on the account you can verify, your best shot is to contact Xbox Support by phone:

<h2>            Can&#39;t add Device &#34;Anycast&#34; on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Today I just bought Anycast Dongle M2 Plus.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So I just use it as the tutorial said, but the problem is, when I plug the dongle, anycast main page didn't appear. So I google, how to do it in windows 8.1<br />
<br />
What I get, I need to manually add the new Device, so I try as the tutorial said. But this is where the problem get annoying. I can detect the dongle when search new device. But everytime I try to add (or connect), it always get this error :<br />
<br />

 already did what I can found in the google, like uninstall hidden network drivers, turn on sharing file or internet, etc, I still got this error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How I can fix it? It getting annoying everytime I want to try it.. Is there any proper solution for this?</p>
