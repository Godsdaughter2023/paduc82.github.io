                    <span>
<p>I have setup Windows Media Center on a clean install of Windows, I configured Media Center and added an XBox 360 as an extender. The media center is running in a VMware Virtual Machine, using a Hava device attached to a cable box as a networked capture device.</p>
<p>When my family tested the Media Center they couldn't get channels above channel 158. Where I live, Long Island, channel 158 is not a significant break in the lineup (it doesn't separate the digital from the basic).&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried rerunning TV setup from menu; however, the guide is still missing channels above 158.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you in advance for a reply.</p>

<h2>            Home Theater&#58; No rear channel sound on Xbox One Optical Output</h2>
                    
<p>Hi - I've got the following connection:</p>
<p>DirecTV Genie &gt;&gt; Xbox One &gt;&gt; TV via HDMI</p>
<p>Then I've got an optical out from the Xbox One direct to a Denon AVR 2311 receiver.</p>
<p>I've got the Xbox One set to Optical Audio Bitstream Dolby Digital but when I watch anything on DirecTV the rear channel surrounds are silent.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Am I missing something? Or does Xbox One not output full 5.1 over Optical? If yes, what's the point of the Dolby and DTS options?</p>
<p>Will I get better results if I plug the Xbox into the receiver via HDMI?</p>
<p>thanks</p>

    <title>WIN 7 Reborn is what we need NOW, not appliance Win-10, but you - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wattyler1  say:</h3>
<h2>            WIN 7 Reborn is what we need NOW, not appliance Win-10, but you can&#39;t tell MS that-Co doesn&#39;t listen</h2>
                    MS has become so bloated that there is not a single person, reachble on phone, whose job it is to listen to how users feel about its products - those of us who don't mind the stormcloud model, rather than freedom to use our PCs to their fullest extent,
 or who regard their computers like their refrigerators, another appliance they don't understand, realize that Windows 7 was the best of the Windows NT-spawned line. Not perfect, but pretty good.<br />
We hoped MS would, eventually, come up with an NT-8 or Win-7 SP(s)2-n. MS didn't.<br />
MS doesn't listen to users - try calling to file ny kind of comment, nd you will find it impossible.<br />
Intel has developed fantastic new CPUs, like the I9-X series - which would make wonderful Personal Computers, for those of us who understand PCs. By limiting information availability, I doubt even paid botique LINUX releases can supply systems to fully utilize
 the new Intel architecture and power. BUT - you cannot find a motherboard with expansion card sockets that support the umpteen lines of the I9-X Extreme - 4 video boards, a layout of 8 monitors as you wish them, Intel OPTANE middle memory, an SRAM "Disk C"
 plug-in and a dedicated high-speed RAID card capable of handling two groups of 4, 8TB drives, an HDMI/other cable "STB" outputs, with room for The Next Big Thing when it comes along.<br />
WHAT WE NEED TO TELL MS: Win-10 with its applince design log-in to accpunt/network, automatic "assistance" from uncontrollable patches, ability by corp. or 3rd parties to reach into our systems, with no power, save multiple "stateful" routers laid out in the
 grc.com method, and lots of expensive firmware, is not what we want or need. We need Windows 14 or 7 Relunched, or whatever MS wants to all the new system. Aside from the kludgy XP sandbox for older programs, forget about 16-bit oldies, no matter how useful,
 Win 7, combined with the XP startup 3rd party directory screen was On the Right Track - Only those on the road need clouds. The rest of us, just a way to log in to our high-test home machines. We don't like "rented" software or software/hardware - leaving
 our IP vulnerable on a "cloud", we don't need Adobe rent-a-font tracking systems. We want a smooth system that allows us who started programming our DEC PDP-8 "PCs" to give up programming and buy software to run locally.<br />
Most of all, we need a modernized Windows 7, we need it yesterday, and realize it probably exists, in some form, at MS. OR, let the same crews building GITHub open source OS's to have WIN-7 sources with comments. We need a group of live people, including those
 speaking idiomatic North American English to tke our requests and preferences to MS development teams.<br />
Please join me with followup messages - enough and even Mirosoft may notice, and solve the problems which could very well bring the company down, while those of us who still "build" our own PCs try to make due with Linux or older, slower equipment.<br />
(Tyler, for you non-history-buffs, a revolutionary against feudalism, didn't last too long. If enough of us convince MS we *like* their products, and will *pay* for them, maybe we an gain some traction)<br />

<p>Unfortunately, the reality is Microsoft is nothing like the company they once were.&nbsp; There is no one there who is interested in what you (and me) have to say about the future of Windows.&nbsp; &nbsp;Your "appliance" idea is a good description.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">There are some people that like Windows 8, but they are far from the majority.&nbsp; Microsoft itself considered Windows 8 a marketplace failure and declared
 that loudly when they announced the development of Windows 10, bypassing Windows 9 to illustrate how different 10 would be.&nbsp; It is not!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Windows 8 was an attempt to create a PC operating system that would function well in a cell phone.&nbsp; It did not work well and Microsoft dumped Nokia which
 it had purchased for that reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Windows 8 was also designed for a touch screen.&nbsp; Ergonomically, that makes no sense in a computer, but is required for a cell phone.&nbsp; You can make Windows
 8 act more like Windows 7 by installing after-market software.&nbsp; Most people that had/have Windows 8 used that kind of software.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Windows 7 is likely the best Windows there will ever be (<strong>my opinion)</strong>.&nbsp; It is highly favoured by something like 40% of users of the Internet,
 still after more than 3 years since Windows 10 was introduced.&nbsp; Come January 2020, the medical field is expected to have 71% of their PCs still running Windows 7.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">My clients are all keeping their Windows 7 systems.&nbsp; There is no very good reason you need to invest in a new computer, particularly if you are like most
 and use your computer mostly for email and browsing the web.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>

</span><span>(I do not recommend "security" products)</span></li><li><span>Do backups regularly</span></li><li><span>Consider re-installing Windows and create an image copy of the installation</span></li><li><span>If your hard drive is over 5 years old, consider replacing it (under $100) before you re-install</span></li></ol>

    <title>Game Install Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> k9lass  say:</h3>
<h2>            Game Install Issue</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I just purchased Sniper Elite 3 for $10.00 in the Ultimate Game Sale event and as I'm trying to install it, the install keeps freezing. I've canceled the install and retried to install again, it got a bit further this time, I was able to get to about
 19% before it froze again. It's been over 15mins and the install still hasn't progressed.</p>

<p>Is this problem due to the issues users are experiencing with prices being wrong? Or is there a solution? I'm not satisfied at all. I purchased Titanfall a couple of days ago and the installation froze up as well and I had to reinstall. What is the problem
 here? I'm becoming more and more fruitful of going over to Playstation Network. I've had nothing but issues since purchasing an Xbox One however long ago.</p>

<p>I want answers.</p>

<p>Your not the only one experiencing problems downloading, after 5 hours I only achieved 9% of COD. This is a kick in the teeth from Microsoft as I am awaiting a replacement Xbox One due to defective disc drive and now I can't download games either.

<p>If Microsoft are moving away from gaming, their must be a better way of communicating it to customers.</p>

<p>I have the same issue as yourself. I bought Sniper Elite 3 for £10 from the Ultimate Game sale and went to download it, it was stuck on 'installing' for ages which i thought was very strange as i have a very healthy 80/20 fiber line. I never have to wait
 long for my games to download, but after 15 minutes still stuck on 'installing' then 1% and in a hour it had done like 3%
</p>
<p>I paused and then cancelled the download and tried again, the same thing happened. I decided to leave it downloading over night, and in 12 hours it had only done 32% which is rubbish, in 12 hours i could of normally have downloaded it 10x over. (for example
 it took me 18 minutes to download the Hardline BETA)</p>
<p>So i contacted the twitter support team for Xbox who lets just say like to read from a script, im sure they do help many people out who are novice to Xbox live or ISP etc etc, but the advice they was giving was simply well...... simple.</p>
<p>Can we see a screen shot of your 'detailed network statistics' sure everything was fine, then it was can you connect it via Ethernet.. Nope.. Oh well in that case can you move your Xbox One closer to your wifi router.... REALLY????
</p>
<p>I have speedtested, pinged, hard reset console, and my router to no avail. Its an Xbox issue this for sure, with loads of people suffering the same thing.
</p>
<p>I would guess with the attacks on the Live service they are not fully operational, they just dont want to tell us.

<p>I bought Sniper Elite 3 for £10 in the UK and it downloading slow: 3.27Mb at the moment, my connection is 152Mb/12Mb from Virgin Media.</p>
<p>Before I started downloading Sniper Elite 3, I was downloading the ScreamRide demo and that was downloading just as slow.</p>
<p>So I rebooted the modem/router, press the power button on the Xbox One for 10 seconds and it made no differences.</p>
<p>I am wired via Ethernet cable and on Detailed network statistics on the Xbox One, I can get full speed on the test, with no packet loss.</p>

<p>I also noticed that after going into 'Bandwidth usage' im getting a current usage of anywhere between 3mb and 1.80mb</p>
<p>as you have said crazygaz76 i have done all the same as you from a full power down of console, and then a full restart of my home router (Home Hub 5) and with no joy.
</p>
<p>Yet when i just did the detailed network statistics i am getting 51.07mb down and 20.77mb up so my line is not the issue.</p>
<p>It goes to show its an Xbox issue, but when you go to the jokers on twitter they tell you to move your router closer to your Xbox... LOL...

<p>I'm having the same problem too. Everything my end is working, speed, wired etc. The Scream Ride demo has taken 1hr to download 2% :-/ Why don't they admit the servers are not good enough, pay a subscription fee and it's just not good enough</p>

<p>Same issue. Same game. Tried the same fixes with same results. I can get to 5% then after that all I get is installation stopped. Ive tried contacting @xboxsupport on Twitter several times over the last 2 days but have yet to get a response. Its weird they
 haven't responded because normally they are all over my problems. </p>

<p>sumothong01 they will possibly tell you the same as me, its 'MY' network and nothing to do with their side of things. They told me to move my xbox closer to my router, which simply isnt going to happen.</p>
<p>They said my 85% wifi strength was the reason for my 1-2mb/s download speed.. When my Xbox was telling me i had 51mb/s download.</p>
<p>I finally got mine downloaded last night after 26 hours... What a joke. (This would normally take me like 20 minutes to download.)</p>

<p>I like to add myself to this list. Exactly the same problem as everyone else when trying to download PES 2015. Either I get stuck at 'Installing' or 3%, 7% and after leaving it overnight, a whopping 16%. I could live with the fact it might take around 30
 hours to download on this occasion but that's not the case because just when I think I'm getting somewhere it inexplicably freezes and I'm back to square one.</p>
<p>The most frustrating thing is feeling like there's no effective support channels to assist with any issue outside of the generic scripted help mentioned above. I have no idea where to go from here and it's looking like £25 down the drain. I'm sick to the
 back teeth of huge corporations failing to deliver their products or services and having no effective support channel to boot.</p>

<p>I ended up pausing the download last night for Sniper Elite 3 and an update for another game.</p>
<p>So this morning, I thought I would finish it off, the update was done in minutes and Sniper Elite 3 was downloading at full speed, but slow down an hour ago to: 2.93Mb</p>

<p>They finally got back to me and asked for a picture of my Detailed Network Settings that was 2 hours ago and nothing from them since. I was showing 0% packet loss and 100% WiFi strength so I know there is nothing wrong on my end. I dug a long Ethernet cable
 out and hooked it up and I'm still getting the same stopped installing message. Lots of people on twitter are complaining about it too. If there is an issue that's fine, just let us know so were nit wasting time trying to download this game. Ive got other
 things to play.</p>

    <title>User Folder Hidden And Cant Unhide - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tyarent  say:</h3>
<h2>            User Folder Hidden And Cant Unhide</h2>
                    So I just got a new computer and I ran into some issues.<br />
<br />
Long story short I was moving folders from the SSD to the Hard Drive. I accidentally made my hard drive the "Documents" folder or something along those lines by not making a folder first to send the "Documents" folder to. Instead i clicked the hardrive then
 clicked use this folder not knowing. I fixed this issue (I think) and everything seems to be back to normal.
<br />
<br />
Only thing I noticed is:<br />
<br />
prior I was able to see my user folder (the one with my name), then after the trouble and the subsequent fix I noticed the folder is now hidden. Now before anyone says "Just click the show hidden folders options" etc etc, Ive tried that and it remains hidden.
 Now i can find the folder by going to one of the folder tied to it, like photos, going Properties&gt;Location&gt;Find Target. This takes me to the folder and it shows that it is still under the "Users" folder on my SSD. I cant click the "Hidden" box to unhide it
 because its grayed out and it wont remove the check. I created another "User" and it is also experiencing the same issue of being.... Hidden and Un-hide-able....&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have no idea whats going on. Im new to Windows 10, Solid State Drives, and even dealing with folders in this way (Always just left everything well enough alone).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Should I be worried? The computer runs fine, and there's no issues so far. <br />
Is this normal?&nbsp;

<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, the thing you are trying to achieve is not possible, yet. There is a 3rd party app for Android that logs you in from phone using fingerprint authentication but not for Apple devices.
<br />
<br />The idea is good and I encourage you to add feedback in the feedback hub.

<h2>            Windows 10 continually suggests Using Edge instead of IE</h2>
                    I have a desktop PC that was running Windows 7 and successfully upgraded to Windows 10. I decided to leave IE 11 as my default browser. I'm using Outlook 2007 for email. Whenever I click on a link to a webpage in an email, I get a pop-up asking me if I
 want to change which program opens such a link. It shows the default correctly as IE 11 and suggests Edge, Google Chrome, or Mozilla Firefox as alternatives. I select Internet Explorer and I click the checkbox saying "Always use this program" and then I click
 on okay.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On other PCs that I've upgraded my only had to do this one time and it remembered it. However on this particular PC, the setting will not stick. Every time I click on a link in Outlook 2007, it prompts me to choose a default browser.</div>

<p>
</p><p>If you scroll down a bit, there's a "reg" file that will make the change for you (back up the registry as always before doing).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the file. It worked great and my links are now behaving themselves.</p>
<p>

<h3> brungl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10&#58; Scheduled task can&#39;t access clipboard when computer is locked</h2>
                    <p>I have many scheduled tasks that run overnight while my computer is locked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Several of those tasks involve the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Running a .bat file to open Firefox</p>
<p>- Using a browser automation tool to navigate to a web page</p>
<p>- Copying the text from the web page to the clipboard</p>
<p>- Extracting the contents of the clipboard to a .txt file</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tasks are set to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Run only when the user is logged on</p>
<p>- Run with highest privileges</p>
<p>- Wake the computer to run the tasks</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of these tasks worked perfectly with Windows 7. I recently upgraded to Windows 10, and the tasks still work if I run them manually, but they have stopped working correctly while the computer is locked. They open Firefox, navigate to the correct pages,
 and select the appropriate text, but are unable to copy anything to the clipboard. All of the resulting .txt files are blank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My other scheduled tasks continue to work correctly, including several that use the clipboard; the difference is that those tasks use Excel instead of Firefox.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Why Is My Wordpad print dark and light and missing half of some script&#63;</h2>
                    I typed a letter on my Wordpad and when I printed it out, some of the lines of print are only half showing and lighter then other lines of&nbsp;print which show up just fine. When I view my page, before printing, it also reads as it should. &nbsp;I printed another
 file, to make certain it wasn't my printer, and it printed just fine. Please help!

<h2>            Receving error code &#58;43 &#39;Generic Bluetooth Adapter is not working properly&#39;</h2>
                    <p>original title: Help with Generic Bluetooth Adapter Error Message - Windows 7</p>
<p>Hello:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First time poster. My laptop runs Windows 7 Professional, 64 bit operating system.</p>
<p>I noticed an error message in the Devices and Printers area. There was a yellow caution sign&nbsp;with an exclamation mark. I right clicked and selected&nbsp;'troubleshoot'.
</p>
<p>Tthe message was 'problem detected with generic bluetooth adapter'.The problem found was that the 'generic bluetooth adapter is not working properly'.</p>
<p>I also saw a message in the 'Device Status'&nbsp;area&nbsp;that said 'Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43).
</p>
<p>The specifics were Device type: Bluetooth radio; Manufacturer: generic adapter and Location: Port_#0006. Hub_#0004.
</p>
<p>I did try searching online for solutions</p>
<p>I tried 'update driver' and Microsfot says I have the most recent driver installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also looked under Control Panel, Hardware and Sound, Device Manager and see that under Bluetooth Radios there is an entry for Generic Bluetooth Adapter with a yellow caution sign. I have only had the laptop for a few weeks and it is new to me. I have not
 seen the error message previously.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am looking for information concerning what to do to get rid of the yellow caution message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            &#91;SOLVED&#93; Update KB4467702 disables WLAN on LAN connect. Workaround of disabling Network location awareness failing since 19-1-9</h2>
                    <p>This issue is reproducable on 3 windows 10 laptops.<br />
<br />
We use OpenVPN, which makes uses a tunneling adapter, seen by windows as an Ethernet adapter.<br />
Since update KB4467702 windows turns off WLAN the adapter when an Ethernet adapter is connected.<br />
<br />
So when our VPN connects windows disconnects the WLAN and teh VPN fails, as it needs the WLAN to remain in contact with the server.<br />
<br />
As a workaround I found that disabling the Network location awareness service worked.<br />
But since 19-1-9 (9 januari), disabling the Network location awareness service prevents the list of available WLAN networks to be displayed and users now can no longer connect to new networks or choose between already known networks when multiple are available.<br />
<br />
I re-enabled the service on the machines so the users can use WLAN. But now VPN is not functional.<br />
<br />
How do I get windows not to disconnect/disable the WLAN when an ethernet connection is established?<br />
<br />
Already I have searched multiple fora and the web, but found no solution.<br />
So far I have tried:<br />
CMD: netsh dump, netsh winsock reset, netsh int ip reset, ipconfig /flushdns<br />
A reboot, WLAN firmware update, Windows update, a clean openVPN install with newly generated configuration file, a clean windows 10 install first removing all existing partitions.<br />
Disabling ipv6, netBIOS, bios LAN/WLAN switch, powersaving op adaptor, Hp bloatware, HP network services &amp; the policies:
<br />
* Windows Group Policy/Computer Configuration/Policies/Administrative Templates/Network/Windows Connection Manager/Minimize the number of simultaneous connections to the Internet or a Windows Domain<br />
* Windows Group Policy/Computer Configuration/Policies/Administrative Templates/Network/Windows Connection Manager/Prohibit connection to non-domain networks when connected to domain authenticated network<br />
<br />
Please advice.<br />
With kind thanks and regards,</p>

<p>This issue is reproducable on 3 windows 10 laptops.<br />
<br />
We use OpenVPN, which makes uses a tunneling adapter, seen by windows as an Ethernet adapter.<br />
Since update KB4467702 windows turns off WLAN the adapter when an Ethernet adapter is connected.<br />
<br />
So when our VPN connects windows disconnects the WLAN and teh VPN fails, as it needs the WLAN to remain in contact with the server.<br />
<br />
As a workaround I found that disabling the Network location awareness service worked.<br />
But since 19-1-9 (9 januari), disabling the Network location awareness service prevents the list of available WLAN networks to be displayed and users now can no longer connect to new networks or choose between already known networks when multiple are available.<br />
<br />
I re-enabled the service on the machines so the users can use WLAN. But now VPN is not functional.<br />
<br />
How do I get windows not to disconnect/disable the WLAN when an ethernet connection is established?<br />
<br />
Already I have searched multiple fora and the web, but found no solution.<br />
So far I have tried:<br />
CMD: netsh dump, netsh winsock reset, netsh int ip reset, ipconfig /flushdns<br />
A reboot, WLAN firmware update, Windows update, a clean openVPN install with newly generated configuration file, a clean windows 10 install first removing all existing partitions.<br />
Disabling ipv6, netBIOS, bios LAN/WLAN switch, powersaving op adaptor, Hp bloatware, HP network services &amp; the policies:
<br />
* Windows Group Policy/Computer Configuration/Policies/Administrative Templates/Network/Windows Connection Manager/Minimize the number of simultaneous connections to the Internet or a Windows Domain<br />
* Windows Group Policy/Computer Configuration/Policies/Administrative Templates/Network/Windows Connection Manager/Prohibit connection to non-domain networks when connected to domain authenticated network<br />
<br />
Please advice.<br />

<p>When booting without third party software the problem did not occur.<br />
Finally it turned out to be the HP LAN/WAN switcher service to cause this.<br />
Disabling it fixed this.</p>

    <title>Win10 - Cannot Change Display Language From UK English to NZ English - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexleadingedge  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10 - Cannot Change Display Language From UK English to NZ English</h2>
                    <p>The Windows 10 Anniversary Update has just installed and my keyboard has returned back to English (United Kingdom). This was the original install language but I cannot change it back to English (New Zealand).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing "Override for Windows display language" to "English (United States)" and pressing "Save" simply changes back to "Use Language List (Recommended)".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Opening "Apply language settings to the welcome screen, system accounts, and new user accounts" shows that under "Current User" the "Input language" is set to "<strong>Setting could not be read</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>SFC says that there is no corruption of the system files, so what is going on? Is there a way to fix the registry so I can then copy the fixed setting to the log in screen and new user accounts?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that you are facing some issue with the USB device. That beings said, please follow the below method and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Method 1:</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We&nbsp;would suggest that you reinstall the driver for Microsoft WPD File System Volume.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Reinstall the Microsoft WPD File System Volume Driver manually.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click&nbsp;Windows key + X key</span><span><strong>.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Go to&nbsp;<strong>Device Manager</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Navigate to “<strong>Microsoft WPD File System Volume Driver</strong>”, right-click on it and choose “<strong>Uninstall</strong>”. (If you get a option to delete the software associated with the driver,
<strong>DO NOT TICK THAT OPTION</strong>)</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>After the un-installation, click “<strong>Action – Scan for hardware changes</strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Install the device again.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Reboot the computer and see how it works.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>The Code 10 error code is generated when Device Manager has insufficient information or the error that is bubbled up by the device drivers is not recognized by Device Manager. Additionally, this error may occur when one of the drivers that the device
 needs does not start. If many drivers are being used by a particular device, it can be difficult to determine the one that failed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer the below Microsoft article and try the steps mentioned.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Description of Code 10-related errors that Device Manager generates in Windows-based computers</span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/943104/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/943104/</span></a></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3: Clean boot</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Try doing a clean boot and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Putting your system in</span><strong><span>Clean Boot
</span></strong><span>state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>DISCLAIMER:
</span></strong><span>After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting".</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know if the issue is resolved or you need any further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>You might also use System Restore to restore to a restore point made just prior to the problem occuring...</p>
<p>From the System Restore pages...</p>

<p>*************************************************</p>
<p><em><strong>What is System Restore?</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>System Restore helps you restore your computer's system files to an earlier point in time</strong>.<u>It's a way to undo system changes to your computer without affecting your personal files, such as e‑mail, documents, or photos.</u></em></p>
<p><em>Sometimes, the installation of a program or a driver can cause an unexpected change to your computer or cause<span>Windows</span> to behave unpredictably. Usually, uninstalling the program or driver corrects the problem. If uninstalling does not fix
 the problem, you can try restoring your computer's system to an earlier date when everything worked correctly.</em></p>
<p><em>System Restore uses a feature called System Protection to regularly create and save restore points on your computer. These restore points contain information about registry settings and other system information that<span>Windows</span> uses. You can
 also create restore points manually.</em></p>
<p><em>System Restore is not intended for backing up personal files, so it cannot help you recover a personal file that has been deleted or damaged. You should regularly back up your personal files and important data using a backup program.</em></p>
<p><em>***************************************************</em></p>
<p>Using System Restore with restore point made just prior to the problem occurring will not affect your program files. Make sure though that critical data and files are backed up. Personally I backup critical files (ie. financial data, documents and an exhaustive
 digital photo archive) on my wife's Win 7 desktop automatically each night and our personal Win 7 laptop weekly.</p>

<p>
</p><p><em>Microsoft Outlook only allows you to recall or retract messages in limited circumstances. You must be using a Microsoft Exchange email system, and you must be on the same Exchange server as the recipient. This feature may work when you’re emailing your

<h2>            Diffculties using Chegg eReader</h2>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I try using the chegg eReader on the browser due to the fact windows does not currently provide an app for chegg. I am unable to use commands as simple as turning a page, as soon as I open the book it seems as if thru screen freezes. Refreshing only
 sends me back to the home screen to select to read the book. It only shows half the page and I can not move around the page. It would be very helpful if these problems could be fixed or if an app was made for windows. There is one for android and apple, but
 not windows. I want to be able to use my tablet and not have to be at a desktop every time I want to use the books I purchased.

<p>You need to talk to chegg. its their app and their service - they are the ones who have to make an app (as they have for ios and android), or fix their website.</p>

<h2>            I cannot log into this Microsoft Website using my Windows 10 account.</h2>
                    Microsoft says my Microsoft account does not exist, so I cannot login. (This is a different account because I could not access the correct one) My WIndows 10 user account, also my MIcrosoft support account, is the one the site says does not exist. But
 I use it every time I logon to this computer. Any ideas? I was trying to contact MIcrosoft online for another question because the call center is closed and was hoping to find help soon (so now there are 2 problems) Thank you!

            Thanks for reply. It turned out to be user error - most likely mine. Login address and password were correct, which is why it was so confusing. However, the username in my password manager did not match this account, so it appeared I was logged into a
 different user account. Sorry for your trouble and same to anyone else who tried to help!&nbsp;
