<p>When I first got XBL, it offered me Gold. Seeing as I have no money, I didn't get it. However, it offered me a free trial. I'm not sure why I declined, but I did. Is there any way I can get the free trial now?</p>

            <p>As far as I know, it's only offered one time, if declined then there is no way to get it again.</p>
<p>So the answer would be 'No' :-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A one month trial is offered to the first few created profiles on a console, you could create a new account, but you'll loose all progress, saves and achievements etc.</p>

<p>There are also sometimes free trials available for special promotions such as IGN, Hulu etc

<p>From time to time you will receive an offer via your Xbox and occasionally via email for a free trial or drastically discounted Gold membershp offer. I've personally gotten 1 month for $1, 2 months for $2 and I will bet they even have a 3 months for $3 offer,
 which I haven't seen yet ;). Also, check out Amazon.com for Gold membership deals. They always have something good going on.</p>
<p>I am sure that if you called support at 1-800-4MY-XBOX and explained what you did, they might offer you a deal.</p>

<p>Greetings, Fantasy. I just want to sum everything up here and offer some clarification. If you decline to upgrade to Gold when creating a new account via your console, you will be offered a 1 month free trial. This is valid for the first three accounts you
 create on a console.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>As others have mentioned you can choose to create a new gamertag in order to receive the 1 month trial provided you have not already created your first three gamertags. However, the 1 month trial will be valid for the account which you created, not any account
 of your choosing.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also want to confirm that if you decide to do this your original account's progress, saves, and achievements will not be lost. In addition, there's no need to call support in this case. Thanks and please let us know if you have any further questions. :)</p>

<p>Hi I have A solution, If you already Done this, Then Congrats ^^</p>
<p>If not Try This This is Official Website So Dont worry so, my xbox live ran out and so I went onto the website to have a look around and to my delight found that they were offering a free month trial.</p>
<p>1.) Visit the xbox website and sign into your account.</p>
<p>2.) Click My account in the top right</p>
<p>3.) Go into the subscriptions area.</p>
<p>4.) Click onto get gold.</p>
<p>5.) There will be an option at the top for the free 1 month trial. Click that and follow the instructions.</p>
<p>You will need to enter a payment method as it sets up a automatic renewal once it runs out. The automatic renewal can be turned off though once you have the trial set up by finding the option within your subscription area (this can be done at any time).</p>
<p>If you have already redeemed an offer like this in the past, I'm not sure if you will be able to again but it's worth a try. The offer is also only available to those who do not currently have a gold account.
</p>
<p>So if you do Have Xbox Live You can Wait till it Expires And Reedem It Later</p>
<p>Hope This Help! :)</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
I would suggest you to first install the Korean language and then check for the issue.<br />
<div>To install a language pack, follow these steps:<br />
<div>a.&nbsp;Open Region and Language by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking Clock, Language, and Region, and then clicking Region and Language.<br />
b.&nbsp;Click the Keyboards and Languages tab.<br />
c.&nbsp;Under Display language, click Install/uninstall languages, and then follow the steps.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
<div><strong>Note: </strong>You can change display language only in Windows 7 Ultimate and Windows 7 Enterprise.</div>
<div><br />
Now check if you are able to read Korean languages. If you want to enter text or edit documents in Korean language then, try the steps provided under<strong> To add an input language</strong> in the below article.</div>

    <title>Problems posting text to Facebook using Microsoft Windows 10 Edge - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> josephhobel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems posting text to Facebook using Microsoft Windows 10 Edge</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)"><span>Making a post on Facebook is a very elementary operation.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Since I have been using Windows 10 Microsoft Edge, I have frequently had the beginning of a string of text that I am typing in on a Facebook post disappear only to reappear at the end of the same text string. Someone should be fixing the
 problem, whether it is Facebook or Windows.</span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>Microsoft Edge has a reputation of being “quirky.”</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>They can only lose that reputation by fixing their problems.</span><span><span>&nbsp; I did not have this problem when using Facebook under Windows XP.
</span></span><span>Whether the problem should be owned by Facebook or by Microsoft is something that they both ought to decide between them.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Our best way to help them as software providers is to report problems for them to fix.</span><span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Otherwise, the software will continue to behave badly and their reputations as software providers will be less than perfect.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE: most recently, I find that updates take when the screen locks up.&nbsp; I can go to other Facebook items, but the item just posted to becomes unresponsive. I have to find the update by going to the collection of items for the person to whom&nbsp; I posted. The
 active item I posted to remains "dead", and I&nbsp; have to cancel out of Facebook and restart Facebook.From the technological, human-made cocoon of the International Space Station, orbiting in the vast ocean of space, a view of the Great Barrier Reef off Australia’s
 east coast. The 133,000-square-mile reef is the largest structure on Earth that was made by living organisms. Tiny coral polyps secrete calcium carbonate to build the reef, creating a unique ecosystem for hundreds of other organisms, and they don’t charge
 rent to a single one.<br />
<br />
I just had another posting abort on this Microsoft site and everything was lost.&nbsp; Why should I expect you to fi problems if this tool remains buggy?</p>
<p>
</p><p>IT APPEARS THAT THE PROBLEM HAS BEEN SOLVED, PRESUMABLY BY FACEBOK IF MICROSOFT HAS NOT DONE ANYTHING ON ITS SIDE.</p>
<p>Why don't you answer whether the Microsoft software is in control or the Facebook software is in control? After the update has taken, the cleanup is no done to show this on the Facebook screen, which seems lit could be due to failure to signal completion.<br />
<br />
After the update has taken place, Facebook should send back the results of the successful update, but that is not occurring.&nbsp; What I see should be the normal result after a successful update, not an update that has not yet been posted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem was never duplicated and traced to see which software was in error, Microsoft's or Facebook's. That would have been the professional way to address the problem.</p>
<p />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do<br />
a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running<br />
resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detect as the<br />
cause.<br />
<br />
No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy<br />
to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So<br />
its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check with these to an<br />
extreme overkill point and then run the cleanup only when you are very sure the system is clean.<br />
<br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also run&nbsp;<br />
them in regular Windows when you can.<br />
<br />
Download malwarebytes and scan with it, run MRT, and add Prevx to be sure it is gone.<br />

            Hi Jg0407 
<br />
<br />I am sorry, if someone turns that PC off, the operation will be stopped and it is very likely some files may be lost . . .
<br />
<br />If that was a move operation, a copy operation would be okay, but a move operation can and most likely will result in data loss . . .

<p>Hi DaveM121,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. Oh no that is not good news. Odds are no one will turn it off but I'm worried now! The likelihood is that those files are backed up elsewhere so it is probably not the end of the world but still not ideal!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought that the move operation is basically a copy to the new destination first and then the files in the original location are deleted once the move is complete? Is this not the case?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish I had just cancelled it now but I didn't want to lose the progress as it was taking a long time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            Hi Jg0407
<br />
<br />I am sorry, the move operation is not a copy operation and then delete - logically it should be and for safety sake, that is definitely the way it should happen, however from much experience, that is definitely not the case . . .
<br />
<br />Your best option would be to get someone to unlock your PC and un-pause that move operation, if you can . . .

<p>Ok thank you, unfortunately I will not be able to get anyone to log into my computer over the weekend. I will just have to hope that no one touches it! It will be fine if it is just hibernating right? The paused move operation will still be there when I
 log in on Monday? Like I said worst comes to worst those files will be backed up so I'm sure it will be fine. Just a little embarrassing if something goes wrong!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would the files that might be lost be the ones that were actually in the process of transferring when I paused the operation? The ones that have already moved should be in the destination folder and the ones that haven't yet been moved still in the original
 folder? At least that would also hopefully mean minimal loss!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!<br />

<p>
</p><p>I wanted to get the latest version so I asked for a repair function and it downloaded, but only went to the first splash screen.&nbsp; I had no keyboard, mouse or login screen.&nbsp; It stalled there.</p>

<p>
</p><p>With F1 it continued to the same screen I received previously with the first splash screen, no keyboard or mouse. and would not proceed any further.</p>

            <p>It seemed like the problem can not be repaired at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have done is download the Window 8.1 version for USB on another computer &nbsp;which took over two hours to download and setup to be used on the Dell 2550.&nbsp; When it cam to Installing I chose the Advanced settings as the first choice to repair did not work
 properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I get the Windows 8.1 to work, I will be waiting to update to Windows 10 for a while until they work out some of the kinks.</p>

<h2>            Installing Windows 10 on Mac error 605</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've created a bootable USB drive using bootcamp to install Windows 10 on my Macbook Pro. However when the system reboots to start installation, I encounter Error 605 as shown in the picture. Can anybody help me how to recover the problem and go ahead with
 the installation.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/82a0e0fb-c3fa-451b-9492-cb33f6ac0ffe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/82a0e0fb-c3fa-451b-9492-cb33f6ac0ffe" /></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi Arthur,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any progress and fix for the HDCP support for the Surface Pro 3 screen (not external display).</p>
<p>I am trying to mirror the screen of my android phone (Oreo 8.0) to the Surface Pro 3.</p>
<p>I simply want to see my phone screen on the SP3 screen, no digital protected content, movie etc...</p>
<p>I want to see an app I am running on the phone (drone control app) and my Surface (as there is no Windows 10 app for the drone).</p>
<p>
</p><p>All my "Projecting to this PC" settings are OK.</p>
<p>I launch the Connect app to make the surface discoverable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then get an error telling me that the Surface Pro 3 doesn't support HDCP, hence my phone cannot mirror the screen to the SP3...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let me know asap.</p>
<p>

<h2>            error 0xc0000225 windows does not start up</h2>
                    hello everyone<br />
i have a sony vaio, windows vista home premium edition, and basically my computer was working fine and all of a sudden it went off, and when i restarted it, it directly went into windows startup repair options and would not fix the probelm in automatic startup
 repair, i tried several times but everytime i restarted it, it would show windows loading files and go directly into the startup repair options.&nbsp;<br />
after that i followed some instructions online about going through command prompt and typing bootrec.exe and rebuilding the boot or something (sorry iam seriously technically incompetent) and now all i get whenever i start my compputer is a black screen saying<br />
'windows failed to start, a recent hardware or software change might be the cause. to fix the problem<br />
1. insert your windows installation cd and restart your computer<br />
2.choose your language settings and click next<br />
3.click repair your computer<br />
<br />
except i dont have my vista cd so iam basically screwed, the page also reads<br />
file: \windows\system32\drivers\qzgvarw.sys<br />
status: 0xc0000225<br />
info: windows failed to load because of a critical system driver is missing, or corrupt<br />
<br />
so i really needs someone help since i have so much of my proffesional work on my hard drive and i cant reformat everything since i didnt make a backup, i also have a partition on my harddrive is there anyway i can transfer important files from my operating
 system hardrive to my other one????<br />
please help, freaking out here!!

<p><span><span>We'll need to do a general troubleshooting to see if we can identify and resolve the problem.<span>&nbsp;</span>Skip any steps that require booting into normal mode for now and
 then reply with results. Use the disk or safe mode where required (if unable to boot into safe mode either, skip those steps as well).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The best solution is to find a genuine Vista Installation Disk of the same size and extract the missing or corrupt driver and replace it using:<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/261616-extract-files-vista-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/261616-extract-files-vista-installation-dvd.html</a>.&nbsp;
 Having that disk will also help later and may be very important depending on what we find.&nbsp; Anyway, let's move on.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span></span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above information
 you should be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp;
 Here's the procedure: </span></span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
</span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span></span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD (perhaps made on a different computer or perhaps in safe mode with networking if that is working).<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp;
 It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;startup (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer).&nbsp; Here's how
 to use Event Viewer: </span></span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Look in the System section.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be infected with malware. Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem
 (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:</span></span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and</span></span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span></span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a><span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span></span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></a><span><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:</span></span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a><span><span>
 and Avast at: </span></span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the free OneCare at</span></span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/whatsnew.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/whatsnew.htm</span></span></a><span><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work,</span><span><span>try a clean boot&nbsp;</span></span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></span></span></a><span><span><span><span>.&nbsp;
 If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as
 explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be having troubles with your device drivers, firmware, and/or software.&nbsp;</span><span>Go to Device Manager by going to start / search
 box and type device manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each
 for further details and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (and you should do any you have time to do - they may help in ways beyond just resolving this problem), do so from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp;
 In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a><span><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span></span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let's test your hard drive and RAM for hardware problems:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To test your hard drive, check the manufacturer and then get the diagnostic utility from:</span></span><a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html</span></span></a><span><span>
 (and/or get one from your hard drive or computer manufacturer if they have one available – it wouldn’t hurt to try both).&nbsp; If it fails the test, replace it.&nbsp; If it passes the test, then there's probably nothing wrong with it.<br />
<br />
You can also test your RAM at </span></span><a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.memtest.org/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 If it fails, test each chip individually to find those that are bad and replace them.&nbsp; If it passes, RAM is probably OK.<br />

If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; To do this you have to also be able to boot normally which may rule out this option even if you
 do find a disk.<span>&nbsp; </span>Here's the procedure: </span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a><span><span>.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Please
 reply before doing the next step as it is a radical option and I’d like to make sure we’ve ruled out all other options before taking that step.</span></span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work (or you don’t have the disk), then I'm afraid the only option is a clean install.&nbsp; You can use Knoppix</span><a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;with
 a good ISO copier like: </span><a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with a blank CD.&nbsp; This should give you enough access to the system (if you can't get in any other way) to backup your important data.&nbsp; Once done, you can do a clean install either using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk or the Recovery Disk or the
 Recovery Partition (whatever process is dictated by your computer manufacturer – you may need to contact them for the procedure and perhaps to get recovery disks).&nbsp; To do a clean install proceed as follows:</span><a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;(adapted
 as necessary by the procedures of your computer manufacturer).&nbsp; Then you will need to re-install all your programs, reset all your preferences, reconfigure your network and email settings, restore your backed up data, run Windows Update with possibly nearly
 150 updates pending,...</span></p>
<p><span><span>Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Good luck!</span></span></p>

<h2>            joystick problem in windows 10 &#63;</h2>
                    ı have used&nbsp; logitech extreme 3D PRO for 2 years in x-plane 11 flight simulator game&nbsp; succesfully.But until 2&nbsp; weeks ago. Nowadays x-plane 11 can't see my joysticks. May be windows 10 does not&nbsp; recognise my joysticks any more ?. İs that true ?. What&nbsp; can
 ı do in order to solve this problem. Thank you&nbsp;

            Windows Key+X &gt; Device Manager &gt; View tab &gt; Show hidden devices &gt; See if you can spot your joystick anywhere &gt; If yes, right click on that and update.
<br />
<br />There are three other actions which you can undertake
<br />
<br />1. Restore from a system restore point to a point when things were working fine
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. If the issue has been caused due to recent Windows update - I would suggest that you uninstall the latest KB update  and hide it so that it doesn't install it automatically and wait for new update to come which will be installed automatically.
<br />
<br />To know which update got installed
<br />Windows Key+i to invoke Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Click View installed update history.  These KBs should be from the below list. Don't uninstall any other KB
<br />For 1809 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619</a>
<br />For 1803 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479</a>
<br />Make note of KB and uninstall and block it.
<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; Type: appwiz.cpl &gt; Enter &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Select the required updates, right click, uninstall.
<br />Block
<br />Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update
<br />Download the tool from below link
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions
<br />
<br />3. Perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repair-install-windows-10-place-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repai...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

<p>Are you using the Logitech <em>LGS 510.127</em> x64 profiling software ?</p>
<p><a href="https://support.logitech.com/en_gb/product/extreme-3d-pro/downloads#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.logitech.com/en_gb/product/extreme-3d-pro/downloads#</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, you may be having the problem I've had with my Logitech G27 wheel since the start of Win10.
<br />
I have to reinstall the LSG510 software each time I use the wheel (after having not used if for a while, or shutting the machine down),</p>
<p>or it does not identify the wheel correctly, instead identifying it as newer cheaper Logi wheel that does not have the same functions.</p>
<p>I am now on Win10 v1809 and the same applies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your case it may have started loosing sight of the joystick altogether after doing a Windows Update ? If so, reinstalling the</p>
<p>software may help.</p>

                    <p>since installing November update in windows 10,&nbsp;when I right click on the desktop, it takes along time to display the context menu. It used to display instantly before the upgrade. I get no errors, the menu displays after long time. Also now can't copy/paste
 any more. </p>
<p>and can't search for update it as it stuck on windows update and i can't choose any thing in update&amp;security list

    <title>Task Scheduler - Sunday After Second Tuesday - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david92590  say:</h3>
<h2>            Task Scheduler - Sunday After Second Tuesday</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a script that automatically installs new Microsoft updates and then emails me what was updated, failed, ect. My install window is on the Sunday following patch Tuesday.&nbsp; Does anyone know of a way to schedule this task in windows task scheduler?&nbsp; Currently
 I have 12 tasks, one for each month, but am hoping to get this down to one. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In my searches prior to this post I was hoping to find a way to calculate the second Tuesday (easy) and then add 5 days, but I have not been able to find a way to do this in task scheduler.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />
Thank you!<br />
</p>

<h2>            Login to Microsoft to get Cortana to function fully-why&#63;</h2>
                    I bought a new computer with windows 10. I've had software issues and have just had it back from my retailer. They have re-loaded windows 10 and it all seems to work ok now -&nbsp;but Cortana now wants me to log into my account before it functions fully, but
 its suggesting that if I go down this route I will have to log into my account to access Cortana and possibly other functions each time. No way, I have logged in using my password, I expect to use everything without having to log into Microsoft each time.
 Shouldn't the log in to Microsoft just be automatic.&nbsp; How can I avoid this, I have read of others having problems so I would rather just not use the Cortana app rather than risk being asked to log in continually?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>While you can set Cortana to work on a Windows 10 local user account, you will still need the details of a Microsoft account to
</span><span>activa</span><span>te and use Cortana. You will keep using your local user account in Windows 10 but, for using Cortana, you also need to provide a Microsoft account.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The first thing you have to do is login with your local user account. Then, click or tap on Cortana’s search field from the taskbar.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.digitalcitizen.life%2fsites%2fdefault%2ffiles%2fgdrive%2fwin10_cortana_local%2fcortana_local_0" height="159" width="487" /></span></p>
<p><span>Then, at the bottom of Cortana’s dialog box, she’ll tell you a bit about herself and then ask you if you want to enable her. Click or tap the
</span><span>Next</span><span>&nbsp;button.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fwww.digitalcitizen.life%2fsites%2fdefault%2ffiles%2fgdrive%2fwin10_cortana_local%2fcortana_local_1" height="623" width="496" /></span></p>
<p><span>Cortana will let you know that, in order for her to </span>
<span>“do her best work”</span><span>, Microsoft collects and uses information about you and your devices. This is a glimpse into Cortana’s privacy statement and she also provides a link which you can use to open the full
</span><span>Privacy Statement</span><span>. If you are OK with Microsoft using your information, click or tap
</span><span>Use Cortana</span><span>&nbsp;to continue with the setup.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After agreeing with its privacy terms, Cortana will ask you to sign in with a Microsoft account. These are her exact words:
</span><span>“Before we get started, I’ll need you to sign in with a Microsoft account”</span><span>. Sounds strange, right? After all, we want to use Cortana on a local user account, not a Microsoft account. But, as we mentioned in the first
 section of this tutorial, Cortana still needs a Microsoft account for her to work. This account will be used only by Cortana, to provide you the services she’s been built to provide.</span></p>
<p><span>Fortunately, as you will see later on, you will be able to set the Microsoft account to be used
</span><span>only</span><span>&nbsp;with Cortana, not with any other features or apps from Windows 10. Also, it will not replace your local account in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For now, you will need to press the </span><span>Sign in</span><span>&nbsp;button.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Enter the details of your Microsoft account and click or tap on
</span><span>Sign in</span><span>. If you don’t already have a Microsoft account, you can also choose to
</span><span>Create one</span><span>&nbsp;straight from this dialog box.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>At this step, Microsoft will try to convince you to switch your local Windows 10 user account to a Microsoft account. Don’t jump to conclusions and read carefully: on the bottom of this dialog box, you’ll find a link that says
</span><span>“Sign in to just this app instead”</span><span>. If you click or tap this link, your Microsoft account will be used only with Cortana, not with anything else. Neither Windows 10,
</span><span>nor </span><span>any other app or feature, will be able to use your Microsoft account. You will keep using your local user account in Windows 10, just like before.</span><span>That’s it! Now Cortana is enabled and working
 for your local account on your Windows 10 device.</span></p>

    <title>Keyboard stops working after recording one keystroke - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mattfanguy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Keyboard stops working after recording one keystroke</h2>
                    <p>I've tried two different corded USB keyboards now on my Desktop and both gave the same problem leading me to believe this has something to do with Windows 10 or my actual computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The keyboards were recognized and named correctly in "Settings&gt;Devices&gt;Bluetooth &amp; other devices", and listed on device manager as "HID Keyboard devices". However, the problem I'm getting is that after plugging in the keyboard and clicking in a field that
 allows me to type I can press a key and it will record that one keystroke, but afterwards it will completely stop recording anymore. I can repeat this over and over by unplugging and reconnecting the keyboard, each time only allowing one keystroke to be recorded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Would anyone have a suggestion for how to go about troubleshooting this? I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling drivers, restarting, downloading new drivers, all with no luck and I'm running out of ideas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks so much in advance.</p>

<p>P90x shoulders and arms is a simple resistance workout and the 10 minute trainers are awesome but very fast paced for beginners. &nbsp;If you have any questions add me on XBL I am a personal trainer/ orthopedic surgeon plus I am a beachbody coach so I can probably
 answer most of your questions or at least point you in the right direction. &nbsp;Most importantly be consistent and don't give up. &nbsp;Keep pushing play!!!</p>

<p>Like CATigerman said, do a 10 minute one. &nbsp;Then if you're not dying lol, do another 10 minute one right after. &nbsp;Only after you can do these back-to-back with 5 stars would I go into the 20 minute ones and then eventually venture into any of the 30 minute
 or more workouts. &nbsp;You definitely don't want to jump in too fast, get so sore you can't walk or sit down/up normal for a week, and then won't want to do it again :-).</p>

<p>@Rangerprime X,im seeing more and more of these threads pop up,and being completely serious I have 7 years worth of education and qualifications in gym instructoring,I can not express enough,xb1 fitness will not help anyone starting out on a fitness regieme.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Fitness beginners need a complete health assesment to obtain the optimal programme for their needs,by a fully qualified gym instructor, end off.it is against all health and safety any other way.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Please for the benefit of your health in general get yourself down the gym/leisure centre and ask for advise and help,it will get you away form the xb1 of which sadly is a big addition to overall fitness problems in society,gyms aint exspensive if you look
 around.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I wish you all the best for your future indevous with fitness and put ya mind to it and no goal is unachieveable.The power of the group in society is a powerful thing;and that fully implys when you become a regular at any gym,you will get a 100% more support
 ,help and advise.</p>

<p>I agree with Saber to an extent....The only problem I have is that most of your personal trainers, especially at these 24 hour locations, are not college graduates and don't have an extensive background in general health and wellness. &nbsp;The only person I
 would trust to give actual advise about your health and if you are ready to take on any kind of workout regime is a licensed physician. (Xbox Fitness also suggests this in the fine print) &nbsp;No offense against any personal trainers out there, but there are a
 lot of personal trainers out there that over step certain boundaries and give advice that they are not licensed to give.</p>

<p>I would appreciate anything showing the recommended fitness level. And a beginners fitness would be nice to learn the various steps.
</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>I'm sorry, but the trainers in Xbox Fitness walk through a step once then go full speed. I'm not a couch potato by any means. I've never been to an aerobics class so I don't know the "oldies but goodies" steps. Rewinding constantly just gets frustrating
 and sends me back to the treadmill (which I'm tired of and why I started using Xbox Fitness).</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>At least Dance Central gave you the option to slow down steps till you felt comfortable enought to do them at full speed.</p>

<p>The Jillian Michaels ripped in 30 is a decent one. &nbsp;You arent going to get all the way through it &nbsp;the first time (if you are a couch potato) but if you do the first 15 minutes you can come back to it in a couple of days and get further with each visit.
 &nbsp;Most of the exercises are simple enough to understand how to do right away. &nbsp;Its challenging but relatively simple. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>That being said, yes, of course this shouldnt be your only fitness option, but it certainly worked out great in a pinch on some mornings where I didnt want to fight the snowstorm or the negative five temps. &nbsp;Get out and do some walking, do some hiking, hit
 the gym if you like, but theres nothing wrong with getting some acheivements while sweating inyour own living room. Just be sure to know your limits.</p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<h2>            Unable to type password after installing Skype</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed Skype ver. 7.38.0.101 and I can't type my password after installing. This field is inactive, I can't click on it. I know, that some time ago there was such a problem but on older version. This is the first log-in after installing (Widnows 7).</p>

            I solved the problem. I uninstalled Internet Explorer 11. After reboot I noticed that windows installed older version - IE10. After that, I could type a password, so Skype now works :)

<p>I. Hate. Vista. Windows XP has NEVER been this difficult to work with!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I recently installed MagicISO. Didn't like it, so I deleted it. It left behind the folder and a small dll file. I wanted to delete both, couldn't.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tried safe mode. FAILED</p>
<p>Tried Administrator Account. FAILED</p>
<p>Tried both together. FAILED</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help me please? How can I not have permission to delete a file in administrator mode? Seriously, Windows Vista is just messed up beyond all recognition... *rant rant rant*</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Went into safe mode.</p>
<p>Used ShellExViewer (RUN AS ADMIN) and disabled MagicISO.</p>
<p>Went over to the directory and delete the .dll along with the folder it was in.</p>
<p>Restarted my computer in normal mode.</p>

 anything to do with me. &nbsp;Also when support "locked my account" they kid somehow regained access and was still able to use it. This was the "FIFA hack" where my account was used to buy dlc.</p>

            Yes, no problem. Your license allows you the option to switch from 32 to 64 bit as needed. But it is not an "upgrade" type process. You will have to do a "clean install" of the 64 bit version.  This will wipe out all installed programs and all of your data files. So make sure to backup your data files first, and that you have all of the information you need to re-install your programs.

            Switching to Windows 10 64 bit is free, you don't have to pay for it. As long as you have a qualifying Windows 7 or 8 or Windows 10 license, you are entitled to use it.
<br />Switching requires that you perform a new installation, that means files, applications and settings will be deleted.
<br />
<br />You will have to reinstall applications and native 64 bit drivers.

            in your ISO there should be multiple setup.exe files. Make use you are running the right one.  I wonder if you were trying to run a 64 bit setup on a 32 bit computer?

            In that case all I can suggest is try downloading the installation file again and recreating the bootable installation dvd/usb (whichever you are using).
<br />
<br />Actually, you could try this bootable medium on a different computer, to see if it will boot or not (stopping before it actually does anything).

 10. As far as I know it never has had Windows 7&nbsp;loaded on it. There was an odd occurrence prior to this "reversion". I powered my computer up and it bypassed the login screen and went directly to solitaire. I assumed my wife was playing this game when she
 shut it off the night before. When I closed solitaire and went to the start screen I received an error message saying that there was a problem that Windows needed to fix. It then went through a disk check and restart. The login screen still looks like Windows

<p>Geethu - Thank you for offering to help. First of all I think that I am still on Windows 10. At least that is what the banner at the top of the System page says. I am running a HP Pavilion (p7-1439 PC) with AMD 10 Quad-Core, 8GB DDR3, 1.5 TB hard drive that
 came with Windows 8. After I converted to Windows 10 I could left-click the Start button and some tiles would pop-up along with the normal start button actions.&nbsp;Now the Start key does nothing, nor does anything happen when I left-click the start button with
 my mouse. But if I right-click the start button I get this:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0b09b2e3-540e-469f-b47a-e9f6d7a7bd3d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0b09b2e3-540e-469f-b47a-e9f6d7a7bd3d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And when I go to&nbsp;Control Panel I get something completely different from what&nbsp;I used to get. I cannot check for updates, nor does it appear that I have had any from Windows for sometime. See the reference to Windows 7 which was never installed on this computer:&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5619eee3-438e-490b-ac46-b64772439edf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5619eee3-438e-490b-ac46-b64772439edf" /></a></p>
