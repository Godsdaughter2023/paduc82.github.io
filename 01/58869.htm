<h2>            How to disable Fn lock on the Surface Book</h2>
                    <p><span>I have a surface book and for a while now the Fn key has been locked.</span></p>
<p><span>When I press the Fn key the light on the key remains on.</span></p>
<p><span>I'm just wondering how I can unlock the key?</span></p>
<p><span>I have restarted my computer and have done a system restore and the issue still remains.</span></p>
<p><span>I also do not have any updates available.</span></p>
<p><span>Please note that I have a Surface Book and not a Surface Pro, therefore the CAPS + Fn method does not unlock it.</span></p>
<p><span>So, my question is, how do I unlock the button?</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Some issues can be resolved by updates. We suggest that you install any available
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/install-update-activate/surface-book-update-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">updates</a></strong> on your device. By the way, to resolve your Fn key issue, please try holding the Fn
 key down for 15 seconds. The little light at the upper right hand corner of the Fn key itself should light up and stay that way between reboots.

<p><span>5 steps: How to set up your home wireless network</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/athome/organization/wirelesssetup.aspx#fbid=Gy36bMJUxrq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/athome/organization/wirelesssetup.aspx#fbid=Gy36bMJUxrq</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p><strong><span><span>Export Wireless Network Profile</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>1) Go to <strong>Start -&gt; All Programs -&gt; Accessories</strong> -&gt; then click on
<strong>Command Prompt (cmd.exe)</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span>2) Command prompt window will open, then type <strong>netsh wlan show profiles</strong> and hit
<strong>Enter</strong> button to show available wireless network profiles on this computer.</span></p>
<p><span>3) Let’s say you want to export home-network profile to a thumb drive for example (G:\wireless-profile), In that case you have to issue the command
<strong>netsh wlan export profile name="home-network" folder="g:\wireless-profile"</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Home network is just an example, you have to enter your networks name in place of home network.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: This command usage: netsh wlan export profile name="</span><span>profile-name</span><span>" folder="</span><span>the-folder-you-want-to-export-to</span><span>"</span></p>
<p><span>4) Then you have to go to your thumb drive folder for example (G:wireless-profile) and see there is an exported profile. Your network profile will be created as
<strong>Wireless Network connection-</strong></span><strong><span>"profile-name"</span></strong><strong><span>.xml</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Import Wireless Network Profile</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>1) Open the command prompt again, type <strong>netstat wlan show profile</strong>, and you will see no profile here. Then you type
<strong>netsh wlan add profile filename="g:\wireless-profile\Wireless Network Connection-home-network.xml"</strong>, you will then add the profile successfully on this computer. By default it will add to all user profiles, so everybody on this computer can
 see this new profile and use it. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: This command usage: netsh wlan add profile filename="</span><span>location-of-the profile-you-want-to-import</span><span>" user=</span><span>current/all</span><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>2) If you open your <strong>Manage Wireless Networks</strong> window, you will see the new profile there.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Windows 7 makes it easy to export your wireless settings from one machine to another.The backup of the wireless networks settings can be easily done from Windows 7, and the settings can be saved to a USB stick, and then the settings can be imported
 on laptops &amp; netbooks running Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7.</span></p>
<p><strong><strong><span>How to Save Your Wireless Network Settings</span></strong></strong></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>First, open the <strong>Network and Sharing Center</strong>. You can do this by clicking on the wireless network symbol from the taskbar and clicking on
<strong>‘Open Network and Sharing Center’</strong>. An alternative would be to go to
<strong>Control Panel -&gt; Network and Internet -&gt; Network and Sharing Center</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>On the <strong>left side</strong> of the
<strong>Network and Sharing Center window</strong>, click on the ‘<strong>Manage wireless networks</strong>’ link.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>In the <strong>Manage Wireless Networks window</strong> you will see a list with all wireless networks to which you have connected in the past<strong>. Double click</strong> on the one which interests you.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Now you will see a window with all its properties. In order to save them on a flash drive, click on the bottom link which says
<strong>‘Copy this network profile to a USB flash drive</strong>’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>The <strong>Copy Network Settings wizard</strong> will now start. Insert the USB flash drive, wait until it is detected and the
<strong>Next button is no longer gray</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>The copying process will take only a few seconds. When done, click on
<strong>Close</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>If you will look on your USB flash drive you will see a
<strong>setupSNK.exe</strong> file and a <strong>SMRTNTKY</strong> folder. Make sure you don’t delete them from the memory stick.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><strong><span>How to Import Your Wireless Network Settings</span></strong></strong></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>First, plug in the USB flash drive in the laptop where you want to import the settings and run the
<strong>setupSNK.exe</strong> file. When the <strong>Wireless Network Setup Wizard launches</strong>, click on
<strong>Yes</strong>.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>The settings will be imported in seconds and when receiving the notification below, click on
<strong>OK</strong> and start using the wireless network.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>This procedure is very helpful for both public and hidden wireless networks. Instead of typing long authentication keys, it is easier to plug in an USB memory stick and run a setup file.</span></p>

    <title>Missing Battery Option in Power Option Profile - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anthony scalese  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing Battery Option in Power Option Profile</h2>
                    I am running Windows 7 Enterprise Edition SP1 64 Bit on a <b>desktop</b> PC that I built.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I recently purchased an APC 1500 UPS backup battery. &nbsp;I connected the battery to the PC using the APC supplied cable. &nbsp;The battery appears in my Device List but does not show in my Power Options advanced options.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c1b4b194-3a18-451d-a758-bddf68af90dc" /></div>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0c38731d-70a4-4874-bf81-245d52874c39" /></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am looking to add this so that I can shut down other devices &amp; PCs on my <b>
home</b> network when the battery reaches a certain level. &nbsp;I have a command file that I will use to do this but need to have the battery options in order to kick off the command file when the battery is being used and running low.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have been searching the web for a couple of days trying to find solutions. &nbsp;I have modified the registry per this posting (<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/power-icon-from-the-task-bar-is-missing/e7f180ef-81e3-40da-8703-64aced7383c7">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/power-icon-from-the-task-bar-is-missing/e7f180ef-81e3-40da-8703-64aced7383c7</a>)
 but the power icon for the notification area is still greyed out.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0dfacc9f-32ff-4907-b50a-da29beae05f8" /></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have also run this Microsoft FixIt (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/945011/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/945011/en-us</a>) and that has not helped. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried modifying the local group policies (<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/19085-system-icons-enable-disable.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/19085-system-icons-enable-disable.html</a>)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Finally I tried an SFC scan as noted in this post (<a href="http://bd-programmers.blogspot.com/2011/11/vbnet-mysql-connection-adodb.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://bd-programmers.blogspot.com/2011/11/vbnet-mysql-connection-adodb.html</a>) but no issues were found.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have rebooted my PC after all of these actions and none has worked.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help? &nbsp;Many thanks!</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            Cannot downgrade from Windows 8.1 Pro to Windows 8.1 Core OEM</h2>
                    I tried to downgrade from Windows 8.1 Pro to Windows 8.1 OEM, but it keeps giving me the installation failed code and restoring to the windows 8.1 Pro version. I did try to modify the registry at least, but it did not help. I don't need a full reinstall,
 but just a downgrade to the core version. I did extract the OEM serial key.

                    <p>I would like to add space to my C drive partition, but there is a Recovery partition&nbsp;space between my unallocated space and the c drive, is there a way to remove, or move the&nbsp;Recovery partition? I cannot update windows 10 at all until I get more space on
 my C drive, I have my OS on&nbsp;a solid state drive.

</p><p>Thank you for coming to the forums. We'd be happy to help you figure out why Xbox Live is not working for you, but we'll need more information about the issue. Also, we shouldn't be discussing the use of VPN's on the forum since it goes against guidelines
 to discuss something that uses the service in a way that is not intended. Using a VPN is under your discretion but shouldn't be talked about here on the Xbox forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What error are you getting when trying to connect to Xbox Live via your home network? What troubleshooting steps have you already tried that did not help? Do you connect wireless or hardwired to the router?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give us some more information about the issue and we'll be happy to help you figure this out.</p>

            <p>Hello Frankie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I can understand that inconvenience you are gong through specially when it is about your security information we regret the inconvenience. Let me ask you a few questions to understand the issue better;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What is/was the name of the app?</li><li>Are you referring to Mail app?</li><li>Are you able to sing-in to your Gmail account using web browser (Internet Explorer or any other)?</li><li>Are you logged in to the same Gmail account on any other device (phone, another PC or tablet&nbsp;etc.)?</li><li>What are&nbsp;"few other things"?</li><li>Do you use Microsoft Account to sign-in to the computer?</li></ul>
<p>Messages like "someone just tried to sign in to your google account from an app that doesn't meet modern security standards" are prompted when generally you are trying to access the same Gmail account which may be logged-in to any other device or when you
 change your geographical location. </p>
<p>
</p><p>"Microsoft wanting access to my email" is never any term/condition to let you access your personal information on your Windows devices from Microsoft. Please refer to:
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/online-privacy/msname.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Avoid scams that use the Microsoft name fraudulently</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use Microsoft Account to sing-in to your PC, all the apps and settings are synced together. However, Microsoft has no access to your information about your personal information.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer to: <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-live/sign-in-what-is-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">What is a Microsoft account?</a></strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-in/account/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">One account for all things Microsoft</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>As of now, we are not aware which exactly is the app you are referring to so we can exactly help you with the answer. However, you may want to try the following steps and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may want to try the&nbsp;option is to reduce Google's security requirement, also known as "Enable Less Secure Apps".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer to: <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6009563" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are referring to Mail app, as of now, I would suggest you to <strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/add-accounts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">remove the account</a></strong> and create a new user account. Once you have
 created a new user account, try adding your Gmail account to Mail app and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To create a new user account:</p>

            <div>thank you for your quick reply.&nbsp; I understand only part of your reply though.&nbsp;
<div>i have three gmail accounts but only one of them is in question.&nbsp; the other two no problems.&nbsp;
<div>pretty much i have tried most of what you have suggested.&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This has been an issue for several months and i have been trying to find and resolve this since then.&nbsp; this may take a few days for me to re address or duplicate the error or whatever this issue is.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>basically i have this email set up on all my computers, android phone and tablets&nbsp; so when this started happening about two months ago roughly. &nbsp;i have tried all avenues that i could think of why.&nbsp;&nbsp;Since&nbsp;I have&nbsp;warranty/support with Dell &nbsp;I&nbsp; communicated
 with&nbsp;them&nbsp;regarding this issue. they have no clue.&nbsp; but they did run diagnostic etc</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>to answer some of the questions you brought up and I will reply again with more information</p>
<p>as soon I understand the rest of&nbsp;your message.&nbsp; look for follow up&nbsp;a bit later &nbsp;</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<ul>
<li>What is/was the name of the app?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li></ul>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div>That is the unknown&nbsp; i have no idea and no response or info through with google</div>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<ul>
<li>Are you referring to Mail app?</li></ul>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div>&nbsp;I believe it might have something to do with the mail app, not sure, but &nbsp;if by mail app you are referring to the start page with the tile labeled mail.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;I have windows 8.1 and on the start page there is a tile&nbsp;‘mail’ in there&nbsp;I&nbsp; set up or added some of my other email accounts there for quick access to them opposed to going to IE &gt; Google mail or Gmail &gt; sign in etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have my yahoo account set up there
 too no problems with that. &nbsp;&nbsp; I did all that in 2014 and never had any problems or issue until recently</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<ul>
<li>Are you able to sign-in to your Gmail account using web browser (Internet Explorer or any other)?</li></ul>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div>I believe so.&nbsp; however, this issue&nbsp;I only noticed it mostly on one device&nbsp;but did on occasions experience it my phone I think and maybe one other pc.&nbsp; not sure since this pretty much started around Halloween or just before thanksgiving and so much going
 on and no time to&nbsp;have dealt with it then. &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Are you logged in to the same Gmail account on any other device (phone, another PC or tablet&nbsp;etc.)?</li></ul>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<div>the answer to this would be NO if you are referring to being logged in&nbsp;‘at the same time’ on any other devices.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>What are&nbsp;"few other things"?</li></ul>
<p>could not remember all of the information and did not have time to&nbsp;re create the issue before sending message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>have been very frustrated with this&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<li>Do you use Microsoft Account to sign-in to the computer?</li></ul>

<div>
<p>don’t understand this exactly.&nbsp; I'm still new to windows 8 8.1 etc&nbsp; as I <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
am a die hard XP fan&nbsp; would love to see that back </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, since have been unable to get this addressed I had removed that one gmail account from that one computer as I believe it may only be the one that has the issue with the account.&nbsp; I seem to be able to get my emails from the other computers that have
 that&nbsp;same account on them as well.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to try and re set&nbsp;up that email through the one computer and see what happens and will print screen and paste or write down the exact message that I get regarding Microsoft wanting to get into&nbsp;my email account. &nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>having problems with my gmail account thru the I guess it would be the app on the start page in windows 8.1.&nbsp; had to remove it, because I kept getting messages from gmail stating that some one was trying to access my email.&nbsp; message states: someone just
 tried to sign in to your google account from an app that doesn't meet modern security standards.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have been trying to get answers from Google as to WHAT APP.&nbsp; no response from them&nbsp; so I removed that account from system thinking maybe try removing and resetting up. only now I get a message popup from Microsoft wanting access to my email.&nbsp; I am taking
 that as Microsoft WANTS TO READ MY EMAIL&nbsp; and it also mentions a few other things they want from me as well.&nbsp; all private stuff...&nbsp; HOW DARE MICROSOFT..</p>
<p>&nbsp;any one else have this problem??&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<h2>            DELL N5110 Wifi Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>hello dears</p>
<p>let me clearly state the problem</p>
<p>i had migrated to windows 10. the problem is that all devices at home can connect to modem/router. which is tplink w8951nd</p>
<p>but my device couldnt connect.</p>
<p>i had tried to install dell official windows 8.1 wifi driver on my device but it clearly said that this software is not compatible with this operating system even after using windows 10 compatibility solver. the device doesn't connect but sometimes and it
 does not have internet access.</p>
<p>other devices can connect to modem without any problem</p>
<p>there was not such issues on windows 7</p>

    <title>File Size in Movie Maker - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dwarfelvishdiplomacy  say:</h3>
<h2>            File Size in Movie Maker</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>I am doing videos on YouTube and for cutting i use the Movie maker because often i don't need to do much stuff, only put one or 3 files together.</p>
<p>Now my Problem</p>
<p>Every time i save the movie the file size gets ridiculously big for no apparent reason</p>
<p>as a example :</p>
<p>I&nbsp; have a recording in 130 MB in MP4 format,</p>
<p>all i want to do is put my intro in front of it which is 20 MB big also in MP4</p>
<p>When i am going to safe movie the size of the file will be over 1 GB without gaining any quality of course.</p>
<p>Can anyone give me a tip on how to prevent this ?</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Pick settings closer to the original format. For example, pick lower dimensions and a lower bitrate. As you hover over a save setting in Movie Maker, it will show you details of estimated size per minute of video. Use that to estimate the final file size.
 Pick one that matches with your desired size. You can also create a custom output profile with exactly the settings you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, are you using Movie Maker 2012 or an earlier version? The earlier versions only save in .wmv which has slightly lower compression compared to .mp4 which is the default in Movie Maker 2012.</p>

            <p>Sadly i don't seem to have the option to change that.</p>
<p>I ca go for some of the presets like Youtube/HD Display but most of them are increasing the file size in a really huge way , the other ones are decreasing the quality so far that you cant see anything.</p>
<p>When i am doing my Nethack series a low bitrate and 720 p are alright but when i am doing a High end flight sim like rise of flight its just unwatchable</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder what is happening there, there is no visible change between the cut together video and the clips itself when i am saving it with the recommended setting but still the file would be 400 % bigger and it would take me days to upload them.</p>

            <p>You might want to try using another utility (like Handbrake or Freemake Video Encoder) for encoding them down to a smaller size. In fact, if you use Freemake Video Converter, I think you can just give it the two files and let it do the joining and encoding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, be sure to choose a "Custom install" of the program so that you can uncheck anything extra it tries to install.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Update error  WindowsUpdate_80080005 WindowsUpdate_dt000</h2>
                    <p>The error started around the 29th November, I've tried the following solutions found on the Microsoft forums;</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Resetting Windows Defender (The History is completely wiped now, there's no updates in the history or anything)</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">*Using the Windows Diag tools&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/928c0489-7418-417d-b59d-d4bf71206b6f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/928c0489-7418-417d-b59d-d4bf71206b6f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5d503db4-50fa-47e2-b0c2-e99620029946" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5d503db4-50fa-47e2-b0c2-e99620029946" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither of those two tools fixed the problem. Around this time parts of my Anti Virus also stopped working.(ESET NOD)</p>
<p>I also tried several solutions on fixing the ESET NOD anti virus, the repair tool etc. But back to the issue at hand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*I have reset the registery as to what "default" options would be I'm pretty sure.</p>
<p>*Scanned for Malware with ESET Online Scanner, MBAM. (MBAM found something that is identified as a MSIL.Dropper, also found a MSIL/Livate, both got removed, and there's no&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">visibile</span> traces of them anywhere on
 the computer with MBAM anymore.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Removed a Rootkit with a name I don't remember.</p>
<p>*Cleaned the PC with CC cleaner before using the tools above.</p>
<p>*Used a clean bootup on my PC.</p>
<p>

<p>You cannot put a hard drive with Windows 10 into a device which has never had Windows 10 (same edition) and expect Windows to remain activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hard drives play no role in activation.&nbsp; There are no Windows 10 activation files kept on the local hard drive.&nbsp; It is all about the device now.&nbsp; This is a big change from previous versions of Windows.&nbsp; The activation data is now kept on Microsoft's servers,
 not on the computer.&nbsp; This is an anti-piracy measure.&nbsp; No files to hack.&nbsp; Instead, Microsoft now uses the unique hardware identifiers (motherboard serial number, etc.).&nbsp; The Windows license is tied to those.&nbsp; When you moved the hard drive the new device's
 unique identifiers did not match any data on Microsoft's Windows 10 registration servers anymore.&nbsp; That's why simply moving the hard drive is causing you the messages you are getting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A device (desktop, laptop, tablet, etc.) must be a registered Windows 10 device for the edition installed on the HDD in order for Windows 10 to activate and remain activated.&nbsp; Registration involves sending the unique hardware identifiers (from the motherboard)
 to Microsoft and once these are registered with Microsoft it is permanent.&nbsp; In your case, this can be done by entering a retail product key in Settings/Update and Security/Activation.&nbsp; If you don't have a retail product key you can purchase Windows 10 from
 the Microsoft Online Store.&nbsp; Product keys are not legitimately sold separately.</p>

<p>You cannot move the free Windows 7 to Windows 10 upgrade from the old computer to the new one without purchasing a new license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The upgrade from Windows 7 to Windows 10 did not have a unique product key.&nbsp; It was activated by digital entitlement, meaning the device is recorded with Microsoft as a Windows 10 device.&nbsp; It is not transferrable from one computer to a new computer.&nbsp; The
 product key embedded in it is a dummy key that helps Microsoft identify your Windows as the free upgrade should you need support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only retail Windows (purchased from a store) has a unique product key that can be used to activate Windows on a new computer.&nbsp; You need to purchase a new copy of Windows (same edition) from the Microsoft Store online.&nbsp; You do not need to re-install Windows,
 just put the new product key in on the Activation page.&nbsp; Sorry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once again, the copy of Windows does not matter.&nbsp; Activation is now based on the
<em>device</em>.&nbsp; Specifically the motherboard.</p>

<p>ive had players threaten to hack me allot. no one has even made a attempt cause they are normally just kids acting tough over the internet. just today on GTA4 some kid threatened to hack my account and buy a bunch of stuff, yet he blocked me afterward.</p>
<p>just make it so your account needs a password to sign in on other consoles and change your password after like 2 weeks. also reporting some numerous times wont anything , since it just counts as 1 complaint each time</p>

<p><strong>Look, More than likely Microsoft is not going to do anything about it, I've seen them turn down the same situation time and time again.</strong></p>
<p>I have dealt with hackers time and time again and I know this online world like the buttons of my controller or the back of my hand. I have defeated and saved many of my friends from hackers as well as lag switchers, and other disturbances. Now I'm not about
 to go and hack the hacker that is threatening you or anything but I am going to relay a few helpful tips over to you.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>&nbsp; .</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">HACKER DEFENSE GUIDE</span></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>If the "Hacker" Has hacked into your account before and you are afraid of him/her doing it again you should go about connecting your phone and adding multiple security questions to your profile. These additions can be used as a "Back Door' Into
 your profile and this strategy has helped me more than once in the past, Take it from someone who has over 300,000 Gamerscore and is attempted to be hacked at least once or twice a month.</strong>
</li><li>Try to recover hard evidence of the hackers intentions or incriminating actions. If you can gather a collection of images and videos to support your accusation then maybe Microsoft will take notice to your plea.
</li><li><strong>I would promote avoiding and blocking the person and yes this works most of the time but if the hacker knows how to get into your profile it would maybe be wise to gather Intel on him so that you may be able to stop him at some point. DO NOT PROVOKE
 THE HACKER!!!</strong> </li><li>If you are getting constantly "Lagged" Offline by this hacker you should start by attempting to change, randomize, or proxify your IP Address, If you have no idea what I am talking about you should look for a documentation on YouTube and also search Google
 for more information. </li><li><strong>Consult others warning them of the hackers presence and intentions, Have people file complaints on the person for network tampering or anything under that manner.</strong>
</li></ol>
<div>.</div>
<div>.</div>
<div><strong>Anyway there is not much to say but these 5 steps should help you to some degree, None the less all I can say is Good Luck out there I hope my input solves your problem!!</strong></div>

 hackers as well as lag switchers, and other disturbances. Now I'm not about to go and hack the hacker that is threatening you or anything but I am going to relay a few helpful tips over to you.</span></p>

<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(153, 204, 0, 1)"><strong>If the "Hacker" Has hacked into your account before and you are afraid of him/her doing it again you should go about connecting your phone and adding multiple security questions to your profile. These
 additions can be used as a "Back Door' Into your profile and this strategy has helped me more than once in the past, Take it from someone who has over 300,000 Gamerscore and is attempted to be hacked at least once or twice a month.</strong></span>
</li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Try to recover hard evidence of the hackers intentions or incriminating actions. If you can gather a collection of images and videos to support your accusation then maybe Microsoft will take notice to your plea.</span>
</li><li><span style="color: rgba(153, 204, 0, 1)"><strong>I would promote avoiding and blocking the person and yes this works most of the time but if the hacker knows how to get into your profile it would maybe be wise to gather Intel on him so that you may
 be able to stop him at some point. DO NOT PROVOKE THE HACKER!!!</strong></span> </li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If you are getting constantly "Lagged" Offline by this hacker you should start by attempting to change, randomize, or proxify your IP Address, If you have no idea what I am talking about you should look for a
 documentation on YouTube and also search Google for more information.</span> </li><li><span style="color: rgba(153, 204, 0, 1)"><strong>Consult others warning them of the hackers presence and intentions, Have people file complaints on the person for network tampering or anything under that manner.</strong></span>

 private and all will be good.<br />
<br />
Let's put it another way, if someone can't "hack" their way through something as simple as a Block Communications, why would anyone think they have the ability to "hack" an Account to begin with?</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(153, 204, 0, 1)">No offence but That is in your and more than likely Microsoft's opinion, I have seen and dealt with hackers for as long as I can remember. Now my opinion on how to go about this kind of thing may be unorthodox and yes
 your suggestion is the correct one but in this situation in which the hacker has already gained access to the account I am not about to stand by and do nothing just to loose another gamer that I had a chance to help.</span></strong></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>In technicality we are both more or less correct though we both seem to go about handling a specific situation in two very different ways.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(153, 204, 0, 1)">And as of hacking.. I honestly don't know why Microsoft persists to imply that hacking a/an Xbox profile is impossible. &nbsp;Well I hate to say that the world has stooped to such a low level but technology is advancing and
 I have seen someone being hacked with my own eyes. There is a program out there that recently got shut down by the Government, This program is called "Dark Comet RAT" (Remote Administration Trojan) In simplicity would have to do is use something like "Cain&amp;Able
 or Net Tools and they could easily send the Trojan to anybodies computer at all of and pull not only all of their passwords off of their computer but also all of their personal information and it gives them full access to the operations and controls of the
 infected computer.</span></strong></p>
<p>.</p>
<p>NOTE: To those of whom that want to attempt this Dark Comet is SHUT DOWN, Hacking is illegal so don't even think about trying it!!!</p>

<h3> maxwellcrystal  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to fix Game DvR problem &#34;This system doesn&#39;t meet the hardware requirements for recording clips&#34; even though you meet those standards.</h2>
                    <p>This issue has plagued the community for a while and after looking and trying everything, I've finally figured it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The short answer is, your profile (user profile) most likely has corrupted files that is causing it not to work and there's a service that will run just to disrupt it. You will have to do a clean installation of the news (1703 windows creator to fix it)<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9dcdd856-96cd-4cf7-9844-5ced25d72b2b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9dcdd856-96cd-4cf7-9844-5ced25d72b2b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>First create a new user. Use Window key + R then type in netplwiz and add a user. Then log into that user and use Window Key G to pull up the game bar or visit settings and try to check the game bar switch</p>
<p>secondly, try utilizing sfc/scannow and if nothing comes back that's fine, this is just to make sure that the issue is narrowed.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/25d149bc-b254-4da0-95db-e22bb0ea7f1b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/25d149bc-b254-4da0-95db-e22bb0ea7f1b" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/66d71985-793d-40a3-991d-1302b0a98577" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/66d71985-793d-40a3-991d-1302b0a98577" /></a></p>
<p>third, try using <span style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">
Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth in the command prompt (run as administrator). This will help to also narrow the issue down and it's also to make sure that you can restore corrupted files. If you have an install.esd or install.wim then that's fine
 but we won't mess with this just yet depending if the solution desn't work then you will have to use either&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image
 /RestoreHealth /Source:wim:Full path to install.wim file:1 /limitaccess (Remember this is only the final solution doesn't work for you or you do not wish to try it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">Now the solution is to use another user at-least in my case it was. The best way to go about this is to do a clean install of the creators
 update but before back up files that are on your C drive to another drive or usb.</span></p>
<p>I hope this helps but becareful going to MS support because when I found out the issue and wanted someone to help me move my files
 over to a newly created user, they ended up deleting 54 gigs of my data and told me they can't do anything nor would they compensate me.</p>
