    <title>System Tray Icons Disappear When Mouse Hovers Over Them - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            System Tray Icons Disappear When Mouse Hovers Over Them</h2>
                    <p>When I click the arrow on my taskbar to "show hidden icons", it will show all the icons that should be there, like my mouse config. However, when I move my mouse into that area and hover it over anything, every single icon disappears one by one. I can then
 open the settings for the taskbar and all the ones I had checked to show up, are still checked. If i uncheck and reselect and close the window, they still don't come back.&nbsp;Windows 10- valid copy from where I bought my laptop with windows 8 and got the free
 upgrade. Laptop is an MSI GP70 Leopard Pro. (if any of that is even relevant). What is going on, here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
One possible cause of Windows' misbehavior is corrupted or missing system files. For us to effectively assist you with this, we'd like to know if you've installed any Windows updates?<br />
<br />
In the meantime, we suggest running <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">System File Check
 (SFC) and Microsoft Windows Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM)</a></strong> to scan and repair all corrupted and missing system files.<br />
<br />
We're looking forward to your reply.

<p>I've got it set to do automatic updates and the system check says it did not find any integrity violation.

<p>
</p><p>ALSO:</p>
<p>I had a light bulb go off in my head earlier about this issue.My laptop had been shut and was about to shut down, but Paint was open and I never clicked save or anything, so I think it just stayed on that page until it went to hybernate or whatever. So later
 when I returned to the laptop, I opened it and it still had that page open about being unable to shut down because of paint, and I just clicked like nevermind or something. I do this A LOT, like very often. Could this be why the system tray icons disappear?
 Just reminded me of when the computer shuts down and closes all that stuff up....... Just a thought.</p>

Thank you for your reply. <br />
<br />
Your computer won't shutdown if there's a program or app opened, hence, you will be asked to close it or cancel your computer from shutting down.
<br />
<br />
"<strong>Could this be why the system tray icons disappear?</strong>" - Usually happens it there's an issue with Windows updates (e.g. corrupted or incomplete updates). For further checking, have you installed the latest major update which is Windows 10 Fall
 Creators Update? To check the version of your Windows, press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> &gt; type
<strong>winver </strong>&gt; hit <strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your reply.

Meanwhile, we suggest booting your computer in <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">safe mode</a></strong> to check if the issue will occur.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: Safe mode starts Windows in a basic state, using a limited set of files and drivers.<br />
<br />
We would appreciate an update about how it went. </p>

Thank you again for your reply. <br />
<br />
Since the issue doesn't happen in safe mode, it means that the default settings and basic device drivers aren't causing the issue. In this case, we need to determine what software is causing the issue. First, you need to
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/how-to-exit-safe-mode-in-windows-10/42105531-dde0-404d-beab-ce533349b765">boot your computer from safe mode to normal</a></strong>.
 Once your computer already in normal mode, please perform a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot</a></strong>.
<br />

<p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I would like to say that any help is extremely appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an HP Laptop that is running Windows 8.1. Recently, I have noticed that all apps originating from the Microsoft Store App have ceased working, including the store itself and Netflix. I always wait for it to load for 10 minutes, and then I get the
 error code 0x80072ee2. Similarly, I cannot seem to install any updates. I have run the update troubleshooting, which always gives me a message saying that the problem was simply not resolved, and when I had run the network troubleshooter, it says it cannot
 detect the problem. All internet communications with my browser and such are working fine. I am desperate to solve the problem and hope someone can help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Issue with black screen, dual display, ATI Integrated GPU - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> harshsyd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issue with black screen, dual display, ATI Integrated GPU</h2>
                    <p>Sorry for making this long, I couldn't explain it properly without going in detail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi there, so I have a kind of big issue. Recently I was setting up a HP Compaq 6910p Laptop for my friend with Windows 10. All is well, I know this laptop isn't "really and officially" supported by HP for Win 10 but all the drivers installed by Microsoft
 works fine and some missing I installed Vista version drivers and they worked totally fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now for my display, I have a ATI/AMD Mobility Radeon X2300 on my laptop (pretty sure this is a Integrated) and I have a issue/black screen at startup of Windows. So basically whenever I restart/boot up my PC I get a black screen with a mouse, so then
 I found a small fix which when I press <strong>Win+P</strong> and I blindly select "Extend these displays" I get my display back. So I have to do this everytime I boot and this is an issue. I found out this is&nbsp; some bug that windows creates another "virtual
 invisible monitor" which causes the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>So I went in Display Settings I found out it shows I have two displays.</p>
<p>1. Mobile PC Display (I think this is my main display)</p>
<p>2. Available display output on: AMD Mobility Radeon X2300 (this one says: "Another display not detected").</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I played around and found out the issue is with this new second display. Whenever I boot, windows loads the number 2 display and it has no display, then I gotta blindly switch with Win+P. So what is my solution here? I also upgraded some other old Lenovo
 Laptops and installed legacy GPU Drivers and they worked fine, this HP is causing an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have some Screenshots of my display settings and you can see how it has a display numbered "2" and says "Another display not detected".
<strong>I have no external monitors or anything connected, it's just plain.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Display 1: </strong>http://imgur.com/F6LAupR</p>
<p><strong>Display 2: </strong>http://imgur.com/s32571v</p>
<p>*ALSO: While being on Display 1, I click "Advanced Display Settings" and all, the box opens and shows that Mobile PC Display is running my actual GPU and shows the Memory details and all that so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So basically, now I need a solution for my BLACK SCREEN/THIS SECOND DISPLAY. Whenever I boot, it's a pain switching to display one everytime and my friend is WEAK in computers so he will definitely not be able to do this, so how can I somehow delete/disable
 this Second Display? OR make my Display 1 appear everytime at boot rather than windows trying to get display from the Display 2?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's complicated-ish so, sorry for that, and there is no option for making Display 1 my main display, there is this option for display 2 however but it's grayed out and also I dont need it for that display. So what can I do with this second "invisible" display?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, again, my apologies for making this terribly long.</p>

 somehow but cannot find how to do it.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Home Edition 64-bit doesn&#39;t play sound when playing game.</h2>
                    I just got an Asus A43SA and having a problem when installing a games. On my windows, if i play something with music player, for example winamp, there's sound coming out both from the speaker and the headphone, no problem at all. The problem is there's
 no sound when I'm playing NBA 2K12, Skyrim, and Super Street Fighter. I'm suspecting this come from the directx, can anyone guide me how to solve this?

<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> Each game\program has a unique setting to turn on and turn off the
 sound. Refer to the product documentation (manual) for certain keys or game settings to "toggle" the sound on or off.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><b><span>Method 2:
</span></b></span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Try to run the built-in troubleshooter and check if it helps.
</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Open the Playing Audio troubleshooter:

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<b><span>Method 3: </span>
</b><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>First of all, update your sound card drivers. If doing that doesn’t clear up the problem, make sure you have volume set to max for NBA&nbsp;<b>2K12</b>&nbsp;in
 the volume mixer (click on the little speaker icon in the bottom-right of your screen in the system tray). If you’re in-game, just alt+tab out of the game and check if NBA<b>2K12</b>&nbsp;is set to max in the volume mixer.</span></p>
<p><b><span>For your reference:&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>No sound in Windows</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 explorer.exe won&#39;t run from desktop. Admin issues I - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> barocky14  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 explorer.exe won&#39;t run from desktop.  Admin issues I presume.</h2>
                    <p>Background:</p>
<p>I recently upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7.&nbsp; It was not without issues (partition size).&nbsp; After installation I got the black screen with cursor only.&nbsp; No activity. CTRL-ALT-Del and reboot.&nbsp; Everything came up.</p>
<p>I have two accounts both with Admin privileges. One Admin and one personal.&nbsp; I logged into the personal.&nbsp; So far so good.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Explorer.exe Problem: With my personal account I cannot launch Windows Explorer.&nbsp; The screen goes black and returns.&nbsp; This happens no matter where I launch it.&nbsp; I searched for cmd.exe and ran as administrator. Up it comes.&nbsp; I right click on any folder or
 drive and down it goes.&nbsp; Double click inside Explorer no problem.</p>
<p>Now when I log in with my Admin account,&nbsp; Windows Explorer launches and runs properly.&nbsp; Both accounts have Admin privileges.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start Menu Problem:&nbsp; When I log into my Admin account the new Window Start icon does nothing.&nbsp; I cannot search in the search box either.&nbsp; It does not recognize my input.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched for a solution online but did not find my particular problem.</p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting you query in Microsoft Community. Your interest on Windows 10 is appreciated.<br />
I can understand the inconvenience that you are facing with the issue. We are glad to help you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the following steps and check:</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;Open an Administrator CMD window.&nbsp; If you can’t find a way, use these steps:<br />
a)&nbsp;Press CTRL+Shift+ESC to open Task Manager. <br />
b)&nbsp;Click File &gt; Run New Task <br />
c) Make sure you have a check mark beside “Create this task with administrative privileges”
<br />
d)&nbsp;Type CMD.</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;Type the following commands at the CMD prompt: <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sfc /scannnow </span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;If the above commands both completed and show no remaining issues, run these commands:
<br />
powershell<br />
Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers |Where-Object {$_.InstallLocation -like "*SystemApps*"} | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}

            <p>I did as you suggested. Step 2 had no errors.</p>
<p>Step 3 had problems with Cortana running. All others seems to go through. Tried to end task but it restarts. &nbsp;Here is the error message.</p>

<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>Net result is that I still have the same problem. &nbsp;The behavior between the two accounts is very odd. &nbsp;In the Admin account I cannot get Chrome to going. &nbsp;It loads but will search indefinitely for a url. &nbsp;In my personal account it runs fine even with add-ins.
 &nbsp;On my personal account I still cannot get explorer.exe running expect from the search window, running cmd.exe as administrator. &nbsp;Once up I still cannot right click anything without it crashing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Could it be a corrupted profile? &nbsp;Why do I need to run explorer with admin privileges when the account is an administrator? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the Event log after Explorer crashes</p>

            <p>Seems like I'm talking to myself here. &nbsp;Anyway I have an update. &nbsp;It appears to be profile related. &nbsp;When I first did the upgrade it took forever. &nbsp;I ended up with a black screen and a mouse. &nbsp;I was able to ctrl-alt-del &nbsp;reboot and log in but nothing was
 right after. &nbsp;My only account that was mostly right was Admin. &nbsp;Explorer never ran. &nbsp;Decided to try playing with my profile since it was the only think different with my problems and its behavior.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to create another new profile with Admin privledges. &nbsp;I used my personal account and created another personal account with admin privledges. &nbsp;Got the same black screen after what seemed like an hour. &nbsp;Account had the same problems. &nbsp;Then I decided
 to create another personal account with admin priv but this time I did it from my Admin account. &nbsp;Looks like everything is working but a lot of programs that were in my start menu are nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps someone, but not of lot of help from Microsoft staff.</p>

<h2>            Toshiba Satellite plugged in but not charging &#40;at 11&#37; all the time&#41;</h2>
                    I have tried uninstalling the two battery thingys that reinstall when you switch the computer back on and nothing changed.&nbsp; I can't take the battery out and put it back in to reset it.&nbsp; Could it be the actual charger plug or could it be that the battery
 is past it's use-by???&nbsp; I can still use my laptop but only when it's plugged in somewhere.....very frustrating!!&nbsp; Any suggestion would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thank you. Nikki:)&nbsp; PS.. The problem&nbsp; seemed to start after I upgraded my Windows 10

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<span>Make a Restore Point - Start - type in --&gt; Restore ...... find at top and click on - Create
</span><br />
<br />
<span>Right Click Start Button - Device Manager - Batteries - double click each in turn - Drivers tab - Update driver - OK - after doing both go back to same spot and Uninstall - OK &lt;-- that will refresh the driver stack.
</span><br />
<br />
<span>----- </span><br />
<br />
<span>Turn off the computer and remove A/C power then remove the battery - if possible clean the battery terminals with a pencil eraser (some can't be cleaned).
</span><br />
<br />
<span>----- </span><br />
<br />
Check with the system maker's support, their online documentation, and ask in their forums about any known issues. Many have software that will control the battery charge which&nbsp;is designed to extend the battery life. Right Click the battery icon near the clock
 and see if there are any selections there to set - of course, the software controls could be anywhere on the system - such as App/Start menu, Control Panel, Device Manager, or other locations.<br />
<br />
=======================================================<br />
<br />
The battery could be worn - <span><span>Use this method to check the battery and create a report :</span></span>
<p>
</p><p><span>WinKEY&nbsp;+X -&nbsp;or Right Click in the lower left corner - Command Prompt (Admin)&nbsp; OR Windows PowerShell</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Copy/paste or type&nbsp;:<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-weight: bold"><span><br />
</span></span></strong><span>powercfg -energy -output %userprofile%\desktop\energy-report.html</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>hit&nbsp;Enter</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>That&nbsp;creates&nbsp;"energy-report.html" and&nbsp;puts&nbsp;it on the Desktop.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>double click the file on your desktop </p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Scroll down&nbsp;to Battery Information :</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Design Capacity</span></p>
<p><span>Last Full Charge<br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Copy&nbsp;and paste those into a reply here so we can interpret them for you.<br />
<br />
--------------<br />
<br />
Also in a Command Prompt (Admin)&nbsp; OR&nbsp; Windows PowerShell - navigate to a folder where you have Write rights such as &nbsp;&nbsp; \YourUserName\Documents<br />
</p>
<p><br />
Type or Copy and Paste each of these and press enter after&nbsp;each&nbsp;: (if C: is where your Documents folder is)<br />
<br />
C:</p>
<p><br />
CD\<br />
<br />
CD&nbsp;%userprofile%\Documents<br />
<br />
powercfg /BATTERYREPORT<br />
<br />
That puts Battery-Report.html in your Documents folder.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

            Hi to all the replies to my 'plugged in, not charging' problem.&nbsp; After trying all of the suggestions to no avail, I resorted to closing the laptop, turning it upside down on the table and proceeded to disassemble it...screw by screw to remove the back
 to try to find out where the battery was.&nbsp; As it happened, it was a long thing in between the hinges....not being a 'computer geek' by any stretch of the imagination, I felt VERY clever having found it.&nbsp; I removed it, then put it back in, put all the screws
 back in ( I didn't need to remove them to begin with Ha Ha) Powered it up again and BINGO! plugged in and charging!!!!!! Wooohooo!!!&nbsp; Thanks to everyone:)

            <p>Hello Vrajjshah,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description it seems that you are unable to use your mouse after upgrading to Windows 7. So there might be a chance that the drivers of devices are not updated so you might be facing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try the below mentioned methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Follow the troubleshooting steps from the Kb article and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Troubleshoot response failures in wireless keyboard or mouse</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/838398" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/838398</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If issue still persists you need to update the drivers and for that you may try the steps provided in the following article and see if it works for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows comes with drivers for many devices, such as printers, displays, keyboards, and TVs. A driver is software that a device uses to work with your PC. Every device needs a driver to work with your PC. So, in many cases, you can plug in a device, and
 it’ll work automatically. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download and install drivers</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If still issue persists you may try to update the drivers from the manufacturer's website and the link you may refer is provided below.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this would help. <span>If issue still persists post </span>back with current status of your computer and result of the proposed suggestion, we will be happy to assist you.</span></p>

<p><span>Hello Mr. Vista,</span></p>

<p><strong><span><span>Update drivers for your Sound card:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest that you update the drivers for your sound card.<span>Check the Device Manager if there are any yellow bangs or

<p>Hi Clarice, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Running the Surface Diagnostic toolkit may help resolve the issue. This will run a series of tests on your device and automatically install any missing driver and firmware updates<span>.
</span><span><span>Click&nbsp;<span><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong></span> to learn how to run the toolkit.</span></span>
<span><span>After running the toolkit, <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4036280/surface-force-a-shut-down-and-restart-your-surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">force shutdown and restart your device</a></strong> to ensure all updates
 are applied. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If running the toolkit did not help, </span></span><span><span>start your Surface in
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">safe mode</a></strong> and check if the issue occurs. If the issue doesn't occur in safe mode, perform a

</span></span><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This will help you determine if the issue is software related.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, check if the issue occurs while the power supply unit is plugged in. </p>

<h2>            Stutters while right clicking or opening programs&#47;folders</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>just got a brand new laptop with an i7 processor and a GTX 1060 graphics card. From the moment I turned it on, it prompted me to update windows which I did. After the update I started noticing micro stutters while right clicking anywhere on the desktop or
 even while opening Chrome or Control Panel or whatever. The screen just froze for one second while the program was loading or the folder was being opened. I don't know what causes this issue. I searched around the forums and people keep referencing this "Fall
 Update". Unfortunately I deleted the windows.old folder and cannot revert to a previous build. The issue isn't RAM related since the machine has 16GB of it. I believe it's not a problem of the integrated graphics card the laptop was shipped with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea for a possible fix? A user in the forums noticed that while having "Geforce Experience" open, the stutters don't happen at all and I find that is the case with my machine as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

            Hi Stathis.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Having GeForce Experience open resolving the problem indicates it is with the Display adapter.  Make sure you have the latest version installed from the PC's Support Downloads webpage.  If so, uninstall the Display driver in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu, restart PC to have it reinstall.
<br />
<br />Make sure the GeForce Experience is set to start with PC in Task Manager &gt; Startup list, and in System Configuration &gt; Services list (after Hiding all MS Services).  Normally clearing bloatware out of these lists helps performance but you should set GeForce to start if it is resolving the problem. 
<br />
<br />Go to the PC's Support Downloads web page to make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display, Sound, Network, USB3 and all other drivers.  Compare to the installed versions in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>So I have some updates for you! Thanks for the replies!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I actually had some firmware updates to download. I downloaded them through the manufacturers website. I hoped that would fix the problem but unfortunately it did not. Then I had the idea to start windows on safe mode (with networking). And lo and behold
 the pc runs smoothly all of a sudden. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What does that mean exactly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently speaking with a friend of mine through discord and noticed that when I right click on the desktop his voice cuts out. I tried it many times and I am 100% sure that it is caused from the right click and it is not a random internet voice cut
 out. Hope that helps!</p>

<p>Tried disabling the iGPU (Intel HD Graphics 630) to see if it causes the problem and it actually did. Problem is, that this is not a solution. Using the other GPU consumes alot more unnecessary power and the laptop doesn't last at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it has something to do with the integrated graphics card from Intel. Don't know if it conflicts with something that changed during the update because of Intel or because of Microsoft but this is clearly a software problem that I shouldn't expect to find
 in a brand new device ...</p>

<p>I have the exact same problem as you described with my Inspiron 7577. Disabling my HD Graphics 630 does seem to fix it but I get an error when launching NVIDIA settings or Geforce Experience, and games will not run at all, basically freezing on the title
 screen. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the latest NVIDIA drivers, and updated my Intel HD 630 in Device Manager. I also have the latest Windows 10 Updates, and ran the recommended updates (including new BIOS) on the Dell support website.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My last ditch effort will be to reinstall Windows, but I was hoping I could fix it otherwise.</p>

<p><span>Hello,</span><br />
<br />
<span>All you can do in regards to this is file a complaint against people that are harassing you, block communications against them, and then change your privacy settings. There's really nothing else that Microsoft can to in terms of providing advice on this
 situation. They seem to have advised you on all of the areas that are built into Xbox LIVE to protect users against this sort of activity.</span><br />
<br />
<span>If you wish to change your gamertag, you could do that but it won't be for free, you'll need to pay 800 Microsoft Points or $10 to do so.</span><br />
<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
I would like to gather some information in context of this issue:<br />
1) How did you install Windows 8 on the computer? Is it a clean or an upgrade installation?<br />
2) Did you run upgrade assistant while installing Windows 8?<br />
3) Have you installed any software recently after installing Windows 8 on the computer?
</p><div><br />
This error usually occurs due to any other application or software installed on the computer. You may also get the issue due to missing or corrupt system files.</div>
<div><br />
Let’s check if you get the error when you boot the computer in safe mode.</div>
<div><br />
Follow the methods:</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
You can follow the steps:<br />
<strong>Step 1</strong>:<br />
Refer to the link to boot the computer into safe mode and check for the error message:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode</span></a>
<br />
If the issue does not occur in safe mode you may move to step 2:</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Step 2:<br />
</strong>You can refer to the link to place the computer in clean boot state and check if any other application or software is causing this issue:<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate
 software conflicts.<br />
“<strong>How to perform a clean boot to troubleshoot a problem in Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8”<br />
Follow the section “Windows 8</strong>”<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a>
<br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Please go through the section: How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>Let’s check if this issue is due to missing or corrupt system file by running SFC scan on the computer.</div>
<div><br />
Follow the steps:<br />
a. Press “<strong>Windows Key + Q</strong>” to open Charms Bar.<br />
b. Type “<strong>cmd</strong>” without quotes in the search box.<br />
c. On the left pane, right click on the “<strong>Command Prompt</strong>” and select “<strong>Run as Administrator</strong>”.<br />
d. Type <strong>‘sfc /scannow’ </strong>without quotes and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 3:</strong></div>
<div>Let’s find out if there could be any issues related to the memory that is causing this issue.</div>
<div><br />
I would suggest you to perform Memory diagnostics and check if that shows any error in context of this issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may follow the steps:<br />
a) Type '<strong>diagnostics</strong>' on the start screen.<br />
b) Click on ‘<strong>Windows memory diagnostics’</strong>.<br />
c) Click on ‘<strong>restart now and check for problems’</strong>.</div>
<div>Check if you get any error message after restarting.</div>
<div><br />
Do let us know about the status of this issue.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are saying that everything is normal in safe mode and clean boot then there is any third party application conflicting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to go to Programs and Features and check if you have application that you didn't install or you don't use please uninstall that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Steps:</p>
<p>1. Press <strong><em>Windows key + R</em></strong></p>
<p>2. Run box will pop-up and type "<em><strong>appwiz.cpl</strong></em>".</p>
<p>3. It will directly take you to <strong><em>programs and features </em></strong>tab.
</p>
<p>4. Look for the Applications and uninstall all that you think you don't use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And Restart and check if you still get the same issue, If yes then place your PC in partial clean boot state and then try to find which application is conflicting.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Sculpt Mouse disconnecting with Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Sculpt Mouse disconnecting with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am using a MS sculpt mouse and since upgrading to Windows 10 from Windows 8, the mouse keeps freezing after a short period of inactivity. I have to then go into the Bluetooth settings, remove and re-install the device before it begins to work again.
 This is very frustrating. I had absolutely no problems on the previous version of Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would greatly appreciate any support and advice.&nbsp;<br />

            <p>I had the same problem with Microsoft Bluetooth mouse 5000... so I go a Sculpt Comfort thinking it would work better (since it is officially supported under Windows 10)... and it did not (it did exactly what you describe)...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I spent hours trying various things and&nbsp;finally came to the conclusion that the Sculpt Comfort, like the 5000,&nbsp;only works properly under Windows 10 if using the "Generic Bluetooth adapter" provided by Microsoft. It also seems to prefer if the power management
 is disabled.<br />
<br />
So try the following:<br />
1. Open Device Manager<br />
2. Locate Bluetooth<br />
3. If you see a specific adapter such as "Intel Centrino Wireless Bluetooth 3.0 + High Speed Adapter" open its Properties, then Update Driver, Browse my computer for driver software, Let me pick from a list, and pick "Generic Bluetooth Adapter".<br />
4. Select OK whenever needed<br />
<br />
If you still encounter issue go back to the Properties of the generic adapter and disable "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" in the Power Management tab<br />
Also still in the Device Manager, go to Human Interface Devices, open the properties of the Microsoft Hardware Bluetooth Device, and disable "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" in the Power Management</p>

            <p>I just purchased an HP computer with same bluetooth mouse issues. &nbsp;The bluetooth adapter in the computer is connected to the computer via USB port. &nbsp;I had to click off the "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" for the bluetooth adapter
 and its associated USB port which I could not determined so just click them off for all the USB ports.</p>

    <title>What happened to the &#39;Up one folder&#39; button in the Windows - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            What happened to the &#39;Up one folder&#39; button in the Windows Explorer&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    Starting with Windows Vista, the 'up one folder level' button has been removed!! &nbsp;I found this button to be HIGHLY useful and am VERY disappointed it is not there any more... This has drastically slowed down my production speeds!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In the following image from Windows XP Explorer, near the top right between the 'Back/Forward' buttons and the 'Search' button, you see a folder with a green arrow pointing up. &nbsp;Clicking that button makes the Windows Explorer go "up one folder level" bringing
 you to the parent folder of your current location:</div>
<div><a href="http://www.daleisphere.com/wp-content/uploads/windows-xp-windows-explorer-folders-view.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.daleisphere.com/wp-content/uploads/windows-xp-windows-explorer-folders-view.jpg</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In the next image from Windows 7 Explorer, you can see that the 'up one folder level' button has been removed:</div>
<div><a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/images/win7/win7_m3_explorer_01.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.winsupersite.com/images/win7/win7_m3_explorer_01.jpg</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is there any way at all to get that button back PLEASE? &nbsp;This will drastically improve my production speeds...&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>(Whenever I click a 'browse for file' button in Windows 7, the explorer starts at the last folder I was looking at and I often just want to go one or 2 folder levels higher than that, but the only way to get there is to start completely at the beginning
 from the C: drive and navigate through all the folders to get there which can get VERY time consuming since I find myself browsing for folders 50 times/day simply cuz the 'up one folder' button is missing...)</div>
