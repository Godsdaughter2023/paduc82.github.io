    <title>Cannot connect with Forza Motorsport . net or Servers - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot connect with Forza Motorsport . net or Servers</h2>
                    
<p>It just will not connect and after spending around&nbsp;eight hours over the past two days reviewing network settings, replacing router, bridging modem, port forwarding and speaking with two different techs from my ISP, I still cannot connect.</p>
<p>I've even checked with friends who do seem to be able to reach the servers for multiplayer but did not find out if they could get to the .net site.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>
<p>I'm about ready to make a video of the xbox one going to the rifle range to be put out of my misery.</p>

<p>I'm a little unsure if your problem is connecting to the forzamotorsport.net website, connecting to online FM5 server, or both.</p>
<p>I'm sure you've been through this with support but, </p>
<p>1. Can you get to other websites (i.e. msn.com, yahoo.com)?</p>
<p>2. Have you done a hard restart of your Xbox One?</p>
<p>3. Can you play other games on your Xbox One online?</p>

<p>I get no error messages.</p>
<p>NAT shows open and all shows good to go under Network settings.</p>
<p>It is something on my network I'm thinking but what, is the mystery.</p>
<p>I did use my cell to look at Forza Motorsports .net but could only see the news page.</p>
<p>No access to the forums there either even after it prompted me and I signed in.</p>
<p>I'm beginning to believe I got a ban somehow but, got no notice of such and have not done any ban-able offense...</p>

<p>Apparently it was an issue with the new router I was trying to use even though it is the same brand only a little faster.</p>
<p>The Medialink 300n wireless router would not work but the Medialink 150n does.</p>
<p>The strange part is that the new one would block me from the Forza servers and the .net site.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I could surf the inerwebs and play WoT on my PC just fine.</p>

<p>Olá, quando vc clica em baixar qualquer coisa no marketplace pelo PC, vc terá que estar logado à uma conta da Live e o download iniciará automaticamente quando vc entrar com essa conta no console (e ele estiver conectado à net). Portanto, pelo marketplace
 não dá pra fazer o que vc quer.</p>

<h2>            Windows Movie Maker Corrupt - WILL NOT OPEN&#33;</h2>
                    I have spent hours editing a video in Movie Maker. I have Windows 8.1 and and using the 2012 version of Movie Maker. The video was working well and saving fine too, then I go to open it and it says that it cannot open as it may be corrupt. I really don't
 want to restart the whole video. I have also followed the steps on here on how to fix a corrupt file but when I entered my problem to the support team, it would not send through. Please help :)

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your quick response. Regarding your questions, my laptop is an Acer Aspire V5. And when I try to open the project that I have been working on, the error message is as follows: "Sorry, Movie Maker can't open this project file. The file might be
 incompatible with Movie Maker or corrupted. Please select a different project file." I have been facing this issue and trying to resolve it for 2 days. Furthermore, I have successfully repaired all Windows Essentials programs as suggested in your reply and
 unfortunately this hasn't made a difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your help.</p>

<li>You followed the steps listed in <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-ZA/windows-live/movie-maker-fix-project-file" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How do I fix a corrupt Movie Maker project file?</a> and created a public link to your uploaded project file on OneDrive.</li><li>You clicked the last link to <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-za/windows-live/movie-maker-support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

all the information for the form</a> and tried to click <em>Submit</em>.</li></ol>
<p>So did it fail to submit at the last step? If so, hopefully the representative from Microsoft (Sudheendra S) can escalate the issue and find out why you are unable to submit your corrupted file for repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a common problem that seems to be happening where the durations of the clips get incorrectly written with an endTime of 0 which results in a negative duration. Hopefully someone from Microsoft will get back to you shortly with the reason you aren't
 able to submit or ask you to try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry you have encountered this known issue that Microsoft has yet to investigate/fix but hopefully they will at least correct your corrupted file as they have promised to do in the past.</p>

</p><p>However, after redoing this again today, despite being sent to this page again, I have received an automated email to say that I should get a response &nbsp;within 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for all of your help, I really hope that Microsoft will fix my file as they have previously promised :)</p>

    <title>Multiple blue screen crashes on new PC. KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED, - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Multiple blue screen crashes on new PC. KMODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED, IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL, DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL. Reinstalling Win 10 also crashes at configuration restart.</h2>
                    <p>Hi folks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My son has a brand new PC. ASUS motherbord Z170 Pro Gaming, Kingston RAM (2 x 8 GB), SSD 250 GB harddrive, Nvidia video card with 4GB on-board memory. The only thing carried over from the old PC is the old spinning harddrive as a number 2 harddisk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC is just 4 days old. It was working perfectly: No errors, no hick-ups, no lacking and booted with express speed thanks to the SSD. There was a big smile from ear to ear on my sons face.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He played Mass Effect on the PC for 3 days (not 24 hours a day though) but on the 4th day it crashed in a big way with an error message that I never saw before. Any attempt to just restart the PC immidiately gave a multitude of different blue screen crashes
 either in the middle of a boot or a few seconds after login into Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was not possible to have the OS run long enough to even try launching a memory check or anything else before it just crashed again. Of course we started to look through blogs and debates on the net and most of them talks about driver problems where a
 driver tries to write into an address in the memory where it is not allowed to. However, we have not installed any new stuff or updated anything. It is a brand new PC. You could say yes we installed and updated everything on it given the fact that it is brand
 new.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How is it possible to run it for 3 days with no problem and then from out of nowhere it just decides to keep on crashing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We eventually decided to reinstall Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First we tried to boot from the install media and choose to repair -&gt; crashes with blue screen and restarts endlessly</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then we removed the NVidia card (a huge "brick" I might add) from the motherboard and just run on the build in video card on the motherboard and tried repair again -&gt; crashes with blue screen</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then we removed one of memory block from from the RAM-sockets and tried again to boot and/or repair -&gt; crashes with blue screen</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then we swapped the one memory block in the machine with the one memory block we removed before and tried again -&gt; crashes with blue screen</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then we disconnected the old secondary harddisk. That did not help either -&gt; crashes with blue screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then we swapped cable connection to the SSD to try another SATA3 port -&gt; still crashes with blue screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then we took out the wi-fi net card and booted again -&gt; crases with blue screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I disabled the on-board sound card in the BIOS and tried again -&gt; still crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point we were getting desperate. We put the video card back into the machine and the wi-fi net card also because it obviously maked no difference. We started completely from scratch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We booted the machine from install media and started the installation from scratch. We deleted every partition on the SSD harddisk and created new ones and continued the installation. It fetches allt he files and the installation seems to run fine. When
 the files are transferred the installation will say that it needs to restart to configure Windows. It counts down from 10 itself and restarts. It all looks fine that far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At restart it says it will start to configure the OS but it seldom reaches even half a minute into the configuration before it crashes with an info-box-warning that says the installation could not continue. It does not say why not. There is just an OK-button
 and all we can do is hit ENTER to press that button. Then it restarts and we are back to the now wellknown dead-end circle of reboot and crashes with blue screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So actually we are at a point were we cannot even install a Windows 10 from scratch. If this is a driver problem then were exactly is there a driver that can cause this issue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried to disconnect the SSD and just connect the old spinning harddisk as primary harddisk and tried to install Windows 10 on that instead but it gives the same result.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do?</p>

            <p>Hi Syed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already have a Windows 10 installation ready on an USB-drive. I have used it several times in order to try and fix my issue. Whatever repair option I try to use whether that is advanced, clean up, or others they have not worked. As I wrote I even started
 completely from scratch and "nuked" the harddrive during a fresh installation by deleting all partitions and created new partitions and formatted the primary partition.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like it will install just fine but when it restarts to go into automatic configuration of Windows 10 it barely go beyond the Windows load-ball. It might reach 10 or 20% of the configuration and then crash again. So now I do not even have a functional
 Windows 10 because it crashes midways during installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could of course try and use the install-USB again and boot on that but I expect it to give the same result as the 15 og 20 other times that I tried it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think something is wrong with the motherboard. I will try and update the firmware on it from ASUS.</p>

</p><p>Hi again folks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I tried to update the BIOS with the lastest version of the firmware for Z170-P that I could find on ASUS' homepage. It still does not solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I moved the grafics card (NVidia) to another PCI-E slot just to try that too. It did not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we take the SSD-disk and put it into the old PC then the old PC runs just fine with no blue screen crashes. The new one just will not. We are lucky if we can keep it running for 3 minutes after windows login.</p>

</p><p>DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION</p>
<p>SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED</p>
<p>MEMORY_MANAGEMENT</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of them blue screen errors. It is now almost impossible to start Windows 10. I managed just once to make it run long enough to restart it in safe mode. In safe mode it will run without crashing. However, I do not know what to look for to find what is
 causing the crashes when it is not running in safe mode.</p>

            <p>Hi Syed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the motherboard has been changed to a new one and had a professional hardware shop mount the CPU on to the motherboard but still the error is there. It is driving me crazy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible that there is an error on the ISO-file?</p>

            <p>Hey folks, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I seem to have a quite similar problem. </p>
<p>The installation of Windows 10 took me a while, as my system (a completely new built PC, except the RAM, DVD player, case and power supply which ran smooth as *** for many years now) crahsed with bluescreens very often.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the installation process, I was able to update the BIOS and install Chipset and graphics drivers - which took me again quite a while, as the computer won't run more than a few minutes until it either just freezes, or frows me one of the following (but
 not exclusive, I might have missed one) bluescreens:</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<div style="margin-left: 0">
<div style="margin-left: 0">
<p><span>Memory Management</span></p>
<p><span>Driver IRQL not less or equal</span></p>
<p><span>Page Fault in unpaged area</span></p>
<p><span>Dpc watchdog violation</span></p>
<p><span>Kmode exception not handled</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>After a bluescreen, it does not restart by itself, so usually I hit the power-button after a few minutes.
</span></p>
<p><span>I guess it is a driver problem, as all the hardware seem to be fine, but I can not find it. At the moment, the pc freezes after around one minute
 of running. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Can anyone help please? </span>
</p>
<p><span>Kind regards, </span></p>
<p><span>Benjamin</span></p>

            <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>seems like an old Post, but i just had the same, but i found a solution for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the Asus Z170 - Pro Gaming mainboard with 2x8GB ram ( kingston ) and an nvidia 960.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i had this mouselag( other problem ) and i thought, well let's try to install the Official Asus Chipset drivers.</p>
<p>After that the same bluescreens and stuff appeared as you mentioned before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled the chipset driver, like it was before(i am running this system for about 2-3 months now) and now the bluescreens are gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So MAYBE, try to uninstall the official Asus Chipset drivers! ( i don't have any compatibility problems, only my logitech software won't work)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings from Germany,</p>

            <p>Hi, I seem to be having the exact same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am 15 years old, and built my custom PC with my neighbor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Parts:</p>
<p>CPU: Intel i5 6600k</p>
<p>Motherboard: Asus Z170-A</p>
<p>RAM: 2x8GB DDR RAM from Corsair</p>
<p>GPU: ASUS GTX 770</p>
<p>SSD: Samsung 850 Evo 250GB</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed a fresh copy of windows 10, and the PC was running perfectly fine, for about 3 days. I had just about finished installing all my applications and drives, when my PC just crashed, and rebooted into a blue screen with an error message, and rebooted
 on it's own, onto another blue screen with a different error message. After this was repeated a few times, the PC went into the windows 10 recovery option, and I was able to select a complete system reset. It deleted all my files and apps, but it fixed the
 problem with the blue screen... at least for a day. Net day, I leave the computer on while I had dinner, and guess what, when I come back, the computer was in the continues reboot loop. Sometimes it made it to the log in screen for windows 10, but it crashed
 too soon before I could interact with the operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next weekend, I asked my neighbor to come over to help me fix the issue we wiped the SSD and tried to install a new copy of windows 10 via USB and CD... Blue screen</p>
<p>Reset the motherboard... No luck</p>
<p>Installed all the different BIOS of the Motherboard... Nope</p>
<p>Tried installing Linux... Error</p>
<p>Took the graphics card out... Din't work :(</p>
<p>Took the PC to a tech specialist... Could't fix it</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, we were sure that it was a problem with the motherboard, so we decided send it back , in exchange for a new one.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Motherboard arrived today, and I basically rebuilt the PC with the new motherboard and tried booting into the bootable windows 10 USB Drive... Then the same blue screen with the error message came up :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am so upset :(</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess only thing that could possibly be causing all of this is the CPU, so... I will try and return it and just pray it works.&nbsp;<br />

            I am using Windows 10 and Firefox browser.&nbsp; and it jumped from smaller size print to way larger size print just now.&nbsp; So it's not only on Facebook.&nbsp; It is getting more frequent and it even did it while using H&amp;R Block Tax software.<br />

            <p>No it was not helpful. &nbsp;Since switching to Windows 10 the font size in FB and some other forums jumps around plus or minus, randomly. &nbsp;A little icon circle with a plus sign magically appears in the URL window on the right end. &nbsp;I switched from Chrome to
 Firefox but the problem persists. &nbsp;I have the same computer upgrading from W7 to W10 so its not my HP and since its both browsers the problem is obviously in Windows 10! &nbsp;It's been more than 30 days so I can't go back to W7 otherwise I would - Windows 10 is
 a mess, the tiles are annoying and endlessly useless, the "search" thing (Cortona) launches a Bing search and who needs that?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just don't understand every time you release a window upgrade the computer basics like searching, launching, printing, setting preferences suffers. &nbsp;I understand your need to simplify your operating software across all platforms (computers, laptops, tablets
 and cell phones) but honestly, why would I want this mess on my cell phone?</p>
<p>

            I agree, I would go back to Windows 7 in a minute.&nbsp; Yes, I didn't have to pay for this upgrade, but it is only a matter of time and why would I want to pay for it knowing the problems.&nbsp; Maybe Microsoft should realize there is not a catch all version for
 every device.&nbsp;&nbsp; But since they know about this now, why don't the brainiacs do something to fix it?

            <p>What? &nbsp;Thanks, I'll wait for someone to tell me they did all of that and it fixed the font size problem!! &nbsp;Hey, community: &nbsp;did anyone get a resolution? &nbsp;Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to add here: &nbsp;I'm not going through all of these steps on a pure speculative guess that it "might" help. &nbsp;Come on, seriously? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mr Santosh Kumar Rai: &nbsp;you need to Google "The Bed Bug Letter" because that specifically applies here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe I'm out of my element but what I expect from Microsoft in a specific case like this is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Dear valued customer: yes, we've gotten a number of complaints of the font size jumping around while typing in certain applications like Facebook. &nbsp;And you are right, there is a little plus sign icon inside a a search magnifying glass icon that will appears
 on the right side of the URL window when this happens. &nbsp;We (or the community) has found that the problem is caused by " &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; enter your expert answer here &nbsp; &nbsp;" &nbsp;and the solution most often is " &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;enter your expert answer here &nbsp;".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Otherwise just admit it that you either don't understand the problem or have no **** idea on how to fix it. &nbsp;THAT's how you handle a customer complaint! &nbsp; Geez</p>

    <title>How do I run hardware monitors at startup with a Standard - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I run hardware monitors at startup with a Standard account&#63;__</h2>
                    
<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>I have used "Run as administrator" to install two programs that monitor hardware temperatures and fans, but I have been unsuccessful at getting them to automatically start with each logon.&nbsp; The main program is EVGA Precision which I need to control the fan
 speed on a "green" 9800 GT.&nbsp; Choosing "Start with Windows" within the program works when I am logged on with my Administrator account, but not with my Standard account.&nbsp; I have tried both adding a shortcut for the program to the hidden Startup folder, and
 using the Compatibility tab for the executable to change the "Run this program as an administrator" setting via "Change settings for all users."&nbsp; The program won't autostart under&nbsp;either of these scenarios, and I am only able to start it by choosing it from
 the Start menu and then providing adminstrator credentials.&nbsp; (I also reinstalled within the Standard account, but that did not fix the problem.)</p>
<p>I use&nbsp;a Standard account for Internet access (including Internet gaming, thus the critical need for fan ramp up) and it is a bit of a hassel to have to manually start&nbsp;the Precision program&nbsp;with each logon.&nbsp; I have the same issue with HWMonitor from CPUID.&nbsp;
 I use Windows 7 Home Premium 64, and my only network is a wireless adapter that connects to a wireless firewall/router and then to a Cox Cable gateway.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for any suggestions.</p>
<p>Rob</p>

<p>Hi Jack,</p>
<p>Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; I tried your suggestion but it didn't work, unfortunately.&nbsp; The result was the same as dragging the shortcut to the Startup folder within the Users path.&nbsp; These two programs that collect readings from the motherboard are just not
 working with the Standard account following Administrator configuration.&nbsp; I am very surprised by this.&nbsp; Since there apparently is no Local Security Policy snap-in for the MMC in Home Premium it seems only a direct modification of the Registry will be a possible
 solution.&nbsp; I understand that Home Premium doesn't allow the computer to obtain a&nbsp;domain account,&nbsp;and for that reason it might make sense to not have&nbsp;the Local Security snap-in.&nbsp; However, I always thought an additional reason for that snap-in was to provide
 a safer (more straightforward) method&nbsp;for changing registry settings.&nbsp; I guess I'll just have to go with manual startup.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Rob</p>

            Any solutions found to this issue? I experience the same with CPUID HWMonitor, a great hardware monitor, in Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. Finally getting around to google for a solution, but that's not found in 1-2-3, it seems.<br />

Surface Mouse</a> and recently I am having issues with the scroll wheel function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every few clicks of the scroll wheel, the page that is scrolling will go in the opposite direction. This is very disruptive when trying to use it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know whether this is a hardware or software issue. I am using the mouse with a Surface Book 2 running Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a known problem? Is there anything I can do to fix it?</p>

<p>Hi Mike, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The issue can be hardware or software driven. Try you check if the issue occurs on specific applications and compare the scrolling behaviors in other programs.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try the mouse on other devices and check if the issue occurs. If the issue does not occur on other devices, try to uninstall and reinstall the mouse driver.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Let us now if you need further assistance. </p>

<p>Hi Shansu,</p>
<p>This sounds like Graphics Card driver issue.</p>
<p>I don’t see any drivers for Windows 7 for the laptop model number mentioned.</p>
<p>The latest operating system it supports is Vista. <br />
<br />
Follow either of these two Methods. Hopefully one of them should help in fixing the display issue.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Check out the vista driver for the corresponding graphics card, fiddle with its compatibility settings and see how it behaves with the new driver.</p>
<p>Get the driver from:<br />
<a href="http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/swu-list.pl?mdl=VGNT250P&amp;SelectOS=29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://esupport.sony.com/US/perl/swu-list.pl?mdl=VGNT250P&amp;SelectOS=29</strong></a></p>
<p>In case the driver don’t install normally, you might need to run it in compatibility mode.</p>
<p>Changing the compatibility settings can be done manually or automatically by running Program Compatibility Troubleshooter.</p>
<p>Refer:</p>
<p><strong>Make older programs run in this version of Windows<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</strong></a></p>
<p><strong>Method 2: <br />
<br />
</strong>Since your laptop has Intel® 855GME Chipset Integrated Graphics Card, please go to intel website and use the automated system to check for updated drivers if available.<br />
Here’s the link to intel website.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.intel.com/support/detect.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://www.intel.com/support/detect.htm</strong></a><br />
<br />
After downloading the driver, change the display resolution to what’s best for your monitor.</p>
<p>Hope this fixes the display issue.<br />

<h2>            Apple Magic Mouse not working with Windows 10 Bootcamp</h2>
                    <p>The Apple Magic mouse is paired via Bluetooth and shows the device connected, but does not work with Windows 10.&nbsp; Windows 10 is installed on my Macbook using Bootcamp.&nbsp; From Windows, the mouse cursor does not appear when the mouse is moved or click on.&nbsp;
 The mouse works completely fine on MacOS.&nbsp; I tried many proposed solutions online.&nbsp; Reinstalling Bootcamp drivers, installing updates via Apple Software Updates/Windows Updates, even reinstalling windows, and many more suggested solutions online.&nbsp; The MacBook
 Pro 2016 is running MacOS Mojave and uses the Apple File System.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After many hours of tinkering with my MacBook, the solution was found.&nbsp; The solution is very simple.&nbsp; Shutdown the computer, then power on the computer and load windows.&nbsp; The mouse works correctly.&nbsp; Restarting the computer from MacOS does something unknown,
 and the mouse will not function.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I've tried many different ways to fix my update problems and it hasn't helped.&nbsp;At this point, I'm thinking it will result in a clean wipe of the computer (which I have no idea how to really do). Anyways, my computer hasn't updated since before September.
 The list of errors is so damn long and my troubleshooting skills aren't good to be begin with. Any help to a lost Windows 10 user would be great.

<p>Since that error code means that the downloaded file is corrupted, I'd recommend that you take the following steps to delete all cached versions of the patch files.</p>

            <p>Ok, well I did the troubleshooter, again, said that it fixed my issues but the updates are still ending in Error. I tried to manually reset the Windows Update components. While entering some of the BITS and Windows Update files said there weren't pathways
 or binary codes? I'm not sure what that entails, but some of them ended in error, so that components may have been installed wrong on my part...<br />
<br />
I tried deleting the Software Distribution files as well&nbsp;and that didn't work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what else to do from here.</p>

            You have made a great point. May I request a small help from you? These forum posts are not read by Microsoft engineers. This feedback should go to Microsoft engineers for them to consider this. 
<br />
<br />I would recommend that you should send this feedback to Skype engineers - Open skype &gt; Click 3 dots on top &gt; Help &amp; feedback &gt; Give feedback 
<br />
<br />Feedback can also be given through Uservoice where you can find the feedback of others and status would be visible to you - <a href="https://skype.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skype.uservoice.com/</a>

            You should share your feedback and suggestions with the Skype engineers if you would like to see this further improved. The engineers are carefully listening to feedback, so, its worth giving it.
<br />
<br />Here are some further tips about sending in feedback:

<h2>            System being Attacked by an Intruder&#58; Need Help and Advice.</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">Hello Everyone!!!</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I´ve been sending out messages when possible that I´m being hacked and I´m losing my computer, but never received any real responses. I´ve been pretty much watching them, watch &nbsp;me, trying to decide how to eliminate them with out
 losing my system. I even had "Cox´s Technical Solutions" on it but they weren´t helping me.
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Since February of this year, I´ve concluded that my intruder has many names-identites and has been manipulating my system and making my friends think I´m a little, well alot, "Crazy!" I even questioned myself, but then remeber "I
 Actually watched them move around my computer while I was acrossed the room on "2" seperate occasions...</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Tonight I think I had a Major Breakthrough. I discovered that there are various ways Idenities are assumed...Well mine uses almost if not ALL of those ways...from tunneling to being a Inf. File in the Root system. He has mocked
 my account, duplicating it and also took administrative rights using a plural version
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">"Administrator</span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">s"</span></strong>
</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I'm so excited to learn that I've caught him!!! I had to rebuild my partition three times in the last 45 days. I have become obsessed with NOT ALLOWING him to take MY COMPUTER FROM ME!!!!</p>
<p class="contentStandard">So Now I need your help!!! I need to know... Is there anyone out there who has gone through this and gotten rid of the pest successfully w/o losing their system???</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I have factory reset 3x's I changed carries 2x's and I'm on my 3rd modem...He doesn't go away, I believe because he's always in the system and is triggered when i GET ON. I'm sure he's watching this...</p>
<p class="contentStandard">His command prompts are poor and only half of his program executions are completely successfull, but He's still pretty smart. I'm self taught, but this has increased my computer technical skills dramatically.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I've Become Driven!!!</p>
<p class="contentStandard">I don't want to delete anything that could destroy my system. I have deleted some things, fortunately I've been Lucky... I don't want my "Luck" to Run Out...</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Anyone with advise...It will be GREATLY WELCOMED AND APPRECIATED!!!</p>

<p>Dear Vicky;</p>
<p>THANK-YOU THANK-YOU, THANK-YOU</p>
<p>I have been fighting SAA-TT-AAAAANNNN!!!! , as I have come&nbsp;to call him; although Beelzebub, Lucifer and/or Lord of the Flies will &nbsp;certainly do, since July 10th, 2016 at 3:10 a.m. when I watched him gobble up McAfee and then proceed to winsys32 and everything
 &nbsp;else in its path. Try telling an idiot from *Bell Tech Experts* that even though they are in your computer&nbsp; and you try to tell them&nbsp;not to&nbsp;press run Spyware because its a trick and Spyware is not really Spyware, it is Satan hiding under the logo in order
 to get you to turn Java Script back on (or whatever else HE so desires) He is capable of hiding so completely as soon as someone comes on remotely to help, He even hid from Microsoft when I finally contacted them, although she did agree there were some anomalies
 she could not explain (such as 2,3,4 arrows going back and forth between file icons, most have tried to write it off as shadow copies !REALLY!) I have emptied it totally at least 10 -15 times, I have lost everything that I ever had on there a long time now.
 I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHO, WHAT, WHY, HOW!!! I am certainly impressed but honestly Guys can I just have my computer back now. It has cost me a fortune in internet, and like you, I am now,I believe, more knowledgeable than any of the Techies I have tried to speak
 to!! Knowledgeable, in that I know what is possible, I have been watching and playing and reading (library books to the ceiling) so I know what I have seen (I have for a long time had to take pictures of the screen ((printer long since taken over))&nbsp;because
 my hands cramp so bad from trying&nbsp;to write things down. I have note books and note books and papers enough to fill boxes. The last time, my sister thought, Im sure, that I was just an idiot and decides to send me a * techie home visit guy * and I told her
 that if the guy doesn't understand remote control, buried script layers, being blocked from your own internet while Satan uses it freely, Skype calls to all over the world such as Luxembourg which you are never charged for and wifi usage amounting to nothing
 even though you have files and files into the 10s of thousands passing through your computer every few seconds and massive storage somehow, somewhere that you never applied for and token systems and all kinds of things that are way beyond my comprehension&nbsp;(although
 I TRY,&nbsp;but WILL NEVER SURRENDER) He has even recorded me!! I yelled up to my roommate on day that I hated the song for the commercial that was playing on TV upstairs, and I mimicked the song which was in French, and later on that evening, I went back on the
 computer and was just looking at some&nbsp; files and such, nothing to do with media, and all of a sudden my computer starts playing the song to the commercial that I had complained about earlier AND IN FRENCH!! exactly as I had done! I never use French on the
 computer. (I had to walk away for awhile that time / had long since taped over the camera). ANYHOW, I love you for writing because the whole world thinks I spend my life in my basement SMOKING CRACK&nbsp; and making insane observations and complaints!!!! Sorr that
 this is not a solution for you or I , BUT, SISTERS IN ARMS!!!!!</p>
<p>Thank-you Please Reply I would love to hear from you because I could write a book on what I have seen and nobody has ever understood! Bye for now</p>
<p>Sincerely; Jules</p>

<p>OK this does sound like a real problem, this is what I would do in this situation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Change the user name and password on your Router</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>On the back of your WiFi router is an IP address, type this into your Web Browser to get into the router settings page</li><li>Also on the back of the router is the default user name and password, you will need these to get into the settings page, then change the user name and password - use a strong password which includes:</li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">Lowercase letters, capital letters, numbers and a punctuation symbol like an exclamation mark or question mark</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Go to another PC and change you password on your Email accounts<em> (Don't do this on your PC)</em></p>
<p>3. Go to another PC and change your password and user name on your Microsoft Account&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;(Don't do this on your PC)</em></p>
<p>4. Backup your data (files) to an external drive</p>
<p>5. Format and clean install your PC - <strong>(See Details below on how to do that)</strong></p>
<p>6. After you have clean installed Windows 10, go to Control Panel - System - on the left click 'Remote Settings'</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Turn off Remote Access completely</li></ul>
<p>

<li>Click 'Select Users' and if there are any users listed, remove them from the list</li></ul>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>How to Clean Install Windows 10:</strong></p>
<p><span>If you do not have Windows 10 Installation Media Click&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>HERE</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;to
 download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 4GB) using that tool or create the ISO file
 which you can later burn to DVD</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When this window appears, select bottom option (Custom: Install Windows Only)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/75df4dc8-8d98-4383-a042-709e51f8aaf0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/75df4dc8-8d98-4383-a042-709e51f8aaf0" /></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When this Window appears, select each partition, click disc options and delete all partitions, until one Unallocated Partition remains.
 Select that partition and install onto that . . .</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c02b6669-d209-41a0-839c-3a750a99a9e3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c02b6669-d209-41a0-839c-3a750a99a9e3" /></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>NOTE:</strong>
<em>during the installation process, your system will reboot, at that point, you may need to go into your BIOS and change the boot order so your system boots from your Hard Drive, otherwise the installation may start all over again - do not remove the installation
 media at this point</em></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC
<strong>during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key</strong> and select the option
<strong>'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC</strong>', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Server</span></p>

<p>Hi Vickey;</p>
<p>Its Jules again, your fellow tortured being. I wrote a long letter a few days ago but it was returned as unreachable or something like that, so of course I immediately wonder if its real or if its Satan. I am going to see what happens with this one. I KNOW
 HOW YOU FEEL, AND I KNOW KNOW KNOW that even what you have written is not even the tip of the iceberg. Camera, audio, phones, skype, c drive, active x&nbsp; aaaaaaghhhh theres too much and would take forever. I believe he is back in full force on me since I contacted
 you. I have been able to use my neighbours HP elitebook, which satan didnt seem to bother with too much, until now. And COINCIDENTALLY since I contacted you. I know all about the password changing (I came across a list of MY email addresses with the same password
 for each (which I NEVER CREATED) and each with a URL.) , I know about the Administrator with the S, I also have my computer and user names written exactly the same but changed into all capital letters, and as you said... on and on and on and on and on. I am
 sending you my phone number in case he tries to completely disconnect us (we both know HE can) I also have all the false logos and tricks to get me to press something for what he wants. There is a message on the Microsoft Community forum saying that all old
 discussions will be erased as of July 31st, dont know if its true yet or not. Anyhow hope I havent lost you and will wait to see if this goes through. I am going to set up a new email account somewhere safe (I know that he has even followed me on the computers
 at the library, try telling people that!!!). I will try to open it as ******* if it is available and if you dont hear from me you can try that from somewhere safe. my phone #*********</p>
<p>KEEP SANE</p>
<p>Sincerely; Jules</p>

    <title>Samsung galaxy tab pro s connection to HDMI TV no signal blue screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tribalrose389  say:</h3>
<h2>            Samsung galaxy tab pro s connection to HDMI TV no signal blue screen</h2>
                    <p>Hello there I have a Samsung galaxy tab pro s and a Comsol adapter with usb 3.c to usb 3, HDMI and another usb3.c port.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>my issue is I have been trying to connect my galaxy to a television screen and they are not working.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the past it used to work a dream, but now it comes up with no signal and a blue screen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using the latest version of Windows 10, tried trouble shooting and everything seems up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When trying to detect a second screen it says second screen inactive and Intel® HD Graphics 515.
<br />
I have updated drives, checked the adapter, the HDMI lead (it works with my Pc computer HDMI to Tv) and various other settings with no avail.
<br />
<br />
I have also tried win key and all options with no luck and changed both my tv settings to accept HDMI and they both cannot seem to notice the adapter.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks or reading and I look forward to any suggestions.</p>

    <title>Gamertag NOT taken, but... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> univocalbean944  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gamertag NOT taken, but...</h2>
                    
<p>My xbox was suggesting random available GT's for me and I saw one I liked, but kept looking. A few minutes later I typed it in and it said that it was taken. I tried to befriend the owner of this gamertag, but my xbox said "The gamertag you entered does
 not exist on xbox live."</p>
<p>So, it suggested a gamertag that wasn't taken, it says it doesn't exist on xbox live, and I checked at gamertagchecker.com and it was available for the taking BUT I still can't get it because of some glitch in the system?</p>
<p>Has anyone had to deal with an issue like this? Anything will help, I'm just coming here in hope of a lucky break while waiting for microsoft's XBL support offices to open.... Thanks</p>

</strong>Just because you can't friend request a GT doesn't mean it is available. First of all, all GT are tied to services like Zune or Games for Windows LIVE. If a GT doesn't exist on Xbox, it might be in use on one of those services. Also, spaces and capitalization
 are not considered when looking for available GTs. For example, "Major Nelson" is the same as "MajorNelson" is the same as "MaJoR nElSoN".
</span><span><strong><span>Basically if the service says the GT isn't available, it isn't available.</span></strong></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />
<br />
<strong>I heard old GTs are being re-added. When will "This GT" be available?<br />
</strong>There is no schedule or estimated dates for when certain GTs will become available again. GTs are not an on-demand service. They will be available when they are available.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Nevertheless, you are right about giving the explanation I needed, I just didn't realize at first because xbox.com<em> told me that it was available</em>. (It's just an overlooked and underestimated glitch in their programming for it to display FatalLogic
 as available when FataL LogiC is in use)</p>
