<h2>            Ps2&#47;keyboard suddenly stopped working</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have been using a ps/2 keyboard for as long as i can remember and i recently reinstalled windows 10 on my pc and it was working fine for a few days but then yesterday it suddenly stopped. I researched online and tried a few solutions with no luck. I have
 included a screenshot of my device manager and the i8042 port in regedit. The keyboard works fine in bios so it must be a windows issue. Can anyone help me?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could be a possible driver issue. We suggest that you remove your keyboard from the port, and then put it back in. Once done, restart your PC and see if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to hearing from you regarding the steps that we’ve provided. </p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Key Email&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, so this is a question regarding upgrading from windows 7 to windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 7 Home Premium and I reserved Windows 10 when I got the notification. The prompt asked me to put in my email. I decided to do a clean install to try out the windows 10 preview. So when windows 10 officially launches, will I get a product key
 in the email I used to reserve win 10 from windows 7, or will I have to reinstall win 7 and then upgrade to win 10?</p>
                </div>

If you have been participating in the Windows 10 Insider Preview Program, you might be eligible for the final release. The following article will show you how to get it."><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">How
 to upgrade from the Windows 10 Insider Preview to Windows 10 RTM build</span></a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Will I get a product key, can I get a product key?</strong></p>
<p>By default, Windows 10 builds are pre-keyed, meaning, you do not have to enter a product key and should not be prompted to enter one even after Windows 10 has completed setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-activate-the-latest-windows-10-build/33f31475-93b3-4d1c-812f-4b21fbd807a7"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-activate-the-latest-windows-10-build/33f31475-93b3-4d1c-812f-4b21fbd807a7</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Microsoft tells me that it will be possible to do so. And that a key part of this process is that it will save a product key tied to the previously upgraded PC or device in Windows Store. This is how Windows 10 will later know that the install is allowed:
 It’s “one of the benefits of the new delivery system,” a Microsoft representative told me.</em></p>

<h2>            Soul shriven in coldharbour bugged out</h2>
                    

<p>I made it out of the wailing prison and to davons watch. I got side tracked on side queats. Finished a couple of those and I go back to the main story line and it tells me to talk to the prophet. I go to the area in the house and he's not there. Two NPCs
 keep telling me I shouldn't be there. I go back to the quest log and activate the quest an show on map and it shows up in the wailing prison....... Very confused very upset. I kept playing side quests hoping it would fix and now I'm at level 19 and really
 dont want to start another character. Any help?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret the inconvenience this has caused. We'll be happy to assist you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Provide few information to help us understand better.</p>
<p>1)Where are the picture&nbsp;folders saved in your Phone?</p>
<p>2) Are you using Windows Photo app to view the slideshow?</p>
<p>3) Do you get any error message while looping back to the beginning?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>If you are using a Windows default Photo app, I would suggest you to check for the updates for Photo app in the Windows Store and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>If the issue still persists, I would suggest you to do a soft reset from the below article and check:</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/wiki/mdlumia-mdsettings/how-to-soft-and-hard-reset-your-windows-phone/4ec36474-c21e-4aec-ad1b-30f3afaf824d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/mobiledevices/wiki/mdlumia-mdsettings/how-to-soft-and-hard-reset-your-windows-phone/4ec36474-c21e-4aec-ad1b-30f3afaf824d</a>

            <p>this is NOT a phone issue...</p>
<p>the slideshow only allows 30 slides before looping back to the starting position.</p>
<p>if you have a large folder of photos / videos, you can start at any position, but the

<p>results are always the same...&nbsp; the slides loop after 30 slides.</p>

                    <p>I found this question asked but never answered.&nbsp; Now, I'm running into the same exact issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under Page Setup - Paper Options - Page Size, the default orientation is currently set to Landscape and IE8 starts that way every time.&nbsp; This is still true even after resetting IE8 options to the defaults.&nbsp; How can I permanently set the default page orientation
 to Portrait so that I don't have to manually reset printing to Portrait every time I print a page from IE8?&nbsp; I'm running under XP SP3.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting. We appreciate your interest in Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As per description I understand that you have an issue in setting Performance options on Windows 10.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to inform that when you choose “Let Windows choose what's best for my computer” option as the name says, the system will only choose
 the default settings on to your computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Either you select “Show translucent selection rectangle” option or not does not make any changes.</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to choose only “<strong>Show translucent selection rectangle</strong>” and not “Let Windows choose what's best for my computer option”.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope it helps. Feel free to contact us for any further queries on Windows Operating System.</span></p>

            Hi cbeldr, a lot of users are reporting problems with the Store app in version 1803! 
<br />
<br />Open the Windows Store 
<br />
<br />Click your User Icon and choose Sign out 
<br />
<br />Search for an App you want to download and click 'Get' 
<br />
<br />Sign back into your Account 
<br />
<br />Can you now download that App?       
        </p>

            Please try these options one by one and check after each option. (The first step usually solves the problem)
<br />
<br />1. Open MS Store &gt; Click on your profile picture on top right and sign-out. Then sign-in again.
<br />
<br />2. Run Windows App Troubleshooter
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click Settings &gt; Click Update &amp; security &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down to the bottom &gt; Click Windows Store Apps &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />3. Reset Windows Store through Command Prompt
<br />Type cmd in Windows Search box &gt; Right click on Command Prompt &gt; Run As Administrator &gt; Type WSreset.exe and click Enter  &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />
<br />4. Re-register All Store apps
<br />Right click on Windows Start &gt; Right click on Windows Powershell (Admin) &gt; Copy the following from below and right click in Powershell to paste &gt; Enter &gt; Restart your computer
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />5. Uninstall &amp; Reinstall Store
<br />Right click on Windows Start &gt; Right click on Windows Powershell (Admin) &gt; Copy the following from below and right click in Powershell to paste &gt; Enter 
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers *WindowsStore* | Remove-AppxPackage
<br />
<br />Copy the following from below and right click in Powershell to paste &gt; Enter &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />
<br />Get-AppxPackage -allusers *WindowsStore* | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml”}
<br />
<br />Let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

    <title>Win10 Disk Management not recognizing my WesternDigital external - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ballardguy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10 Disk Management not recognizing my WesternDigital external backup drive</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Moderators, if I have mis-categorized this question, please re-categorize as needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Win10 on an HP desktop. I've been using a 4TB Western Digital external hard drive to back up my desktop data weekly and have had no problems doing this. The point is that this external drive is not brand new with nothing on it. It has files on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, and while my WD drive was plugged in to the USB on my desktop, I happened to visit Disk Management, a place I do not regularly visit, and saw this information for Disk 7, referring to my 4TB WD drive:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Left-side pane&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp; Right-side pane</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disk 7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |</p>
<p>Unknown&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |</p>
<p>3725.99 GB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3725.99 GB</p>
<p>Not initialized&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unallocated</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, I was hoping it would have said similar to what it says for my other external Backup drive, a 2TB Seagate drive:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basic&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seagate Backup Slim (S:)</p>
<p>1862.89 GB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1862.89 GB NTFS</p>
<p>Online&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Healthy (Primary Partition)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If I right-click the right-side pane for Disk 7, it only allows me these choices:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Properties</p>
<p>Help</p>
<p>
</p><p>and right-clicking the left-side shows only these options:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Initialize Disk</p>
<p>Offline</p>
<p>Properties</p>
<p>Help</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally, I notice it does not let me "Change Drive Letter and Paths..."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, I do not want to initialize the WD or else I will erase all of its data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is:</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(42, 0, 170, 1)">Like the case above, the issue “<strong>disk unknown not initialized</strong>” happens not only on removable hard drives but also on internal or external hard drives from major manufacturers like Western Digital, Samsung, etc
 in Windows 10/8/7.</span></p>

            Hi BG.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 10 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Are you saying you're still able to access the files on the drive, and if so are you sure it's Disk7 in Disk Mgmt because that disk is reading  Unallocated which means it's not even formatted so couldn't have data.  
<br />
<br />If you're sure it's Disk 7,  then move the data off ASAP as it may be failing.  Then Test the hard drive with diagnostics:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testin...</a>.  Best is Seatools bootable Long Test which works on all models: 
<br /><a href="http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seatools-off-of-a-usb-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seat...</a>.
<br /><a href="https://www.seagate.com/manuals/software/seatools-bootable/using-seatools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.seagate.com/manuals/software/seatoo...</a>
<br /> 
<br />If the drive is good then format it as shown here:
<br /><a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Format-an-External-Hard-Drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Format-an-External-Hard-...</a>
<br />
<br /> File History, Windows file and Image backup are dysfunctional and may be phased out in a future version.  But they're not the best choices anyway because after ten years in forums I've seen countless times that files are lost trying to restore them, so  feel obligated to recommend choices that work much better and are 100% reliable.  
<br />
<br />For example a simple common mistake during File History file recovery is to turn it on and set it up again which wipes out the files.  See here to avoid this:
<br /><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-correctly-use-file-history-to-transfer-data-files-to-a-new-windows-10-installation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-cor...</a>
<br />
<br />The safest and most reliable backup method is to sort your files into their User Folders (Documents, Desktop, Pictures, Downloads, etc) and periodically drag or copy them to external or another hard drive.  See tips for copying large groups of files here:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-many-ways-to-copy-move-or-delete-multiple-files.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/2086566/the-man...</a>
<br />
<br />Then have one other Cloud backup so your files are safe from fire and theft and easily accessible via the internet just like email.  Some suggestions to help ease into this habit:
<br />
<br />You can drag or copy 5gb for free into OneDrive app to store in the cloud where they are safe from fire and theft.  You can also choose to sync the Desktop, Pictures and Documents folders (only) in OneDrive app Settings &gt; Autosave for real time backup.  
<br />
<br />If you install Google Drive, you can use their new Backup to choose ANY  User folders (Documents, Pictures, etc.) to sync up to 15g for free to their cloud in real time.  You can also drag/copy selected files into Drive folder.
<br />
<br /> Besides your files you should back up a System Image to use in place of reinstall in 20 minutes. The best free alternative is Macrium:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-ref...</a>.  
<br />
<br />There is an easy way to mount the System Image to extract files if needed.  Some prefer to move their User folders off of C to make the image smaller and so they stay current if you need to re-image C.  Here's how:  <a href="http://www.dummies.com/computers/operating-systems/windows-10/how-to-change-the-location-of-user-folders-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.dummies.com/computers/operating-syst...</a>
<br />
<br />This way  if Windows ever becomes irreparable you can restore C in 20 minutes from recovery media, and your files will be current and safe in their own separate partition.  If they are left on C they will be dated from when the image was taken.  
<br />
<br />The best free imaging app for saving the backup image externally is here:

<br />
<br /> I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />
<br />
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this time, I am responding only to the portion of your message recapped above as you had given me a lot to digest and I wanted to first supply you with the following information in case your other advice may change because of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I can access the files on my WD drive at anytime when plugged into my desktop. It will always appear on "This PC / Devices and Drives" with the designation "W" that I had previously assigned it, like this:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>WD My Passport 4TB (W:)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can click on it there on "This PC / Devices and Drives" and open its menu of files and folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I <em>think </em>it was in Disk Management a few months ago where I had previously designated the Seagate as (S:) and the WD as (W:).&nbsp; My memory fails me. I can almost remember formatting the Seagate via Disk Management to make it allocated but apparently
 for some reason I did not also do that to the WD from Disk Management, likely because it already had files on it from the manufacturer. This was a while back. Apparently I must have moved on and did not visit Disk Management again until today when I realized
 maybe I should ask about the Unallocated thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I note the URL I referenced does acknowledge that WD will show up as "disk unknown not initialized" so
<em>somebody </em>out there knows about this and apparently accepts this as expected. Hmm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, yes, my WD software functions perfectly fine. At the scheduled time every week, I get a pop-up saying the WD backup has begun then another one saying it has completed. I am also able to access the WD dashboard to password-protect the WD drive, etc.
 Everything about it works as expected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure it is (always) Disk 7. Here's why:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Without my WD drive plugged in, my Disk Management screen lists these entries from top of page to bottom, no Disk 7:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disk 1 - DATADRIVE1 (E:)&nbsp;&nbsp;<em> (this is my second internal hard drive, 1TB)</em></p>
<p>Disk 2 - Seagate Backup Slim (S:)</p>
<p>Disk 3 - Removable (G:) - No Media <em>(this is my SD card port)</em></p>
<p>Disk 4 - Removable - No Media</p>
<p>Disk 5 - Removable - No Media</p>
<p>Disk 6 - Removable - No Media</p>
<p>CD-ROM 0 - DVD (F:)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have at least 6 USB ports on my desktop. I don't know if this is good or bad, but no matter which USB I plug my WD into, once my desktop sees it, it appears on the list always as Disk 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally, and I don't want to complicate the story with unnecessary observations, but each time my desktop would recognize the WD, I would see a quick sliding popup in lower right corner of my screen that would say this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>CD Drive (H:) WD Unlocker</p>
<p>
</p><p>Noticing that "H" was the next letter to follow "G", I removed the WD drive then experimented and assigned H: to Disk 4, wondering if that would make my WD appear as Disk 4 and not Disk 7. I now had this list prior to insertion of the WD drive:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disk 1 - DATADRIVE1 (E:)</p>
<p>Disk 2 - Seagate Backup Slim (S:)</p>
<p>Disk 3 - Removable (G:) - No Media</p>
<p>Disk 4 - Removable (H:) - No Media</p>
<p>Disk 5 - Removable - No Media</p>
<p>Disk 6 - Removable - No Media</p>
CD-ROM 0 - DVD (F:)
<p>
</p><p>Nope, it still appeared as Disk 7 and the popup simply showed the next alphabetic letter:</p>
<p>
</p><p>CD Drive (I:) WD Unlocker</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my WD drive seems to perform without a problem in spite of the fact that Disk Management sees it as Unallocated, whatever that word is supposed to mean in view of my working WD drive.<br />

</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>No, the WD 4TB external backup drive is not partitioned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My desktop has two internal drives. C: is 2TB and E: is 1TB. Neither is partitioned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally, I plugged my WD into my <strong>laptop</strong> whose Disk Management only had this one entry:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disk 0</p>
<p>Basic 298.09 GB </p>
<p>Online</p>
<p>
</p><p>and the WD showed up as a new entry there:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disk 1</p>
<p>Unknown</p>
<p>3725.99 GB&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp; 3725.99 GB</p>
<p>Not initiated&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp; Unallocated</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, at least WIn10 is consistent between my desktop and my laptop.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The second image here shows the directory of that drive once I clicked on it. The only folder I added to the directory is the one labeled "Files copied to here on 122118". The other files/folders were already on that drive when I bought it and therefore
 I never would have felt it necessary to initialize that drive which would have removed that factory data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For some reason, the Win10 Disk Management screen does not recognize my WD drive which clearly has data on it, while MyPC does recognize it and its data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is why I had initially wondered if this was even a problem. Am I really losing any functionality here?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Curiously, is it a mystery that Win10 decided to list my WD drive as "Disk 7" or was the number 7 merely the next available number on my Disk Management list for a disc that it did not recognize via Disk Management?)</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>File corruption is one of the usual reasons why some exe files are not opening or working. For us to isolate the root cause of the issue, we would appreciate if you could provide additional information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you make any change prior to the issue?</li><li>Were you still able to login or use the computer after trying to open the exe file or after receiving the blue screen?</li><li>Can you send us a picture of the blue screen error that you've received?</li></ul>
<br />
<p>We'll keep an eye out to your response.</p>

                    I just opened my mahjong to play and it gave me this message: "There was a problem downloading game data for Microsoft Mahjong. Please check the Microsoft Mahjong FAQ at https://aka.ms/msmahjongfaq and refer to error code 101_105_101." &nbsp;This is the second
 error code it gave me. &nbsp;the first time i restarted my computer and it didn't help. &nbsp;What should i do?

            <p>... Further, if you follow the link it takes you to Facebook and REQUIRES you to log in or create an account to get support information.&nbsp; I have no desire to "expose my privates", virtual or otherwise, online, or to live my life online for very real personal
 security reasons.&nbsp; I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO HAVE / CREATE A FACEBOOK ACCOUNT TO GET SUPPORT FOR A MICROSOFT PRODUCT!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now for the real joy - if you hit "Cancel" it will ask if you want to play offline, and if you opt to do so, it pops up a blank Microsoft Mahjong News window.&nbsp; Close that, choose your puzzle and play.&nbsp; Note however, that it will only give you about half
 the puzzles that it did when it was working normally a couple days ago.</p>

            <p>Yeah, but the point is...</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHY DO I NEED TO CREATE A FACEBOOK ACCOUNT TO GET SUPPORT FOR A MICROSOFT PRODUCT?!?!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Facebook was not intended to be a product support service.&nbsp; If it is going to be used for that, there should be a way I can report bugs / problems as a legal, legitimate registered user of the product, no further "accounts" required.&nbsp; (I DO have a Microsoft
 Account - that was forced on people just to get Windows 10 and Win 10 updates.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a retired software engineer / software systems architect I know how frequently facebook and other social / online account sites get compromised for nefarious purposes.&nbsp; Even all my classification info from the '70s and '80s was stolen by the Chinese several
 years ago, according to the Office of Personnel Management;&nbsp; and in my later years working in forensics and legal video field I saw how often cops, lawyers and PI's went to social media, lifting all sorts of crap out of context to build civil and criminal
 cases against a fair number of innocent people.&nbsp; I don't want the expense of having to defend some one of those Trumped up cases, ID theft or anything else that comes with having more online than just what I need to get the support I deserve for products I
 paid for.&nbsp; And forcing me to get some social media account for "support" when it is really to try got get deeper into my privacy for marketing and sales purposes and NOT support purposes IS JUST PLAIN WRONG!!!</p>

                    I recently downloaded the xbox hub to get the beta of minecraft so i could join my friends who also have it. Since my account is not 18, i used my adult account and installed it just fine. Now, its not giving me updates to minecraft and can no longer play
 with my friends because of an outdated server or outdated client message. Ive gone through everything i could, even hard resetting the xbox and looking inside the hub to figure it out and have come up with nothing. I dont know what to do. Suggestions?

            Sorry your having issues with Minecraft.&nbsp; You can try uninstalling the game and then reinstall it.&nbsp; Outdated client means your playing an outdated version of the game.&nbsp; Maybe reinstalling it will add the needed update it needs. Also, do you and your friends
 have the same version of the game? Hopefully this will help.

            Yes we did, but the hub isnt even offering the updates to me anymore. They get the updates normally but mine never shows up and leads to the outdated game

    <title>Surface Book Overheats - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kennylee3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Book Overheats</h2>
                    Hi. I've been using my Microsoft Surface Book for a good amount of time not, but I've been really frustrated whenever my laptop crashes due to heat. It tends to happen while it is charging, but for the price that I paid for a "high-quality product," I
 shouldn't have to worry about this issue. I love this laptop and I thoroughly enjoy using it, but I am utterly unhappy with this outcome. This thermal&nbsp;issue is starting to get under my skin, and I'm stressed considering the premium I paid for it. I expected
 a better experience with this product. That is all.

            It does shut down with a thermometer icon. It happens when I'm using photoshop and other productivity software. Isn't that what this laptop was built to do? It also happens while I am charging along with the programs mentioned before.

                    <p>No matter what I do, my Xbox One S can't do better than 1.5Mbps download. I've performed all troubleshooting tips I've seen, including a full&nbsp;system reset. This problem exists for both wired and wireless connections.&nbsp;I&nbsp;know it's not my home network, because every other console and device is able to achieve the&nbsp;near-gigabit speeds from my ISP. &nbsp;Any suggestion/advice is greatly appreciated.</p>

 </blockquote> <p>You are quite welcome, and I am much appreciative of the detailed steps you've done!</p><p><br /></p><p>We don't have any information on that device with known issues; that's both good and not good news. You've already done so much that I would ask someone to do. Oddly enough, I&nbsp;do have someone else that is running into the same type of issue (download speed) with the same device, but it's in an area where Verizon was bought out by another company; his console is 360. We have seen similar issues in the past with certain network&nbsp;devices causing connection issues while wireless (an **** device specifically given out by Comcast). The only way to fix it was to go wired with those devices, but that clearly isn't going to work here.</p><p><br /></p><p>If you can, try setting up port forwarding on your device.

            Dear Skype. It seems like the Forum is riddled with complaints about the date format in Skype and I too have been forced to upgrade from Skype 7 Classic because of your "E-MAIL"<br />
<br />
<div>
<p>The Skype I have does NOT follow the Windows Date Settings so why is it that a Microsoft program does not follow Windows recommendations for programming?<br />
</p>
<p>The date format you provide is uniquely USA and as far as I know, nobody else in the world uses MM/DD/YYYY. This makes a mockery of having settings in Windows to localise my splelling and formats and we might as well all use US$ and have Trump as our leader
 if this is the way you regard the rest of the world.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having read through numerous postings, the common answer is "thank you for bringing this to our attention. We will consider it" You have been considering it for a very long time by the looks of it and still ignore non US users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please change this. It is annoying and insulting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trevor Hibdige</p>

<p>Actually it is not uniquely USA. It still adheres to the settings on your machine. However, it is currently restricted to display language rather than the individual date/format customization, that it should. If you change to another language that adheres
 to a different date/time format, it will adhere to those settings. So for example. if you change the display language of the OS to UK (British English), it will adhere to 24 hour and Day/Month/Year format (as displayed below). The downfall of that configuration
 if you normally use American English, is British English spell check. </p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55230458-6d2c-4cdc-909f-7b2b7d4dcfbb?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55230458-6d2c-4cdc-909f-7b2b7d4dcfbb?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The one advantage of Skype 8.x over the current Skype for Windows 10 App (12.x not 14.x, as it also has this option) is the ability to change the default language in the client. When not set to
<em>Device language,</em> you can set it to another language. This way your OS can remain in one language with its time/date format settings and your Skype client can be in another with the time/date format settings that are common for that language.</p>

</p><p>I'm using Skype version 8.27.0.85 (latest at time of writing) on windows 7. Neither my OS language or Skype Language is set to US. My OS date is set to display as day/month/year but it still doesn't display like this in Skype. Very annoying and confusing.</p>

            AARGGH!!&nbsp; I thought I could get rid of it by giving feedback.&nbsp; I HAD to comment to get that one off, but can't get the bottom one off.&nbsp; It blocks the message under the photos on msn news.

            I too find it most annoying as the banner ad takes up space at the bottom of the screen.&nbsp; I have given feedback asking how to remove it but no response yet.

<h2>            I disabled soundcard I think and I can&#39;t enable it now. Windows Vista Home Premium &#47; Fujitsu Lifebook A Series Laptop. No other changes made recently.</h2>
                    I apparently disabled my sound card by rt clicking on the speaker icon in the system tray on bottom rt of screen. Then I deselected the output device and selected the headphones option under the Playback Tab. I am getting no sound using headphones or from
 my internal speakers. Now hovering over the speaker icon says no audio output device is installed. Under the playback tab I now have only the headphones option. I have changed nothing else. I'm using Windows Vista Home Premium on a Fujitsu Lifebook A-series
 Laptop. Please Help? Thx.

            Thx for the Help, In my particular case Uninstalling the sound card and then rebooting solved the issue. It was a much simpler solution. Thx Tho!<br />
