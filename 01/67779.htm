            Hi LeRoy.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Are you able to create a new Admin Account at Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and Other Users?  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br />
<br />Sign into it, Set it up, move your files over, test all programs work from it, then when ready you can delete the old Account in the same location.  
<br />
<br />There will still be a User account folder with the old name which will not go away until you reinstall.  Just ignore it.  It will not interfere or appear at Sign in.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.       
        </p>

<h2>            Resident Evil 2 Revelations Digital game problem</h2>
                    <p>I was playing RE rev 2 when it locked up my Xbox 360 I had to pull the plug to turn it off (guide button would not work). Now when I try to play it the screen goes black and about 20 sec later in the bottom left corner the words loading come up like it should and the symbol swirls trying to load&nbsp;but it never loads now it just swirls like it's trying to load.</p><p><br /></p><p>I have erased all the data for it ( the&nbsp;game, updates, saves, ect...) and re-downloaded it and the game still won't work, I even tried different profiles to no avail. Other games I have downloaded still work just not this one. This is the console I bought the game on and I'm using the profile the game was bought with. The only thing I haven't done was re-download my profile to see if the license for the game was some how messed up. I paid for this game and now I can't play it pretty upsetting this isn't the first time this game has locked up like this when checking other forums I see it crashes and locks

            <p>Thanks for the extra info! Couple things for you to be aware of. First, we don't work on the weekends. We work Monday through Friday, 9am-5pm Pacific time which means we aren't here over the weekends. Second, please don't quote/respond to your post multiple times to try to get more attention to it. We know when you respond and will get to you accordingly. See point #1. :)</p><p><br /></p><p>Now, let's try a couple other things. The purpose of these steps is to try to determine if the issue is with your console, your account, the game, or something else so please follow the steps and let us know if either works. </p><p><br /></p><p>First thing to try is the easiest. If you're still on the console that purchased the game that means your current console still has the license. Because of that, you can play the game using another account on that Xbox 360 so go ahead and try playing the game using a different account. Again, this is to see if you're able to play the game successfully or if you contin

<p>Not entirely; the dochebag modders are the ones that ruin the game entirely. The modders that actually are nice and don't care about freezing, killing, or griefing are the ones that you should hang out with. Try to stay out of a game if you happen upon a
 griefer modder.</p>

<p>LegendOfGta, actually IP range bans work well. They restrict player access based on geographical location; very similar to what websites such as Wikipedia use to stop multiple vandals. In other words, a ISP provides you with an IP address to connect to the
 internet, based on location these can vary, however the addresses are numerical in order; so what they do is they restrict access based on your location. If Microsoft could use these steps, they could prevent a lot more modders/hackers from accessing online
 gameplay.</p>

<p>Microsoft, unfortunately, will not resort to IPbans. They will continue with console bans, which will always have a workaround: 1) Unban via KV key swapping, 2) Buying a new console. Modding is inevitable, and Microsoft will never stop it. I've researched
 this subject for years now. I'm well educated on this. I'm refraining from discussing anymore otherwise I will be accused of giving away precious unbanning info.</p>

<p>It's a shame, a lot of people have been saying Microsoft is too worried about people changing their avatar colors than modding/hacking games and consoles... too bad that particular hack was an easy fix, not it's all auto-detected without even filing a complaint.

<p>What I never understood though is why there is so much hatred for modding. Look at the PC community. Companies don't try to ban people for modding the PC and an Xbox 360 is very similar to a PC. Where did MS suddenly get the idea that modding was wrong?
 Where I ask because I'll admit that some mods might pose an unfair advantage, but the majority I've seen in GTA IV is clothing mods, vehicle spawns, speed mods, and invincibility, which IMO, the latter should be bannable. But honestly, what is wrong with modding
 in the Police Patriot or the Noose Enforcer? How does it harm other players? How does it ruin their gaming expereince? How can changing your appearance to a NOOSE member possibly be detrimental to another player's gaming expereince? These are the questions
 that go through my head whenever I read the ToS and witness modding on GTA IV. I'll admit it is annoying seeing people have mods and others don't but I really don't see what the harm is and why MS has such a "hard on" for banning mods.</p>

<p>LegendOfGta, it's business ethics. These, we, are paying customers; we reserve the right to have our game experiences to be positive, not negative or threatening. Microsoft will constantly try to slam the Terms of Use and Code of Conduct in your face but
 do little to actually enforce them. Most of the mods alter gameplay experience for other players... so if Microsoft is so adamant about their policies they score poorly on actual ethics. I've seen this way too many times.

<p>Ah, so it all becomes clear. They mostly "throw the Terms of Use in our faces" but do little to enforce them. Just wanted to hear it officially.
</p>
<p>-----</p>
<p>I will argue though that, although mods change the expereince of other players, it also improves the expereince of the person who is modding. Also, some players actually enjoy having modders in the game; the ones that are most hated are the modders that
 simply come to games to RUIN THE EXPERIENCE (i.e: freezing, killing, setting players on fire, etc). What I'm arguing now is why does Microsoft want to ban mods outright and not overlook the players that are actually considered "cool" to the community? (i.e:
 spawning rare/unobtainable vehicles, giving out money to players of low rank, killing griefers/players that ruin the expereince for others, don't attack unless provoked wrongly, spawning peds, etc)</p>

                    I went through the connection process, entered my SSID and KEY and then it asked me for a usb. After plugging it into the laptop I followed the steps telling me to plug it into the computer etc. I opened the usb on my computer and tried to run the AUTORUN
 but my computer denied access. I also attempted to setupSNK and add my laptop to my computer's network but I recieved a notification saying that either my wireless network or my wireless network software was not installed. I have a router and it's properly
 hooked up to the computer. Wireless also works on my sisters laptop. Could you explain what I should do to get it setup properly?

 settings (which there weren't any anyway),&nbsp;ran scv/scannow&nbsp;which found no problems.&nbsp;Following one tho, when running '<span><span><strong>REGSVR32 softpub.dll initpki.dll wintrust.dll'
</strong>it states that&nbsp;The module initpki.dll failed to load, specified module could not be found. Would this affect trying to sign in to an instant messaging program? The program itself downloads without a problem, but as soon as i try to sign in or create
 an account with the actual server, thats where theres problems.&nbsp;Please help!<br />

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Unpack Error Alternative Download</h2>
                    Hi, I was downloading 8.1 from Dreamspark and every time download completes (3gb) the unpack error occurs. I am downloading 64-bit 8.1 on my desktop (currently using Win8 64-Bit) through SDM. I searched through net and MS sites but none of the tricks worked.
<br />
Just want to ask is there any other download alternative?<br />

<h2>            Connecting to wireless internet ISP</h2>
                    <p>I use a local ISP that uses cellular towers to broadcast. It's beeter than satellite and my best option. Currently per instructions from my ISP I have an xbox one in the basement that is connected via wire to a switch using a static ip. Everything else in the house connects via a d link router.</p><p><br /></p><p>That is the only way that the xbox would connect to xbox live. Now for my issue. I just got an xbox one x and my 4 k tv is upstairs. I don't have the ability to connect in the same manner as the other xbox. I can connect to the internet without issues and it shows a moderate NAT even though Nat test says I'm not connected to the internet.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>ISP says I may be able to set up my router as an access point and connect that way. Anyone run into this issue and have had luck setting it up?</p><p><br /></p><p>Oddly xbox one x also looses connection to the network a lot as well. :(</p><p><br /></p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Unable to empty recycle bin - &#39;discovering items&#39; issue</h2>
                    I have a .mkv file stuck in my recycle bin, I cannot empty it from the recycle bin or restore it to force delete it.<br />
<br />
Whats happens is i get the box stating 'Discovering items' and nothing else happens, it just sits there forever till you force the dialog box to close.<br />
<br />
Is there another way to purge the recycle bin to resolve this? Or does anyone know how to fix this?<br />
<br />
I've had this issue with folders on the C drive before and found out that was permissions related but I am unsure why the recycle bin is doing it!

            Hi jmhill54,<br />
<br />
See if you can clear the Recycle Bin after restarting Windows. If not, you may try manually clearing the Recycler folder. Instructions

    <title>Windows 10 randomly freeze - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pira21  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 randomly freeze</h2>
                    <p>Hi, my I've been using my PC with Windows 10 for a while. One day (more than a year ago), I noticed that it randomly freeze at times when I browse the internet, play games, or even in the Windows Explorer. The freeze sometimes came every 2-3 minutes, sometimes
 longer than that and it took around a minute for the PC to come back in operation. During the freeze, my browser (Chrome) sometimes said 'waiting for cache...'. If I watch video streaming, the video stops, but sometimes I still can scroll other browser pages
 that I open earlier before the freeze. Sometimes I can just do nothing during the freeze. In some occasion my Windows Explorer became broken (unreadable text and buttons) after the freeze that I had to restart my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried update Windows and all my drivers, clear malware, clear internet cache and history, run memory check, run drive error check, change my browser, and nothing worked. Then I just ignored that PC and hope that future Windows update might help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have to use this PC. I run Windows update and everything is the same. So yesterday I reinstalled my Windows 10, now using Education version. The installation took around 4-5 hours. After the format, I noticed slight freeze at the beginning of Windows
 login, but after installation of the latest graphic driver, it ran smoothly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I use this PC again and here comes the freeze while I watch video streaming. I thought it was because of software, now I'm afraid that it might be because of some of my hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS. I notice that if I'm typing this while listening to the video streaming, the PC freeze 2-3 times and I could not type. But when I close all the Youtube video, the freeze does not happen. Though this might be just a coincidence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my PC.</p>
<p>Windows 10 Education 64 bit</p>
<p>Intel Core i5-4460</p>
<p>Ram 16 Gb</p>
<p>SSD 120 Gb (Windows drive)</p>

<p>Hello Pira21, <br />
<br />
<br />
This seems to be an interesting issue. To help you with this, kindly follow the methods below that can resolve your concern:
<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Method 1</strong></em>: Clear your computer's <em><strong>temp files</strong></em>.
<br />
<br />
If Windows doesn’t have enough space to store temp files, it can slow down or even freeze. So you should clear them regularly.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <em><strong>Windows + R</strong></em> keys to open the <strong><em>Run</em></strong> dialog box.</li><li>Type <strong><em>temp</em></strong> and press <strong><em>Enter</em></strong>. This will open
<em><strong>Windows Explorer</strong></em> with your <strong><em>Temp</em></strong> folder open showing all the temp files on your computer.<br />
<br />

<br />
</li><li>Select <strong><em>all</em></strong> the files, right-click on it and choose <strong>
<em>Delete</em></strong>.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b2f7c2b5-edd1-4cfe-aa51-3bcfe0c841ac?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b2f7c2b5-edd1-4cfe-aa51-3bcfe0c841ac?upload=true" height="465" width="573" /></a><br />
<br />
</li><li>Once done, check if the issue persists. If so, try the next method. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Method 2</strong></em>: Run <em><strong>Disk Check</strong></em>. <br />
<br />
A bad sector on your device can be one of the factors why this issue occurs. To make sure that this is not the case, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Close all open programs and files.</li><li>Press <em><strong>Windows + E</strong></em> keys to open the <em><strong>File Explorer</strong></em>.</li><li>On the left-pane, click on <em><strong>This PC</strong></em>.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/767470d8-8aac-49f6-a704-e56a350512cc?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/767470d8-8aac-49f6-a704-e56a350512cc?upload=true" height="267" width="516" /></a><br />
<br />
</li><li>Locate the hard drive you’d like to check, right-click on it and choose <strong>

            This is a brand new build of mine. As far as I can tell this is only happening with the one game. All updates are installed. I am currently connected through Ethernet but I have also tried wifi. I have tried clean boot and there is no difference. I have
 even manually removed the windows store app and reinstalled it using the powershell interface. There seems to have been a slew of errors and issues with the pc port of this game especially in stability and performance but I can't even get the game to download.&nbsp;

            <div>Windows has been repaired several time, not to mention that I reinstalled the entire operating system fresh several times as well. This is clearly a big issue with their the windows store of the game itself. I've even tried downloading the game on other
 hardware, other computers and even a virtual machine of windows all getting the same error.

            I've had this same issue for weeks. I have a brand new PC with a brand new installation of Windows 10. I followed lots of methods of fixing it. Basically anything you can find by searching the error code. In the end I found a post which suggested creating
 a new user account on the PC. This fixed the issue but only temporarily. The error is now back. It only seems to occur on large downloads and will fail at bang on the 1GB or 2GB download mark. Is yours the same?

    <title>Power Brick popped - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gabbygooby  say:</h3>
<h2>            Power Brick popped</h2>
                    
<p>I have an xbox one and the power brick made a popping/cracking noise yesterday and quit working. The orange light still comes on but then when I plug it in to the xbox console it goes off and won't power the console on.</p>

<p>There's nothing wrong with the outlet it was plugged in to, it does the same thing from every outlet I have. This is only less than a year old.
</p>

<p>Does anyone have this issue, and does anyone know how to fix it? Is it common that they blow like this?

<p>Sometimes a short circuit can fry even the most resilient of power bricks. I suggest you to get a new asap and not use a damaged power brick that might damage your console in return.

<h2>            Phone not connecting to laptop</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a Samsung A3 and have plugged it in to my Windows 10 laptop via USB but it was not recognised by the laptop as being connected. I just want to transfer photos between my phone and laptop as I have done many times before but for some reason now I can't.</p>

    <title>USB Hub Freezes - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pjglad  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB Hub Freezes</h2>
                    I am not sure if I have a hardware problem or a software problem. I have a new HP desktop with WIN 7 plus SP1. It has 4 USB ports in the back and 2 in the front. The back 4 ports have are connected to a webcam, Passport disc drive, mouse and a powered
 USB hub. The hub is connected to the keyboard and a scanner. About once a week, the keyboard freezes. The only way to proceed is to power down the system. Also, sometimes when I connect the iPhone to one of the front USB ports and install a very large App
 (e.g., Navigon), the keyboard will freeze. Any suggestions?

            <p>Hi Pjglad,</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>How long have you been facing this issue?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Did you make any recent changes prior to the issue?</p>
<p>Follow the methods provided below to resolve the issue:</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b>
I would suggest you to run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</b></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:
</b>Use Device Manager to disable and re-enable all the USB controllers. </p>
<p>This lets the controllers recover the USB port from its unresponsive condition. The USB controllers represent the USB ports in Device Manager.</p>
<p>To disable and re-enable the USB controllers, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Open Device Manager.</p>
<p>Refer:
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Device-Manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Device-Manager</a></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Expand <b>Universal Serial Bus controllers.</b>
</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> You might have to scroll down the list to find this item.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right-click the first USB controller under
<b>Universal Serial Bus controllers</b>, and then click <b>Uninstall</b> to remove it.</p>
<p>
<b><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></b>Repeat the above step for each USB controller that is listed under
<b>Universal Serial Bus controllers.</b></p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Restart the computer. After the computer starts, Windows will automatically scan for hardware changes and reinstall all the USB controllers that you uninstalled.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>Hello,<br />
<br />
Yes, playing with people who are modding or hacking in a game will also get you banned alongside them. If you encounter a game where someone is modding or hacking file a complaint against them and leave the game or return to the dashboard.<br />
<br />
If you don't know how to file a complaint you can visit this page <strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/account-banning-and-player-feedback/file-player-complaint" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You could get into trouble yes, just for even being in it for a minute, Microsoft or Activision don't know your intensions, exploiting the game in various ways such as glitching and hacking/modding can result in account suspension. Microsoft wouldn't be
 the one to ban you as they can't see what your doing in an Activision game but Activision in it's digression could take action. Now here is my input, that being an old game such as it is should not be a problem as almost every lobby on there is modded and
 Activision fails to update or take action on such exploits and or players. But nontheless it still violates Microsofts Code of Conduct and can result in suspension of account if enough players deem you as system tampering/cheating. I would tell you to not
 play in those&nbsp;lobbies anyways, why risk it?</p>

<h2>            Video Playback Issues with Windows 10 Update</h2>
                    <p>I hope someone can assist me with this. Since upgrading to Windows 10 I have been having major video issues. Videos seem to play fine in VLC, and interestingly YouTube seems fine, but streaming from anywhere else I get choppy playback and the right half
 of the video screen is distorted. Also having issues with the Windows video player - same as when streaming. Choppy video and sound and right half of the screen is distorted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did anyone else have the same issues and have a fix to offer?</p>
