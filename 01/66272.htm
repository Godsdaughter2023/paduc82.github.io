    <title>Netflix app freezes in Windows 8, no error detected in Troubleshooter - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maggiemurphy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Netflix app freezes in Windows 8, no error detected in Troubleshooter</h2>
                    I have an Asus&nbsp;notebook PC&nbsp;with Windows 8 that I just got today, and I got the Netflix app from the Windows store a few hours ago. The first time I tried to stream a TV show it played just fine for about 30 seconds, then the picture froze while the audio
 continued. In another few seconds the screen went black and the audio stopped, then the player just started again from the beginning, with the same thing happening after 30 seconds. This happens every time I stream any TV show or movie, from any point in the
 title.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first time it happened the troubleshooter opened, but it couldn't find the error. I am not tech savvy so I just went online to see if anyone had similar problems, and it seemed like a lot of people were having issues with the app crashing,&nbsp;and they&nbsp;just
 installed the most recent version of Silverlight and it went away. So I tried that, and nothing has changed. I have uninstalled and reinstalled the app, restarted the computer, and tried just quitting the app altogether and streaming from IE but as soon as
 it accesses the title&nbsp;it stops me and says I cannot stream without the Windows 8 app.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm all out of ideas, and I have yet to see anyone else with a similar problem. If anyone has any ideas, I would appreciate the help as this is NOT something I am good at!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            Hi,
<br />
<br />Welcome to the Microsoft community!
<br />
<br />Regardless of whether it is for work or personal use, you can connect to a VPN (virtual private network) on your Windows 10 PC. A VPN connection can help you provide a more secure connection to your company's network and the Internet (for example, when you are working in a cafeteria or similar public place).
<br />
<br />In order to connect to a VPN, you need a VPN profile on your PC. You can create a VPN profile on your own or set up a professional account to obtain a company VPN profile.
<br />
<br />Create a VPN profile
<br />If you do not have any VPN profile on your Windows 10 PC, you will have to create one on your own. Before starting:
<br />
<br />If it's for work, look for the VPN configuration or a VPN application on your company's intranet site when you're at work, or contact the company's technical support staff.
<br />If it is for a VPN service that you subscribe to for personal use, visit the Microsoft Store to see if there is an application for that service, and then go to the VPN service website to see if the VPN connection configuration that is must use appears there.
<br />Select the Start button and then select Settings&gt; Network and Internet&gt; VPN&gt; Add a VPN connection.
<br />In Add a VPN connection, do the following:
<br />In VPN Provider, choose Windows (integrated). In the Connection box, type a descriptive name (for example, my Personal VPN) for the VPN connection profile. This is the name of the VPN connection that you should look for in the server names or in the address box when you want to connect. Enter the address of the VPN server.
<br />In VPN Type, choose the type of VPN connection you want to create. You will have to know what type of VPN connection the company uses or the VPN service.
<br />In Type of login information, choose the type of login information (or credentials) you are going to use. This information can be a username and password, a one-time password, a certificate or a smart card if you connect to a work VPN. Enter your username and password in the corresponding boxes (optional).
<br />Select Save
<br />If you need to edit the VPN connection information or specify additional configuration options, such as the proxy settings that will be used for the VPN connection, choose the VPN connection and then Advanced Options.
<br />Connect to a VPN
<br />When you have a VPN profile, you can connect.
<br />
<br />At the far right of the taskbar, select the Network (or) icon.
<br />Select the VPN connection you want to use, and then perform one of the following actions depending on what happens when you select the VPN connection:
<br />If the Connect button is displayed below the VPN connection, select Connect.
<br />If the VPN is opened in Settings, select the VPN connection, and then select Connect.
<br />If asked, enter your username and password or other login information.
<br />Once connected, Connected will appear below the name of the VPN connection.
<br />To quickly check if you are connected to the VPN while doing tasks on the computer, select the Network icon (or) at the far right of the taskbar and then see if the VPN connection indicates "Connected" below.
<br />
<br />regards

            Hi HallowedDrop854 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Yes, receiving SMS is possible only for US Skype numbers. As of now, the schedule for other countries is not published. They would like to make it perfect first in US market.
<br />
<br />I would recommend that you should send this feedback to Skype engineers to make it available in UK market fast - Open Skype &gt; Click 3 dots on top &gt; Help &amp; feedback &gt; Give feedback 
<br />
<br />Feedback can also be given through Uservoice where you can find the feedback of others and status would be visible to you - <a href="https://skype.uservoice.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skype.uservoice.com/</a>

                    <p>I have had to change my password for my Microsoft account a few times this evening while I was setting up my new notebook. I'm new to windows 8 and am having some trouble! The first time the password didn't work I was trying to install the twitter app when
 it asked me to sign in to my Microsoft account and when I typed my password it said it was wrong. So I went through the process of creating a new password only to find it happened again when I went to&nbsp;PC settings&nbsp;and under users it said I had to sign in with
 my new password which then didn't work. The password did work on all online sites asking for my Microsoft account info and password. Needles to say I repeated the process twice and am now just frustrated and am getting the same result. Please Help!</p>

<h2>            Password changed automatically by windows 7</h2>
                    Received error message stating windows 7 recovered from a serious error. The password I alway used to log on now does not work. I did not forget my passord but a message appears giving a hint for a lost password. The hint is "V14". I tried typing V14 as
 the password but cannot log on.

<p>Hey jergan,</p>
<p>This most often happens due to virus infection.</p>
<p>You may refer the Help article below to fix the issue.</p>
<p>After fixing the issue, make sure that you install a good antivirus software and run a complete scan of the computer.</p>
<p><strong>What to do if you forget your Windows password<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-to-do-if-you-forget-your-Windows-password" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-to-do-if-you-forget-your-Windows-password</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you do not have antivirus/antispyware software on your machine, you may download Microsoft Security Essentials.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Here’s the download link:</span></p>

<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/market.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/market.aspx</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>In case you do not have the windows reset disk as mentioned in the article above, you&nbsp;may have to rely on a third party password recovery tool for password retrieval.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Note</strong>: Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be solved. Using Third Party Software is at your own risk.</span></p>

<h2>            &#8220;We need to verify your identity&#8221;,</h2>
                    <p><span><span>I have a clean installation of Windows 10 Home (up to date). I get asked by Windows: “We need to verify your identity”, about 10 minutes after I turn on the laptop. Then I get asked
 that same question, on average every two hours, sometimes more, sometimes less.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>When I click on the “We need to verify your identity” message, it takes me to Settings / Accounts, there I click on “Verify” and enter my PIN. Then after a while it keeps asking me to
 do that again. </span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>This has been happening for weeks. I have re-installed Windows on a completely clean, formatted C: partition each time. Same problem each time.</span></span></p>

            We need you to verify your identity" means that Microsoft sends you a code number via text message or telephone call and you enter that code number to the prompt. You only have to verify once and you're done.

            <p>I have received this code about a 100 times, either to my phone or my e-mail. It lasts about an hour or two, then I get the “We need to verify your identity” pop-up again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two-step sign in is not activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also noticed that on the "My devices" page, my desktop PC is shown with detailed info, like motherboard type, Windows 10 Core (10.0.10586.63), etc.</p>
<p>But my other computer, the laptop, is just listed as "PC". No other information is available, not Windows version, no hardware details, nothing. That laptop is the only one that gets this annoying “We need to verify your identity” despite me having entered
 the code over a hundred times in any available way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am quite certain that the fact that not detailed PC or Windows information is closely related to the “We need to verify your identity” problem.</p>

            I'm having the same problem too. I talked to some microsoft support rep last night and (after holding for some time) she said it was a technical issue and to try back 1-2 hours later. Its been about 24hrs now and its still not working... When i check "my
 account" at the app store it says i haven't added a payment option yet. But when I click "buy" in the app store it shows my credit card as an option. So i select the card and click submit and then the "payments and billing" page just goes blank. Anybody else
 experiencing this?

            <p>So there has been no response from Microsoft on this issue since October....</p>
<p>I guess I should have went the produce product instead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I too had/ have this issue and I took to the MS phone lines only to find out that the office that could help me get it figured out was only open during US East coast office hours and I'm in the Midwest. Isn't MS a global company...? Shouldn't that mean
 24/7 support for their products?</p>

                    Hi, my PC has been freezing/crashing soon after startup or waking from sleep. It seldom shows a blue screen and it just freezes in most occasions without any error notices. It usually repairs by itself after a few forced restarts. Once it's running, it
 works just fine without any issues, until next restarts - I can't keep it running for 24/7 unfortunately.<br />
<br />
Just a short history..... I upgraded to Windows 8 recently from XP. My motherboard died upon installation, so I got a new motherboard, CPU and RAM. I had a major issue after about 2 weeks, not being able to boot up, which turned out to be a faulty motherboard.
 I got a replacement, but I've been experiencing this problem right from the start. Just to rule out other hardware issues, I've since upgraded HD(SSD), PSU and graphic card - so everything is basically new except for the case.
<br />
<br />
I doesn't usually create minidump files (only 7 located in the last 2 weeks but freezes/crashes occur almost every time PC is started or waken from sleep, usually several times continuously) but when it does, it leads to 'ntoskrnl.exe+5a440'. Does anybody have
 any idea how to solve this? I'm getting really sick of it......<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance! <br />
<br />
My system is running Windows 8 Pro x64:<br />
Intel i5-3470 3.2GHz<br />
Crucial Ballistix 8GB RAM<br />
Asus P8Z77-V LX2 motherboard<br />
Samsung SSD 840 250GB<br />
Asus HD 6670 Graphic card<br />
XFX Pro550W PSU<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>EDIT</b>: Just to add a bit more info.... freezing can even happen during the startup (screen with blue window) or logging in process (where you enter the PIN), even in BIOS.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To resolve the issue with system performance, follow these methods:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1</b>:</p>
<p><b>Step A:</b> Boot the computer in <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<b>Safe mode</b></a><b> </b>wherein the computer starts with basic drivers and no third party programs.
</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b></p>
<p><b>Step B:</b></p>
<p>If the issue does not persists in Safe Mode then perform <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<b>clean boot</b></a> mode to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: After troubleshooting, refer to the section “<b>How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot</b>” to return the computer to a
<b>Normal startup</b> mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2</b>:</p>
<p>I would also suggest you to refer to the article and check if it helps:</p>

<br />
To be honest, I haven't tried Safe Mode, purely because I don't want to restart my PC when it's working (i.e. to be able start in Safe Mode means the PC is working without freezing). I have tried Clean Boot. It did work for a couple of days without this issue
 initially, but they could just happen to be the days when the freezing doesn't occur (like today, it's been working fine without any issues right from the startup).
<br />
<br />
I've tried Method 2 but they didn't work. <br />

            Update..... The same problem occurs in Safe Mode too. I've tried the System File Checker and it showed hunderds (maybe thousands) of files that couldn't be repaired. I'm not sure if this is the cause or the result s of all these forced restarts. But it's
 hard to believe it's the cause as this happened with completely fresh install (several times) of Windows (unless the DVD itself has the issue). Any ideas?

I've done that and it makes no difference. The problem still continues and it's becoming like a chore&nbsp; in the morning. Getting really fed up!

            Thanks, but I've already tried it. If I use it, I think this will set the time for the PC to go to sleep shorter? But I'm trying to avoid it as it'll freeze if I wake it up from sleep. So, I've set it so that it doesn't hibernate, longer time before sleeping
 etc etc. <br />

<p>Although you would probably be seeing this everywhere, it's possible that your F5 (refresh) key is stuck or possibly sticky.&nbsp; It's worth a quick look see.&nbsp; Just make sure the key is in the normal position, i.e., not partially or completely depressed (grammar
 police, feel free...).</p>
<p>Another possibility is a conflicting program.&nbsp; Toolbars for IE, Firefox, Chrome, Opera, etc...&nbsp; might be to blame.&nbsp; You should not need *any* toolbars at all.&nbsp; If you have any, please remove them, one at a time to isolate which is the problem.&nbsp; My *guess*
 would be any that have a desktop search feature.</p>
<p>Yet another possibility is that your Windows Desktop Search (right?) has gone haywire.&nbsp; Uninstall it and reinstall it, or, do without (don't reinstall it), your choice.&nbsp; It could be that your combination of hardware and software doesn't play well with Windows
 Desktop Search.&nbsp; It's not fun, but it does happen.&nbsp; Should that be the case, you have my apologies.&nbsp; There are alternatives you could try.</p>
<p>Please keep us informed of your success, or lack there of, and what you find out.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
<p>Edit:&nbsp; Brendon is probably on to something.&nbsp; It's definitely worth verifying that indexing is on.&nbsp; Perhaps I'll test this and post back.</p>
<p>Edit2:&nbsp; I could not replicate this condition.&nbsp; The computer on which XP is installed has two drives. Installing Windows Search, allowing full indexing of both drives, disabling indexing, did not lead to the any unexpected behavior.&nbsp; Curiously, making new
 files required a search refresh (F5) to see the new files.&nbsp; It's possible that the short interval used precluded automatic refreshing, although, I did allow enough time for indexing to complete (or so it reported).&nbsp; Re-enabling drive indexing only changed
 which search was used.&nbsp; Without indexing, no queries complete or, results are not listed.&nbsp; It suggested that the use of the search companion was required.</p>
<p>I'm sorry I could not be more helpful.</p>

<p>I've seen this, too, and can only speculate that your&nbsp;experience was the same as mine.&nbsp;&nbsp; For me, I had search indexing turned off, and I don't think Windows likes that too much.&nbsp; So therefore, when you ask to search something, it takes the opportunity to
 search like crazy, and that entails searching in places it's already looked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My&nbsp;test that proved it to me was that I had it search one folder, which only had a few files, for a file I knew wasn't there.&nbsp; Being so small, it "finished" the search instantaneously.&nbsp; While leaving the search window up and untouched, I created a file in
 the folder that was "done searching".&nbsp; The file then immediately appeared in the search results, suggesting that either the file creation triggered an event or the search kept searching that folder.&nbsp; I spread my test to include larger and larger sections of
 my hard drive and the effect was the same, albeit slower.&nbsp; Eventually the scope of my search was so large, that although it checked everything once, it immediately started checking everything again and looked like it never was stopping.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I turned on
 indexing, however, this behavior stopped.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another&nbsp;guess as to why this was happening is that the new search results are triggered as an event, but an event that also triggers a virus scan.&nbsp; The virus scanner checks all the files that were touched in the file search, which in turn triggers the search
 window to search all those files again.&nbsp; The war of attrition continues until you terminate the whole thing.&nbsp; I think I missed my opportunity to check this, but I think it's a very valid scenario.</p>
<p>This is only one experience, though.&nbsp; Other reasons this may happen, especially if you're searching multiple drives, is that one piece of hardware isn't responding in a way windows expects, and the search never gets the final acknowledgement that it's done.&nbsp;
 Something like an obscure&nbsp;bug in the hardware drivers or bad media could cause this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To summerize things to try:</p>
<ul>
<li>turn on indexing (temporarily if just to test, but give it time to do a full index)
</li><li>turn off active virus scanning (definately temporary if there's any virus risk)
</li><li>update virus scanner engine </li><li>ensure your device drivers are up-to-date </li><li>run disk checks on the drives you are checking. </li></ul>
<p>Hope one of these wordy shots-in-the-dark help!&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Blank CD declared to be read only</h2>
                    My computer has a DVD-RW drive. I put a blank CD disc into it and tried writing to it. One program, ready to write and audio file, declared the CD to be read-only. Another -- doing a file copy and burn -- simply failed. How do I get this blank disc to
 be recognized as writable?

            <p>Along with the previous suggestion - there are quite a few possibilities. The blank disc itself is one. There's a lot of old stock around and they can (and do!) deteriorate. Try a different&nbsp;disc - maybe even a different brand - before doing anything else...</p>
<p>The age of the pc's optical drive is another. It may just be caput, particularly if it is a laptop. You could try cleaning the lens either with a cleaning disc designed for computers or if accessible, with a very soft brush and a very gentle tickle.
</p>
<p>There are other checks that can be made but update on progress first... have a good holiday. - Ric.</p>

            <p>Update since last night:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I am done for the evening I shut down the computer, essentially doing what ClockJogos suggested. This morning I tried the file copy and burn. This was using Windows Explorer to copy folders from one internal drive to the CD drive, then telling it to
 burn the CD. This morning it worked, successfully writing 443 Mb. It was the one I reported as having "failed" yesterday. So, ClockJogos had a useful suggestion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on a PC which is 2.5 years old. I don't think I've written CDs on this drive before, though I have used it to read and play commercial music CDs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday, I did try two different brands of blank CDs. I used to write CDs quite a bit as backup for my computer, but tech has changed and I don't do that anymore. I don't know how old they are. Since I use them so rarely now I'm reluctant to buy more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On to the other program that was a problem last night. It is Sony Sound Forge Audio Studio, version 9.0. It came with the new vinyl turntable a few years ago. The program is a sound editor, which I'm using to clean up what I got off a vinyl record and want
 to write to CD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried that writing again this morning. It gives the message "The disc in the drive is a read only disc." Following ClockJogos' suggestion I shut down the computer for a few minutes, booted, and tried again. I got the same message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried copying and burning the audio .wav file using Windows Explorer. It succeeded, though now I have a CD with an audio file on it rather than an audio CD.</p>

            <p>Thanks for updating. I'm in a similar situation as regards blank CD stock. I have a handful left and am unlikely ever to buy more! I do have some CD/RWs which can&nbsp;be unreliable but at least I can usually run a test-burn before committing to&nbsp;a write-once
 disc... might be worth considering if you want to avoid wastage.</p>
<p>I'm not familiar with the Forge Studio but suspect that may be the problem as you successfully burned a disc... What about trying to burn with WMP? - R.</p>

            <p>Before I got my current computer I used WMP and found that I had to contort what I wanted to fit the way it did things. An example is folders by artist when I was more interested in composition and composer. So on this computer I've avoided WMP, using VLC
 instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But at your suggestion I started up WMP and turned down its pleas to make it the default music program. I could open the file I want to write into WMP, but it wouldn't let me drag the file into the burn column. I guess it wanted me to put the file in a playlist
 or library.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not going to pursue trying to burn with WMP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, it is possible the Sound Forge program is a problem. And I recognize to pursue that option I need to talk to their support team.</p>

            Adding the file to a temporary playlist ought to enable burning. It doesn't have to be in the library (or even the music folder) to do that. Your decision of course... hope you have some success with Sound Forge, = Ric.

            <p>No problem -- no time wasted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your statement isn't quite clear how your printers are connected, but I assume you are using a router.&nbsp; If you are not using a router, the basic problem described below is very similar, but some details are different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to work when connected by Ethernet cable, a printer has to be assigned an IP address.&nbsp; In this situation, the typical default setting of the printer can easily cause a problem such as you describe.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a description of the problem and how to avoid it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All home printers with which I am familiar that are capable of being connected over a network default to obtaining an IP address automatically.&nbsp; This is not a problem in the typical home network, where the printer is connected to a router by using either
 an Ethernet cable or wi-fi.&nbsp; The router has a "DHCP server" that automatically assigns IP addresses to each device connected to it (as long as the device is configured to request an address).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the printer is first installed on a Windows computer, part of the installation is the discovery of the IP address assigned to the printer.&nbsp; Windows then configures its printing subsystem to direct output for that printer to that IP address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, the image below shows that the "Downstairs HP 6988" printer has been assigned IP address 192.168.1.26.&nbsp; You can see that there is another network printer in this system, the "Upstairs HP 6988" printer; that printer has been assigned IP address
 192.168.1.25.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e7f5b1d5-e43e-45e7-a2bf-fd5c5e41b9d2" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem arises when the printer is turned off and other devices are connected to the local network during that time.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>At some time after the printer is turned off (or disconnected from the network), the router's DHCP server recognizes that the IP address is no longer in use and makes it "available."&nbsp; If another device (a printer or something else) is then connected to the
 network, that IP address may be assigned to the new device.&nbsp; When the printer is subsequently turned on (or re-connected to the network), the DHCP server assigns it a new IP address.&nbsp; The problem is that Windows still directs print output to the old (original)
 IP address.&nbsp; Because the printer isn't there, nothing happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 6 in my earlier response describes how to see the IP addresses where Windows directs print output for each of your printers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If those IP addresses were assigned automatically and if the "Upstairs HP 6988" printer was turned off long enough for address 192.168.1.25 to become available, and if I then connected another network device that was assigned that address, when I then turned
 the printer back on, it would be assigned a different address, e.g., 192.168.1.27.&nbsp; But Windows would still try to print to 192.168.1.25.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step 8 in my earlier response describes how to see the IP address actually assigned to the printer.&nbsp; If the IP address assigned to the printer (as shown in step 8) isn't the same as the IP address where Windows is directing the printing output (as shown
 in step 6), you can't print.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One way to avoid this problem is to assign a "static" IP address to the printer and then configure Windows to use that address.&nbsp; A "static" IP address simply means one that doesn't change.&nbsp; How you do that will be described in the User Guide for your printer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, both of the HP 6988 printers in the image above are assigned static IP addresses.&nbsp; They will always have those addresses, even if they are powered off or disconnected from the network.&nbsp; Thus, these printers are always where Windows expects to find
 them when it sends a print job.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another way is to "reserve" the IP addresses assigned to the printer(s) so that the router will not assign that address to anything else, even if the printer is powered off or disconnected from the network.&nbsp; How you do that will be described in the User
 Guide for your router (not all routers can do this, but many newer ones can).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want help on the above, please provide the specific models of your Epson and HP printers and the make and model of your router.&nbsp; For the latter, look at the label on the back or bottom of the device and include any hardware version indicated.&nbsp;

    <title>touch screen keyboard symbols not working properly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kavamay  say:</h3>
<h2>            touch screen keyboard symbols not working properly</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>I recently bought an Asus transformer book convertible notebook, which has a detachable touch screen "tablet" alongside the keyboard. Most times i simply use the screen w/o the keyboard as i have the touch screen keyboard. I have windows 8 installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that any time try to use the symbols section of the keyboard and press a key, it acts just like a regular keyboard which requires to me shift press a button to get some symbols. Such as shift pressing 1 to get ! and 2 to get @ etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a problem since there is no way for me to "shift" while in this section, meaning i have no way to use the majority of the symbols unless i were to reattach the keyboard, which i don't want to do. Same applies with the ? on the main screen giving
 me a / instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone else have this problem as well? Its getting increasingly frustrating.</p>
<p>I've searched for answers, the closest i got was that it might be the UK keyboard, which it isn't, as i found out, i have the English(Canada) one, which i selected when setting up my computer.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The keyboard i was using was the touchscreen keyboard, the same one pictured from this Article:</p>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/using-touch-keyboard</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried as many different things i could think of to try to get it to work, such as touching shift, then moving to the symbols section and pressing one, and also holding it down, and selecting the specific symbol, neither of which worked, still outputting
 the corresponding number or symbol that coincides with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I honestly don't know what happened, but it seemed to have fixed itself after my computer updated a bit after i posted this. which is still odd as it has updated many times before and the problem remained.</p>
<p>Im praying that the problem doesn't return, but i am not keeping my hopes up.</p>

    <title>Bios recognizes IDE Hard Drives, Windows 7 Installer does not find - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> emeraldslady  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bios recognizes IDE Hard Drives, Windows 7 Installer does not find them, How do I install Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    I recently recieved some used computer parts from a friend. These parts are Window7 compatable as he was running the RC on them before he sent them to me. When I got them, I added my Power supply, Case, IDE Hard Drives and CD/<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>DVD
</span><span>Burners</span></span></a>.<br />
<br />
When I had everything wired up and in the case, I was able to get it to power up, but when Windows 7 Ultimate got to the point where it is supposed to install on a Hard Drive, it didn't recognize either of the two drives in the tower.<br />
<br />
Current Configuration:<br />
<br />
1- 320 Gig WD Caviar Blue IDE (Master)<br />
1- 160 Gig WD Caviar Blue IDE (Slave)<br />
1- HP CD/DVD RW Burner<br />
1- Sony CD/DVD R Burner<br />
<br />
1- MSI PT890-Neo V motherboard<br />
2- 1 Gig Crucial <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</span></a><br />
<span>1- Graphics card (uncertain as to info as I am not where I can check it)<br />
<span>1- Graphics card (uncertain as to info as I am not where I can check it)<br />
1- </span><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>PCI</span></span></a><span>
 USB card<br />
1- PCI Audio Card (uncertain as to info as I am not where I can check it)<br />
1- MSI Wireless adapter<br />
<br />
I originally had&nbsp;Windows XP</span><span>&nbsp;on the 160 Gig Hard Drive, but since I have changed out Mother Board, Graphics Card</span><span>, RAM, etc. that build of Windows XP will not function.<br />
<br />
I do not have a&nbsp;wired Keyboard</span><span>&nbsp;so I cannot reinstall from the Windows XP disk, and with my USB Keyboard I can install the&nbsp;Windows 7</span><span>&nbsp;Disk, but if Windows 7 does not recognize my INTERNAL IDE
 drives, I cannot install that!<br />
<br />
What am I to do? Can anyone help me trouble shoot Windows 7 refusing to recognize my Hard Drives when booting from Install CD.<br />
<br />
My Windows 7 CD is Windows 7 Ultimate, Full Version.</span>

            Have found out true problem.... IDE Channel on Motherboard has died.<br />
<br />
Solution I used to get Windows 7 installed:<br />
<br />
Place 320Gig HDD as Master and HP CD/DVD Burner as Slave on the functioning IDE channel.<br />
<br />
Installed Windows 7. <br />
<br />
I am now waiting for PCI IDE to arrive so I can install all HDD and CD drives on computer.<br />
<br />
BIOS does accept PCI IDE...&nbsp; :)<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help and support on this matter.

<p>This is the link that you want (need) as of 6/5/17, choose between the 32bit (x86) or the 64bit (x64) or just install both if you have a 64bit (x64) based system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hint: The 32 bit is the most commonly used for app and program development as it will run on both 32bit and 64bit PC's.</p>

 will be the most likely one that you will need, even if you are using a 64bit system, however, if the app that needs the file to run was developed for a 64bit OS only then you will need the 64bit version. You can install both versions on a 64bit system as
 a 64bit system will run both 32bit and 64bit apps and/or programs.</p>
