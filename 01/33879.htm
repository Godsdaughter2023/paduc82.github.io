            Hi,<br />
I would recommend posting that message in the Tech Net forum where professionals go to find community answers. Also, you may want to do a search on the file you are looking for. I didn't see any mentions on official MS sites, but there are hits out there...I
 just can't advise them.<br />
Hope this helps,<br />
Eddie B.<br />

<h2>            Windows 7 &#43; DLNA &#43; &#34;Play to&#34; not in context menu...</h2>
                    <div>I have a device which is DLNA compliant and supports DMR mode to allow media to be pushed on to it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The Windows 7 PC detects the device under the network plane. Showing that a media renderer has been detected as an icon labelled,
<b>10.0.0.16 (Media Renderer)</b>. I can confirm that is the correct IP address and there is no problem accessing other services over protocols such as FTP, HTTP between the two devices (i.e. there is no network problems).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, when I look for the <u>play to</u> item menu under a media files context menu / in the stream menu of WMP, I can not see 10.0.0.16 as an available device (no devices listed / available). I can confirm that the media file that I'm trying to play,
 can play in WMP, i.e. all required CODECs are already installed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone have any further suggestions how I can debug this problem, or know of any tools which can help debug this problem?</div>
                </div>

<h2>            Windows server 2012 enable firewall logging</h2>
                    <p>Windows Server 2012 Essentials</p>
<p>Windows Firewall with Advanced Security.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a web server, though when I initially installed it, it desperately wanted to be a domain controller.&nbsp; I think I effectively broke it's will, but...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow, I want to log all incoming and outgoing firewall activity.&nbsp; I can see in the firewall app that There is a log file, but that dropped packets and successful connections are both NOT LOGGED.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If only there was a little gray checkbox there to EFFING TURN IT ON!</p>
<p>
</p><p>But alas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen lots of discussion about going into the Group Policy thing and setting firewall settings there, but unless it's hidden 12 levels deep,
<strong>there are no firewall settings in GPO</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen solutions that involve setting Registry entries under "WindowsFirewall" but my registry has no such key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been notified by my network people that they suspect someone is getting into my server and doing nefarious things, but without a log, who the hell knows what is happening?</p>
<p>
</p><p>the question: How do I log all incoming and outgoing firewall activity with <strong>
source:port and destination:port</strong>, so I can tell if I am being hacked???</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><div>Windows 10 will run on a PC with AMD/Intel Hybrid (Switchable) graphics.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Since Sony has confirmed that you might face BSOD with AMD/Intel Hybrid (Switchable) Graphics SVE14A* computer model. I would suggest you to disable one of the graphic card driver and then try upgrading to Windows 10 and check.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>For disabling one of the graphic card&nbsp;follow the steps .</p>
<p>
<span><span><strong>Uninstall the Device Drivers</strong></span></span><span> :
</span>
</p><p><span><span>a) Press “Windows Logo” + “X” keys on the keyboard.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b) Click on “Device Manager” from that list.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c) Search for the Graphics Card device from the device list, right click on it and then select “Uninstall”. On the un-installation window, if you have
 an option: “Delete the driver software for this device” you may select that and then remove the corrupted drivers from the computer.</span></span></p>
<span>d) Follow the on-screen instructions to complete it and the restart the computer if prompted</span>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>
<p>Reply us back with the update of the issue.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi Akheel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I uninstalled both graphics drivers (1 at a time) and both times the installation of Windows 10 failed. The installation got to 75% and stalled (no HDD activity for over 2 hours).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankfully for bothfailed installation my original Windows 8.1 was restored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any next steps, please.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards</p>

            <p>That's not a solution, there is a reason why we buy a laptop with hybrid graphics, i would suggest you guys test your OS before you release it and kick everyone in the nuts with your buggy Windows 10.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If this fails and you have access to disable the other GPU then try that next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you get to the desktop then proceed as normal with the steps in first Wiki, pulling in all Windows Updates until no more are offered, then check Device Manager to import any missing or erroring (with a ! mark) drivers.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Watch closely how stable the graphics remain during and after this because some reports are that Windows Update forces drivers that destabilize the switchable graphics.&nbsp;

            Hi Fndrb, I am Rob, an independent and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. Please remember as independents we are not responsible for the development of Windows or the computer hardware and drivers. If you will work with me I will be here to help until the issue is resolved.
<br /> 
<br />What program are you trying to RUN?
<br />
<br />Some programs will not properly install from RUN so try using SAVE. If that works then use File Explorer to navigate to where you saved the program's installer and then Right Click on the file and select "Run as Admin".
<br />
<br />If needed, since it is a new HP contact their support. As OEM HP is responsible for the proper operation of the hardware and Windows. So regardless of the cause it is theirs to resolve. 
<br />
<br />Also, if that is a 3rd party app (not Microsoft or HP's) then you should contact the program developer's support.

            Download speed depends on several factors, many outside of your control. 
<br />
<br />It is ALWAYS better to SAVE files before running them.  If you RUN it during the download, if there is an interruption, the isntall has to back out.  Then you have to do the download all over again. Ultimately, it is safer and faster to SAVE first, then run the file.

<p>Thanks, Sumit!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try to keep an eye open for Edge to restore the Status Bar; without that, when I click on a link, I have no way of knowing if I actually
<em>didn't click</em> or the site is just&nbsp;very&nbsp;slow responding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did try to go back to Chrome to have access to the status bar, but it is no longer on Chrome, either - with lots of complaints over there, too!&nbsp;&nbsp;<em>I must have mis-remembered a Status Bar on Chrome from before I recently retired from work,</em> where
 I used IE, Chrome, <em>and </em>Firefox.</p>
<p>

    <title>Upgrade install of Window 10 fails. Drive locked. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Upgrade install of Window 10 fails. Drive locked.</h2>
                    <p>Hello all.</p>
<p>I am having major trouble with the free upgrade to Win 10 Pro from Win 7 Pro. This would be my second machine to do this to. My first was a Dell Studio XPS 1640 that came with Win Vista Pro 64 and was upgraded to Win 7 Pro 64 through Microsoft Store. The
 only trouble I had with that install was with self activation that was fixed through the contact support app after a 72 hour wait.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows Support seems to be at a loss with this so far as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This Machine:</p>
<p>Dell Precision M4700</p>
<p>Intel Core i7 3840QM @2.8 GHz</p>
<p>16 GB installed RAM</p>
<p>Genuine and activated Win 7 Pro 64-bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to complete the upgrade through the "Get windows 10" app and Windows Update. The download and beginning phase seems to go normally then after the "Loading Files" bar completes the system goes to a Keyboard layout selection screen. I select US
 and get to a "Choose and option" Screen with Troubleshoot and a Turn off your PC choice screen.</p>
<p>If the turn off option is selected and the computer restarted, Win 7 Pro starts normally. To return to Win 10 install you have to go through the Windows Upgrade download all over again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the "Choose and option" Screen Troubleshoot and Turn off PC &nbsp;during the upgrade process, and select Troubleshoot and any "System Restore&gt;Keep my files" or "Remove everything" options I get the error "The drive where Windows is installed is locked. Unlock
 the drive and try again." message. System Image recovery options give error windows as does Startup Recovery options. Using comand prompt, Diskpart and chkdsk will run but no disk is found to analyze and is running on X: at the command prompt.</p>
<p>Some research lead me to copy all boot files from the System Reserved E: Healthy (System, Active, Primary Partition) to Windows C: Healthy (Boot, Page File, Crash Dump, Primary Partition) then mark Windows C: as active. This allows the Win 10 upgrade to
 advance to Upgrading Windows Circle Graph screen to 29-30% and 100% of the Copying Files portion but after the subsequent restart the upgrade fails with the same errors as before changing active partition.</p>
<p>I would go to the comand prompt and change the active partition but only X: is seen by Diskpart and chkdsk so the upgrade needs to be aborted.
</p>
<p>One time after trying all the troubleshooting choices the Upgrading Windows Circle Graph screen came back up and proceeded through aprox. 33% total and an unknown %age of "Installing features and drivers". Then restarts and goes back to the "Choose and option"
 Screen. Throughout all of this it seems the "Go back to the previous build." choice gets me back to Win 7 Pro as I left it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get the upgrade app to recognize the Active and the Boot partitions as it did so easily on my first machine?<br />
Thanks in advance to all for any help.</p>
<p>Bud</p>

<p>Thanks for your information. I went through all of it and tried all that hadn't been done with support chat and others that made sense based on those suggestions through updating all drivers and firmware that I could find with no success. I tried at least
 10 times today using the media creation tool supplied on my desktop by support chat each time to the point of questioning the tool itself. Clean boot and everything else. Having to wait for the download each time is excruciating to find out if what you just
 tried is working this time. The search for corrections to sfc /scannow CBS log problems was the most difficult operation for me and in the end didn't yield any positive results.</p>
<p>I tried with my anti-virus disabled and uninstalled and got a browser hijacker right away with it uninstalled while I was looking for drivers and firmware. i ended up with it installed and waited till all downloading was completed and the start acceptance
 window was up to disable it. My next attempt was going to be with my upgrade added memory removed but in the end it was not necessary.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that I have no idea why but after 10 attempts the Windows 10 Upgrade installation finally completed and activated. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I wish I could tell you what component made the upgrade successful but I just can't. The only tips on what I did that I believe did the trick were. Try everything you can from others here until you get it to complete.</p>
<p>My first laptop completed on the first attempt with only some activation trouble, so this second one not going through right away threw me a little.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Clean Booting each time disabling anything that was not absolutely neccessary.</p>
<p>2. Updating all the drivers and firmware I could find including for items like the DVD+-RW drive.</p>
<p>3. Disabled in Device Manager a. Integrated MMC/SD controler and the IEEE 1394 Host Controler.</p>
<p>4. Using a bare minimum screen background rather than my custom backgrounds.</p>
<p>5. I am using AVG Free and waited till the last moment to disable it "until restart".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best of luck, wish I could be of more help.</p>

            <p>::UPDATE::</p>
<p>While I did get the installation of Win10 to complete, there are still major problems with the system. During any boot from off or sleep or reboot, the frowning face blue screen comes up saying "Inaccessable_Boot_Device". This adds a substantial amount of
 time to the boot up. I got one restart at the end of the install that seemed to be normal without any blue error screen. Now it seems the system restarts 2-3 times by itself and sometimes comes out of the problem and other times I have to manually shut it
 down. Just when I am ready to revert to my "Previous Version" it comes up good to the lock screen before the login screen.</p>
<p>I will copy the drive image at this point and try some different things but something isn't quite right. It acts like a corrupt install or a serious incompatibility of software issue.
</p>
<p>Remembering when my HP printer software was making the Win 7 hang for like 10-15 minutes on boot with a spinning circle over the network connection sys-tray icon before making some small adjustment to the spooler and network strings in the registry. Not
 the same but seems like a similar issue.</p>
<p>If I didn't have another machine running fine on Win 10 Pro, I would revert to my Win 7 image and forget about it as this has been anything but smooth and easy.</p>
<p>Frustrated but still trying. Another long day coming I feel.</p>

            <p>::UPDATE::</p>
<p>Well my patience is running very low for Win 10 on my primary machine. I have lost 3 full days to the madness on this one machine while a much older and less up to date Dell 1640 sailed right through the process. Yesterday as I tried several different "fixes"
 for this problem and watched Win 10 throw both "Inaccessable_Boot_Device" and "Unmountable_Boot_Volume" frownie face blue screens and multiple instances of various automatic repair and troubleshooting screens, trying boot repair proceedures from the recovery
 platform and cmd prompt, Win 10 just collapsed for good after trying a change of the SATA settings in the BIOS then with a hard failed boot reverting to the original BIOS settings a refusal to boot no matter what was tried. The revert to previous version and
 reset options failed midstream this time as well. Never did get a reliable boot up so didn't take an image of the Win 10 drive.</p>
<p>Back to my good o'l Win 7 image (so **** glad I have that) on this machine for now and doing a lot more research before trying Win 10 again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All I can really say is that Linux Ubuntu distros seem to do a much better job of install and hardware hurrdles than Win 10 for sure. I can even carry a live boot USB version &nbsp;around in my pocket that boots and finds/installs hardware, networks and printers
 with ease on multiple machines. </p>
<p>Hmmm, why is Win 10 so difficult?</p>

            <p>Ok, </p>
<p>I ran a live version of Linux tools and used Gparted as Fdisk wasn't getting the job done for some reason, and deleted all the partitions and reformatted the HDD with a single partition&nbsp;to NTFS just to wipe everything off of it before restoring my Win 7
 Pro 64 bit image. </p>
<p>I put on my patience hat and started over. I got back to the point of an installed but sick Win 10 install by doing&nbsp;the following again before install.</p>
<p>1. Update Nvidia Drivers. (not completely deleted first, explanation to come)</p>
<p>2. Installed all Dell searched by service tag drivers. (not completely deleted first).</p>
<p>3. Clean boot set from msconfig.exe (google it)</p>
<p>4. Disabled AVG Free 2015 (until restart)</p>
<p>5. Started Upgrade from the Media Creation Tool placed on my desktop by support chat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The installation went through from start to&nbsp;finish but&nbsp;was still very sick and&nbsp;unstable unlike my other upgraded laptop.&nbsp;After the install, every time I restarted, cold booted or resumed from sleep I would get a blue, Frownie Face screen with one of 3 error
 messages in most frequent order.</p>
<p>1. Inaccessible_Boot_Device 80% of the time.</p>
<p>2. Unmountable_Boot_Volume 18 % of the time.</p>
<p>3. DPC_Watchdog_Violation 2% of the time.</p>
<p>Each time the computer would go through and auto reboot and then a Diagnosing your Computer screen then a blue keyboard language screen. I would try the Boot Repair and sometimes some other options before using the Turn Off Computer option. After which the
 computer would boot to the lock screen. Hmmm.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each time I would search out the fix for the error and tried many different things. A google search for the DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION error found a you tube video from PC Helper, Here
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GY-laVVzdA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GY-laVVzdA</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/7GY-laVVzdA?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/7GY-laVVzdA?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>
<p>
</p><p>that made things about 75% better but didn't fix it entirely. Basically you go to
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Control Panel&gt;Power Options&gt;Choose what the power buttons do&gt;Change settings that are currently unavailable&gt;and Uncheck the Turn on fast startup option".
</p>
<p>Much more stabile after this and without the Frownie face page it would boot much faster anyway.
</p>
<p>On restarts I would still get Inaccessible_Boot_Device or Unmountable_Boot_Volume randomly almost every time but on cold boot or return from sleep the system would seem to&nbsp;boot normally.</p>
<p>I went back to Dell and allowed them to again automatically search for drivers with Win 10 installed. found one additional tagged for Win 10&nbsp;for Intel Management Engine Components&nbsp;"Chipset_Driver_KFR45_WN32_11.0.0.1153_A00." and installed.</p>
<p>Went to both Intel and Nvidia and found Win 10&nbsp;drivers for the Intel(R) HD Graphics 4000 and one for the Nvidia Quadro K1000M Display Drivers at each of those sites all for Win 10 pro&nbsp;64 bit&nbsp;and downloaded those items and subsequently installed them.</p>
<p>Problem was much the same at that point and&nbsp;I was suspecting the HGST HDD Drivers or firmware even though it passed every test I could find to run on it. I still had the Seagate drive that came installed to try.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then on one of the sites I was reading while&nbsp;researching the remaining two errors I found an entry that explained how each driver needed to be
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Completely Uninstalled</span> </em>and how to do it through Device manager rather than just installing the updated driver over the old one. Wish I could find the site to give a link&nbsp;but now I can't by searching the
 web or my history but the main points follow. Use them at your own risk, I take no responsibility whatsoever for the&nbsp;source of this information or knowing if it will work for you or won't but here goes in the order I used on my Dell Precision M4700&nbsp;right or
 wrong.</p>
<p>1. Make sure you have the correct (32 vs 64 bit) drivers&nbsp;pre downloaded, unzipped and in an accessible place, like&nbsp;on your desktop.</p>
<p>2. Go to Device manager, open up the&nbsp;device plus sign, (For me Display Drivers)&nbsp;and right click the first one in line. (For Me was Intel(R) HD Graphics 4000) and click Uninstall. At the warning dialogue click yes.&nbsp;Your screen will flicker and may change
 resolution and generally look wrong to you.</p>
<p>3. Shut down the computer till you hear the HDD stop rotating or cold stop. The drivers will not install until you restart or cold stop boot.</p>
<p>4. Boot the computer up and as quickly as possible find and install the drivers for that device. Windows will "Find" the device and try to install the old drivers pretty quickly so be ready on the boot up. Or you could go to the folder of the current drivers
 and empty it. You may or may not be asked to restart the computer. I said no and&nbsp;went to a cold stop each time I was asked.</p>
<p>5. Repeat&nbsp;steps 1-4&nbsp;for, (In my case&nbsp;the NVIDA Quadro K1000M) Display Adapter or whatever driver you need to replace.</p>
<p>The INVIDA and Intel drivers seem to be the biggest problems to both the install and running of Win 10 for my M4700.</p>
<p>The computer now seems to be doing much better and runs quite snappy.&nbsp;I only had one blue Frownie screen after uninstalling an unwanted program and allowing the system to restart by itself. So far if I initiate a restart, shutdown or sleep the computer starts
 correctly each time from those states&nbsp;so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am enjoying Win 10 so far now that it seems to be working correctly. it seems most of my Win 7 programs run well on it with the exception of my Sidebar but I will wait until someone comes up with a suitable "Live Tile" type solution. The solutions I have
 found don't seem to work at all on my install. My priority programs seem to work well so that is a plus.</p>

<h2>            Redeemed game doesn&#39;t appear anywhere</h2>
                    <p>I've recently redeemed a game with a code I've wait near on 24 hours and the game still hasn't appeared in my library or in my ready to install, and the store isn't saying that I've redeemed it even though I've typed in the code correctly. Isn't there anyway I can get my game or was it a waste of a redeem code?</p>

Was it for a game/version of a game&nbsp;that's only playable on Windows 10?<br /><br />Please click the "Message" button with the envelope&nbsp;icon&nbsp;under my name and send us the 5x5 code so we can take a closer look into this with you.

<p><strong>Community Moderator Susan Bradley (I don't work for Microsoft)&nbsp;with a community&nbsp;edit:</strong></p>
 of this InfoWorld article - it's the dropbox link&nbsp; </strong></em><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/0u0au9xgy6ss18p/win10fix_full.zip?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">https://www.dropbox.com/s/0u0au9xgy6ss18p/win10fix_full.zip?dl=0&nbsp; which
 is also referred to&nbsp;in the article below:</span></a></p>
<p><a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/2932192/microsoft-windows/how-to-remove-or-acquire-the-windows-10-free-copy-icon.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.infoworld.com/article/2932192/microsoft-windows/how-to-remove-or-acquire-the-windows-10-free-copy-icon.html
</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Instructions to run the tool:</p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Go to <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/0u0au9xgy6ss18p/win10fix_full.zip?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>2. Copy the win10fix_full.bat file to anywhere else like desktop.</p>
<p>3. Right click the file and click run as administrator.</p>
<p>4. Follow the screen instruction until to come to main menu screen.</p>
<p>5. On main menu screen do step 1 first and check if you go the updates installed and then press any key it will take you back to main menu.</p>
<p>6. Now do step 2 which only takes like 1 second and should have the icon in the task bar.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Please note this tool is not officially from Microsoft is not sanctioned by them
</strong></em><strong><em>but it has been reviewed by me, is not malicious and certainly makes it easier to get the process done.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional comments by another poster that may help explain what's going on:</p>
<p>"When you run the batch file, upon clicking Selection 1, it not only checks that update KB3035583 is installed, but also KB 2952664.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Selection 2 (<strong>Quick Method #1</strong> [JC from answers.microsoft.com]) which updated the registry is what fixed it for me instantly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Selection 3 (<strong>Quick Method #2</strong> [KevinStevens_845]) tries the GWX task, and says it could take up to 10 minutes for the icon to show up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Selection 4 (<strong>Long Method #1</strong> (Yaqub K's method)] says it could take from 10 to 40 or so minutes, and will continually loop, that is normal, but you shold keep seeing 'RUNNING' as it loops, and you may have to run Selection 4 (Yaqub's method)
 again for it to kick in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ALSO, when you finally get the box to enter your email address for your confirmation, you may have to wait 5-10 minutes for it to arrive. Mine said "Congratulations on reserving your free upgrade to Windows 10" in the subject line."</p>

            <p>There is an easy way to upgrade to Win10 without bothering with getting the icon back. Here is the post about using the Media Creation Tool to upgrade to Windows 10.</p>

<p><strong><span>Hi tetrish60,</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I would suggest you to check for the exact location of the picture on the hard drive rather than from the picture
 library and then try setting it as a background and check if this works. </span>
</strong></p>
<p><strong><span><br />
You can find the exact location of the file on the hard drive by right clicking the file in library and checking for the path under properties. The picture file might be present in the user’s folder on hard drive under</span></strong><strong><span>my
 pictures</span></strong><strong><span> folder.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this helps.</span></span></p>

            <p>Hi HFadli,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't know your system, but assume the answer is quite simple. I have the same "problem" and found out, that this update does not fix every IE-version.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft published Internet Explorer 10 and the fix&nbsp;at the same day via automatic download.&nbsp;Our brand new IE 10 was installed before the IE 9 update. Therefore, we don't need it if you are running a Windows 7 operating system too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See "<strong>Non-Affected Software". </strong>You can read about it here (at the end of the table):</p>

            <p>While I'm sure we appreciate your enthusiasm, please stop posting this, Matthias: You're just unnecessarily&nbsp;confusing people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If IE10 is already-installed, KB2809289 will NOT be offered to the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If IE9 is installed, you run a manual check for updates and find that KB2809289
<em>and IE10 </em>are offered &amp; you choose to install IE10, you won't be able to install KB2809289 nor will it be offered again as long as IE10 is installed.</p>

            <p>Hello PA Bear,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is confusing? Please read my answer again.</p>
<p>You have probably not understood the problem. I am not writing about theory. I got both updates -&nbsp;the IE 9 fix and the IE 10 installation&nbsp;&nbsp;via automatic update today - no manual updating!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT: But right, it is possible to select both parts, although only one should do it. And that has been, what happened to the other users too, I think. Sorry, if I wasn't clear about that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both updates should have been installed at the same time, but since IE 10 installation obviously started first, the IE 9 fix failed, because&nbsp;there was no IE 9 available on the system&nbsp;anymore.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So please guys, check if that answer works for you too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BR</p>
<p>Matthias</p>

    <title>A lot of Mass Effect 3 new details revealed at Gamescom - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            A lot of Mass Effect 3 new details revealed at Gamescom</h2>
                    
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>The CE Robot dog is possible to interact with aboard the Normandy, like having it follow you around, play fetch and it apparently has a story to it. No details on whether it’s combat able or not though.
</li><li>Character creator will get a lot more hair styles and facial features in ME3. So expect the hairstyles from the femShep competition to make it into the CC.
</li><li>They are considering an Uber achievement for all three games. What that is exactly is they don’t know, but they want to reward their long term fans.
</li><li>All squad mates will get their story and closure for ME3 even if they might not be a permanent squad member.
</li><li>We’ll see more of the Yahg (The former Shadow Broker) </li><li>Not loyalty of people, but loyalty of races. Less focus on building loyalty with squad members and more on the various races. So expect previous loyalty and decisions to play a part in this.
</li><li>XP system goes back to ME1. No details but they won’t do the mission summary XP from ME2.
</li><li>The fate of the squad mates will not always be up to the player and decisions that feels right can prove to be harmful.
</li><li>The banter will be increased significantly since the squad member group is smaller this time.
</li><li>The ending of ME3 will give closure to the trilogy so don’t expect answers on post ME3 DLC until the game is out.
</li><li>There will not be an SDK after Mass Effect 3. </li><li>Joker EDI romance is being “looked at”. </li><li>Aside from the Krogan princess, we will apparently not see female counterparts of turians, salarians and so on in ME3 either.
</li><li>Mods for ME2 has to be remade for ME3. </li><li>Thane is still alive in ME3. (if he survived Collector Base) </li><li>Kelly Chambers will return. </li><li>Romance between Joker and Shepard is a case of “you have to play it to see it”
</li><li>If Hammerhead or Mako returns it’s closer to critical path missions. Don’t expect exploration using these vehicles.
</li><li>The Normandy will be upgraded by the Systems Alliance, so resource gathering for the ship is not likely this time.
</li><li>The geth quarian conflict will be concluded. </li><li>Existing music from ME1 and ME2 will make its way into ME3. </li><li>Side quests will pretty much always be in line with the critical path story. </li><li>Classes will get new powers with up to six different ways to customize each power
</li><li>Squad mates appearances and armor will be possible to customize again. </li><li>Seems Cerberus will be a full blown antagonist and not possible to align with in ME3.
</li><li>They have DECIDED about whether you’ll get to see Tali’s face or not. </li><li>There may be time sensitive story elements though it will be more focused ones like the Normandy crew.
</li><li>ME3 will make you cry! </li><li>There will be a larger variety of environments compared to ME2. </li><li>Heavy melee will pretty much always kill a target, but defensive factors like armor, barriers and shields will affect the outcome. Also don’t try to melee an Atlas mech.
</li><li>There will be mini games though no announcements. </li><li>We may see Quarians without masks. Whether that would include Tali or not was left unsaid.
</li><li>The choices you make in the trial at the beginning of ME3 will set the tone for the future in the game
</li><li>James Vega’s voice actor will be announced really soon and is apparently a closely guarded secret, since he’s really awesome.
</li><li>Indoctrination seem to play a role in ME3, possibly including party members. </li><li>Kal’Reegar will return in ME3. </li><li>They are discussing possibilities of missions that ties back to your background choice for Shepard.
</li><li>You have a lot more romance options in ME3. Possibly not limited to party members.
</li><li>You will be able to change class if you import your ME2 Shepard to ME3. Though you will have to start from Lvl 1 while kept class will get Import+ perks.
</li><li>Legion will return with a larger role in ME3. </li><li>There may be a ‘special’ import for saves where Shepard died. The interest is clearly too big for them to simply ignore such a treat.
</li><li>Miranda will be back and has unfinished business with Shepard. </li><li>Shepard’s SPECTRE status will play part in ME3 and change things if you had the status reinstated in ME2.
</li><li>Conrad Verner’s back. </li><li>Normandy will be the SR-2 with an Alliance paint and some redesigned interiors. Joker will apparently be happy with it.
</li><li>How many team mates you speak to at the same time aboard the Normandy depends on the context of the missions.
</li><li>You’ll have debriefings after each mission that are deeper than ME2, but you are still likely to only talk to the squad mates one on one outside of that.
</li></ul>

<p>Crimini!! Talk about sensory overload, man!</p>
<p>The Yarg, eh? Can't wait to see more of these wonderful species. Loved the last one I met, heh.</p>
<p>Anyway, what's this about a robot dog? WANT! Is it only for the collector's edition? I don't fancy buying one for the Xbox 360 from Australian retailers, which would undoubtedly fetch way over the $179 price mark- which is madness!</p>
<p>Perhaps you should edit the title with a possible spoilers warning? Nevertheless, much is appreciated though, bro! Thanks man!</p>

<p>Very happy with everything (especially the removal of the end mission summary) aside from the idea of seeing Quarians without their masks... more to the point; Tali.</p>
<p>A good sci-fi should retain some mystery in some of it's story elements and characters. Boba Fett used to be cool until you found out he was just a whiny kid who was sad because his father died.</p>

<p>I know how you feel fuzzyearlobes lol I don't want to miss out on the robot dog as well! I was super pumped to read about all of these details and I'm dripping with anticipation to play this game and find closure to this trilogy.
</p>
<p>I am a little miffed by redesigning of the Normandy....I hope they don't change too much because I want to serve another tour of duty and open a can on the reapers from the same ship I am so used too from Mass Effect 2. I already know the layout and it would
 just feel better to be on the same ship as opposed to a ship that's all different again. *shrugs*</p>

 for Hardware Assisted Virtualization Techology, there are three items you need to run to get XP mode working:&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/download.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/download.aspx</a>.&nbsp; Select your Windows version and language.&nbsp; Three items will appear that you need to install (if you have the chip installed,
 you only need the first two items installed for Step 3).</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps,</span></p>
<p><span>Barbara&nbsp;</span></p>

            I purchased the Windows 7 Professional upgrade yesterday, and it is installed. I went to the download site to get the XP feature, and I cannot get it downloaded. It validates my copy of windows, then the popup blocker appears (IE), and I check 'download'
 file, then there is a message in the bottom bar saying something is downloading, but it is a *.jpg file, then within seconds, the bar says 'DONE.' I have no idea what to try next. I have already rebooted my computer. Thank you

<p>I am having the excact same problem as is being described... I go to the Microsoft site to download Windows XP Mode, and after I select Professional 64 bit and english, 3 download buttons appear.</p>
<p>I click the first one, it validates Genuine Microsoft Software, then the download blocked shows and I click it and select download.</p>
<p>All that happens is a fast 'download' and then says done. Really nothing downloaded.</p>
<p>Is there a solution to this?</p>

            I have a similar problem. I have a new computer with Windows 7 64 Pro. When I click on the "Print" insructions button, it just reverts to the previous page. When I click on the "Download" button, it validates, then reverts to the previous page. Could this
 be a Java issue?

<h3> clementgoh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer&#39;s startup issues</h2>
                    <p>So basically 2 qns</p>
<p><strong>1)Upon start up recently my computer (Window 8 Asus)</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;-the desktop is black</p>
<p>(No Icons, no task bar and nothing at the side *Only mouse is available*)</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now what im doing to overcome this is open Task manager, either restart or end task for the window explorer and then click new task explorer.exe and then my desktop, task bar and everything will show up again. (This is ok but its pretty annoying to have
 to keep doing it again every time i turn on my computer. so is there a way i can make them standard again like i turn on my com and the desktop and all just show up normally.)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2) How to reset my computer without erasing all my files.</strong></p>
<p>So before i found out how to do all those things to get around my problems in the 1st qns, I came across this thing where i can reset my computer's setting or sth without erasing all my files. which is to like on the computer in Save mode and then click
 the reset stuffs and then i enter my details then click next then another issue appeared. it says "Window's drive is locked unlock it before coming back" or sth along the lines of that. which i've heard i need to go to my command area type all the list disk,
 select disk and then list partition part then well as u can tell i didn get far and ended up seeing another problem cos all my partition(I've 7 in total some saying primary,recovery and sth else i forgot) in the disk 0 is like not the correct one or sth so
 i can enter the code to active it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So maybe some one can help with the qns 2 so i can do that in the future at my ease but
<strong>main priority is going to qns 1 so i can solve that issue and not have such a hassle every time i login to my computer &nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>*Also on a side note some of my other stuff weren't working right also for one my Window Media Player wasn working but i've fix that to become permanent so no issues there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much in advance</p>

            <p>Hi Shivam,</p>
<p>Thank you so much for the reply. To start off, answering the 1st few qns</p>
<p><strong>Have you recently made any changes on your computer, prior to the issue?</strong></p>
<p>Prior to this issue, I have remembered that my computer required to update itself so that happened. Also regarding a game that I was playing Cardfight Area had it had a DDoS attack which I did restarted my computer and then the issues started happening(*Do
 note that I have been playing Cardfight Area for quite some time with no issues until the recent DDos Attack on the sever however that’s been fix now and the game is running smoothly). However, Prior to all of that, the 1<sup>st</sup> few signs of my computer
 having some issues is that whenever I would login, there would be a light blue covering over my whole computer screen (All features worked fined except that it required some loading before any of the things I clicked opened which only after awhile, the blue
 screen would lift and then computer speed were back to normal.)</p>
<p><strong>Are you getting any error message or code during Windows startup?</strong></p>
<p>Nope none what so ever.</p>
<p><strong>What is the complete model number of your computer?</strong></p>
<p>Asus NoteBook Model: S551L</p>
<p><strong>Have you recently installed any security application on your computer?</strong></p>
<p>Prior to the game that I was playing, it required to unzip their files which required me to either have WinRar or the recent one I downloaded, WinZip(Standard things that I needed to do per each new update) (Game now is working fine as usually so yea)</p>
<p><strong>Have you recently installed any Windows Update?</strong></p>
<p>Yes as mentioned at the top. With searching the update history, there is</p>
<p>Windows defender –KB2267602 25/1/2015</p>
<p>Security Update for Internet Explorer Flash play for Window 8.1 for x64-Lased System KB3033408 (Failed 25,24,23,21/1/2015).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for What i did afterwards, i followed your instructions&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Clean Boot: </strong>Followed the instructions and then disabled all the enabled items in the start up. Then was prompt to restart computer to apply all the new changes which I did. However, after turning on the computer again, screen is still black.</li><li><strong>SFC scan</strong>: results where <strong>Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them. Details are included in the CBS.Log&nbsp;</strong><strong><var>%WinDir%</var></strong><strong>\Logs\CBS\CBS.log.&nbsp;</strong>however,
 when following the instructions to enter the code </li></ol>

<h3> rjordan393  say:</h3>
<h2>            Defragging a partition drive &#40;D drive&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I can defrag C drive but when I try to defrag&nbsp;D drive, I get an incomplete error message that says:</p>
<p>"Not enough.........." and the process fails. My D drive which is a partition shows that it is over 44% fragmented.</p>
<p>I have Vista installed and it does not allow me to see the files on&nbsp;D drive but I do know it contains the recovery files. But I think there may be files added to this drive by mistake. I was able to defrag D drive just a few times when my computer was new.</p>
<p>How do I fix this problem?</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Do not bother defragging the Recovery Partition and in fact it can cause issues. There is absolutely<br />
no real&nbsp;benefit to defragging D: . The drive has to have enough space to support the defrag operation<br />
which is the other problem <strong>IF </strong>it needed to be or should be defragged neither of which is the case.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps and Happy Holidays!<br />
<br />
<br />

<p>Hi JlaHills,</p>
<p>Make sure that you have logged in as an administrator and check if you are facing the issue.</p>
<p>Let us try to take ownership of a drive and check if the issue is resolved.</p>
<p><strong>To take ownership of a drive:</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Right-click the drive that you want to take ownership of, and then click Properties.
<br />
2.&nbsp;Click the Security tab, click Advanced, and then click the Owner tab.<br />
3.&nbsp;Click Edit.&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
4.&nbsp;Click the name of the person you want to give ownership to.<br />
5.&nbsp;If you want that person to be the owner of files and subfolders in this folder, select the Replace owner on subcontainers and objects check box.<br />
6.&nbsp;Click OK.</p>
<p>If that does not work, I would suggest you to enable the <strong>built in</strong> administrator account and check if it is working.</p>
<p>An administrator account is a user account that lets you make changes that will affect other users. Administrators can change security settings, install software and hardware, and access all files on the computer. Administrators can also make changes to
 other user accounts.</p>
<p>If you are logged in as an administrator then I would suggest you to enable the built in user account and check if it is working.</p>
<p>In Windows Vista, the built-in administrator account is disabled by default. In previous versions of Windows, an Administrator account was automatically created during Out-of-Box-Experience (OOBE) with a blank password.</p>
<p>An Administrator account with a blank password is a security risk. To better protect the system, the built-in Administrator account is disabled by default in all clean installations and upgrades of Windows Vista.</p>
<p><strong>HOW TO: Enable the build-in Administrator account in Windows Vista</strong><br />

            <p>What game was it that you purchased? &nbsp;The Xbox system uses codes that are 25 characters in length. &nbsp;You should either double check the card the code came with to see if there's another site you need to enter it on or return the game to the store for an exchange.</p>
