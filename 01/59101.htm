<h2>            What the power button and closing the lid does</h2>
                    when trying to choose what pressing the power button or closing the lid does, my option is locked on "sleep" i can't choose anything else, is there something missing from windows or do i have to install something for it to work?

            <p>You need to disable the Samsung utility "Fast start".&nbsp; It is managing some of your power options for you [there is no problem with disabling it as it's doing nothing for you that you cannot do yourself].</p>
<p>Note - one user said a while ago that "Fast start" had been renamed so you might need to check the correct name in your manual or by looking in the Samsung folders within All programs.</p>

            I read somewhere that you should be able to restore but I cannot find a restore point before Windows 10 upgrade.&nbsp; Perhaps you might try to restore to when your internet worked?

    <title>Poor, Poor Cortana - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Poor, Poor Cortana</h2>
                    <p>Cortana gets accused of a lot of things. Some threads have called her "Paranoid" "A Waste" "Useless" and even (gasp) "Spyware."</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of this is actually true.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Objectively, that is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to whether or not these things are true SUBJECTIVELY for those who make these startling accusations I am willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and grant that they honestly believe what they say.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But let's take a look at the facts: First...is she SPYWARE?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, that depends on what you mean by "Spyware". If she IS she is certainly quite open about it.:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b61e21ef-6db8-425d-9fca-3646ce6f4205" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b61e21ef-6db8-425d-9fca-3646ce6f4205" /></a></p>
<p>As you can see from the above...she tells you everything she is keeping track of. And she gives you the option of clearing your history.</p>
<p>REAL spyware doesn't actually do either of those things. The whole point of Spyware being to track you without you knowing about it.</p>
<p>The reason Cortana needs to do this is the same reason a human personal assistant needs to get to know their boss. To be a more efficient assistant.</p>
<p>In time you will find she begins to respond to queries, searches, and so on as though she has known you for a long time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think that's a good thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>"But," you say. "I know how to run a search. I don't need her for that."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, quite frankly, neither do I and I usually run my own searches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But she can also open the programs on your device. INCLUDING your Third Party Apps like iTunes and the VLC Media Player and so on as well as all the Microsoft ones. And why should you get Carpal Tunnel Syndrome when you have a helper who can't?</p>
<p>
</p><p>She can also tell jokes, sing songs, answer questions.</p>
<p>The other day I asked her if she reported my personal information to the NSA and she replied "What if I answered a question with a question?"</p>
<p>See how informative that is? :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>And with Halloween coming up soon...you can always say "Hey Cortana, tell me a scary story!"</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f006cc9-b3ed-4ce6-a189-d819b6da9b95" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f006cc9-b3ed-4ce6-a189-d819b6da9b95" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, she is just a program like any other. She is not an AI...not yet. She couldn't pass the Turing Test.</p>
<p>But she makes a fun companion already.</p>

<h2>            windows 10 stops after a week or so</h2>
                    <p>I'm on my 3rd install of W10. After about a week following install W10 grinds to a halt and stops working. The only difference between my W8.1 and W10 installs is that I install W10 on a SSD drive. I also have a 2nd HD installed for programs and files. I
 did not have ACHI active in BIOS when I did the first 2 installs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could this lead to W10 stopping?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've activated it with the 3rd install and will see how things run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system is very plain otherwise, several years old but runs well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions to determine why 10 freezes up after a week or so is welcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>I'm replying to my own post to share what I think is the fix which fixed my issue with Windows 10 stopping after a week. It may very well be the SSD drive and that W10 did not recognize the SATA AHCI Controller in Device Manager. After running this simple
 fix all seems to be well.</p>

            Hi PickleRick420,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />There has been an ongoing issue with windows update servers. Many users worldwide have been reporting it.
<br />
<br />There is absolutely nothing wrong with your computer. 
<br />
<br />As a workaround, you can try to change your DNS to either Google DNS or Open DNS
<br />
<br />Windows Key+R &gt; Type ncpa.cpl and Enter &gt; Right click on your network &gt; Properties &gt; Select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/IPv4) &gt; Hit properties &gt; Make sure below ones are checked
<br />
<br />Google DNS
<br />Select Use the following DNS Server Addresses &gt; Preferred DNS Server - 8.8.8.8 &gt; ALternate DNS Server - 8.8.4.4
<br />OR
<br />Open DNS
<br />Select Use the following DNS Server Addresses &gt; Preferred DNS server : 208.67.222.222 &gt; Alternate DNS server : 208.67.220.220
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.
<br />

<p>Hello Rick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the others pointed out, it's a known issue for right now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can change your DNS server to use Google Public DNS for now as a workaround.</p>
<p>

<p>Have you tried reactivating by telephone?</p>
<p>Activate Windows 7 manually:<br />
1. Click Start, and in the Search box type :&nbsp; slui.exe 4<br />
<br />
2. Press ENTER on your Keyboard<br />
<br />
3. Select your Country.<br />
4. Select the Phone Activation option, and hold on for a real person.</p>
<p>Computers, which are built by large manufactures that come with Windows Pre-Installed, come with two (2) Product Keys:<br />
<br />
A)&nbsp;&nbsp; OEM SLP: This key comes pre-installed in Windows, when it comes from the Factory. This key is geared to work with the OEM Bios Flag found only on that Manufacturer's computer hardware. So when Windows was installed using the OEM SLP key (at the factory)
 Windows looks at the motherboard and sees the proper OEM Bios Flag (for that Manufacturer and that version of Windows) and Self-Activates. (that's why you did not need to Activate your computer after you brought it home)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; COA SLP: This is the Product key that you see on the sticker on the side (or bottom) of your computer. It is a valid product key, but should only be used in limited situations (sush as if the OEM SLP key stops self-activating for whatever reason). The
 key must be activated by Phone. (Note: All manufacturers that use the OEM SLP system are required by contract to include a Certificate of Authenticity (COA) sticker, that has a COA SLP key, on the computer)<br />
<br />
Your Windows is using an OEM SLP key, but (for whatever reason) cannot see the special instructions in the computer’s motherboard and is unable to Self-Activate.To fix the issue, you will need to change out the OEM SLP key with the COA SLP key.&nbsp; The normal
 way to do this is to click the ‘Start’ button, right-click ‘Computer’, select ‘Properties’ and then click ‘Change Product Key’ (located in the lower right-hand side of the window). Enter the COA SLP key and follow the instructions in the Change Product Key
 Wizard.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en/genuinewindows7/thread/da16dd03-502a-4b21-9c9f-24fd26497a51</p>

    <title>Windows 10 change from Tablet to Desktop view&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> douglasneal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 change from Tablet to Desktop view&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there, I installed Windows 10 on my tablet, and it started with the desktop type view. All very nice. I tried to add an account, clicked on switch user and now it is in Tablet/ Phone view with no discernable way to switch it back. The option to change
 user has now disappeared from my login screen so I can not go back and repeat the process.</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update - Settings, System, Tablet View. Now then Microsoft, let me explain what the word seamlessly means to people who exist in the real world - put a button next to the start button for change mode. Why was the option to change the way windows is displayed&nbsp;not
 under display? Its the display I want to change? Seriously, I am happy to pay for a product I can use, stop aiming your software at kids who can not afford to buy it and have the time so sit and play with it for hours. Damn bring back 3.11, think I have the
 floppy disks somewhere...</p>

<h2>            My hard drive is not seen in the file explorer</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm using Windows 7 (64).</p>
<p>I need to retrieve data's from an old hard drive WD5000AAJS.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>External connection:</strong></span></p>
<p>I first tried to connect it via an adapter USB/SATA</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fcd430f0-d610-4833-9a25-41cdcd66197d?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fcd430f0-d610-4833-9a25-41cdcd66197d?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>At the beginning my Windows 7 install the driver</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d546b364-b0df-476e-929b-7b95b68d3cf3?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d546b364-b0df-476e-929b-7b95b68d3cf3?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>but then I don’t see it in the file explorer.<br />
When I look in the devices, I can see it few seconds and then it disappear</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c62f546f-c014-4cd0-852d-044892054d29?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c62f546f-c014-4cd0-852d-044892054d29?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Internal connection:</strong></span></p>
<p>Then I tried to install it using my DVD drive connection.</p>
<p>There also, I don't see the hard drive in the file explorer.</p>
<p>However I can see it in the Bios</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/05cbc795-c1fb-4226-b73f-4ea62644dcdb?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/05cbc795-c1fb-4226-b73f-4ea62644dcdb?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>and in the device manager</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d2862677-5984-43da-a527-0d4018ec624f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d2862677-5984-43da-a527-0d4018ec624f?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Seems that I also see it in the disk management (disque 0) (but not with the correct size ??)</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ad0072b6-8701-4bce-a0db-c557214558fa?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ad0072b6-8701-4bce-a0db-c557214558fa?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Do someone know how to solve this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a nice week-end</p>

            The partitions on Disk 0 do not have recognised file system. It must be NTFS, FAT32 or FAT. Maybe the partitions were created on a non-Windows system.

<p>Windows 7 uses the same file systems as Windows 10. If the file systems are no longer recognised then something must have happened to the disk since you last used it. I would connect it to some Windows 7 machine in order to find out what is going on.</p>

<h2>            can someone get remote access to my computer....</h2>
                    Hi, someone phoned me today claiming to be from Window's, and said that my computer was sending them error messages - I knew it was a 'have' but I listened to what he was saying. &nbsp;He was asking me to go to 'my computer' and click on devices etc... (of
 course I did not do this), and after a minute or two of him saying a whole lot of things I need to be doing, he just said "you are my servant" and then hung up. &nbsp;My question is, can people through the phone line gain remote access to your computer, if your
 computer is switched on and on the internet when they call you - even though I did not click on anything/download anything etc... &nbsp;Many thanks.

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>This is likely a scam, there are several posts about this in the forums.&nbsp; There are several ways a person can gain remote access.</span></p>
<p><span>1. The user downloads a virus through a file or pic of an unknown sender.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>2. Through remote assistance ( this has to be verified by the owner of the computer first.&nbsp; I would advise
 you to never give out personal information to someone they don’t know especially over the phone.

<p>Hi, thanks for visiting Xbox Support! I'm Shawn M.

<p>Shawn M 

  </p>

<p>Hello! Who do I have the pleasure of speaking with today?

  </p>

<p>Me 

  </p>

<p>Bruce Williams

  </p>

<p>Shawn M 

  </p>

<p>Hi Bruce! How are you?

 

 

  </p>

<p>6:08 pm

<p>Me 

  </p>

<p>Furious

  </p>

<p>6:08 pm

  </p>

<p>Shawn M 

  </p>

<p>Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that! How may I help you?

 

 

  </p>

<p>6:08 pm

  </p>

<p>Me 

  </p>

<p>I am expecting resolution on Repair Order: # 1401876886

  </p>

<p>6:08 pm

  </p>

<p>Shawn M 

  </p>

<p>So you're inquiring about the Advanced Exchange?

 

 

  </p>

<p>6:10 pm

  </p>

<p>Me 

  </p>

<p>Yes, I am wondering why I was told 4-7 days and the device hasn't shipped yet even though my account was drafted that evening. And when I call I get told the order was cancelled

  </p>

<p>6:11 pm

  </p>

<p>Shawn M 

  </p>

<p>Reviewing the account it appears the order was cancelled, and the charge was refunded almost immediately after it was created. 

 

 

  </p>

<p>6:12 pm

  </p>

<p>Me 

  </p>

<p>I requested to speak to a supervisor and was then disconnected after 10 minutes.

  </p>

<p>6:12 pm

  </p>

<p>Me 

  </p>

<p>The amount has not been refunded there is no notice on the site as to why and I had not been notified at all about the cancellation!!!

  </p>

<p>6:13 pm

  </p>

<p>Me 

  </p>

<p>If I didn't call support to find out I wouldn't even know it was cancelled

  </p>

<p>6:13 pm

  </p>

<p>Shawn M 

  </p>

<p>I certainly understand, I am not seeing any reason the order was to be cancelled, only seeing the transactions for the hold and the fee say "refunded" and the repair order says "cancel complete", let me see if I can find any more info on it. 

  </p>

<p>6:15 pm

  </p>

<p>Me 

  </p>

<p>There was 2 orders, Repair Order: # 1401868796 . It didn't give me an ability to pay extra for expedited, so I contacted live support again, he cancelled Repair Order: # 1401868796 , did Repair Order: # 1401876886 and my account was drafted minutes later for $370

  </p>

<p>6:17 pm

  </p>

<p>Shawn M 

  </p>

<p>I do show he did cancel the original repair, although the advanced exchange shouldn't have been cancelled for any reason. Allow me to look into this further to find out what happened. 

 

 

  </p>

<p>6:19 pm

  </p>

<p>Me 

  </p>

<p>ok

  </p>

<p>6:19 pm

  </p>

<p>Shawn M 

  </p>

<p>I am still here, I am investigating as we speak!

 

 

  </p>

<p>6:22 pm

  </p>

<p>Me 

  </p>

<p>ok

  </p>

<p>6:23 pm

  </p>

<p>Shawn M 

  </p>

<p>So I am not seeing any reason that order should have cancelled, so what we'll need to do is wait and see if you receive anything by the 3rd of November, and if nothing is received by then, we will need to setup an escalation to at least get the hold removed. 

 

 

  </p>

<p>6:28 pm

  </p>

<p>Me 

  </p>

<p>Wait and see?

  </p>

<p>6:29 pm

  </p>

<p>Shawn M 

  </p>

<p>Correct, when it comes to Advanced exchanges, they cannot be cancelled normally, so we'll need to see if our service center will still go ahead and send out the console as the hold is still in place, or see if we can get the hold removed. 

 

 

  </p>

<p>6:30 pm

  </p>

<p>Me 

  </p>

<p>I've been waiting a week as of tomorrow, you want me to wait and see if I might received something a week from now and then escalate at that point?

  </p>

<p>6:31 pm

  </p>

<p>Shawn M 

  </p>

<p>As much as I would hate to have you wait longer, before we can start an investigation on it, we'll need to give it at least 10 business days since the order's creation. 

  </p>

<p>6:31 pm

  </p>

<p>Me 

  </p>

<p>which creation? the cancelled order?

  </p>

<p>6:32 pm

  </p>

<p>Shawn M 

  </p>

<p>Correct, the advanced exchange order that is showing as cancelled, just to see if they still go ahead with the order and send out the console or remove the hold. 

 

 

  </p>

<p>6:32 pm

  </p>

<p>Me 

  </p>

<p>not acceptable

  </p>

<p>6:32 pm

  </p>

<p>Shawn M 

  </p>

<p>I understand how you feel in this matter, however it is the best course of action. I have taken over the case the order was created under initially and will monitor what happens for the next week, if you still haven't received anything on or after the 3rd of the month, we'll need to setup an investigation to find out what happened. If we were to set it up now, and our service center did infact send the console, it may cause problems on completing the full exchange. \

 

 

  </p>

<p>6:36 pm

  </p>

<p>Me 

  </p>

<p>Imagine you bought a car, then the manufacturer tells you if you want to drive it on the street, they have to update it. Otherwise you can drive it in your yard. Then the update keeps the car from running at all. Then they say if you ship the car to Detroit, they may have it back in 2 weeks or so maybe.

 But, if you pay full price for a new car, they’ll ship it out, then you can swap later. Than right after they take your money, they cancel the order, don’t tell you at all. Then when you ask, you get no answers and let’s wait and see if maybe your car shows up, and then maybe it won’t. But let us know if it doesn't otherwise it may interfere with you getting your car anyways?

  </p>

<p>6:39 pm

  </p>

<p>Me 

  </p>

<p>So no, I don't thing you understand how I feel at all.

  </p>

<p>6:40 pm

  </p>

<p>Me 

  </p>

<p>I would like this escalated immediately. I would like a call from someone in a supervisory capacity to call me this evening. They already called me once before they hung up, they can do it again.

  </p>

<p>6:41 pm

  </p>

<p>Shawn M 

  </p>

<p>Sure I get where you're coming from, what I can do alternatively is have someone that higher than me monitor the case until the 3rd, and monitor what happens. When it comes to Advanced Exchange orders, we cannot touch the order or make any changes until at least 10 business days have passed, else if we were to send out a console or remove the hold, it may cause problems for the existing order. 

 

 

  </p>

<p>6:47 pm

  </p>

<p>Shawn M 

  </p>

<p>There's still the chance the console will still be sent out, as the hold is still in place as you mentioned. 

 

 

  </p>

<p>6:48 pm

  </p>

<p>Me 

  </p>

<p>So the bottom line is: my bank account was debited immediately NOT HELD (there is a difference), the order was cancelled on your end, somewhere. No one knows or can find the answer why. No one can tell if my order has shipped or not. Does that about sum up the situation?

  </p>

<p>6:49 pm

  </p>

<p>Shawn M 

  </p>

<p>You are correct, so we need to at least give it 10 business days since it was created to see if they go ahead and send out the console or refund the hold. 

 

 

  </p>

<p>6:50 pm

  </p>

<p>Me 

  </p>

<p>Or I can dispute the charge immediately

  </p>

<p>6:51 pm

  </p>

<p>Shawn M 

  </p>

<p>Yes you can dispute the charge, however doing so may cause other issues on the account's billing in the future. 

 

 

  </p>

<p>6:54 pm

  </p>

<p>Me 

  </p>

<p>I commend you for reading the company script. But you and I both know this is wrong. I switched from sony to xbox when they first came out 16 years ago. I will definitely be rethinking the PS4 vs scorpio This is shoddy service at best.

  </p>

<p>6:55 pm

  </p>

<p>Shawn M 

  </p>

<p>I'm sorry you feel that way, I have offered the best course of action in order to get this issue resolved, and have went ahead and handed the case to someone higher than me who will monitor it and contact you back by the 3rd to give further assistance and setup the investigation. 

 

 

  </p>

<p>6:57 pm

  </p>

<p>Me 

  </p>

<p>Sorry to take it out on you. But this is a violation of the mail order rule. It would be one thing if anyone knew if it had been shipped. But when I can't even get that answered while I'm out of my money.....wait and see doesn't cut it. A supervisory should be doing more than monitoring.

  </p>

<p>7:01 pm

  </p>

<p>Shawn M 

  </p>

<p>Once a console has been shipped, you will be provided the tracking info to your email, if no email is received by the third, We'll look into getting the hold refunded. 

 

 

  </p>

<p>7:02 pm

  </p>

<p>Me 

  </p>

<p>And I was told 4-7 working days. Tuesday is day 7. If I don't have it on Tuesday, Wednesday I will dispute the charge.

  </p>

<p>7:03 pm

  </p>

<p>Shawn M 

  </p>

<p>Normally once an order has been created, the console is sent out to be delivered within 4-7 business days, although this is an unusual case which we need to give more time. 

  </p>

<p>7:05 pm

  </p>

<p>Shawn M 

  </p>

<p>I hope I didn't lose you. Are we still connected?

  </p>

<p>7:08 pm

  </p>

<p>Me 

  </p>

<p>No I'm still here

  </p>

<p>7:09 pm

  </p>

<p>Me 

  </p>

<p>I am willing to give it more time. It needs to say shipped, by Wednesday morning.

  </p>

<p>7:10 pm

  </p>

<p>Shawn M 

  </p>

<p>I understand, I have advised of the specialist who now has this case of that. 

 

 

  </p>

<p>7:11 pm

  </p>

<p>Me 

  </p>

<p>Thank you, can you email me a copy of this chat?

    <title>Windows Defender &#34;Full Scan&#34; very slow but custom scan normal - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dr. michael williams  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Defender &#34;Full Scan&#34; very slow but custom scan normal speed</h2>
                    Running Windows 8.1 quad core machine with 8 GB of RAM. No memory problems, but if I run a full scan on Windows defender it takes over 2 days to complete with the file count jumping by 10's on the progress bar. However, if you choose custom scan and select
 all devices it completes in less than 2 hours and the file count jumps by hundreds on the progress bar. Also, selecting all the drives under a custom scan will reset the "Full Scan" timer so that the "needs a full scan" alert goes away. Not a fix, but definitely
 a work around.

            <p>I can confirm this issue. A full scan takes days, but if you select the <strong>
same</strong> drives to be scanned as a "custom scan", it is very fast and is completed in a few hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems like a bug in Windows Defender. I'm using Windows 8.1 x64. The issue is fully reproducable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In task manager during a "full scan" it shows ~20-30% CPU activity and a maximum of 0.9 MB/s hard drive activity (using a Samsung 840 SSD drive). The number of scanned files increases by just ~10-20 files/second.<br />
During a custom scan, it uses around 50-80% CPU and the hard drive activity goes up to 100 MB/s. The number of scanned files increases by a few thousands a second.</p>

            <p>Indeed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have exactly the same Problem on a brand new Surface Pro 3, without any Software installed other than Windows 8.1 with all updates done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Full Scan, 10-15 items/second.&nbsp; Custom Scan (select c:\) about 2000 items/ second.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, while my machine is inactive, ie. away from my desk, or idle, Defender starts scanning in the Background, and obviously ist using this slow full scan approach.&nbsp; My machine can literally sit there all day (I tested this on the Weekend 24+ hrs) at
 25-26% cpu&nbsp;with very very slow disk Access, below 1% on the Task manager.&nbsp; When I run a custom scan, select c:\ it runs at 49-55% cpu with 100% disk in the Task Manager and scan 500'000 files in about 10 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Drives me nuts, as the Fan on the Surface Pro 3 runs at full power the whole time, and as the machine warms up over time, it throtttles the CPU to 2.00 Ghz down from just over 2.5-2.6GHz normally in Bursts, so the Termal aspects of the machine are keeping
 temps in a normal range, but my fans run all day...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Weird....</p>

            <p>Yes, same here. I wish windows updates would release a&nbsp;fix for some of these annoying W8/8.1 problems instead of worrying about Lithuania joining the euro. Its good to know now about this custom option of checking every drive, I may be able to do a complete
 system scan after all. For the first time. Previously, after 10hrs or so, I looked at the resource moniter to see what it was scanning, and it was just stuck reading "Catroot" over and over again.<br />
As for the idle scans, the auto maintenance (TIWorker)&nbsp;kicks that off, daily, which is totally unnecessary. In the task scheduler, disabling the "Task Scheduler"&nbsp;tasks wont work, as the configurator will restart it. But, disabling the trigger will work. (On
 Regular and Idle Maintenance).&nbsp;You can leave the Manual Maintenance task enabled if you want to start it once a week or so yourself.</p>

            In a full scan Defender scans a lot more files and through a more critical process while in a custom scan it scans the file but doesn't penetrate through it and uses basic virus checking protocol.<br />
<br />
Therefore, Full scan is slow but custom scan is fast.<br />
I think so!!!!

<p>Yeah, I was hoping... But I cant see much that this update has fixed. Full scans start in spurts but reverts back to scanning single figure amounts per second. So I wonder what this update actually did? 31 updates this month, and while I welcome the security
 ones, the other updates, which I go through to see what they are, fix issues that Ive never heard of being an issue before. Not for me anyway. Meanwjhile the bugs and stuff with W8-W8.1, that remain,&nbsp;and are all over the web, still don't get any attn.</p>
<p>If yu click on "More Information" on the windows update page, it'll take you to the MSoft site and tell you what the update is for. At the bottom is "Was this page helpful".&nbsp;I will go back to this defender update page, and ask (Or tell) them, "What the hell
 are they doing" and why cant they have a fix that fixes. Seems one of the only ways to get the message through. If it does at all. I hope others add their thoughts too on this page. (Amongst other issues and other pages).

            I got rid of McAffee 5 days ago after getting infected with an Adware / Malware program. I've uninstalled and deleted everything I could find. I also started doing a Windows Defender Full Scan on my system. I definitely think something is wrong because
 I am now going on 91 HOURS!!!!! of scanning 1,374,527 files. I have around 380gb worth of data, but there is no way that Windows Defender should take 91 HOURS!!!!! Any recommendations? I've used CC cleaner to help clean up registries. I've deleted all references
 to McAfee so I don't know what to do except just let it run, and run and run. Help me Obi Wan, you're my only hope!

<h2>            Windows 10,  Boots up to non-user screen &#40;field of flowers&#41;. There is no option to get to any users accounts.. then goes to black screen.</h2>
                    <p>I have a Windows 10, Dell Laptop, Boots to non-user screen (field of flowers). There is no option to get to any users accounts.&nbsp;Mouse cursor will move around, but if you click or press the ctrl button, screen goes black screen and nothing else ever shows
 up.&nbsp; After a while the cursor shows up in the blank screen and you can move it, but nothing else.&nbsp; ctrl+alt+del dose not work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you reboot from power button it does the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can get to the f2 and f12 screens for boot and setup?&nbsp;&nbsp; But I don't know if any of that would help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried f4 for safe mode, with no luck?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<br />
</p>
<p><span>To get there:
</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Boot your PC and continually press F2 (alternatively, press and hold), until you reach the
</span><span><strong>System Diagnostics
</strong></span><span>menu.
<br />
</span></li><li><span>Use arrow keys to navigate and choose<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Hard Drive Check</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Choose<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Extensive Check.</strong></span></li><li><span>Allow it to finish checking and
<strong>reboot</strong> the PC as normal</span></li></ul>

            Thanks - that was what I was thinking, but the more I thought about it I was thinking the contact number might be helpful to someone on your security team??&nbsp; I don't know who called but the background sounded like a call center, he couldn't pronounce my
 name - a typical American name - and was asking specific questions about my computer, which is when I just hung up.&nbsp; I am so irritated that they have connected my stuff up - now I think I need to revisit my security system.&nbsp; The fella used "Microsoft" as the
 company he was calling from - completely ridiculous!&nbsp; What is this world coming to?!?!?!?!&nbsp; I do appreciate your feedback though - timely and in line with my thinking! Appreciate it bunches. - KW

            A scam, and they have no way of knowing what kind of computer you have.&nbsp; They will mention a common brand such as Dell or HP, and most of the time they'll be correct and make the user think that it might be a legit call.&nbsp;
