    <title>windows 10 kick out - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            windows 10 kick out</h2>
                    when ever I login in I almost always get kicked back to my login right away or within the first minute of being on. This will occur 2-3 time in a row until it finally stops and allows me to actually use my computer. this problem started occurring when
 I made the mistake of downloading windows 10. I will also get a pixilated square on my screen afterwards which then requires totally restart. Its extremely frustrating to have to log on 3 or 4 times to do anything on my computer. please help.

            Hi Nathan,<br />
<br />
<br />
The issue you're experiencing when logging in to your PC might be due to a variety of reasons. One of which is due to corrupted system files.<br />
<br />
Since you've mentioned that you've experienced the issue after downloading Windows 10, may we know your original operating system or the one pre-installed on your PC?<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your response.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.

                    <p>original title: WINDOWS 7 AND LEXMARK X2350 ALL IN ONE PRINTER/DOCUMENTS THAT SHOULD PRINT OUT BLACK ARE DARK GREEN</p>
<p>ABOUT A MONTH AGO, IGOT AN INK REFILL FROM WALGREEN'S&nbsp;FOR MY LEXMARK X2350 PRINTER. DOCUMENTS THAT WERE SUPPOSED TO PRINT BLACK PRINT DARK GREEN. i USED UP THIS INK SUPPLY AND PURCHASED A GENUINE LEXMARK 1 INK REFILL. SAME PROBLEM PRINTS DARK GREEN. IT DOES
 PRINT IN COLOR CORRECTLY. </p>
<p>ABOUT 3 WEEKS AGO, WHILE I WAS TRYING TO PRINT DOCUMENTS, MY SYSTEM STARTED HAVING MANY ISSUES AND PROBLEMS DEALING WITH THE LEXMARK PRINTER AND SPOOLER PROBLEMS. I UNINSTALLED THE LEXMARK ALL TOGETHER AND REINSTALLED USING CD THAT CAME WITH PRINTER. I UNINSTALLED
 THE ORIGINAL PRINTER DRIVER THAT CAME WITH IT AND DOWNLOADED THE UPDATED PRINTER DRIVER FROM MANUFACTURER WEBSITE. I TRIED EVERTHING I COULD THINK OF TO FIX PROBLEM</p>
<p>WHAT I EVENTUALLY DID WAS TO RESTORE MY COMPUTER TO A TIME WHEN THE PRINTER AT LEAST WORKED EVEN THOUGH IT STILL PRINTED DARK GREEN.</p>
<p>i HAVE NOT TRIED TO FIX AGAIN BECAUSE I DO NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO AND I DO NOT WANT TO LOSE THE ABILITY TO PRINT EVEN THOUGH IT IS WRONG COLOR</p>
<p>PLEASE HELP</p>

            <p>Hi Melowin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply and sorry for my late response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately none of the above solved the issue. My login screen contains my account picture, a personal background and a separate personal image in the top right corner. It's this 3rd picture I'd particularly like to remove but if I could make my login
 screen the same as my locked screen that would also solve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just let me know if I can provide any more information.</p>

            Hi Colm,<br />
<br />
<br />
On the Account Settings you will find that there is no remove button to delete the pictures, if you want to remove pictures from your user account, you may follow the steps below:<br />
<br />
Step 1: Go to the Accounts Settings with the step above.<br />
Or click on Windows icon, select "Settings", and then click on "Accounts" to open the Accounts Setting.<br />
<br />
Step 2: On the Accounts setting screen, click on "Browse" button.<br />
<br />
Step 3: On the file explorer address bar, type in %appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\AccountPictures, and then press "Enter".<br />
<br />
Step 4: You will see your user account pictures on the folder, right-click on the picture that you want to remove and click on "Delete", Yes to remove it.<br />
You will find that even if you have removed the user account picture, you still can see it with your account. If you do not want to see your pictures on your user account, you can set it to the default picture. Follow the steps below to set your user account
 picture to the default one.<br />
<br />
Step 5: Click on "Browse" button, on the file explorer address bar type in C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\User Account Pictures, and then press "Enter".<br />
<br />
Step 6: And then you will see the default account pictures, select one, and click on "Choose picture" button to set it to your account.<br />
<br />
Step 7: Now you will see that on your account is the system default picture, not your own picture.<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes.

            <p>Hi Jenicel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the pictures I see when logging in do not appear to be connected to my account (except for my account user image which I am not trying to change). As a result, only that one image is located in&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">%appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\AccountPictures.
 The personal background and other personal image must be stored elsewhere?</span></p>

            <p>Hi again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally solved this! Not entirely sure which step did it but I did the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Right-click on desktop &gt; Personalise &gt; Lock screen</li><li>Remove all app status options</li><li>Changed my background from Windows Spotlight to Pictures</li><li>Selected a random picture</li><li>Signed out and now the new picture was up on the sign in screen</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I figure I can probably change the option back to Windows Spotlight now as it appears the login screen and sign-in screen are now identical.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can make any sense out of how that worked you're better than I.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help anyway, hopefully the above can help someone else in future</p>

    <title>Windows 10 causes overheating in older CPU&#39;s and GPU&#39;s - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> endawyld  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 causes overheating in older CPU&#39;s and GPU&#39;s</h2>
                    <p>My "Haswell" generation 4 Core i7 constantly overheated while I had Windows 10 installed, primarily while running MMORPG's. (After 4 days back in Windows 7, my ears are still ringing from the fans spinning at top speed.)</p>
<p>My cooling fans often would run full blast, and after a few hours I started getting graphics artifacts throughout the games. (If I didn't reboot my computer when the artifacts showed up, Windows 10 would do a blue screen crash on me.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>During an in-game discussion it was noted that players whose computers were over a year or so old were having the same problems, but folks with the newest computers had no problems what-so-ever.</p>
<p>The MMORPG's I play are; Star Trek Online, MechWarrior Online, Guild Wars 1 &amp; 2, and Star Wars The Old Republic.</p>
<p>Star Wars The Old Republic is the worst, and has blue screen crashed so many times in Windows 10 that&nbsp;I finally got tired of Windows 10.</p>
<p>Star Trek online is all but impossible to play in Windows 10, as I sign in and then have to wait 10-15+ minutes for it to launch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I have been retired for almost three years, and pretty much play MMORPG's 24/7.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Alienware M17 has a "Haswell" Intel Core i7-4700MQ @ 2.40ghz, 8gb ram, NVidia GeForce GTX 765M w/2gb, and a 750gb HDD, with all drivers updated to Windows 10 versions, and my fans cleaned several times a week during the 6 weeks I tried Windows 10.</p>
<p>Using Task Manager in Windows 10, I had 23-29% CPU usage, 31-39% Memory usage, 0-1% HDD usage, and 0-1% Network usage. (None of which would justify overheating the CPU or GPU.)</p>
<p>In Windows 7, Task Manager gives me about the same usage percentages as I got in Window 10, but my cooling fans rarely, if ever, come on. (The Fleet Stations in Star Wars The Old Republic are about the only place my CPU or GPU cooling fans will come on,
 and even then, only&nbsp;at a very&nbsp;low speed.)</p>
<p>On the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows 7 Support</a>&nbsp;wiki page it mentions that Microsoft's Windows will not support computers with CPU's older than the "SkyLake" (generation 6 Core CPU's) effective July 2017. The "SkyLake" series came out in August 2015.</p>
<p>Combine that with the constant requests for you to upgrade to Windows 10, I can't help but wonder if they set up Windows 10 to burn up older computers in order to force us to buy new ones with Windows 10 already installed. (It's the only way they actually
 make money on Windows 10 right now.)</p>

            I got the same error code. I uninstalled the Netflix app then reinstalled it, and still got the same error code. Also, when I stream using the internet browser (IE 10), the sounds is distorted and the video stream times-out.

It's a Netflix code. If you call the 800 number with the code, I'm sure Netflix support can tell you exactly what's happening. Seems like it's an app problem to me that Netflix needs to fix.

<div>Ever since I installed hyper-v, I have been getting this error. Not only in Netflix, but Hulu Plus as well. I had disabled the virtual machines service only to find out that any wireless keyboard or mouse would not work period during start-up. That being
 said, I had to use the corded mouse and on-screen keyboard to navigate Windows and to turn back on that service. Wireless mouse and keyboards work now.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>But the problem still exists with concerning Netflix and Hulu. Ever since Hyper-V, because I wanted to&nbsp;develop&nbsp;Windows Phone 8 applications; but now, I'm not too satisfied with what has happened. Have you figured out how to solve this problem?</div>

 is correct!! </blockquote>
<br />
It's a Netflix code. If you call the 800 number with the code, I'm sure Netflix support can tell you exactly what's happening. Seems like it's an app problem to me that Netflix needs to fix.
</blockquote>
<p><br />
What makes you so 'sure' that Netflix will know what Error code W8156-C0262500 is?</p>
<p>I just called; they had no clue. They went as far as blaming it on Microsoft trying to claim that they're responsible for bringing the media to the computer, and not playing it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is of coarse a load of garbase as Netflix designed the Windows 8 full view app experience.
</p>
<p>What really needs to happen is a Netflix engineer needs to debug this and figure out what's causing it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FYI: I have a similar problem with Hulu as well. Both apps worked fine until a week or so ago &amp; both haven't worked since.</p>

            I'm running into the same issue with my Netflix app on Windows 8 Pro.&nbsp; Is there a solution to this yet?&nbsp; I also installed the Windows Phone 8 SDK pack for development which installed hyper v.&nbsp; Is this the issue causing the application to fail?

<h2>            Skype in the browser - in-call feature problem</h2>
                    <p>When I am dialling to a landline or mobile number in the browser, how do I use the in-call feature of selecting options from a voicemail menu? When the voice message says, to do this, press 1; to do this, press 2, and so on.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This feature simply doesn't seem to exist, or at least doesn't seem to work. Can anyone help out with advice? I am using a Mac, by the way, running Chrome, but I don't think that should make a difference, or does it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help will be very gratefully received.</p>
<p>
In anticipation, thanks<br />

    <title>Gift for Friend via XBox Did Not Work - Refund Refused - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Gift for Friend via XBox Did Not Work - Refund Refused</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am hoping somebody can help me understand a response I had from XBox Support a couple of days ago.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Using my XBox I accessed the Games Store and purchased the season pass of Elite Dangerous for a friend. &nbsp;Both of us are in the UK, and both of our consoles are affiliated with the UK store.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>On my part the purchase went through smoothly ,and my friend received the notification that I had gifted him the item. &nbsp;However, when he tried to redeem it an error popped up telling him the gift was not eligible for his region. &nbsp;Again, we are both in the
 UK and both our XBoxes are affiliated to the UK store.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I read the email I had received when I made the purchase and it showed a key/code for the purchase, so I sent that to him. &nbsp;Same error.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So I contact XBox Support via “live chat”. &nbsp;The support guy was vary helpful and despite his confirming that both consoles are UK based and the code for the purchase was authentic, he was unable to fix the problem. &nbsp;He suggested I requested a refund. &nbsp;He
 gave me a support reference number. &nbsp;I was happy with this outcome. &nbsp;In the meantime I went onto Amazon UK and purchased a download code for £10, which I then gave to my friend and he was able to purchase the season pass. &nbsp;I then emailed XBox Support and requested
 a refund, providing the support reference number.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A few days later, yesterday in fact, I received an email from XBox Support telling me that my refund request had been rejected as it did not meet the “Terms and Conditions”. &nbsp;No further explanation was provided to explain their reasoning. &nbsp;They closed the
 case. &nbsp;I opened it up again and asked them why I was not able to get a refund for an item that did not work. &nbsp;The case was again closed with no further response from XBox/MS.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Can somebody here explain to me why this was not eligible for a refund? &nbsp;Are MS in the wrong here or can they legally refuse to refund me for a product that did not work as advertised?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Many thanks for any help proffered.</p>

<p>Hi Myrm,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us in the forums for this issue. Sorry to hear that your refund request didn't go through initially. Here on the forums we don't have the tools available to assist with refunds; however, you do have the option to respond directly
 to the confirmation email you received to dispute the denial.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Note</span></strong><span> Due to high support activity,
</span><a href="https://www.xbox.com/refunds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">refund</a><span> response times can be more than 72 hours. Thanks for your patience.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this helps out!</p>

<p>Nope, that happens to everyone. In fact a fan brought it up at the Q&amp;A of the Zombies panel and they brushed it off, saying it was maybe his connection, so they're either not aware of it or don't want to fix it.</p>

<p>In most cases your machine has a WIRELESS SWITCH which needs to be physically SWITCHED to ON position. Problem solved :)</p>

<h2>            0x80042108 in Outlook 2003 SP3 on Vista Ultimate SP1 64-bit</h2>
                    Hi guys,<br />
<br />
I just had a 32-bit Windows XP/Office 2003 machine die on me (fried motherboard), so I bought a new box, but this time 64-bit onto which I installed Vista Ultimate SP1 (but kept Office 2003 SP3).<br />
<br />
I wanted to transfer over all my Outlook 2003 stuff from the old hard disk, to the new one, including my former inbox directory structure, all my old emails and other stuff.<br />
<br />
Following Judy Gleeson's advice, I copied over the files, and Outlook seems to have recognised them as expected. I can now see all my old inbox folders and all the old emails. The problem is that I'm unable to connect to my incoming or outgoing servers (they
 are not the same).&nbsp;If I go in through Control Panel | View 32-bit Control Panel Items | Mail, I can send/receive test messages forever, but doing the same thing through Outlook always fails
<p>Attempts at sending a test message using ‘Test Account Settings’ on the Email Accounts dialog, result in the following messages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Send test e-mail message: The specified server was found, but there was no response from the server.
</li><li>Log onto incoming mail server (POP): The specified server was found, but there was no response from the server.
</li><li>Find outgoing mail server (SMTP): Outlook could not connect to the outgoing mail server (SMTP).</li></ul>
<p><br />
Interestingly, the test messages <em>are</em> actually being sent (I can pick them up&nbsp;using another computer).<br />
<br />
Attempts at sending/receiving via Outlook result in the following message:</p>
<ul>
<li>Task ‘Pacific Database - Receiving’ reported error (0x80042108) : Outlook is unable to connect to your incoming (POP3) e-mail server.</li></ul>
<p><br />
Following&nbsp;Robert Sparnaaij's suggestion, I uninstalled Symantec EndPoint Protection, and rebooted. Unfortunately that didn't help. I then tried Office Detect &amp; Repair, and&nbsp;then running Outlook in safe mode. I also tried creating a new profile. No change. Interestingly,
 prior to uninstalling SEP, I noticed the system log indicated that ipv6 packets were being blocked (sorry, I forgot to write down the details).</p>
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Graham R Seach<br />

            Graham, you mentioned IPV6, do you believe its port / network related?<br />
Have you tried disabling IPv6 on your NIC?<br />
<br />
Have you tested it under a clean boot?<br />

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand how important the files are that you have lost accidentally from the app.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per my research on the Media Locker app, the app creates a folder that contains the copy of the files that you have imported to the app. You can check for the folder “MediaLocker” and see if the files exist there.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, you can go ahead and try this methods to see if the files are still in the system.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> Check if the deleted files are showing up in Recycle Bin.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To enable Recycle Bin icon, select <strong>Start</strong>&nbsp;Windows logo Start button &gt;
<strong>Settings</strong> Gear-shaped Settings icon&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Personalization</strong> &gt;

<p>Dear</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did all as per your suggestions but unfortunately none of above worked. Is there any other way to recover files from media locker as i have not deleted the apps itself, and there has not been deleted folder in that apps itself. Please advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I've read a thread which asks how to get the 3D pipes screensaver on Vista. I understand it, I have a Vista and&nbsp;two XPs. Only one problem, I can't find 3d pipes.scr.</p>
<p>It's supposed to be C:\WINDOWS\system32\3d pipes.scr, but it isn't there. But it has to be, because It's my screensaver. I tried the adress bar, but it says "Cannot find 'file ///C:/WINDOWS/system32/3d%20pipes.scr'. Make sure path or Internet address is
 correct."</p>
<p>I'm about to try the XP laptop, but that has some router connectivity problems.</p>

            I just found it using Search Companion. The file is called 'sspipes', not 3d pipes.scr.
