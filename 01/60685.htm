<h2>            Windows 10 screen time very buggy</h2>
                    <p>I've been using windows 10 screen time for a long time and it's never really worked properly. Below is the list of bugs/problems that I've experienced VERY frequently:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Screen time randomly changes the time slots, usually it shortens the amount of time my kid can use the computer. For example if I give him access from 4pm-12pm after school, it randomly adjusts itself to say 5pm-10pm</li><li>Screen time randomly does not activate, meaning he has unlimited access. However, it does NOT display as unlimited access in screen time controls, still displays the normal settings</li><li>Have to go on his computer and remove the parental controls folder <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">almost every week</span></strong>, probably files are corrupt or something?</li><li>Have to restart his computer VERY frequently due to screen time not working</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Is this normal? Having to go on his computer (which truthfully isn't very convenient in this day and age when kids are so possessive) every week to do a bunch of restarts and delete files? This is honestly becoming more trouble than it's worth and the basic
 wifi restrictions I can set on the router is starting to become a good alternative.</p>

            Hi,
<p>
</p><p>From the sound of it, the issue is all about the application of time limit rules on your child's computer. Note that time limits apply according to the time set on the child account's computer. Any underlying issues that may cause the date and time on your
 child's PC to reset will directly affect the rules application on it. For now, let us isolate the issue by answering the questions below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Do you have any other computers that have screen time child accounts in it? If so, does it happen to all child account computers?</li><li>Is your child using a laptop or a desktop? If your child is using a desktop and you have verified that the date and time is resetting on the machine, it may have something to do with the CMOS battery.<br />
</li><li>Do you regularly update your Windows 10?</li><li>Have you already tried deleting and recreating the rules on the parent account?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>You may also visit this link to know more how Windows 10 screen time works: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12439/microsoft-account-set-child-limits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

                    <p>Ok so here the issues i have i been a loyal xbox member for over 8 years and i been apart of the reword program since day 1 it started. I been busy with life but always find time to game on my xbox and never got around to contacting support so now that i do got time i thought i would see if i can get this fix and claim what rightly my. So on my reword your suppose to get points base on your gamer score i have over 100k score like around 160,000 give or take and never got a single point for any of it as well i pay for my xbox live for years and pay for items on the store. I not once never got any points for any of that even doing the surveys. All i am asking is to fix this issue and give me what i rightly earn all these years.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>As of September 2014 we are no longer rewarded for earning gamerscore and as of July 2014 we are no longer rewarded for renewing or maintaining Xbox Live Gold. The program has changed a lot since those days. A member of the staff will have to review your purchases, however it is important you update yourself on the changes the program has gone through by visiting the reward page and the FAQ. You have to reach a minimum spending threshold to start receiving MyVip rewards (which does not include pre-orders, subscriptions, or in-game currency) and this resets yearly&nbsp;<strong><u>AND/OR</u></strong> you have to complete specific missions located on the MyMissions page on the reward website. The missions change monthly and quarterly.&nbsp;<br /></p><p>The staff will review your account and reply to you here if there are any other issues or missed items. The staff works Monday - Friday from 9am to 5pm PST and typically takes 1-2 business days to reply, they reply to threads oldest to newest.</p>

            <p>Hello NIGHT&nbsp;SHAD0W&nbsp;NW,</p><p><br /></p><p>You can earn Xbox Live Rewards Credit in two ways:&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>
<p>1. By finishing the offers located on the&nbsp;MyMissions&nbsp;page at&nbsp;<a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/mymissions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rewards.xbox.com/mymissions/</a>&nbsp;.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-or-&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;For non-offer purchases, you can earn Credits by earning a one star&nbsp;MyVIP&nbsp;level through purchasing at least $300 USD or regional equivalent of eligible content. After you receive your first star you will begin to earn a percentage of your eligible purchases back as payback Rewards Credit. Pre-orders,&nbsp;in-game consumables, and subscriptions are not eligible for&nbsp;MyVIP.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>
<p>In&nbsp;September 2014&nbsp;we changed to the MyVIP policy.&nbsp;As a result, payback based off Gamerscore (MyAchievements) was discontinued.&nbsp;Also, as of July 2014, we do not award Credits for Xbox Live Gold renewals.&nbsp;In September 2015, we made some refinements to the program. One change that happened was an adjustment of&nbsp;MyVIP&nbsp;purchase thresholds. If you did not reach any&nbsp;MyVIP&nbsp;ranks with your purchases from September 2014-August&nbsp;31st&nbsp;2015, you were placed at a default rank. Since you are a&nbsp;zero star&nbsp;member, you do not get payback Credits on your purchases. You can check your current MyVIP level/progress at (<a href="https://rewards.xbox.com/myrewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rewards.xbox.com/myrewards/</a>).&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>As Murphs mentions, and as stated above, we do not Reward gamerscore.</p><p><br /></p>

            It is too bad the MS Answers forums implementation does not prompt for any system information when a new question is asked, so we know absolutely nothing about your system.<br />
<br />
Not knowing fundamental information about a problem prolongs the frustration and agony of resolving these issues but that is the way they choose to run things here.<br />
<br />
If you mean you are seeing a message similar to this:<br />
<br />
Microsoft Feeds Synchronization has encountered a problem and needs to close.<br />
<br />
AppName: msfeedssync.exe AppVer: 8.0.6001.18702 ModName: user32.dll<br />
ModVer: 5.1.2600.2622 Offset: 000095d8<br />
<br />
Disabling and enabling feed synchronization again will usually straighten this out...<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
cmd<br />
<br />
Click OK to open a Command prompt window then run the following commands one at a time from the command prompt:<br />
<br />
msfeedssync&nbsp; disable&nbsp; &lt;Enter&gt;&nbsp; There will be no message about what happened<br />
msfeedssync&nbsp; enable&nbsp; &lt;Enter&gt;&nbsp; There will be no message about what happened<br />
<br />
exit &lt;Enter&gt;&nbsp; Closes the command prompt window<br />
<br />
Reboot and see how things look.<br />

            <p>I have never tried the forum before and I do so appreciate how helpful you all have been.&nbsp; I am getting basically the message that is in your reply except that the App Ver is the same, the Mod Name is the same but the Mod Ver is 5.1.2600.2180 and the Offset
 is 0000bbcd</p>
<p>I would try your suggestion but I'm so spooked from trying the repair on my own, that I'm scared to try your fix unless you tell me it is ok to do it since my error message is not exact.</p>

            I can think of no 'danger' or anything that might go wrong in simply disabling and enabling the feeds Task.&nbsp; It's like throwing a switch...&nbsp; turn it off, turn it back on.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
It looks like you are pursuing other system/Internet Explorer related issues in another topic, so this feeds thing may be resolved when that other stuff is resolved.<br />
<br />
Since we don't know anything about your system, I changed my reply to be more generic:<br />
<br />
If you mean you are seeing a message <i>similar</i> to this:<br />
<i><br />
Microsoft Feeds Synchronization has encountered a problem and needs to close.<br />
<br />
AppName: msfeedssync.exe AppVer: 8.0.6001.18702 ModName: user32.dll<br />
ModVer: 5.1.2600.2622 Offset: 000095d8</i><br />
<br />
You should only see that message if you are using Feeds (and I am not), and Feeds are usually set up in Internet Explorer under Favorites (not using IE unless I have to) and since the Feeds process runs as a Scheduled Task, you can query any feeds you might
 be subscribed to by entering this from a Command prompt window:<br />
<br />
<strong>schtasks&nbsp; /query&nbsp; |&nbsp; findstr&nbsp; /i&nbsp; "user_feed"<br />
<br />
</strong>You might see something <i>similar </i>to this indicating an afflicted feed:<strong><br />
<br />
</strong>User_Feed_Synchronization-{B70B1824-595E-4 11/28/2013 02:24:00&nbsp; Ready<br />
User_Feed_Synchronization-{C73963F9-62BB-4 11/28/2013 02:45:00&nbsp; <b>Could not start</b><br />
<br />
In that case, something is not right with one of the feeds, so disabling and enabling is usually all you need to do to straighten it out - then you can query it again to be sure.<br />
<br />
If you don't know what a feed is or are not sure if you are using feeds, just <b>
disable </b>it and that will be one less thing running on your system:<br />
<b><br />
msfeedssync&nbsp; disable&nbsp; &lt;Enter&gt;</b>&nbsp; There will be no message about what happened<br />

    <title>Windows cannot access &#92;&#92;&#40;Share name&#41; You do not have - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> odeoncomputers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows cannot access &#92;&#92;&#40;Share name&#41; You do not have permission to access&#92;&#92;&#40;shre name&#41; Contact your administrator&#63;</h2>
                    I am the Administrator?<br />
<br />
I have Networked 4 clean new computers together with Windows 7 Pro on all of them, lets call them Main-PC, PC-1, PC-2 &amp; PC-3.<br />
All was fine when I had only 3 networked together - all were sharing files and folders happily until some bright spark came along and decided he needed to add all these (work) computers to a Homegroup to share a specific folder (Lets call it&nbsp; \\Main-PC\Folder1
 ) throughout the network. <br />
I arrived the next day to add the 4th machine into the mix and couldn't understand why PC-3 wasn't communicating with the other computers? I kept getting the message "Windows cannot access \\(share name)" and so on..
<br />
Found the Homegroup - removed all PC's from the group - Changed the network type to "WORK" from "Home" - Checked Workgroup was set the same on all PC's - Checked Date &amp; Time on all PC's - Removed sharing from Folder1 - Restarted Main-PC - Then re-enabled sharring
 to Folder1 with Read/Write access for EVERYONE in permissions - Still getting "Windows cannot access \\(share name)"?<br />
It seems the only way I can get these machines to talk is to re-create the Homegroup then Right click the Folder1 share with Homegroup with Read/write.<br />
<br />
That would be fine, but something else is wrong? When PC-1, PC-2 &amp; PC-3 are joined to the newly created Homegroup on Main-PC all of 1, 2 &amp; 3 can talk create shares and work happily together, but Main-PC cannot access these newly created Shares on 1,2 or 3?
 They (1,2 &amp; 3) can access \\Main-PC\Folder1 ok but if I go to Main-PC and try to access \\PC-1\Newshare "Windows cannot access \\(share name)" and so on..<br />
So I hunted the internet &amp; tried the following on all PC's:<br />
<br />
<span style="font-style: italic">Type secpol.msc in the search function.</span>
<p>Browse to "Local Policies" -&gt; "Security Options".&nbsp; Now look for the entry "Network Security: LAN Manager authentication level" and open it.&nbsp; Click on the dropdown menu and select "Send LM &amp; NTLM - use NTLMv2 session security if
 negotiated".&nbsp; Apply the settings.</p>
<p>In the Advanced sharing settings page of Network and sharing center, you need to have it set as Work/Home profile.&nbsp; Try</p>
<p>-Enable network discovery<br />
-Turn on&nbsp; file and print sharing<br />
-Turn off password protected sharing<br />
-Use user accounts and passwords to connect to other computers</p>
<p>The other settings such as encryption I have set as use 128 bit encryption.</p>
<p>Please check related policies.</p>
<p>1. Enter “gpedit.msc” in the Start Search box. <br />
2. Open “Computer Configuration”/Windows Settings/Security Settings/Local Policies/Security Settings.<br />
3. In the right pane, enable the following policies:</p>
<p>Network access: Allow anonymous SID/name translation<br />
Network access: Let Everyone permissions apply to anonymous users</p>
<p>Also please disable the following policies.</p>
<p>Network access: Restrict anonymous access to Named Pipes and Shares<br />
Network access: Do not allow anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts<br />
Network access: Do not allow anonymous enumeration of SAM accounts and shares</p>
<p><br />
</p>
This did not work and am getting exactly the same "Windows cannot access \\(Share name)"?
<br />
I also tried creating the same user account &amp; Password on every PC including Main PC - This created a different problem?<br />
On creating a new user on Main-PC when I try access \\PC-1\Newshare I get a username &amp; password dialogue box appear - if I type the correct username and password in it will allow me access to the share (finally..), but only for that session - If I restart the
 Main-PC or PC-1 I will have to re-enter the correct Username &amp; password again (even tho I have ticked the box to remember my credentials)?<br />
<br />
I need help - PC-1, PC-2 &amp; PC-3 all need access to \\Main-PC\Folder1 (for software reasons) and Main-PC needs to be able to access \\PC-1\Newshare without having to enter a username &amp; password every time I need to see it, I would also like to get rid of the
 Homegroup?<br />
I have also made sure Guest accounts are off!<br />
<br />
Can someone help me please?<br />

                    <p><strong>How do I search for a diary event on Windows 10 Calendar App?&nbsp; I still don't see a 'search magnifier'?? 01/2018</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, it's now January 2018 &amp; I am cleaning up my Calendars.&nbsp; I am using the Windows 10 Calendar App on my laptop which is (was) great&nbsp; but still CANNOT find the 'search' button. &nbsp; Why oh Why ?? &nbsp; How can you have a calendar that lets you add &amp; delete events
 but won't let you search ??</p>
<p>This is a simple basic&nbsp; function that should have be added to this App.&nbsp; I've read on the forums here that you can ask Cortana but it only searches in the present not past?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I've had to resort to going back into my mobile phone and searching for a particular event on a date a year ago. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If someone knows how to find an entry using the calendar app, please can you advise. &nbsp; I'm in the UK, as someone also suggested downloading a 'search' app but it said it wasn't available in my region.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>
<p>Frustrated with Windows 10&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>ps - my Winn 10 camera app images were upside down since 2016, then i got it back as it couldn't be found (driver issue), then i had to reinstall my SmartLogon facial recognition now it's gone again.&nbsp; I have posted &amp; looked up many of the same queries with
 no actual resolution on here. &nbsp;</p>

Fast Boot – Windows 8 boots significantly faster than Windows 7, in fact on an SSD, I can have Windows 8 up and running in 5 to 7 seconds.
</p>
<li>Fully Touch Ready – This has been a miss on on prior versions of Windows going back to Windows XP Tablet PC edition. Windows 8 features a smart, fluid and fast interface that is significantly engineered for Touch called the Start Screen. There is just no
 disadvantage when using it with Touch. You can swipe, pan, zoom and do all the key actions expected on a Touch device. Microsoft has also created an environment that will encourage third party developers to create touch ready applications just for Windows
 8. These applications will not run on Windows 7. </li><li>Fully compatible with existing hardware and software. If it works with Vista or Windows 7, it is guaranteed to work with Windows 8.
</li><li>Tighter Internet integration – Windows 8 features a holistic integration with services that deliver information right to your screen without much need for you to find and discover it.
</li><li>The ability to sync information across multiple devices makes Windows 8 a truly Internet ready operating system. Please Help.<br />

            You can't do this manually, but it will still work the way you want because if you turn off your Internet connection or shut down the computer, it will keep the pieces that have&nbsp; already been downloaded (you never have to "start over" downloading it).

                    <p>I have been stuck on Avoid Me for several weeks on my N3ON Saint account. I only get reported on Overwatch simply because of hero choice but this has knocked me down to Avoid me for the first time ever. I have been playing battlefield almost every day for two weeks to try and get my reputation back so I can matchmake in other games but it won't move. I have never had this low of a reputation so does it ever go away? I keep playing other games and trying to get it up but nothing is happening. This is hurting a competitive team I play with as I have to use a different MMR account for practice. Please help with any tips the enforcement pages are not **** helpful.</p>

<p>Hi Alberto,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Diagnosing the PC after selecting the Startup Repair takes some time, depending whether there are open apps or not before the repair. If you've used an external device to boot the PC, it usually takes about an hour or two to finish, even reaching three hours
 for maximum time.&nbsp; If you're waiting for a long time and it doesn't boot your PC at all, we recommend contacting your Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) directly and have them perform a hardware diagnostics as this can be related to hardware issues.</p>
<p>
Let us know if you need anything else. We're here to help.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t install programs despite of Admin privileges &#40;can&#39;t remove read-only via attrib-cmd&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Actually I did not make any changes to my system as far as I can remember, but when I tried to install Irfanview (and later VLC Media Player) it seems that write-permissions are missing...</p>
<p>I have already read KB326549 (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/326549) which did not really cover my problem here. Some related threads in this forum (concerning the read-only attribute / taking ownership / admin permissions / ...) did not really work for
 me (at least the read-only attribute remained checked in the properties page...). So I am really hoping that someone here comes up with an idea :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I noticed that every folder is write-protected/"read-only" and after I unchecked that in the Properties page it just came back every time. So, I took ownership of the folder with my (Admin) account, gave it full control and tried again, but it did not make
 any difference.</p>
<p>At last I used the command-line (cmd with Admin rights): attrib -r -s "C:\Program Files" /S /D and other variations...</p>
<p>I am using Windows 7 x64 Professional in English - nevertheless please excuse my bad English, obviously daily usage of the OS did not help that much with the language...</p>

    <title>Achievements broken when playing same game on more than one profile - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Achievements broken when playing same game on more than one profile</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Is anyone else experiencing serious issues with achievements when the same game is being played by more than one profile ?</p>
<p>The first game me and the wife played 'Metro Redux' had serious issues with progress towards achievements 'bleeding' between our separate profiles. &nbsp;For example, I began my play through of 'last light' before her, and was quite a way into the game when she
 began to play, and somehow my progress towards certain achievements (as indicated by the purple bars) interfered with her own, giving her progress on the bars right off the bat when they all should have been zero percent. Also, diaries (an in game collectible)
 that I had picked up in my game were then missing from hers, making the achievement unobtainable.</p>
<p>I blamed the game at the time but now we are playing our second xbox one game DA:Inquisition and are experiencing similar issues here. Basically once I have unlocked an achievement in my game progress towards that achievement in my wife's game then ceases,
 making the achievement unobtainable, and vice versa. &nbsp;For example my progress towards the 'Quartermaster' achievement has been stuck at 90 percent ever since my wife unlocked that achievement on her own profile. And there are several others which are similarly
 effected.</p>

<p>I'm having the exact same problems with my girlfriend on DA:I. I've tried hard-reset and using my GamerTag on a completely different Xbox but the problem persists. It seems that this bug has caused several achievements to be completely unobtainable. We've
 completely stopped playing on Xbox One due to this problem.</p>

<p>Surely this must be a serious glitch in the achievement system and is totally ruining our xbox one experience to the point where we have decided to no longer purchase xbox one games.
</p>
<p>The occasional bugged achievement I could live with but when you know every game you purchase is going to have broken achievements if played by more than one profile that's a deal breaker.</p>

<p>Last week there were problems with the achievements on 360 as well but they seem to be fixed today. I tried if the problems with Xbox One disappeared but it seems that nothing has changed, the achievements in Dragon Age: Inquisition are still stuck. The
 weird thing is that the achievements on Master Chief Collection seem to work fine with multiple accounts, but it might also be due to the fact that I have always been the "host" of the games.</p>
<p>I'd hope some kind of acknowledgment of the problem from the Microsoft as the problem can be clearly seen from my achievement progress in DA:I.</p>

<p>This has been an issue since launch for me (Nov 13) </p>
<p>If I have an achievement then my wife (probably) wont be able to earn it unless im signed out.</p>
<p>Not just co-op either. She has to make sure I am signed out before she plays anything.</p>
<p>Unfortunatley;</p>
<p>1. We dont play co-op on the xbox one anymore</p>
<p>2. I have had to deselect the biometric sign in (incase the xbox spots me while shes signed playing) &nbsp;</p>

<p>For us the signing out doesn't make any difference, I've tried playing on a different xbox that only has my account and I still can't earn some of the achievements. If an achievement has glitched at some point due to multiple accounts signed in at the same
 time there is no way to recover from that.</p>

<p>As you say Digee I would like to see MS acknowledge that there is a serious issue and provide some feedback on what they are going to do about it.</p>
<p>Also it would be nice to have some advice on how we can get these broken achievements fixed.</p>
<p>I am now on my second playthrough of DA:I but a new game hasn't made any difference to the progress bars despite fulfilling the criteria for a second time for the Quartermaster, Botanist and People Person achievements.</p>
<p>Thanks for your replies guys :)</p>

<p>I've got the same issue with DA:I.</p>
<p>I noticed progress reports are broken on some of the achievements - (I view them on
<a href="http://www.trueachievements.com/Dragon-Age-Inquisition/achievements.htm?showall=1&amp;gamerid=323186" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.trueachievements.com/.../achievements.htm</a>) - where e.g. for Saddled up I see 4/5 mounts, whereas I have 7 already.</p>
<p>I was hoping it is an issue particularly of DA:I, but Petexbox28 post makes me wonder how can such a glitch be active for over a year?!</p>

    <title>USB disk recognized in Disk Management, status is &#34;Online,&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kharrisma  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB disk recognized in Disk Management, status is &#34;Online,&#34; but does not show in Explorer&#59; no access to that disk.</h2>
                    <p>HI All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Running Windows 10 (probably running Linux soon, instead....) on a new Dell Inspiron 5755 (my trusty old Asus G73JH running Win7 finally died).&nbsp; Haven't done any messing around with system settings or changing things in the registry yet (though probably
 soon, trying to get rid of Skype, but that's for another post).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, has anybody actually found a solution for this apparently fairly common problem?&nbsp; The drive is absolutely good, as it was running just fine in my last laptop.&nbsp; I open Disk Management, and it shows the onboard drive and it's partitions, as "basic" and
 "online," as disk 0.&nbsp; I plug in the USB drive, and a moment later, it too shows up as disk 1, basic, online.&nbsp; No problems of any kind are shown.&nbsp; Right-clicking on the USB drive offers only "convert to dynamic disk," "properties," and "help" as options.&nbsp; So
 far, so good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, only the internal disk 0 shows up in Windows Explorer.&nbsp; Right-clicking and selecting "refresh" does nothing to change things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't believe it's a problem with the USB drivers.&nbsp; Device Manager shows ten of them, none with any issues.&nbsp; Properties of the "USB Mass Storage Device" show "This device is working properly," and clicking on "Update Driver" results in "The best drivers
 for your device are already installed."&nbsp; Besides, if there were an issue with this driver, the drive wouldn't show up at all, anywhere, would it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what's the fix for this tail-chasing problem?&nbsp; I want to create a disk-image of the laptop's internal drive to this USB drive so I can restore my laptop to it's current state: settings, preferences, apps, and all, without all the laborious, tedious,
 attention-hogging, and time-consuming process of finding, downloading, installing, and setting up all the apps I like to use / games I like to play / email accounts, etc, etc, etc,&nbsp; and also because I want to use Disk Management to create a new partition in
 which I plan to install Linux, as a dual-boot system.&nbsp; I have had this latter process go badly in the past, trashing the existing Windows install and leaving me with a flawed install of Linux too, forcing the scenario just described above.&nbsp; I don't really
 trust the "rescue disk" I created soon after I got the laptop, which came with a squirrely hard drive (sector errors), and wound up failing altogether, and the "rescue disk" was of no help whatever (I know, probably because the hard drive was junk, but still,
 I'm just not feeling all warm and fuzzy about trusting that rescue disk at this point.&nbsp; Belt AND suspenders, if you catch my drift....)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help here would be very much appreciated... Microsoft is useless, as usual, and the 'net offerings are varied and vague, and thus far of no help.&nbsp; I'm dead in the water until I can get this problem solved... and then it's on to disabling/removing Windows
 Defender (denying access to key files) so I can remove the hated Skype from my machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading, and in advance for the help!</p>

<p>Hey there Wolverine,</p>
<p>I created you a new thread for you to receive catered support! I'm sorry to hear about what you're experiencing when playing campaign on CoD: AW. To get more clarification, I have a couple questions to run past you.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>What version of COD:AW do you own - Disc or Digital?</span> </li><li><span>When you install the game, do you wait for it to fully install 100% until you start playing or do you play it as soon as it's playable while it's still installing?</span>
</li></ol>
<p>If you haven't already, give these troubleshooting steps a try to see if it helps to sort things out.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/system/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Power cycle</span></a><span>&nbsp;your Xbox One console.</span>
</li><li><span>Once the console is off completely, unplug all cords from your console.</span>
</li><li><span>Leave everything unplugged for a few minutes.</span> </li><li><span>Plug your console and cords back in and turn it on.</span> </li><li><span>Try playing Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare again</span> </li></ul>
<p>By the way, I enjoy your Gamertag! :) Anyways, let us know the answers to the questions above and how the troubleshooting steps go!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seems that you are unable to install the games on the computer. Have you checked if the games are compatible with Windows 8?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here`s <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/compatibility/win8/CompatCenter/Home?Language=en-US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
the link </a>which should help you determine that. If they are incompatible, uninstall them and install in compatibility mode. Here`s how:</p>

    <title>Need to regain access to locked local admin account in Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamesd-s  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need to regain access to locked local admin account in Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>A W7 machine in WORKGROUP, SSD/64-bit, forgot the local admin password and locked the local admin account trying to guess.&nbsp; I do have a standard user account I can access.&nbsp; How do I regain access to the local admin when I am not part of a domain.&nbsp; Currently,
 login attempts to local admin tell me to see my system administrator, but I am the sysadmin (!).&nbsp; I&nbsp;have since learned the password, so that issue is resolved.</p>
<p>Lesson learned:&nbsp; even sysadmins should make a password reset disk as well as a rescue CD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I FIXED THIS ISSUE:&nbsp; I found a W7 password hacking tool, recovered the admin password and the renamed local admin user name, which was disabled by too many attempts to guess.&nbsp; I then went in Safe Mode/Networking and logged in as local admin (this bypassed
 the disabling) and rejoined the domain.&nbsp; Restarted the machine and logged in as domain admin.&nbsp; Went to local admin user account and unchecked the "disable" box.&nbsp; All set, back on the domain, local admin is online.&nbsp; Good to go.

Second lesson: Unless you wish to live dangerously, always create, test and document a spare admin account, same as you have a spare car key. This goes for local admin accounts too.<br />

    <title>New folder option missing in vista when right clicking - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> axxel6307  say:</h3>
<h2>            New folder option missing in vista when right clicking</h2>
                    I have vista 32 bit and just replaced my hard drive and reinstalled my OS.<br />
<br />
I have not been able to create new folders.&nbsp; When I right click on the desktop area, and click new, "folder" is not there.&nbsp; When I am in windows explorer, and click "organize", "new folder" is there but when I click on it, nothing happens.<br />
<br />
I have run sfc/scannow and it said it successfully repaired some files.&nbsp; I then rebooted and the problem is still there.<br />
<br />
I also checked the registry to verify that the windows desktop update component was installed and equaled: {D969A300-E7FF-11d0-A93B-00A0C90F2719}
<br />
<br />
I also do have administrator rights.<br />
<br />
Not sure what else to try.<br />
<br />
I saw another thread regarding this with recommendation to copy and paste some registry lines, but that thread was several years old and not sure if I should still try that.&nbsp; Also, it was vague.&nbsp; It said "<span>copy and paste the following lines and save the
 file with <strong>.reg </strong>extension. Double-click to add the information to your registry."<br />
<br />
Where do I paste it to?<br />

            Can I reinstall Windows 10 on my computer after upgrading? 
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Yes. Once you’ve upgraded to Windows 10 using the free upgrade offer, you will be able to reinstall, including a clean install, on the same device. You won’t need to purchase Windows 10 or go back to your prior version of Windows and upgrade again.</p>
<p>You’ll also be able to create your own installation media like a USB drive or DVD, and use that to upgrade your device or reinstall after you’ve upgraded.</p>

</p><p><strong>Does the ISO file support dual boot with another version of Windows?</strong></p>
<p>You can download an ISO, but the installation must be done from within a qualifying version of Windows, either Windows 8.1, Windows 8.0, Windows 7 or Windows 10 Insider Preview. If you don't, it won't activate. Why? It has to do a compliance check against
 a qualifying operating system. </p>
