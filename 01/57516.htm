<p>I too am having problems with this error code. The computer updates the same 4 emails when I try receiving and then comes up withan error report. Here is a copy of the error report. I have tried turnng off my antivirus programme (ESET) and that has not fixed
 the problem. Help! </p>

            <p>Check to ensure the account works okay by logging on from webmail.&nbsp; If that works, then try removing your mail account then close and reopen WinMail (if that is your mail program) and then add your account back again.&nbsp; You can also try compacting and repairing
 the database (<a href="http://www.oehelp.com/WMUtil/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.oehelp.com/WMUtil/</a>)&nbsp;and see
<a href="http://www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#3</a> to eliminate antivirus issues.&nbsp; If doing all that doesn't help, there may be a message that is sticking on the server making WInMail unable to download the rest of the messages.&nbsp;
 If so then you can try deleting the messages from webmail or else have your ISP delete the problem message to clear the queue.</p>

<h3> steverenalds  say:</h3>
<h2>            Family Safety on Windows 10 doesn&#39;t work... at all...</h2>
                    <p>I've upgraded to Windows 10 and jumped through all the hoops that didn't exist with Windows 8... I added my child to the account. I see him with his new e-mail address added to the account.&nbsp; I made him log out and log in with his new account and I had him
 accept the invite.&nbsp; Like I said, I see him with his new account in the Family Safety app... When I use his account to log into Family Safety, he sees himself and my account.&nbsp; So, it appears everything is connected as it should be.&nbsp; I also removed his old account
 that we used with Windows 8...&nbsp; HOWEVER, I log in with his account and there are no restrictions whatsoever.&nbsp; I also am not seeing any recent activity in my console, even though I know he's been using the computer.&nbsp; I've even logged on myself and had no trouble
 accessing things I'd like locked down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, I don't want my children buying ANYTHING from Windows Store...&nbsp; I don't care if it's for 3 year olds or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help me resolve the issue with Family Safety.&nbsp; I liked the product in Windows 8 and I don't necessarily hate the idea of tying it to an online e-mail, but it does need to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>

            You provided no help to this issue by posting these links. I am very upset at this point. We did the upgrade thinking that it would be a great transition. But now the feature that we used the most isn't working at all. I set up screen time and website
 blocking and none of them are working. The windows team is looking really foolish at this point if you ask me. In the age where more and more children are using laptops and pc's. As parents we are purchasing the devices for our children. I think windows looses
 big time if the device that once worked without issue no longer works anymore. And I also noticed that family safety can no longer be accessed from the control panel and I cannot mange the settings from the actual device. I have to log into a website. Which
 I think is stupid. This needs to be fixed immediately or windows is no longer suitable for children. This is something I think all parents should know.

            This is what I mean by "Family Safety on Windows 10 doesn't work... at all...". &nbsp;"How do you block Chrome?" &nbsp;I'd like to block every application on the system and make them ask me for what they need... I want a "least privileged" account that gives them
 access to nothing and I open up what I want. &nbsp;In the previous version, I could block Chrome and all installed browsers and force my children to log in through IE (which Family Safety has more control over). &nbsp;If you don't block Chrome, how are you preventing
 children from using "In Private" browsing there? &nbsp;The changes have basically forced me to look at other options concerning Family Safety, when I was pretty happy with the product before.

            BTW, I haven't allows my kids to use our workstation since I installed Windows 10... &nbsp;I'm probably going to have to look for some other solution, since they'll need to access for School. &nbsp;Also, the links you responded with are useless. &nbsp;It's not the configuration
 that is wrong, it's the product itself. &nbsp;I see a bunch of individuals who are having trouble because Family Safety is locking down their computer too much. &nbsp;It's as if Microsoft listened to just those individuals and stripped the product of all it's actual
 value.

            <p>I fixed sync issue of Family Safety on my box. I am unable to recollect where I read it from or who put it up so I apologize in advance to and thank the original poster of the solution. When I logged into my child's account, and went to the account page,
 it showed that account needed verification. Once I completed verification, familysafety worked fine and synced properly.</p>
<p>
Note to Microsoft: How many child users go to their account page in windows 10 once their account is created? Ans: hardly any. So if Windows 10 needs account to be verified, keep it in the notification area or a prompt immediately after each logon until verified.
 There was no way to know that account was "unverified" until I read the other post and went to Account page of child to confirm. Make Windows 10 user friendly.</p>

            I just bought a new computer with Windows 10, and cannot get Family Safety to work.&nbsp; I did enter a site to disallow, and that worked. I cannot see a list of websites visited. I log in with my child's account, and enter some websites. Then I log off and
 use the administrator id, to view the child account. Not even one site is listed.

            I have had family safety set up for a couple of weeks now and my child visits a lot of websites.&nbsp; There is nothing under visited websites!&nbsp; I had an e-mail once that told me that he had asked permission to visit a new website that had very explicit content
 and I added it to the blocked list.&nbsp; Does anybody have any visited websites showing up and if you do how did you get it to work.&nbsp; I don't have time restrictions on and I do get an activity report e-mailed to me that shows&nbsp;PC time usage.&nbsp; Under suspicious pages,
 latest blocked pages, and latest searches it says no results this week!&nbsp; This I know is not correct.&nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe my privacy settings are blocking&nbsp;some information from Microsoft?&nbsp;

<p>PCI ECP Parallel port Ready to use</p>
<p>then the printer was automatically detected, a driver of about 10MB was downloaded (I guess the same as above in my question) and after a few min HP LaserJet 4000 series PCL5 also ready to use !</p>
<p>Print page test ...Ok !</p>

    <title>How to get the charms bar in windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to get the charms bar in windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not one of the few who actually like Windows 8.1, in fact there's many who are quite impressed with&nbsp;8.1 and I'm one of them. I use a non touch laptop. And I don't see myself upgrading to Windows 10 if the Charms bar doesn't work like it does in Win 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find using the Charms bar extremely helpful and I see no reason why Microsoft can't include it in Windows 10 (it'll just take a few more codes). The option to use it like before should be made available. Using
<strong>Win Key+C</strong> is just too inconvenient as compared to using the mouse. If there is still time, Microsoft should include both worlds of Windows in their latest version, that is - windows 7 and windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I strongly feel using the Start menu is like going back in time, one can easily get everything done through the Modern UI, there is actually no need to go to Start, and I really don't mind switching between two interfaces. I guess some people just
 can't adapt to change. Windows 8.1 was going in a good, futuristic direction, but 10 kind of sets it back in time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either ways, I understand Microsoft would want to please as many people as they can, but take note, if you remove the charms bar, or make it too tedious to access, the next thing you would have is people whining over getting charms bar back. In the end its
 up to you, the consumer has many options available, from Linux, to Apple and even Google now plans to launch their own Google OS based laptops, so Microsoft, I think it would only&nbsp;do you good if you make Windows 10 a full blend of windows 7 style&nbsp;and windows
 8.1. Don't just abandon the key features of windows 8.1, it's a damn good OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I'm wrong and if there is a way to get the Charms bar in windows 10 more easily with the mouse, please do let me know</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Definitely agree that we need the charms bar, very useful to have. I do think that win 8.1 needed a start menu as well as start screen, start menu meant I could do certain things quicker without having to pin to taskbar. I have adapted to win 8.1 (unlike
 most people out there) and love it on both my surface and laptop (no touch screen).</p>
<p>Win8.1 is excellent. Even with mouse and keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please bring back charms bar! (or at least an easy way to reach the same functions)</p>

Right! But I don't think we're going to see the charms bar except in windows 8. Yes, you're right, having a proper start menu in windows 8.1 would have been really nice, sometimes I find it annoying having to switch between interfaces, although that's not as
 much annoying as are the Metro apps. Now, I don't dislike the metro apps (I used to like them), but I just feel that no one's working on updating them anymore, for instance, I downloaded the discovery news app and pinned it on my start screen with live tile
 turned on. It's been a few months since I installed the app, and the live tile headlines, snippets are still the same, they haven't updated and I was expecting them to otherwise what's the point of having live tile turned on. Similarly the MSN News app, does
 not show updated headlines in its live tile as does flipboard never show the latest stories in its live tile. So I feel no one is going to bother with windows 8.1 modern apps anymore. Microsoft has been clever in saying they would offer security updates&nbsp;for
 windows 8.1 until 2023 or thereabouts, because that's just what they're going to offer, nothing more than security updates. The windows 8.1 play store sucks, I mean it really sucks, I haven't seen a new app in there&nbsp;for months and the one's that are there
 don't even work properly. And because of these reasons, I thought of going in for the windows 10 upgrade, which earlier I was sure I wouldn't opt for, but then I found out office 2016 is only free on small screen and touch devices... bummer!

<p>When I upgraded to Windows 10 they replaced the charms bar with the action centre.</p>
<p>If you install pop charms you can get it back. yay!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;:)</p>

 OS is up to date. I can make calls with the IE plugin, but that is more complicated than some family members can handle.</span>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, I understand that you are unable to use skype desktop app on your Windows 8.1 laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might have occurred due to some changes made to your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have uninstalled and re-installed the skype desktop app, then I would suggest you to create a new user account and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you create new user account nothing will be lost, it is only the thing that it would be in the other user account which you are using right now. However creating new user account is a diagnostic step, if everything works fine in new user account we can
 easily move the files and programs to new user account.</p>

 as outlined at&nbsp;<a href="http://bit.ly/1KqjvII" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://bit.ly/1KqjvII</a>.
 &nbsp;That fixed the problem. &nbsp;The site suggested that there were as many as 50 references in the registry to delete. &nbsp;That was greatly underestimated. &nbsp;I took me more than an hour to delete them, although I got an error on an attempt to delete a few of them. &nbsp;I
 didn't restore my old Skype folder as the site recommends. &nbsp;When I logged into the new Skype install, all my contacts, etc. showed up.

<h2>            Is clean install necessary if using used hard drive with data on it&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello all, i have 2 quick questions. I am building a new computer using from scratch, but reusing my current 2tb hard drive and power supply. &nbsp;I plan on keeping all of my folders on that hard drive when installing windows 10 on the new computer. My plan
 is to download windows 10 and all of my files from my hard drive (just in case) &nbsp;onto a large enough flash drive, then using that flash drive to install windows onto the new computer.</p>
<p>1) will having the files( my pictures) on the same flash drive as the windows 10 download interfere with the new installation of windows?</p>
<p>2) will i have to delete my hard drive completely to install windows 10?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance! Alex</p>

<p>Before you can install Windows 10 from that thumb drive, what ever method you use to make it bootable, the drive will be formatted. So, make sure you backup the data on the thumb drive somewhere else safe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply Andre! But i am still a little confused. I am putting my files on the flash drive as my backup. Will using my old hard drive on the new computer erase all of the data on it and force me to upload it back from the flash drive or will
 it stay on there and no need for using the backup?</p>
<p>and will i be able to install windows 10 on the new computer from the flash drive if it has my backup folders on it as well as the windows installation? I am using the flashdrive instead of an external hard drive as my backup. My plan is to use the flash
 drive as my hard drive info back up as well as installing windows at the same time.</p>

<h3> catysullivan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is my brand new computer so slow&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    I recently bought an Acer ES1-111-C1MX series (i think...thats what it says on the bottom of my laptop.) It came with windows 8, has 4gb memory, 500 gb HDD, intel celeron processor n2840, intel hd graphics. Right out of the box this thing is running about
 as slow as my old laptop, and because the old one was so slow was one of the major reasons i decided to upgrade. Doesn't feel like an upgrade at all! My computer checks and installs updates weekly, sometimes more often, I don't really have anything on my disks
 to defragment. I mean i've had this new laptop for all of two weeks. I don't remember windows 7 being this slow right off the bat, so i feel like it might be the windows 8 interface? if thats the case is there a way to set this computer up with windows 7 instead?
 I'm just so confused and frustrated by this issue. 275$ for something brand new that runs basically as well as the one i wanted to replace. Ridiculous. Anyone else having this problem? Any Acer laptop users either?

            <p>Try diskcleanup, and defragmenting... YES! You HAVE something on the disk to cleanup and defrag: The SYSTEM!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you buy a new computer, which comes with Windows pre-installed, the manufactorers ALLWAYS have installed a lot of bloatware, also called "crapware". Let a friend take a look on it, and there can be much to uninstall - but there CAN be some sensible
 things, that you don't want to uninstall. Some of the [BEEEEP!!] can't be uninstalled - only deactivated - e.g. the registrations-pop-up, you allways see, when the computer is started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this, run Diskcleanup and defrag again, and also search for updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There may be MANY updates!! The recommended way to do updates is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't take them all in one time - this is all too much for the computer. Take e.g. 4 - 5 of them in one time, and the smallest of them first, get them installed, restart, take the next 4 - 5 updates, again the smallest of them, get them installed, and so
 on, until there isn't any more outstanding between Microsoft's servers and you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Run another diskcleanup and defrag - there's just only WORK with this... Sorry!!

<h2>            Windows 10 Restoration Incomplete and facing issues in installing Windows 10 on SSD &#40;the laptop contains one SSD and one HDD&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello All,<br />
<br />
I have a HP laptop and Windows 10 Home 64 came installed with it. My OS was installed on 1TB HDD that came with laptop. Recently I bought another SSD and installed it in place of CD ROM drive using a caddy. My plan was to install OS on SSD and use HDD for storage.
 But I could never install OS on SSD. I created USB drive using Windows Media Tool and went through the normal process of installing the OS. But when I choose the partition where I want to install my OS i.e. my SSD, the Laptop will get stuck on that step as
 soon as I click Next. I kept it like it for full night but no progress. to my surprise I was able to install Ubuntu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I left my laptop like that only and used the SSD as storage option. Then, yesterday I tried to factory reset my Laptop by click on esc just after switching the Laptop on and then pressing F11. I was able to start recovery of Windows 10 but my laptop won't
 be Restored. It will go till the point where it will show hp logo then login page of windows as an Administrator and then I will get error saying Restoration was incomplete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now my laptop is not at all in working condition. I am again trying to install Windows on my SSD but same issue as before. I have option of installing windows on HDD but I don't want to&nbsp; lose my recovery drive (in case). Plus I want to install OS on SSD
 and not HDD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me what can I do about it? Also, I have tried troubleshooting using USB boot by repair option. None of them worked because during the factory reset my laptop was reset to factory condition but It couldn't restore it back. So, now I am stuck
 in between.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really appreciate any help.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
P.S. Do you think the OS installation on SSD didn't work because I have installed it at place of CD ROM drive and it will work if I replace HDD with SSD.</p>
<p>

<p>To simplify the resolution of your situation, I would suspect that both the SSD and the original HDD are the same size.&nbsp; You could replace the HDD with the SSD and put the HDD in the caddy.&nbsp; On a UEFI device, it should not really matter where Windows is
 installed, unless the system still sees the connection to the caddy device as removable media.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing to check is if you have the option to select the SSD in the caddy as the first boot device in your UEFI firmware/BIOS settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The SSD has to show up as a UEFI boot device and be visible as that from BIOS.&nbsp; That means it needs to be a GPT disk with the right partitioning scheme (System files on a small FAT32 partition, etc.).&nbsp; Windows setup would normally take care of setting that
 up properly.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Hi Don,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for replying. I also believe that the system is considering caddy as a removable disk or may be the connection between the system and caddy is not that fast as compared to a normal SSD or HDD attached to its actual place (using layman language).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
To answer this "<span><strong>Another thing to check is if you have the option to select the SSD in the caddy as the first boot device in your UEFI firmware/BIOS settings</strong>.</span>" I would say that the BIOS do recognize
 my samsung ssd and I could see ubuntu and broken window boot options in boot menu. I could even boot ubuntu using the samsung ssd option from boot menu (window however never worked and I am not even sure how this entry was added to boot menu when the installation

<p>
</p><p>Also, regarding - "<span><strong>The SSD has to show up as a UEFI boot device and be visible as that from BIOS.&nbsp; That means it needs to be a GPT disk with the right partitioning scheme (System files on a small FAT32 partition,
 etc.).&nbsp; Windows setup would normally take care of setting that up properly.</strong></span>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think my previous answer clears this up and my SSD was visible from BIOS. I somewhere read when selecting the partition during installation we can just delete all partitions-&gt; refresh-&gt; and get one unallocated chunk of memory where we can install os. And
 Windows itself takes care of the partitioning scheme or format of the disk when you select an unallocated space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really appreciate you replying to this question, I will try to replace the SSD with HDD once and try to install OS while only one drive(SSD) is connected to the laptop in the HDD port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's see if that works.<br />
<br />
Just on the last note, I started installing windows on my ssd (still in caddy along with hdd) and this time after waiting almost 4 hours I could see that there are partitions created on my SSD (1-Recovery and 2 System). I clicked on the Unallocated space left
 on the SSD to see if it installs the OS on it but it has been hours again and the computer is still stuck.</p>

<p>Windows can be installed on a single partition on an MBR-initialized disk, but not on a GPT-initialized disk.&nbsp; You can delete all partitions and install to unallocated space (which is the recommended method for a clean install). Windows setup will then partition
 the disk according to Windows defaults and the GPT requirements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does sound like something about the disk connectivity in the caddy is slowing it down.&nbsp; If you had a way to connect it as a normal SATA disk, you would think it should work.&nbsp; Often removable devices instead connect to the USB bus. Once you get Windows
 running, you can check the connectivity of the caddy device in Device Manager by switching to view devices by connection.</p>

            Thank you for your response , first off the photos properties file type JPEG (.JP.G) just like that . So before i received your reply i &nbsp;attempted to open them again but this time from yahoo mail and instead of downloading all 7 photos or attachments i
 saved each individual picture and that &nbsp;allowed me to view them in photo viewer. so i hope this helps others out im still not sure about how to save and view from g mail &nbsp;though&nbsp;

<div>My problem, and details: </div>
<div><br />
</div>
I recently installed Windows 8 on an empty drive:D(shows drive:C in Windows 8) as a dual boot to Windows 7. Now when I want to remove Windows 7 I attempted to format Win 7 drive:C(shows drive:D in windows 8) I got a message "Windows was unable to complete the
 format". When I tried to do the same in cmd, I got the message "System partition is not allowed to be formatted. Format failed". Again in disk management "Windows cannot format the system partition on this disk". Please help me to get the Windows 7 drive space
 formatted. Any help would be greatly appreciated. :) Thanks!

            <p>That will not work, because Windows 7 is the boot drive where the boot information for both operating systems are stored. So Windows is preventing you from making your computer unable to boot if you do that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What you need to do is boot into Windows 7 and upgrade it to Windows 8, then you will be able to format that first Windows 8 install and delete the partition. It seems like you also installed Windows 8 on your recovery drive.

<p>We appreciate your response and all the additional information you have provided. The pop-up message that you're getting is nothing to be afraid of. It's basically reminding you some files or programs are still running and closing Windows will close those
 and anyone working on those programs will be kicked off. Examples of this are if the other users didn't close any program properly, they would still run in the background and the pop-up message could show up. The same goes for other programs that have been
 launched or used by the other remaining users on your computer. We would suggest checking the Task Manager and click "Users" to see the running programs that cause this pop-up message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if there are other concerns.</p>

<p>Hello Jomel,</p>
<p>It is not right. Today, the pc was switched off. I booted the computer and then signed on. After I finished working on my pc when I "shut down" I got the message " Someone else is still using this pc. If you shut down now, they could loose unsaved work"
 I was not happy with this message. I there fore as suggested by you checked the users in "Task Manager" There was a second user listed and the status was disconnected. See screen shots below. How do I stop this happening? This has never happened to me before
 the the latest upgrade.</p>

<p>As the screenshot shows, there is a user logged in together with your account. If you would look at the Memory tab, the user account is using 219.3 MB of memory and this could indicate that a program is running in the background under that user even if shows
 that it is disconnected. We advise having the user of that account log off properly and make sure that no applications under that user are running in the background.</p>

<p>Hello Jomel,</p>
<p>Thanks you for your reply. I am confused.</p>
<p>When the other user shuts down, the steps are...</p>
<p>1) close all open applications / programs</p>
<p>2) right click on the windows icon on the task bar</p>
<p>3) click on shut down or sign off</p>
<p>4) Click on Shut down</p>
<p>5) When the computer shuts down, and there is no power to the computer or th screen , the user switches off at the at the socket.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your message you say "we advise having the user of the account log off properly and make sure that no applications under that user are running in the background". Is there anything else the user has to do other than the 5 steps above?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For your information, When the user was logged on, and clicked on "Task Manager", it went straight to the Task Manager screen.</p>
<p>Normally, when I am logged on with my user ID and I click on Task Manager,&nbsp; it goes to a "User Account Control" pop up screen" with the message "Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device?".</p>
<p>Is there an explanation for this difference?</p>
<p>Is the user ID corrupted? If so how do I rectify that?</p>
<p>Look forward to heraing from you.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>

<p>The User Account Control pop-up mostly shows up on an account that doesn't have administrator rights for making changes to the computer. It also shows up for programs that must be given admin rights before they can be launched. If the user account doesn't
 receive any pop-ups for User Account Control, it could be that they are the one using the admin account and has full control of the computer.

<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Which
 update was installed prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Step 1</strong>: This seems to be a part of Windows Live essentials. Repair or re-install window live essentials and check if that help

<p><span><strong>Step 2</strong>: If that does not resolve, then check what happens in clean boot.</span></p>

<h3> snowballs1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Choose your keyboard Layout Stuck, keyboard doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>My computer blew out its PSU in the middle of doing homework (sooo mad, you have no idea). Loud bang and everything shut off. I bought a new PSU and it turns on and everything however, it runs a automatic repair which prompts me to select a keyboard layout.
 My keyboard doesn't turn on but has power running through it. Headset LEDS turn on but mouse and keyboard don't work. Tried connecting it to another source, works just fine but it doesnt work on my computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing is the keyboard works ONLY on STARTUP, I have like 5-7 seconds until it goes into "select a keyboard layout" and nothing works.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Configure USB settings in BIOS to allow it to work = no difference&nbsp;</p>
<p>restarting it x15 = no difference&nbsp;</p>
<p>checking connections of both keyboard and mouse = no difference&nbsp;</p>
<p>downloading a bootable USB = trying it a second time hope it works</p>
<p>Safe mode = ?, Tried looking for the hotkeys to it but it doesn't work. I tried every function button and del and esc</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could I go old school and use a keyboard with the weird circle connection and will it work then?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way around this WITHOUT downloading bootable devices because I dont have another device besides my roommates computer and he's got stuff to do besides helping me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help if possible thank you!</p>

<p>I figured it out! I did it!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you start research your motherboards "select boot device key". For MSI motherboards, BIOS is del key and F11 or F10 is the other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have 2 hard drives, disconnect the one that does not have the operating system on it. AKA your HDD you probably have all your files in, just in case the system deletes the files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here is how I did it:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Use another computer and download windows 10 onto a 8gb flash drive. (8gb because it is large enough to store windows 10. Also make sure the flash drive has nothing on it)</li><li>Go to this site&nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO and follow the instructions to download the file. PLEASE MAKE SURE IT IS A&nbsp;<strong>.ISO
</strong>OTHERWISE IT WILL NOT BOOT.</li><li>Once that is done, safely remove flash drive and plug into a usb port of the poop computer.&nbsp;</li><li>When you start up again, quickly and repeatedly hit F11 or F10 to get on a "select boot device screen."
</li><li>You should she 2 options, 1 is your original hard drive with the operating system and the USB drive. SELECT THE USB DRIVE.
</li><li>From then on, follow the instructions to download windows 10 onto the busted hard drive. Will take a while
</li><li>Once completed, shut off machine, unplug USB, replug in your HDD (or additional SSD if you have one).&nbsp;</li><li>Repeat step 4, but now pick the hard drive which has the newly installed operating system.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>It's a pain to go through but it will save your computer.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            &#91;Solved&#93; Windows 10 1809 Black screen no cursor after OS loading screen when resuming from hibernation</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the following behavior when resuming from hibernation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. BitLocker PIN is asked for.</p>
<p>2. OS loading screen appears.</p>
<p>3. It tries to switch from loading screen to login screen but apparently fails. A black screen is displayed. Monitor stays active and does not go into energy safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no cursor visible on the black screen. The machine is not responding anymore. Hitting the power button immediately shuts down the machine. Cold restart always works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed, that resume does work if no app (e. g. Chrome) is running. Also resuming from sleep mode does work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine is working just fine and also hibernation used to work. However, since performing a driver update and installing the latest windows updates, I am stuck with this weird problem. As a side note: I did also install a second SSD which is working
 fine. Can't imagine, it has anything to do with this. All my drives are encrypted with BitLocker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all the various hints and tips that google presented me, e. g.:</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Blindly entering the user's password.</p>
<p>* sfc /scannow</p>
<p>* Checking with chkdsk and dism</p>
<p>* Disabling fast boot</p>
<p>* Checking if signal ends up on another monitor</p>
<p>* Disabling Windows App Readiness service</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10.0.17763.195</p>

<p>FYI I sort of "fixed" the issue. I realized the other day, that the machine does also not boot up properly if "Fast Boot" was enabled and the machine had previously been shutdown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This lead me to the conclusion, that there must be something wrong with the fast boot feature, which is also used when doing hibernation which was most likely the reason, why resume from hibernation did also not work correctly.<br />
<br />
Since I fiddled around with partitions (trying to clone things to new SSD) right before the issue occured, I decided to wipe all partitions / volumes and perform a fresh install of Windows. I then installed all updates up to 1809 and then installed latest drivers
 for all components.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does now work correctly. No problems anymore.</p>

            Hi Sam.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />See if the following troubleshooting helps:

<br />
<br />The issue was widely reported in v.1803 but supposedly solved in v.1809, so check what version you have at Settings &gt; System &gt; About.  If not v.1809 then install the Media Creation Tool from this link <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>  choosing Download Tool Now, install the tool, open it and choose Upgrade this PC Now.  This will save your files and apps while bringing you up to the latest version by the most stable method.  It will also bring all of your Updates current and solve most problems since it reinstalls Windows.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<div>As for the Windows Version it’s : Version 1809 (operating System 17763.379)</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>All I know is that, originaly it was a Windows 8 home. It was upgraded to Windows 10 few years&nbsp; ago.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>I Added the Bluetooth headset Again from the control panel without trouble ( its a Sony MDR-XB650BT by the way) – no drivers specificaly available on sony’s website for that model infortunately&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>(I remind you that the Headset works perfectly with my Tablet, android phone and on the Groove Music app in my computer – The controls work.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>They just don’t want to work on Window Media Player 12 in my computer) as if the controls are switched by default only for Groove Music App.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I tried to switch the Bluetooth Support Service on automatic startup and it work. I’m restarting the computer and the bluetooth headset can't control WMP 12</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>I checked all the bluetooth devices on the device manager, they are all up-to-date and their rollback button are all grayed.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I did some research and think I pinpointed the origin of the problem, it's about the Audio/Video Remote Control Profile or AVRCP that allow me to control Media apps with my bluetooth headset</div>
<div>and it wont work with apps such as WMP 12</div>
<div><br />
<div>I tried an app called "Bluetooth Tweaker" see https://www.bluetoothgoodies.com/tweaker/?v=01000101&amp;osv=10.0.17763#avrcp-legacy but it wont allow me to Tweak the AVRCP to control WMP 12 with my headset</div>
<div><br />
<div>so problem not solve as of this time...&nbsp;</div>

            I noticed there are some important updates for this model you have not applied yet.
<br />
<br />BIOS Update October 2015
<br /><a href="https://ftp.hp.com/pub/softpaq/sp73001-73500/sp73062.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://ftp.hp.com/pub/softpaq/sp73001-73500/sp...</a>
<br />
<br />There is a chipset driver update from 2013 if you have not applied that yet:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://ftp.hp.com/pub/softpaq/sp63501-64000/sp63931.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://ftp.hp.com/pub/softpaq/sp63501-64000/sp...</a>
<br />
<br />Are you using a Bluetooth dongle by any chance? Because this system doesn't look like it came with Bluetooth built in. 
<br />
<br />Its possible the Bluetooth pairing functionality might be broken under Windows 10 1809 on your configuration.
<br />
<br />This means, you might need to downgrade to an earlier release where it worked.

    <title>Windows 10 cannot connect to the internet with a static IP - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeannaherring  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 cannot connect to the internet with a static IP</h2>
                    I recently purchased a new&nbsp;laptop that has Windows 10.&nbsp; I have this laptop for work and home.&nbsp; I am able to use the WIFI connection at home to get access to my internet, but when I go to work to use it we have to use a static IP (not my choice).&nbsp; When
 using the static IP the computer tells me that I have no network connection, but I can still print to the network.&nbsp; If I am connected by Ethernet I do not have any trouble with connection.&nbsp; It seems that the only difficulty&nbsp;is when I try to connect to the
 internet using a WIFI connection.&nbsp; I have checked the IP address multiple times to verify it is keeping the address and it is correct.&nbsp; Any suggestions?
