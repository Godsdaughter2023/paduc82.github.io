<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What is the make and model of the keyboard?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Is the issue confined with specific keys?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Which operating system is installed on your computer?</p>

<p>I can see emails that have been permanently deleted, but are the Skype for business conversations also stored in recover deleted items folder?</p>

<p>Hi <span>Dineshsharma.sn,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Are the Skype for business conversations also stored in recover deleted items folder?</em></p>
<p>- Yes. If you use Outlook,&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(47, 47, 47, 1)">your Skype for Business conversations are saved there, too, in the Conversation History folder. If you delete it, it will go to the
<strong>Deleted Items</strong> folder and can be recovered there.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the conversation has been deleted permanently and there is no result after using in-place eDiscovery, which means it is not feasible to recover it in Office 365 anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Lance</p>

    <title>Why is Windows 10 incompatible with all previous versions of - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alpha numero etc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is Windows 10 incompatible with all previous versions of WordPerfect.</h2>
                    <p>I am 75 yrs old and have been using WordPerfect since it was the first word processor to replace "Edlin." I have been writing hundreds of lines of poetry during those years and have attended both college and university to acquire four different degrees.
 The last in English Literature on June 13 of this year 2015.&nbsp;In consequence I have thousands of WordPerfect files, so you can imagine my horror on upgrading to Windows 10 and finding that it would not access any&nbsp;of those files and that it would also not permit
 "WORD" to access any of them. From my point of view it was&nbsp; a "virus" of epic proportions and since I can find nowhere to reach humankind for assistance within the volumes of so-called helpful aids provided by Microsoft I was forced to return to my Windows
 7 in order to regain access to a lifetime use of WordPerfect.</p>
<p>I would have believed this was an intent of Microsoft to force use of "Word," but for the fact my "Word" program won't access and translate those files in the manner it has done for many years. On pension I cannot afford $300.00 for a new "WordPerfect" program
 to make it compatible with "Windows" and I am of the belief that if it is Microsoft's intent to eventually force use of Windows 10 then it is their responsibility to assure full compatibility with other programs. So when can I expect that downloading Windows
 10 will NOT deny me access to a lifetime of poetry, essays, papers, personal writings and stored information in WordPerfect format. &gt;&gt;&gt; Richard</p>

DOES your instruction about Compatibility Mode installation of Word Perfect have to happen AFTER I download Windows 10 for a second time and what will this do to my years old personalization of my version of Word Perfect for my special use. As I have said my
 computer use is long standing, BUT very limited to what has been sufficient to satisfy my own needs and my long standing use of Word Perfect as it is now within my computers is a central part of that use. I do not believe I should have to destroy any part
 of that use in order to satisfy a failure within Windows 10 to make adequate effort to assure continued use of a program that pre dated the creation of Microsoft Word and most versions of Windows. Perhaps someone could tell me why this was not a considered
 factor in the development of Windows 10? &gt;&gt;&gt; Since your December message I have been going through diagnosis and treatment for cancer, but I would still like to move to the use of Windows 10 if my problem with Word Perfect can be solved. &gt;&gt;&gt; Yours T Richard

<p>Hi Lovely Nala,</p>
<p>it sounds like their support is confusing your forum invitation code with your digital game code. Either way its their forum you need access to so its odd to send you here!</p>
<p>As far as I am aware the email you deleted is sent from community[AT]elderscrollsonline.com &nbsp;with your forum invite code. Its not something generated by Microsoft as its a code for their own forums. There is some help info
<a href="https://help.elderscrollsonline.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/18679" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a> about getting help getting into the forums - direct from them - I think that's your best shot!</p>
<p>Hope that helps!</p>

    <title>Cant play after Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bunble bee xl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cant play after Update</h2>
                    
<p>i wa playing Mortal Kombat all night had to update this mourn the update then gave me a code
</p>
<p>Odd - First and foremost, there are those of us who have had to have our systems repaired several times over beyond the timeframe of the warranty. WHY we should be forced to suck up that cost for a problem in the base manufacturing in the first place is
 both asinine, and a total windfall on your companies part. It is acting in VERY poor faith towards your consumers.
</p>
<p>Second, I too am experiencing these problems after several repairs - Code ending in C810-1012. Two disc drives and a RRoD. As I've had to send and spend several times to get the console I payed an enormous amount for in the first place, I again say this
 is poor faith on the part of Microsoft. If there is anything you can do to resolve this issue, please do so.</p>
<p>Third, I called your tech support center, and a very nice young lady named Sue suggested I post my issues here in hopes they are resolved. I'd advise against informing anyone on this message board to call in, as they'll simply be told what I was. "This is
 what the error message means, and there's nothing we can do about it." Causing people to go in circles for something which may very well not be their fault is also a pretty poor tactic.</p>
<p>All and all, I'm EXTREMELY disappointed with the lack of support I've gotten on this issue thus far, and will be sharing my experience with as many people as I can in the future. To be quite honest, I do understand a representative of a company having a
 tendency to be defensive of said company, but I feel you've already implied that I, and others experience this problem are "liars." Given all of the money I've dumped into the system, the Live service, the repairs, et cetera, I would expect a slightly higher
 level of service than what's being provided.</p>
<p>So, rather than another "call support," I ask you... What exactly can we do to resolve this issue? to add to this i have over 800 ms points unused and they just renewed my member ship fpr a service i can no longer use if i am going to be forced to by a new
 console after i have done nothing wrong i think i will just be moveing on to Ps3 i know you dont care and no its not a threat i just wana know how a get a refund since service's were not rendered</p>

    <title>Windows 10 photo screensaver is such a disappointment - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dazzani  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 photo screensaver is such a disappointment</h2>
                    I really enjoyed the photo collage that Windows 8.1 provided. &nbsp;Especially when using multiple screens. Why can't this be replicated on Windows 10? I'm very tempted to switch back just for this silly option. If anyone knows a screensaver download option
 that is comparable let me know please.

</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community.</p>

</p><p>From the description provided, I understand that UAC prompt for Admin rights is not allowing you to perform file edit functions in Windows.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Also,<span>&nbsp;make sure that you have complete access over the flash drive.</span></p>
<p><span>(This is a work around step to find out if Windows UAC functions are disabled)</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the steps-</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Right Click on the pen drive and select “Properties”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Now, navigate to the “Security” tab and click on “Edit”,</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on “Add” and then type “Everyone” (without quotes).</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on “Ok”, highlight “Everyone” and place a check mark next to “Full Control”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on “Apply” and “Ok”.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Follow the below suggested methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>Place the computer in a Clean Boot state and check if there are any third party applications to be causing the slow down.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>A <strong>clean boot</strong> is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Steps mentioned for Windows 8/8.1, will work fine with Windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Disclaimer:</span></strong><span> Please go through the section: How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, temporarily disable the installed <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
antivirus/firewall software</span> installed in your computer to see if the UAC prompt is a security concern generated by a third party firewall solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">NOTE:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily
 disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p>I would have you perform the steps to gain permissions to a file, destination folder or drive-</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Click on “Start” and type “cmd” (without the quotations).</p>
<p><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Right Click on the “cmd” icon and select “Run as Administrator”.</p>
<p><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Now copy and paste the commands one by one and hit “Enter” after each command –</p>
<p>
</p><p>TAKEOWN /F &lt;type in the path of the folder (or drive) that you want to take access&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>ICACLS &lt;type in the path of the folder (or drive) that you want to take access&gt; /grant administrators:F</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3</strong></p>
<p>If it does not help, <span>I would suggest you to enable the built in administrator account and check with the results if you can perform the Windows update.</span></p>
<p><span>You need to run the command from an elevated command prompt. To do that you need to do the following:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Press the Windows key + R from the keyboard to open the&nbsp;Run Command Dialog Box&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Enter <strong>cmd</strong> and right-click on the <strong>Command Prompt</strong> result that should appear.</span>
</li><li><span>This opens a list of options at the bottom. Select <strong>Run as administrator</strong> there.</span>
</li><li><span>Accept the UAC prompt</span> </li><li><span>Enter the following command to enable the hidden administrator account:
<strong><span>net user administrator /active:yes</span></strong></span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope the above information was helpful. If you need further assistance, please do let us know and we would be happy to help you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You.</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>w<span>here I can download Conker 's Big Reunion for my XBOX ONE ? In Project Spark is offered on the start page for 1000 Spark-Coins and for premium users. I bought 1000 Spark Coins 9,99 €. Well, if i put the A button for "buying" it at the start page of
 "Project Spark" for normal users (Play and Create), it happens nothing. In the marketplace of "Project Spark" there's no downloadable "Conker" extensions even i set the filter!!!! ****?!
<span>n XBOX STORE nothing can be found</span>. <br />
<span>n XBOX STORE nothing can be found</span>. <br />
</span></p>
<p><span>I shot two photos. As I already said, if I try to "unlock" it for 1000 Coins, nothing happens. Whats the matter?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;I In the meanwile "Project Spark" got an update (at sample the start page of spark shows you the conker-download for the premium users). But still nothing works. It's a awesome downloadfail and there's something terrible wrong. Is it possible a location
 problem? </span></p>

<p>Much appreciate your answer. But, actually, nothing. There's nothing to find. NOTHING. Just this
<span>[Mod Removed]</span>&nbsp;offer I already descriped which does not work. Are you kidding me ? It's a german xbox one. Perhaps there are restrictions so I have to wait until it's midnight?!?!?!?!?!?!?</p>
<p>I paid already 10 € for this [Mod Removed]... I think will resign to play Conker. Thank's Microsoft .................</p>

<p>Ravija,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, you can install &amp; activate Windows again on your new SSD.&nbsp; I assume that your existing Windows is activated - this is essential so check first in Settings, Update &amp; security, Activation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can make your own installation disk - see <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install</a>&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>When you boot from the installation disk and run the installation you will be asked once or twice to enter the product key but, instead, you should use the bypass options that are given in the dialogs concerned [I am reinstalling / I do not have one / Not
 yet / ... - the wording keeps changing].&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>When you finish installation open up Settings, Update &amp; security, Activation so that you can watch its state change.&nbsp; Then go online and it will activate automatically without any product key being needed.&nbsp; This can take as little as a few seconds but can
 sometimes take longer - you can always force it to check activation by clicking on the button but I have never had to.</p>
<ul>
<li>This whole scheme is radically different to previous Windows versions where you needed to enter a product key.&nbsp;
</li><li>Now, providing that it was activated originally, your computer just contacts the MS activation servers, finds the record of the previous activation and re-activates without any other action being needed.</li><li>This automatic re-activation procedure takes place despite changing some hardware such as disks but will not happen for pre-installed Windows such as yours if you change the motherboard or CPU.</li></ul>

<p>Yes, you can move it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You didn't get an installation DVD because you instead got a recovery partition on the drive. The first thing you should have done when you got the computer was to follow the manufacturer's instructions to copy the contents of that partition to a DVD so
 you have something if the drive dies. Do it now.</p>

<p>Yes, you have a couple options for moving the installation:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Option 1: you can create a recovery drive, install the new SSD then reinstall Windows 10:</p>

<span>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft
 Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span><span><span>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</span></span></span></span><span>You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span><span><span>There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter,
 you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key </span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>you already own</span></span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span><span>to
 reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p>Ravija,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1&nbsp; You had&nbsp;quick responses because you explained your question well.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>2&nbsp; Yes, if your previous Windows 10 was activated then the new installation will also get activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3&nbsp; Ken Blake made a good point - before removing your old drive, check your HP manual &amp; their support website if necessary to see if they provide a method for extracting their "factory restore" partition to a USB memory stick**.&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
<li>Using that to reinstall will ensure that you have all the correct drivers straightaway.</li><li>There might still be useful driver updates [through Windows update or on the HP site] that have been published since your "factory restore" partition was created.</li><li>There will also be standard Windows updates [through Windows update] because the "factory restore" partition was only fully up-to-date the day it was created.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>4&nbsp; [**&nbsp; All computer companies are different so they adopt different solutions to the issue of reinstallation.&nbsp; HP might or might not allow you to transfer the "factory restore" partition to a USB memory stick.&nbsp; They might help you in a different way by
 providing, say, an ISO file you can download and turn into an installation USB {in which case they will provide instructions for doing so}.&nbsp; Only your computer manual, the HP website {including its user forums} or other users of your computer model can tell
 you what HP do for your computer model.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>5&nbsp; YuanSR also made a good point.&nbsp; I have also transferred everything to a new SSD from&nbsp;the original&nbsp;HDD using a system image.&nbsp; Using the "factory restore" partition method or the normal install method [my first post] are more straightforward in my opinion.&nbsp;
 If you are comfortable with using the procedure that YuanSR gave you a link to then by all means do it that way.&nbsp; I have been using system images for many years and am always comfortable with using them but I do not know if a major task such as this would
 be alright for somebody who is not already familiar with system images - hence my caution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6&nbsp; I have not seen anybody else refer to <em>slowness </em>when talking about a recently bought computer.&nbsp; Perhaps you could raise a separate question in this forum describing that
<em>slowness </em>and asking for advice.&nbsp; Perhaps it is something that the HP website or the HP user forums can help you with as well.&nbsp; You might find a solution that is cheaper &amp; easier than buying an SSD.</p>

<h2>            Audio Robotico con una Acer Veriton Z291G al reproducir archivos de sonido</h2>
                    <p>Hola!</p>
<p>Tengo un problema. Hace un mes mi novio me regalo una Acer Veriton Z291G (Windows&nbsp;7 Starter,Procesador Intel(R) Atom(TM), CPU D525, RAM 2.00 GB&nbsp;) &nbsp;y no la venia usando mucho por que no estaba mucho en casa. Pero ahora ya van varias veces que cuando reprodusco
 archivos de sonido, tanto grabados por mi como algun que otro mp3 el audio en algunos momentos de la reproduccion suena como robotico y desfazado. Alguien tiene una idea de que puede ser? Alguien mas tuvo un problema con esto o sera que tengo que cambiar la
 pc?....bah a esta altura mandarla a reparar por que creo que ya paso el periodo de cambio.</p>
<p>Agradecere alguna pista de lo que pueda estar sucediendo.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Window unable to start 0x8000ffff to blame</h2>
                    Last night I installed 13 Windows 7 updates, shut down, and went to bed. I forgot that I had left an MP3 Player plugged into a USB port. This morning, when starting the computer, an error occurred and Windows failed to start. The start-up repair utility
 ran, but was unable to fix the problem. The logs were no help, because the problem is unidentified. System restore was unable to resolve the issue. The only error code I get indicates 0x8000ffff is at fault. Is there anything that can be done other than a
 fresh install?

            <p>&nbsp;I'm confused.&nbsp; You say your computer was unable to start, but you had tried System Restore.&nbsp; If it was unable to start, how were you able to try System Restore?&nbsp; Was this possibly in Safe Mode?&nbsp; Normally I'd recommend booting to Safe Mode and trying System
 Restore to a couple of days earlier (you have to check the box that says Show more restore points), but is that what you've already tried?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;FWIW I installed the same updates yesterday on my Windows 7 64 bit laptop with no problem except for the looooonnnng time it took to install them.&nbsp; In fact I have to say I've been installing all the critical updates on 32 computers since 1998 and never
 had a problem with any of them.&nbsp; I wonder if folks who've had these problems might've made changes to the registry by chance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I'd also try booting to Safe mode and doing a full virus scan.&nbsp; Note that some viruses can hide themselves from your antivirus program in normal mode, so you really need to scan in
<strong>Safe Mode</strong>.&nbsp; To get into Safe Mode when you first power up, hit F8 about once a second until you get the menu and select Safe Mode.&nbsp; Then run a full system scan.<br />

<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/windows-explorer-has-stopped-working/6ab02526-5071-4dcc-895f-d90202bad8b3">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/windows-explorer-has-stopped-working/6ab02526-5071-4dcc-895f-d90202bad8b3</a><br />
<br />
- <br />
&nbsp;You can check for corrupted system files.&nbsp; Open an administrator command prompt and run SFC if the above doesn't help. Click START, then type CMD in the search box, right-click CMD.EXE and click Run as administrator. Then from the command prompt type sfc /scannow.<br />
-<br />
&nbsp;Finally if all else fails, you can check the rather cryptic system event log.&nbsp; To do so click Start -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Administrative Tools -&gt; Event Viewer.&nbsp; Once in Event Viewer click on the system log and scroll through the entries looking for those flagged
 "error" to see if you can find hints as to where the problem could be.<br />
&nbsp; `</p>
<p>&nbsp; If none of the above helps, it'll be time to restore from a backup, restore to factory settings, or reinstall.&nbsp; Doing periododic full system backups is an almost necessary thing to do if you don't want to suffer the pain of doing these things because sooner
 or later your kind of problem will happen to&nbsp;all computers.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;I hope this helps.&nbsp; Good luck.<br />

            I'm sorry. What I meant to say is that Windows won't start. I can fire up the hardware, but Windows encounters difficulties and tries to repair its start-up routine. When it can't do that, it gives me an option to try a system restore, or advanced options
 (memory test, image restore, etc). Any communication I am having with the system is from these screens or the logs generated by these functions. I cannot start in safe mode because Windows isn't getting quite that far. The system restore option fails to resolve
 the issue. 0x8000ffff was the only concrete information I was able to get.<br />
<br />
I tried booting from my installation disk to do a repair that way, but that failed to produce positive results, as well. I have the option to do a clean install, but the repair function wants me to restart the system and use a prompt from the start menu. If
 I could access the start menu, I wouldn't need to repair my Windows installation...<br />

            <p>Are you hitting F8 multiple times immediately after powering on?&nbsp; If so, and you can't get to the Advanced Boot menu, you'll have to restore to factory settings, restore from a backup&nbsp;or reinstall.&nbsp; At this point I hope you see for the need for making periodic
 full system backups.&nbsp; The school of hard knocks is a great teacher, but it is a painful one.&nbsp; :-(</p>
<p>&nbsp;When you boot from a DVD, you need to hit something like F12 to get to the menu that allows booting from other than your hard drive.</p>

            I can access the BIOS screen, yes. I have no factory settings to restore it to...I built it myself. I've only had Windows 7 for a few weeks, so I was hoping someone had a simple solution to my problem before I went to the trouble of reinstalling the OS.
 Now I know to make sure all peripheral devices are unplugged before updating.<br />
<br />
All of my files are backed up, so I'm not losing anything other than a few game saves. Once I get everything reinstalled and updated, I'll create an image to restore to if this should ever happen again. I wasn't aware that this was an option.<br />
<br />
Thanks for taking the time to help and thanks for your input!<br />

            <p>&nbsp;I wasn't talking about the BIOS setup when I mentioned F8 and the <strong>Advanced Boot menu</strong>.&nbsp; It's that menu that allows you to boot to Safe Mode.&nbsp; It also allows you to boot to the command prompt.&nbsp; From the command prompt you can run SFC with
 the command <strong>sfc /scannow</strong>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;I doubt if leaving the USB device is the cause of your problem.&nbsp; Had you made any registry tweaks or installed some program that could've been infected with a virus or malware?&nbsp;
</p>

<p>&nbsp;Good luck.</p>

            I see what you're saying now. I will give your suggestions a try in the morning.<br />
<br />
I built this system and installed Windows 7 several weeks ago. I had no problems whatsoever. I installed some older games for my kids to play and one day about a week ago the computer crashed hard. It wouldn't reboot. That's when I discovered the start-up repair
 and system restore utilities. A restore point from before the games were installed was successful.<br />
<br />
It ran trouble-free for another week. Last night, I was notified that there were 13 Windows updates to install, so I installed them. There were no other changes to the system. When we went to start the computer in the morning, it wouldn't boot. A virus is a
 possibility, but I'm pretty fanatical about scanning the system. I use four or five different products, but I haven't done a scan in safe mode...only in regular operating mode. I'll check into it in the morning also.<br />

            &nbsp;I wish I understood the connection between updates and problems folks here report.&nbsp; I've been applying critical updates since '98 on 32 computers and never seen any problems with any of them. Wed. and yesterday I applied all the updates to 7 systems with
 no problems.&nbsp; That includes one Vista, 3 Windows 7 32 bit Home Premium, 2 64 bit Home Premium, and one 32 bit Professional.&nbsp; Did you by any chance run one of the registry cleaners or do a registry change of some kind?&nbsp;

            I do regularly run Glary Utilities which has a registry repair component to it. I have never had a problem with it in the past, and I hadn't run it for a few days before the Windows updates of Wednesday night. None of the other updates I have run ever
 complained. As I said, I am fairly new to Windows 7 and this is only the second hiccup I have encountered with it. Before this, I ran an XP SP3 machine for several years and never had a problem with updates, even with cleaning the registry on a regular basis.<br />
<br />
This time was different. I shut down the system and installed updates. When I left it, everything was fine.<br />
<br />
When it was started the next morning, there was an error (I wasn't there so I don't know what it was) and Windows refused to start. By the time I got to it, it was at the start up repair utility phase.<br />
<br />
I have to assume that the updates had something to do with the failure. A boot sector virus could be to blame. Or it could be a hardware problem (HDD being the suspected culprit). I find the timing to be too coincidental for the updates not to be responsible,
 but stranger things have happened.<br />
<br />
I haven't had an opportunity to try booting in safe mode yet. I'll let you know how that works out when I do.<br />

            <p>&nbsp;All the community stars, MVPs and forum moderaters here will tell you the same thing about registry cleaners.&nbsp; They don't help appreciably, they're unnecesary, and can cause problems.&nbsp; The term
<em>snake oil </em>is often used to describe them.&nbsp; I'm highly inclined to believe that's the root cause of your problem.&nbsp; I'm certainly not right 100% of the time, so if I'm wrong this time, you won't get a virgin!&nbsp; :-)</p>

            <p>&nbsp;My THEORY, and it's just pure speculation you understand, is that MS has put things in the registry for future use that don't appear to be used for anything to the registry cleaners, so they delete them.&nbsp; Then when the updates come along that try to use
 these deleted entries, wham-o, the vigaro hits the mixmaster.&nbsp; Just pure speculation you understand, but it seems to make sense to me, tying the pieces of this mystery together.&nbsp; If anybody has a better idea, I'd love to hear it.</p>

            Yea sometimes HDMI cables go out, try a different cable. Also check to make sure you have it plugged into the right port... there is a HDMI “in” &amp; “out” port.

<p>There are a few things to help identify where the issue is, some might not work if you don't have the equipment, but it'll help find out where the problem actually is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start with the cable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Try a different cable with same device and same port on TV</li><li>Try that same cable to a different device, see if it displays</li></ul>
<p>Check port on TV:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check that cable into a different port on the TV </li><li>Make sure the input and the port match for the TV</li></ul>
<p>Check the TV:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can other devices connect and display on that port/input?</li></ul>
<p>Check the device:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Does the device display on other displays?&nbsp; With different cables?</li></ul>

            It sounds like it could be the TV or the cable still. I would try Palmettos suggestions first just to be sure it's not an easy fix. Are you able to try the console on another TV by chance ?&nbsp;

<p>If the resolution is 640x480 try this:</p>

            Thank you for the reply.<br />
<br />
It happens with the Master Volume which of course affects all sound on the PC, so its&nbsp; causing me on each boot to manually set the Master Volume back up to 100%.&nbsp; Before installation of the headset my PC always booted up with the correct volume levels.<br />
<br />
The model I purchased is the Microsoft LifeChat LX 3000, Model number 1084.<br />
<br />
I've tried several times to set the volume back to 100% but on every boot it just defaults back to 50% Master Volume.<br />
<br />
I'm also running the latest sound card drivers<br />
<br />
I'll look into performing a clean boot and see if that resolves the issue.<br />

            <p><span>Hello Mike.Hu,</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to disable enhancements and check how it works.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to disable speaker audio enhancements.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Open Audio Devices and Sound Themes by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking Hardware and Sound, and then clicking Sound.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the Playback tab, click Speakers, and then click Properties.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click the Enhancements tab, and then select the Disable all enhancements check box.</span></p>
<p><span>If you don't see an Enhancements tab in the Speakers Properties dialog box, those features are not available for your speakers and this procedure
 is not applicable to your computer</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>

            Knowing that my system behaved properly before installing the headset software, I decided to disable LifeChat.exe from starting up and the volume now stays put at 100%.<br />
<br />
I neglected to mention before that I also have the Microsoft Wireless Desktop 3000 (mouse and keyboard) so I guess there's some conflict with the software between the keyboard volume controls and the ones that the headset uses.<br />

<h2>            Share with Specific People&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm a novice at networking but have been getting by using homegroups for a specific office setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have 8 PC's on the network, but only 3 of them on a homegroup that enables us to share files with
<strong>only</strong> those 3 machines. (full read write access)</p>
<p>Now that homegroups are retired, the machines still have shared access only with each other and are still isoated from the other machines, without issue (not sure how).&nbsp; I have a new employee that needs shared access to these existing 3 machines and still
 maintain privacy from the others on the network.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can't seem to figure out how to "Give access to Specific People" to share the files of the other machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>when I get the add user screen, I can't figure out the syntax or method to add a user from the new machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get a message that says "windows was unable to find user "station-mobile\linda"" (where station-mobile is the computer name and linda is the user)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe I'm going about this all wrong, does it see the user over the network?</p>

Suspect antivirus/security programs as the root cause - Norton, McAfee, Kaspersky, TrendMicro and<br />
others often cause such issues.</p>

Right-click your monitor and choose Uninstall and confirm in the popup.</li><li>On the toolbar, click the "Scan" button (4th from the end on my toolbar, it has a magnifying glass on the icon).</li><li>After it refreshes, try adjusting your brightness again from the <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fskeene.net%2fanswers%2fwin8.jpg" />+C settings menu.</li></ol>

<h3> skuggles  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to connect other profiles with my xbox live account</h2>
                    
<p>I created a windows live account years ago to play a pc game. This Christmas the family got an xbox. When I tried to make an xbox live account it wouldnt let me do it with my email address because I already had a profile under that address. I downloaded
 the old profile to the xbox, but I dont want to use that profile because I have several achievements on the profile I created on the xbox. Also, how would the other people in my family connect to xbox live using my account? Does every profile have to have
 its own seperate xbox live account? Any help is appreciated. Thank you.</p>

<p>Not so sure about the other parts but all the other accounts would need to have gold live if they wanted to play online even if they're on the same xbox as another account that has gold.

<p>Every profile does need it's own microsoft account.</p>
<p>As for yours, you can create a second email to put the lesser wanted profile onto, so you can use the email for your main profile.</p>
<p>Beyond that, each profile on the xbox would need it's own Gold subscription to play online, but you can look into the specifics of the family gold.</p>

<p>Hello Skuggles, just press the xbox button and hit logout. Then press the xbox button again and log in into the account you have achievements and you want to use, after that hit "sign up for xbox live" and choose a different email account from that one you
 used in the other account. After that your profile will be connected to xbox live and just set it to auto sign in and everybody dont have to worry about profiles, everybody will be using the same.</p>
<p>Hope it helps.</p>

            You are having a problem because the software will not run on a 64-bit operating system. Your Vista was 32-bit and your new Windows 7 is 64-bit. The
<i>eJay Dance 7</i> software specifies compatibility with "<span><i>Windows 2000, Windows Vista, Windows XP"</i> only.</span><br />
<br />
<p>
I believe you will need to run and install&nbsp;<strong>Virtual PC</strong>&nbsp;in&nbsp;<strong>XP Mode</strong>&nbsp;to have any chance of a fully operational 16 bit subsystem. If you are running Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate, you can use Windows XP Mode and Virtual PC.</p>

<p>
<em><strong>Note</strong></em>: you cannot run XP Mode on Windows Home editions. If you are using Windows 7 Home Premium, you would need to use<strong><em>&nbsp;Virtual Box</em></strong>,<strong><em>&nbsp;DosBox</em></strong>&nbsp;or any other 3rd party virtualization program
 that works with Home Premium. Please visit forums dedicated to these programs for more information.</p>
