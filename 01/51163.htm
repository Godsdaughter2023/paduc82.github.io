Hey there,</p>
<p>What DPil is talking about is deleting individual sites and can be used to delete websites you have pinned to your 'favourites' and individual 'frequent' sites with great effect. To get rid of the 'frequent' list (which is different than the favourites list)
 altogether, while in internet explorer, swipe from the right and touch 'settings,' then touch 'internet options,' then touch 'delete history.' You can do this from the desktop as well, and if you want instructions on how to do it that way, please let is know.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope that helped,</p>

            <p><span>Hi Rusalka,<br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
From your issue description I understand that you want to remove credentials for virtual app.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Credential Manager allows you to store credentials, such as user names and passwords that you use to log on to websites or other computers on a network by storing your credentials.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Windows can automatically log you on to websites or other computers. Virtualapp/Didlogical is a credential that is stored when
 you use any of the Windows Live products, this can include Windows Live Messenger, Windows Live Mail, Windows Live Sign-In Assisstant,
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
You may delete the entry from the Credential Manager by following these steps<br />
a. Open Control Panel, click on Credential Manager.<br />
b. Click on the dropdown icon of the entry Virtualapp/Didlogical.<br />
c. Click on Remove from Vault.</span></p>
<p><b><span>For any Windows related assistance in the future, feel free to contact us and we will be glad to help.</span></b></p>

<h2>            &#34;Error&#58; Another instance is running&#59; Configuration System failed to initialize&#34;</h2>
                    Reference the error message on Startup which crept onto my Desktop a few days after I installed Windows 10:&nbsp;&nbsp;"Error: Another instance is running; Configuration System failed to initialize". I have looked at and tried of the fixes suggested, including uninstalling
 Adaware, but although the error message has at last disappeared, the problem that accompanied it has not gone away. This is that I am unable to open folders via the shortcuts which all have on my Desktop. I have to use a 'cheat' instead, and open them via
 Adobe Acrobat, and even then it is tortuous. I have wasted many frustrating hours trying to get rid of the error, and even more time having to access my folders using a tortuous and time-consuming 'cheat'. When is Microsoft going to produce an update which
 will correct these errors automatically?

Hi,</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
I find your reply baffling: firstly, I simply downloaded Windows 10 when offered a free upgrade, mindful of the fact that Windows 7 (installed when I bought this laptop new) would not be supported forever; in addition to which a year or so ago the updates stopped,
 and every&nbsp;attempt to download and install&nbsp;updates failed. I have no idea which version of Windows 10 I installed: how should I know?</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
Secondly, as per my original message, the issue is that I now can't open folders via my desktop short-cuts, which I use for almost all folders. That includes 'This PC' and 'Recycle Bin'.&nbsp;&nbsp;I can still open word files and PDFs&nbsp;directly, even one via its short-cut.
 The only way I can open folders is via Adobe Acrobat Reader, then telling it to open all files at each stage as I get into folders and open any sort of files (mostly Word documents and photos). I made no changes before the problem appeared.</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
I have already tried most of the methods mentioned in the original dialogue on the topic:&nbsp;"Error: Another instance is running; Configuration System failed to initialize", all to no avail, including working through your suggestion. I remain angry and frustrated.</p>

            <p>Dear Greg,</p>
<p>I do appreciate your help, though I had no idea that this service was being provided by volunteers; I mistakenly thought this was a service provided by Microsoft. Certainly, I intended no offence, though I can't understand why my use of the word 'baffling'
 was taken to mean anything other than that I was in no position to know which version of Windows 10 I had downloaded, not being aware that there was more than one. Equally, I stand by my comment that I am angry and frustrated, which is not aimed at anyone
 personally but at Microsoft; I rely on my laptop for work, and have wasted much time and effort trying to get round a problem which Windows 10 seems to have introduced. In the meantime, I have worked through several more attempts to solve the problem without
 success. I can't take my laptop to a shop because I am about to go abroad for several weeks, and need to be able to work while away. If anyone can tell me which bit of software enables the user to open folders direct from the desktop, I'd be grateful.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>OK Greg, I have now tried working through most of the checklist, but to no avail. Some of the suggestions I couldn't perform anyway, precisely because of the problem I am experiencing: not being able to open elements I need, even in the Start menu. I have
 tried to reload Windows 10, but my PC doesn't seem willing to take this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To reiterate: when I start up, a window soon appears on my desktop with the message at the top of this thread. I did remove Adaware at one stage, and the message disappeared, but not the problems. Then, clicking on any icon except for Control Panel, Word
 documents and PDFs actually on my Desktop (documents I've put them there because I need instant access) provokes a blank screen for a few moments, then an audio signal and a message stating that I have files waiting to be burned to disk (I haven't!). As mentioned
 before, the only method I have discovered, and am having to use, is to open folders by using Adobe Acrobat, then using 'open with...' when I get down to documents, music or photos.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried many other strategies using my limited knowledge and my instincts, and interestingly when I try to establish the status of File Explorer, which I suspect may be the problem, it has three tasks attached to it all to do with the CD disc drive,
 which seems to explain the message which keeps popping up. I have also looked at other forums online; my type of problem seems quite common, and one which creeps in a short time after Windows 10 is installed. Could this be as a result of an corrupted update?
 A number of fellow sufferers out there seem to suspect that the 'free' Windows 10 Download from Microsoft, which then gives rise to problems, might be a ploy from Microsoft to persuade users to buy Windows 10 at full price!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologies for this long update; I have been away from home for over a week and will be for the next month, still needing to use my laptop; I will then have a month of very intensive work, all relying on my laptop. Having wasted a huge amount of time already
 with no result, it seems that I have little choice other than to continue using it as it is, rather than risk further tinkering which might risk losing work, or causing the laptop to fail completely.</p>

            <p>Hi Greg, thanks for the speedy reply. Firstly, as I explained, I am being prevented from accessing some of the features necessary to carry out these steps, notably Command Prompt for instance. Secondly, when I have managed to get into Windows/File Explorer
 (I seem to have both), I can see that they are set to manage CD player functions (and nothing else), but I can neither remove those nor add anything else. Thirdly, I have not been in a position to keep in touch at every stage because I was travelling, often
 not with access to the Internet. Finally, it was not I who suggested that Microsoft is 'playing games', but as I said, others who had posted on other help forums I tried. I will continue as time and opportunity permit to work through your new suggestions above,
 but will be travelling again for the next few days. I will let you know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Hi Greg, believe it or not I now have everything working properly! Not sure how as I have not had time to do anything myself. However, last night my laptop installed some updates. I can only assume that these included updates from Microsoft which rectified
 whatever the malfunction was, because having just opened up my desktop, quite unexpectedly I now have access exactly as before the problem arose a few weeks ago. Many thanks for your attempts to help, and I apologise for not having had the time or competence
 to follow through with your suggestions. Your efforts are appreciated!

<p>Got to step 9, program wouldn't start. Had to leave so I shut down my Computer.</p>
<p>Came back home, turned it on, now I have this:&nbsp;<a href="http://imgur.com/GRqWyRV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Picture of my screen</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I can click the only visible button on error box, it goes away.</p>
<p>I can click the rest of the screen, it flips up (like it would when logging in), and get this:&nbsp;<a href="http://imgur.com/bZ4hJXg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Second screen</a></p>

</p><p>the 'login' screen will not accept the password as I type it normally on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i go on vacation in 12 1/2 hours, so forgive me if I cannot respond immediately to any solutions. Sorry for the use of imgur, I'm on my iPhone to post this, and the site does not want to upload my pics straight from my device.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>ANSWER &amp; EDIT:</strong> I posted in a reply my answer and solution, albeit with a ton of ranting. If you are not Microsoft Support, please bear with me, I am extremely irritated with their lack of sense. If you ARE microsoft support, please pay attention
 to everything. If its a problem like this, every word counts. I realize I forgot to mention the symbol font in the post, but the TITLE OF MY QUESTION THAT YOU CHANGED, stated it. I was freaking out because my precious computer was dying to me. That's what
 it felt like. My first question as support would have been "Where does the Symbol Font fit into your question, I don't see you mention it, except the TITLE I'M CHANGING TO SOMETHING UNRELATED TO THE PROBLEM". Well maybe not those exact words.</p>
<p>I'm VERY dissatisfied.</p>

<p>I will now repost the images I took ON MY PHONE BECAUSE CAN'T TAKE A SCREENSHOT,

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>I had a couple options at this point:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>Take my computer to a tech service who would likely charge me $60-80 or more.</span></span></p>

</p><p>At this point I want to express how much I <strong>ABOSULTELY. [F-word redacted]-ING. HATE.</strong> the fact you no longer provide a physical way to get the product key when purchasing computer. This would have made my life easier, but no, now I am left

<p>
</p><p>So with my 3 options that actually relate to my problem present, I immediately forgo the first one. Screw off IT man, I don't want anyone to touch my baby. Also, you probably would've given up and chrgd another $40 dollars to send it to someone who can actually

<p>Like really? How do FORGET that the company you WORK FOR has an entire set of pages designed to download a program that can put onto a flash drive, the
<strong>ENTIRE WINDOWS 8.1 INSTALLATION PROGRAM</strong> onto a Flashdrive or CD?<br />
Anyway. Medi Creeation Tool, download the .exe. Run it, I'd say put it onto a flash drive.
</p>
<p>(Here was yet another issue. It would not work with a 16gb USB 3.0. It failed 15 times. Luckily a friend had a 64gb USB 3.0, and it worked. I don't know what the issue was, the program was only 4gb large.)</p>
<p>This is the difficult part:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Do you know or have you written down the Product Key for windows 8.1?
</span></p>
<p>If Yes, jump to 1.)</p>
<p>No? Was it because <em>Microsoft doesn't give you a physical COA with your product key on it
</em><strong>or</strong> <em>you never ran a program to extract your key from BIOS</em><em>?</em> Probably. Honestly, who expect a failure of the system so bad it doesn't let you log in, or even read the text on the screen? Sigh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.) You have your product key? Well, then run the .exe you just downloaded, and move through the windows. Step 1: product key, step 2:_________, Step 3: Profit!</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.) No product key. This is a difficult choice. You can either bring it to a tech and pay out the bum for him to maybe fix it or send it off to be fixed, or you can just modify the files on the flashdrive. Doing this will inadvertently make the Flashdrive
 Boot and you will install a trial windows 8.1 version. Windows 10 can be found for 70-110$ easily, depending on package and place of retail.</p>
<p>I chose the Windows 8.1 Trial method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So for this you need to connect that flashdrive to the computer you used to download the windows creation tool. Once again, I'm lucky I had a friend who let me use theirs so I could do all this.</p>
<p>Open the USB:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/51763074-e6c0-41aa-adf8-0fb4b7272ed9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/51763074-e6c0-41aa-adf8-0fb4b7272ed9" /></a></p>
<p>From here, click "Sources"</p>
<p>In this folder create a text document using notepad.</p>
<p>Write these exact lines in it:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ec315b56-adf2-458c-984a-9c8428262295" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ec315b56-adf2-458c-984a-9c8428262295" /></a><br />
Now, save it as ei.cfg:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b0a4d939-99fd-43ad-8244-e38830509646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b0a4d939-99fd-43ad-8244-e38830509646" /></a></p>
<p>Kablammo.</p>
<p>From here, you plug that into your broke as ****, microsoft's support engineers are uselss to me, annoying light screen and symbols showing computer.</p>
<p>This is the tricky part. I have my BIOS set up to boot from a USB by default, FIRST. Always, and it has paid off.</p>
<p>You need to get your computer to boot through the USB. When it comes up, fill out the options (asks you the language of stuff and such).</p>
<p>Next it gives you a purple-ish screen, which says 'install' in the center. Press it, and it bypasses the product key in favor of loading your Trial Version.</p>

<h2>            I don&#39;t know the &#34;Network Credentials&#34; for my desktop computer.</h2>
                    I have a laptop and a desktop that are connected to an external hard drive through my Asus router. I can access the external hard drive from my laptop via the wifi network. When I try to access the same hard drive the same way from my desktop, I am forced
 to enter a username and password that I don't know. Until recently, I was able to access the remote hard drive from the desktop, but I don't know what changed that. So, what can I do about the "Enter Network Credentials" that I am supposed to enter??? How
 can I find the username/password, or how can I bypass the Credentails screen and gain access to the remote hard drive like I used to? Thanks in advance.

<p>so we cant claim any points on my sons account and there's over 200,000 to redeem. This account used to be linked to mine,&nbsp;<strong>[Mod Removed]&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;but this address is now obsolete and also&nbsp;<strong>[Mod Removed]&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;and all the rewards on Sam's
 account are what I've earned since 2005. I want this looking into asap as we have spent alot of money over the years, thousands on digital downloads and I have a gamer score of 40,000 so time spent too. We have enough to redeem for an upgrade to Xbox 1 but
 can not claim the points this Is very annoying.</p>

<h3> purplehayes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error Code 52E when trying to install Windows Updates</h2>
                    My computer is doing strange things.&nbsp; Win 7, 64 Pro.&nbsp; Norton AV installed and current.&nbsp; It wont install anything, windows updates are all failing (they give an error in the windows update screen of Code 52E), skype is failing (error code 2), live essentials
 wont install and additionally it wont automatically connect to any wireless networks.<br />
<br />
I have JV16 Power tools on the computer and use Revo Uninstaller Pro for uninstalling software.&nbsp; I have tried various Windows FixIT applications and one I had to roll back as it messed with installed software and about 1/2 of my desktop items disappeared.<br />
<br />
I am currently running a deep scan with Norton to see what it comes up with but I really am at my wits end with the different things I have tried to fix this.&nbsp; I have a Toshiba Qosmio computer with windows installed on an SSD drive.<br />
<br />
Any ideas please.... I am fairly comfortable with my computer and working stuff out but I am stumped on this one.<br />

            <p>So you are using a Registry Cleaner? That's probably your problem. there's absolutely NO NEED whatsoever to use any sort of Registry cleaner despite what the marketeers tell you. Neither is there any need to use Revo uninstaller unless you come across a
 program that won't uninstall via the Control Panel.</p>
<p>Sounds to me as though you need to bite the bullet and start with a fresh install of Windows.</p>
<p>Don't forget to backup all your critical data before you do so.</p>

            Thanks for the reply but.....<br />
<br />
I thought one of the main benefits of Win7 was that it was stable and the need to install all of your software and windows again was not required.&nbsp; Now having said that, sure if my Reg cleaners and stuff have messed with it then that is my fault but I was hoping
 for some additional steps which could possibly be taken before I sit down for the whole day installing windows and various pieces of software.&nbsp; Anyway....... thanks for the reply.&nbsp; I work away from home and wont be home for at least a week so if anyone else
 has any ideas which I can attempt to help my system before I reinstall windows that would be great.<br />

            <p>&nbsp;If you fool with the registry, all bets are off.&nbsp; Those registry cleaners are all snake oil.&nbsp; They don't help appreciably, and sometimes cause problems.&nbsp; The registry is where thousands of switches and settings that Windows uses are stored.&nbsp; If you fool
 around with it, it's like fooling around with the wires under the hood of your car.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Another thing you should know is the need for backing your system up.&nbsp; Sooner or later all computers will fail and without a backup you're going to pay a painful price.&nbsp; When you get your computer back to good health
<strong>back your system up to an external hard drive!</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Good luck.</p>

            <p><span>Here are some notes about Event Viewer Reports which may help. When you have a lot of errors you need to concentrate on system
 errors and warnings, even if it is applications that are giving you grief. Sorting system problems first can make resolving application problems easier. Note the time the computer is last booted and deal with those at the beginning of the boot first. Correcting
 the earlier errors can resolve later ones.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Normally when an error occurs on your computer looking in Event Viewer should be your starting point for finding a solution.
 Most system related errors are logged and getting an exact copy of the relevant report is important. Unfortunately understanding the reports is not easy and most computer users need help with their interpretation. I have more to say later on interpretation.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Event Viewer comprises three main Windows logs. These are Application, Security and System. For troubleshooting purposes
 System is by far the most important.</span></p>
<p><span>3. To access the System log select Start, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer, from the list in the left side
 of the window select Windows Logs and System. Place the cursor on System, right click and select Filter Current Log. Check the box before Error and click on OK and you see only Error reports. Click on the Date and Time Column Header to sort. You may need to
 click a second time to see the latest Report at the top. </span></p>
<p><span>4. A tip for posting copies of Error Reports! Run Event Viewer and double click on the error you want to copy. Click on
 the Copy button on the General tab to place a copy on your Clipboard and close Event Viewer. Now start your message and paste into the body of the message. Make sure this is the first paste after exiting from Event Viewer.</span></p>
<p><span>5. There are three types of Report, being Information, Warning and Error reports. In most situations it is Error Reports
 that offer the best information but occasionally Warning Reports provide useful clues.
</span></p>
<p><span>6. All reports have date and time stamps and when troubleshooting it is important to concentrate on more recent reports.
 Study reports since the point when the computer was last booted and then check whether a similar report appeared in the previous session. If errors do not repeat investigation as to why they occurred is wasted effort.</span></p>
<p><span>7. Within individual reports the more important information is Event ID and Source as these help when looking for help on
 the internet. The description is equally important and copying the exact text for use as the search criteria greatly helps getting better results when using Google. Do not paraphrase descriptions when asking others for help.</span></p>

            Hey Everyone,  Thanks for the various comments and differing levels of "kickin my ****" regarding my use of various software suites.  First off I will uninstall the reg cleaner and the uninstaller as it also does a reg scan at the end of each uninstall.  Interestingly enough about 4 years ago I swore I would never use them again as I suspected that they may have caused issues with my Alienware laptop.  None the less here we are.  Secondly I will check the reports as recommended and if I find anything I will post it here.  Third, Norton.... I agree to a large extent.  I had left Norton in the trash can many years ago and after time with Eset, Kapersky and then what was my favorite, BitDeffender I ended up going to Norton as BitDef had released an "upgrade" which after being installed stopped my computer virtually from using the internet.  It would not allow any of my web browsers to cleanly access the internet except Opera and that was only installed to circumvent the issue.  After about 3 months o

            Hey Folks...<br />
<br />
Ok I will do my best to provide some information.&nbsp; The error logs are all similar so I think a breakdown here will hopefully be useful.<br />
<br />
First off my computer symptoms.<br />
<br />
Basically the computer runs fine.&nbsp; I first became aware of a potential issue when my computer stopped logging into wireless networks automatically.&nbsp; I need to manually connect to wifi networks with the computer and no matter how many times I click the "connect
 automatically" it will not connect.&nbsp; There were some guidelines on that which I followed some time ago but since have left it mostly due to time but obviously now I am considering that it might be related to my additional issues in some way.&nbsp; The next "warning"
 that all was not as it seemed was twofold, one Skype kept asking me to upgrade and would fail the install, while at the same time (I had not really been paying close attention) I began to consider it strange that my computer was always installing windows updates
 when I went to shutdown the computer.&nbsp; After I uninstalled Skype completely to try a reinstall and it did not work I noticed that the windows update kept coming up... I then started to try manual installs of that only to find that it would also fail in its
 install which then pointed me to the fact that the windows updates which I thought I was doing all week were in fact failing each time.&nbsp; Ok I think that covers that.&nbsp; Norton found two trojans as well as some other issues which it said it took care of.<br />
<br />
Ok and now the logs.&nbsp; I hope this stuff is helpful and not just a waste of everyone's time.&nbsp; I greatly appreciate everyone's help and suggestions, even if it is to tell me that it is my fault for messing with it.&nbsp; Anyway:
<br />
<br />
When I view the logs... I started by looking at the "error" reports as recommended but then also added the warnings to the filter to see what was coming up.&nbsp; The errors all seem to be fairly consistent for each time my computer is booted up so each session.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 There is one "string" (Service Control Manager) of errors which seems longer (more of them) in days gone by but now it is generally showing about 8 errors per session.&nbsp; The list below is from my current session.&nbsp; All of these errors listed below with the exeption
 of the "DistributedCOM" errors exist in every session over the last 10days or so with the exception that there are a few more Service Control Manager errors on certain days.<br />
<br />
Error&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5/30/2012 3:22:35 PM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WindowsUpdateClient&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows Update Agent<br />
Error&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5/30/2012 3:22:30 PM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WindowsUpdateClient&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 20&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows Update Agent<br />
These are related to my windows updates obviously.&nbsp; Both with the error code 0x80070643.<br />
<br />
Error&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5/30/2012 3:20:08 PM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SharedAccess_NAT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 31004&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
All of these errors are indicating that the DNS proxy agent was unable to allocate 0 bytes of memory.&nbsp; This may indicate that the system is low on virtual memory, or that the memory manager has encountered an internal error.
<br />
<br />
Error&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5/30/2012 3:19:28 PM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service Control Manager&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7023&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Error&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5/30/2012 3:19:28 PM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service Control Manager&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7034&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Error&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5/30/2012 3:19:27 PM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service Control Manager&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7009&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />

Error&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5/30/2012 3:19:26 PM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service Control Manager&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
All of the Service Control Manager errors are to do with The Windows Search Service.&nbsp; 7000 is a failed to start, 7009 is a timeout, 7034 is a terminated unexpectedly and 7023 is that the service terminated with the following error: Access is denied.<br />
<br />
Error&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5/30/2012 3:19:26 PM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DistributedCOM&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10005&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
These errors are identical. DCOM got error "1053" attempting to start the service WSearch with arguments "" in order to run the server {.............}<br />

This Warning says that "WLAN AutoConfig service has successfully stopped."<br />
<br />
Once again thanks for everyone's help.&nbsp; I am going to send this message and then uninstall the various elements of software which I have been chastised for using and will then reboot the computer and see if the logs have changed at all.&nbsp; If I dont post further
 then please accept that the logs are the same if not just very similar as per my discussion above.<br />

Cheers<br />

<h3> berndbausch  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 &#34;hardware reserved memory&#34; break-down or optimization&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am running 32-bit Windows 7 SP1 on a notebook with 4GB memory. Since my PC is often very slow, I used Task Manager and Resource Monitor to look for possible causes and found that I am likely to have a memory problem. With 32-bit Windows, adding memory
 to the PC is pointless, so I wonder what my options are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I do run a few memory hogs in parallel, e.g. Outlook, Eclipse (programming environment) and occasionally Gimp, Resource Monitor tells me that about 1GB of memory is reserved by or for hardware. I find that excessive. A screenshot is attached.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My display configuration is the notebook display plus an additional 1280x1024 monitor. Still, it's hard to believe that it could cause a reservation of a full GB of memory.
<strong>How can I find out what really causes this high memory usage, and what can I do to reduce it?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update: </strong>I physically disconnected the secondary monitor, replaced the Windows 7 user interface theme by the Classic Microsoft theme and rebooted. The "hardware reserved memory" doesn't change.</p>
<p>I also checked on my desktop PC with 64-bit Windows 7. There, only 274MB are hardware reserved. Memory usage can therefore be reduced - is it a BIOS setting?</p>

            Thanks tyrred, but I need to run at least Eclipse, the internet browser and Outlook in parallel. Altogether, they occupy just a bit more than half of my memory. What is the 1GB reserved for hardware?

            <p>96 processes right now. I have rebooted and am just running the Firefox browser and Task Manager, plus of course all the background stuff. Firefox is currently using a bit less than 200MB, the total "used memory" figure is about 1.3GB.
</p>
<p>Defragmenting the hard drive, removing browser add-ins and cleaning up the filesystem (right now 26GB free out of 131) will just be peanuts compared to this number and the hardware reservation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When toying around with msconfig, I found the C:\windows\System32\msinfo32.exe tool. It shows me the hardware memory reservations; if the numbers are to be believed, the motherboard has 256MB allocated, and the graphics subsystem another 256MB. It seems
 that I need to find out how to reduce these allocations, which is a hardware or BIOS problem.</p>

            <p>Every process is tying up memory .</p>
<p>If you can not turn some off ,try setting some services to manual&nbsp; not auto ,so you
</p>
<p>use them when needed .Instead of them constantly running in the background .</p>
<p>Ten to fifteen % free space on the C: partition should be kept free for stuff to use when needed . Also</p>
<p>it&nbsp; may be better to let windows manage the memory&nbsp;.</p>
<p>Those two 256mb of memory are your video memory&nbsp; ,windows puts the same amount of installed</p>
<p>memory and video card memory into reserved memory and if that is not enough it will use more on the page file .
</p>
<p>If you have not done so it may also help to run&nbsp;&nbsp; chkdsk /f&nbsp;&nbsp; at the command prompt&nbsp; and reboot ,it may
</p>
<p>find something&nbsp; amiss to fix .</p>
<p>Also stuff that auto-updates at the same time a lot of other stuff is running can make problems</p>
<p>happen .</p>
<p>When you have all the programs you want to have running at the same time ,open task manager and see</p>
<p>what the page file activity is .</p>
<p>What version of Win 7 are you using on your notebook and what cpu&nbsp; Intel or AMD ?</p>

            <p>Since it seems that nothing can be done about hardware reserved memory, I finally bit the bullet and upgraded to Windows 64bit. As a result, I now have about 750MB more memory available and rarely suffer from memory problems. I am also able to increase RAM
 to up to 8GB, the maximum my PC supports</p>

            <p>Hello Sina,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to incorrect Windows media player settings. This may also happen if&nbsp;required codecs are not installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>run Windows media player settings troubleshooter
</strong>and check if it helps. Please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Type <strong>troubleshooting </strong>in the search box on taskbar and click on it in results.<br />
b. Click "<strong>View all</strong>" and then click "<strong>Windows Media Player Settings</strong>".<br />
c. Click "<strong>Next</strong>" and follow on-screen instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also suggest you to <strong>install required codecs </strong>and check the issue.<br />
Refer this article:<br />
<strong>Codecs: frequently asked questions</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/codecs-frequently-asked-questions#codecs-frequently-asked-questions=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/codecs-frequently-asked-questions#codecs-frequently-asked-questions=windows-8</a><br />
(Also holds good for Windows 10)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: You should only install codecs, filters, or plug-ins from trusted, authorized sources, such as the official website of the codec manufacturer. Be careful when you install codecs that you've found on the Internet, particularly the free codec packs that
 claim to include codecs from many companies, because these codec packs might include software that can damage your PC. If you've installed any codec packs and are having problems with the Player, we recommend that you remove them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do let us know if you need any further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<h3> charles j corbin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 and bluetooth connect smartphones</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; I have a Motorola Droid Ultra that was connected Bluetooth to my laptop running windows&nbsp;8. I upgraded to&nbsp;8.1 and it was still connected and moving pictures and songs between the two with easy.</p>
<p>&nbsp; I upgraded to Windows 10 and now the phone still recognizes the laptop&nbsp;but&nbsp;the laptop can't&nbsp;/ won't discover the phone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Help, am I missing a new step some where or is this a problem over my skills?</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; After turning both the phone and laptop Bluetooth off and the restarting...</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Went to the bottom right of screen - Notification tile -&nbsp;Left clicked and the notification message to connect the phone is there - Left clicked and message disappears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. (a)&nbsp;Went to Settings - Devices - Connected devices and the phone is no longer listed, however the wireless mouse is still listed.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b) Went to Settings - Devices - Bluetooth and both the earpiece and the home audio are still connected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (c) in Connected devices&nbsp;I went to Add a device - Left click and a box pop-up shows "Searching for devices" and still nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Using the phone - settings - Bluetooth - search for devices - boom, the laptop is found and a passkey given.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Still laptop can't / won't connect with phone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help! What step have I missed? or did Windows forget about my phone in this new upgrade?</p>

<h3> edwin edmonds  say:</h3>
<h2>            Game lag- Warcommander</h2>
                    <p>I play an online game called warcommander. I have played this game about 4 years now, I am having a huge problem that greatly impedes my ability to play. The game loads just fine but when I go to curser scroll my map, target or anything else&nbsp;it has this
 delay type lag. Why? it never had it before.&nbsp;I thought by upgrading to windows 10 it would fix the problem. I have reinstalled, shockwave and flash multiple &nbsp;times as well my browsers&nbsp; I use google chrome most of the time but I have this problem on all. The
 problem first presented itself 3 days ago after a game maintenance shut down then corrected itself then reappeared the fallowing morning and it is here to stay it would seem. I can't upload a video to show what it is doing but am willing to send to a personal
 email. Please not although I am pretty much computer stupid I am not an idiot so I wont be giving access to my system to anyone. Thanks, I don't see a select for this problem so I just clicked something to get the ball going.</p>

                    <p>HI all - I hope you can help me with following issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Issue : I've recently upgraded my laptop to windows 10 and since the upgrade I'm not able to connect my Sennheiser MB Pro 2 via bluetooth to the laptop. It was working fine on the same laptop when running on Windows 7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The headset was delivered w/o a dongle, so i was using the internal bluetooth.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The device is paired (cfr. screenshot) but it's not appearing in my Sound control panel)</p>
<p>I have another W10 machine on which the headset is working OK</p>

<p>
</p><p>Things I've tried :</p>
<p>- update driver on Sennheiser headset</p>
<p>- update Bluetooth driver on machine</p>
<p>- update sound drivers on machine</p>
<p>
</p><p>but it's still not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for your help</p>
<p>Regards, &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried this just now but even after a clean startup I'm getting the same results:</p>
<p>&nbsp;- BT headset is paired but not connected</p>
<p>&nbsp;- BT headset doesn't appear in the sound devices list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything else I can do to fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Anyway, If you guys can help me out in any way, I'd gladly take the help. If not then at least i tried :)</p>
<p>So yeah, Thats pretty much it.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 Startup issue Missing Toolbar</h2>
                    <p>My computer failed to shut down so I held down the power button. On restarting it scanned the disk, then after login went straight to desktop (rather than app screen).</p>
<p>Desktop was blank although a right click and 'refresh' brings up the icons; however the start button doesn't work and the toolbar has been cleared off all previous icons incl clock and system info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas on the problem or any fixes. All suggestions are welcome!</p>

            <p>It sounds like a bad shutdown caused the problem and the system didn't load properly after powering on again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally speaking you can fix it by shutting down again using the option on the power users menu (right click the Start button and go to Shutdown --&gt; Shutdown). Wait a couple of minutes and then power on again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's a hotfix for it which you can install: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3042085" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't click the Start button, hit Windows key + X to launch the menu, then use the Up arrow to select "Shutdown", then Right arrow to go to "Shutdown" again and hit Enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Try doing the following.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hit Windows key + X, use the Up arrow and select Command Prompt (Admin).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Type: <strong>sfc /scannow </strong>and hit Enter. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The tool will check Windows system files for corruption and try to repair them. At the end, it will tell you if it was unable to fix some of them. If that happens, copy and then right click and paste the following command and hit Enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>DISM.exe/Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can you boot into Safe Mode? That loads a minimum set of drivers and programs and it a good troubleshooting tool. See this tutorial on different methods of accessing it:
<a href="http://www.7tutorials.com/5-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-8-windows-81" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.7tutorials.com/5-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-8-windows-81</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You can run <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> from a Command Prompt (Admin) using the same Windows + X key to access it, but not DISM. Worth a try anyway if the above fail.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As for corrupt iTunes follow instructions in this link to uninstall it and then download a fresh copy:
<a href="https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204275" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT204275</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Uninstall other programs and reinstall if they stop working or produce error messages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            Thanks again for the reply. Hitting windows key + X doesn't result in anything, the toolbar is just locked I.e can't even move s desktop icon. May have to spend some money on getting it looked at

            <p>If you can't access a command prompt and can't get into Safe Mode you can shutdown the machine by holding down the power button. Wait about 30 seconds and then power on again, but immediately press and hold down the power button again. If you do that three
 times, Windows will start an Automatic Repair. </p>
<p>

            <p><span>Hello Akobash</span></p>
<p><span>Most likely you have not installed the drivers for your network card. Here is the link for the drivers for your system. You will need to select the drop down arrow beside "Network" then select
 the correct network driver for your system. You will most likely have to save this driver to a flash drive or other form of portable media. Once you have it saved you can then insert the media into your Dell Dimension 4600, navigate to the media then run the
 installer for the driver. Follow the on screen instructions to complete the install and if required, you may need to reboot. After installing the network driver and you can get online I suggest you install the remaining drivers for your system from the provided
 link. If you have any questions then please let us know. Thanks.</span></p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />Try re-registering Camera app. Run following command in administrative Windows PowerShell:
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers -Name Microsoft.WindowsCamera | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml” -Verbose} 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!

    <title>Touchpad only responds to extremly light touch - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Touchpad only responds to extremly light touch</h2>
                    I have been using my surface book for over six months now.Today I plugged in an SD card for the first time and uploaded some photos. At the time I was using a Bluetooth mouse and had no issues.Since then, I unplugged the surface book and turned off the
 Bluetooth, and noticed I am unable to use the trackpad. It responds to taps and clicks, but to move the cursor I have to barely touch the pad, and even that moves it very intermittently. I have tried disconnecting and reconnecting the base, check updates on
 the drivers, and of course, restarted to no avail. I read a similar post about a keyboard and touchpad delay while an SD card was inserted and attempted several recommendations from that post without any results.&nbsp;

<p>Hi Elijah,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Trackpad issues can be due to either hardware or driver issues. Just to verify, is the issue present only when an SD card is inserted in the slot? Also, have you already performed a two-button shutdown?
<span>To do this, press and hold the <strong>Volume-up</strong> button and the <strong>
Power </strong>button on your Surface at the same time for 15 seconds and then release both of them. The screen may flash the Surface logo, but remember to continue holding down the buttons for 15 seconds.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Some Surface Book users had trackpad multi-touch issues, and </span>disabling/enabling the "Intel(R) Precise Touch Device" in the device manager works as a workaround. You might want to try that as well. Open the device manager, then click on human
 interface devices to expand it and it should be near the bottom of the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, we recommend that you run the <strong>Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</strong>. The SDT resolves common issues with your Surface including touchpad issues. The diagnosis may take 15 minutes or less, but can take an hour or longer depending
 on your internet connection speed and on the repairs that the tool needs to do to fix the problems.

<p>Thank you for the advice, I followed those steps and when that didn't work I thought I would try the hardware end. I bought this skin cover for the surface book over six months ago:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01JOFS62U/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">JRC- Silver Ultra-Thin Case Decals Skins for Microsoft Surface Book, Stickers Fit
 Laptop Body Precisely, 3M Decal Decorative Protector,Set of 4 section</a></p>
<p>It has a thin trackpad cover as well, which has worked like a charm for over 6 months. I removed the skin over it and it works fine now. Strange, it didn't have any scratches or signs of wear, but it was definitely the source of the problem. Thanks again!</p>
