                    Windows Vista will not log off or shut down. Act like it is in a continous loop.<br />

<h2>            Why does my phone keep dropping calls before they go through&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Why does my phone keep dropping calls before they go through?&nbsp; I've had Skype for years and it just started doing this.&nbsp; Please don't suggest the problem is on my end or assume I am an idiot.&nbsp; The problem is with Skype.&nbsp; I'd like to also mention the support
 for SKYPE is absolutely appalling, there is none.&nbsp; At this point one call goes through in about 30 attempts.&nbsp; This is ridiculous.&nbsp;</p>

            Try following 
<br />
<br />1. Please make sure that you have latest version of Skype installed.
<br />
<br />2. To isolate the issue, can you make call using Web Skype
<br />

            Why would any of that matter?&nbsp; This is not a new install I'm trying to get working, I have been using Skype as my main phone since 2010.&nbsp; The problem is with the last update. Looks to me like Microsoft may have made setting changes to my computer without
 my knowledge or permission.

<p>I can't say how long the promotion will run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens is, if you redeem an Xbox Live Gold subscription card, it converts it into Game Pass Ultimate days. You can read how it works in the FAQ section of this link:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass?xr=shellnav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass?xr=shellnav</a></p>

<p>Ok. Thanks. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When I visited the page last night, either faqs weren't there yet, or the page stopped scrolling before reaching the bottom (have had that happen sometimes on unrelated sites).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The $1 has an e3 tag on it. I know standard game pass offer usually lasts a month, but it's obviously a different service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not game sharing, but I wonder how it affects that, as I don't think you can't share gold on another console without being signed in.</p>

<p>I assume that the game pass ultimate is $1 until they decide to end the promo which will probably be when enough customers are signed and converted based on what their target of customers are. If you go to

<h3> og95  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows store won&#39;t open and start menu issues</h2>
                    <p>After upgrading to the creators update, the windows store no longer opens. The start menu is also very slow to come up and I can no longer search using it too. Also the Films &amp; TV app no longer open up any files, coming up with an error "the remote procedure
 call failed."<br />
<br />
I've tried several fixes such as restarting my PC to begin with and also resetting the windows apps using the powershell but I just cannot get everything back to normal. It's also not possible for me to revert back to the old update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems that some of the system files are corrupted. We suggest that you perform the SFC and DISM to repair system file corruption. You may refer to this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">Wiki article</a></strong> created by ZigZag3143 (MS
 -MVP) for the steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the issue remains, try to boot your computer in safe mode. If the PC is working well in safe mode, we recommend to do a clean boot. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update. Click

            <p>I never got as far as to trying out Marby's solutions as I tried one final thing myself.
</p>
<p>That was to go to: &nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>and download the Windows 10 Installation Media Tool. You can choose whether or not to keep your files and/or apps or go for a clean install. Fixed all my issues after reinstallation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this can help others that were in my situation.</p>

<h2>            Motorola Moto G not connecting with windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I'm using a Motorola Moto G phone, my device was connecting with windows. But on a sudden it stopped working, windows does not show anything when I connect my phone to the pc. I've tried to connect my phone with another windows device and a Macbook, both
 of them is working ( connecting ). &nbsp;So, I guess, no problem with my device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to clear all registry of windows after that my phone was connecting, but not anymore. I've also tried to re-install Motorola Device manager but no good.</p>

            I have been trawling the web for weeks trying to find assistance to similar problem. &nbsp;I have a 2013 Moto X which will not connect to my laptop with USB cable. &nbsp;Am I pi**ed off ??? - you bet. &nbsp;I have a sony vaio s series which came with Win 8 loaded, such
 a stupid marketing decision because there was no touch screen and like most of the world I could seem to get my head around 8 or 8.1. I got Win 7 loaded as it was part of my Win 8 package. &nbsp;I have been able to use superbeam to shift photos but I am not always
 in WiFi. &nbsp;Numerous sessions with the clever people at Motorola help but they reckon reload 7 - I'm not made of money does anyone have a smarter solution. &nbsp;

    <title>Not all app icons from Win 10 Taskbar icons are showing up in System - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> salfrank77  say:</h3>
<h2>            Not all app icons from Win 10 Taskbar icons are showing up in System Notifications &#38; Actions</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Win 10 Pro v1511 build 10586.318 </p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to System Notifications &amp; Actions, under "Show notifications from these apps", only 2 of my&nbsp;11 apps from the taskbar&nbsp; hidden icons notification area show up.&nbsp; So my only choice is to configure those two, or no notifications for all apps. How do
 I get the other&nbsp;9 to show up in the "Show notifications from these apps" list? </p>
<p>
</p><p>An ongoing problem&nbsp;with Win 7 and now Win 10 is that if some apps go to show a notification, it will lock the taskbar so that it no longer autohides. The only fix is a restart. Microsoft explains that it is because the apps are not written properly for Windows.
 This is why I need control over all my apps - to enable ones I want and disable others that cause problems. In Windows 7 this was possible by clicking the "Customize" button when showing the hidden icons, so at least there was a way to fix. No such feature
 exists in Windows 10. It is the cumbersome method of having to go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Notifications &amp; actions, only to find that not all my hidden icon apps are there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>in my hidden icons area I have TorGuard (VPN), Unchecky, Logitech SetPoint&nbsp;Keyboard settings, Logitech Gaming Software (mouse settings), Allway sync (backup software), IRST (Intel), Radeon Settings, Keepass, Realtek Audio, &amp; iCalendar. In addition I have
 the Windows 10 proprietary volume and Internet (LAN) icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get the other 9 to populate&nbsp;in the "Show notifications from these apps" list?</p>

            <p>Hi Sal,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed, I would like you to provide the below outlined information:</p>
<p>1. What do you mean when you state "the taskbar&nbsp;hidden icons notification area" ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Can you specify and send us a screenshot of the said "hidden icons"? </p>
<p>
</p><p>As per your query, I understand that you are able to see only two out of the eleven icons that has been pinned to you taskbar under the "Show Notifications for these Apps".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the above is true, I would like to inform that in Windows 10, it is not necessary that the apps you have in the taskbar will show under "show notification for these apps" page. These apps appear by default and you cannot add or edit the said apps.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest that you uninstall the apps you wish, install it again and check if it displays under the said page. Also, try checking form another user account and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>

<p>
</p><p>Here is a screenshot. It is the hidden icons on the right hand side of the&nbsp;taskbar. I'm not sure what to call it because it seems in Win 10 MS has&nbsp;changed naming things ... apps? programs? icons? tiles? I'm just coming from Win 7</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5b5942a7-7672-4102-bce9-57a51955829f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5b5942a7-7672-4102-bce9-57a51955829f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You said:</p>
<p>"it is not necessary that the apps you have in the taskbar will show under "show notification for these apps" page." But it is necessary. If there is no way to "Customize" these as there was in Windows 7, then the only way is to go to
</p>
<p>Settings &gt; System &gt; Notifications &amp; actions &gt; Show notifications from these apps where I find only two, or the option to turn off 'Show app notifications". It is necessary to have control of the individual apps and whether or not each individual app can
 or can not show it's notifications, because, as I mentioned, the bug in Win 7 &amp; 10 where the taskbar locks if certain apps show, or attempt to show a notification.&nbsp; MS says this is the fault of the app \ program not being written correctly for implementation
 with Windows. Fair enough. But the point here is that in Windows 7 you had the ability to customize per app \ program appearing in that hidden area. There was that "Customize" button that allowed you to Show the app, hide it, or hide it and all notifications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To troubleshoot the taskbar problem in Win 7 you simply turned off notification of the hidden taskbar apps - manually - then re-enabled them one by one to see which caused the conflict with Win taskbar. Now&nbsp;my only choice to prevent the taskbar issue is
 to turn off<em> all </em>apps&nbsp;ability to notify,&nbsp;under Settings &gt; System &gt; Notifications &amp; actions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it is necessary to have control of each one - just as it was in Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You said:</p>
<p>"These apps appear by default and you cannot add or edit the said apps. "</p>
<p>But I'm not looking to edit them&nbsp; - I'm looking for a controllable function for that app, a function&nbsp;that has disappeared from Windows 7.</p>

<p>Thanks for responding Vanessa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>but this is basically a re-iteration of what you said earlier in different words, and doesn't address the question I raised. The question being:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me how to get all apps from Win 10 Taskbar hidden icons area,&nbsp; to show up in Settings &gt; System &gt; Notifications &amp; Actions &gt; Show notifications from these apps?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I mentioned earlier the scenario which makes this a necessity - to resolve the taskbar issue and troubleshoot which app causes the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While a user could implement the action you suggest, it does not address my particular problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am looking to troubleshoot a Windows 10 feature that is not working properly, namely: not all aforementioned apps showing under: Settings &gt; System &gt; Notifications &amp; Actions &gt; Show notifications from these apps</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not looking to turn off notifications for all apps, or exit out of&nbsp;my apps or Windows proprietary system&nbsp;apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also moving the slider to ON for "Show app notifications" or moving the slider to ON for "Show notifications on the lock screen" does not populate the list under Settings &gt; System &gt; Notifications &amp; Actions &gt; Show notifications from these apps. It remains
 at two out of eleven.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

    <title>After Much needed time&#59; my opinion of Dead Space 2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lancinator  say:</h3>
<h2>            After Much needed time&#59; my opinion of Dead Space 2</h2>
                    
<p>Dead Space 2 is a great game but there are&nbsp; a few things that bothered me. When I&nbsp;first played DS2 I was very impressed with how the game looked.&nbsp;The look&nbsp;was my biggest concern before the game came out. and I was impressed. However before the game released
 I was not at all concerned with the Audio. I figured, they did such a great job in the first game, they would most definately improve on the second. And so they did. However, when I play in 5.1 audio I'm not getting the same "kick" that I did in DS1. Don't
 get me wrong I have freaky noises coming from right rear and left rear but not "organised" the way it was in the first game. The suround sound effects do not have there place; as if they don't "belong". A theory of mine would say this is do to the fact that
 the&nbsp;game was recorded in <strong>7.1 Audio</strong>. Xbox 360 and DVD do not support uncompressed 7.1 audio. This leads me to believe that the 7.1&nbsp;audio track was compressed and formated for Xbox 360 and I highly doubt Visceral created a seperate track for
 people who are still using 5.1 audio.</p>
<p>I still do not understand why Issac and Nichole were brought back to the story. If you ask me, they are not a part of Dead Space at all. Unitology,&nbsp;the Marker and its origins are what true fans were curious of. The whole idea of keeping
 Issac quiet in the first game was key. So if he died in the end, none of us had grown "attached". This game is too morbid for such character analysis. Granted the idea of giving the player something worth pushing through such a challenging game, such as a
 love interest, is fine but generic. Speaking of generic story ideas; remember in the end of Halo 2 we discovered there were more than two ring worlds? It just seems to me Visceral is getting very lazy with the story telling. I understand&nbsp;Visceral wants to
 pump out more Dead Space games and I want them to do so but do it with respect to&nbsp;the fans. Don't belittle us challenge us.</p>
<p>Another installment to the franchise seems inevitable and I have a few suggestions. When I listen to audio logs or read a text log, it should have some sort of significance to the game play. So if I want to continue to the next chapter
 I would need to gather all the logs, wich would help solve a riddle(or puzzle)&nbsp;that leads me to the next part of the game. Make audio and text logs a necessity and make the player actually
<strong><em>read</em></strong>. And all the enemie deaths start to look the same. Try a gun that expands the enemy and causes them to explode, a weapon that actually melts your enemy, even one that freezes and shatters your enemy and all&nbsp;while trying to maintain
 the idea of dismemberment. I may have more to say but can't think of it at the moment.</p>

<p>I have no idea what your talking about when it comes to Halo 2 (never played) but we have our opinions, I just know I loved DS2 and I loved Isaac as a character. I'm not saying if they went with a different person it would have been bad but to me, Isaac
 pretty much nailed it. And as far as a challenge, they could add a bit more I guess but Love is one of the strongest emotions. I wouldnt call it generic because that's what feeds alot of people their motivation. Love for their wife, kids, family, love for
 their craft their good at. It makes fighting for something worth while so I can see the whole Isaac &amp; Nicole idea. Especially him being haunted. Speaking of the next Dead Space, there most definitely will be another one and I'm sure it will shake things up
 a bit so I also think you will get some things you felt were missing. It's a great series and it only gets better. DS1 was good, DS2 was a great improvement and I believe DS3 will be epic. This series and Mass Effect series are my favorites. Oh, by the way,
 I like your ideas of blowing up, melting or freezing an enemy haha, that would be sweet.</p>

<p>It was kind of obvious that there were more then one or two markers. The second Kendra told you that the first marker was man-made it's obvious they'd build more. When we detonated the first atomic bomb in 1945. We knew it's destructive potential, but still
 we built more, bigger and stronger. That's just the way humanity thinks.</p>

<p>One other thing I don't like about Dead Space 2 is how the flame thrower works in a vacuum. In the first dead Space the flame thrower did not work in vacuums and I liked it that way. It made the game more realistic.</p>

<p>But in reality the flame thrower would work in a vacuum due to the gasses inside of the torch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[quote]The Flamethrower does not work in a vacuum due to the lack of oxygen needed to sustain the flame. This is technically an error by EA, since in reality hydrazine - a hypergolic fuel - is typically used with a liquid oxidizer stored along with it, and
 can even burn without any oxidizer as a mono-propellant. Therefore, a hydrazine flamethrower could theoretically be made to work in a vacuum. (This error is corrected in
<i>Extraction </i>and later <i>Dead Space games.</i>) This being said, you should probably switch to a different weapon when you're going through a vacuum in Dead Space 1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Flamethrower uses hydrazine fuel, which can burn in a vacuum. EA announced they had made a mistake in the first Dead Space since the Flamethrower did not work in a vacuum. The weapon was fixed for Dead Space 2.</p>

<p>[/quote]And you didn't think that they've mastered space travel, so perhaps they figured out how to shoot fire in a vacuum?&nbsp; They did have a few years to upgrade the weapon between the games.&nbsp; Probably not on their priority list but I'm pretty sure if they
 can build deep space vessels and all sorts of sci fi/futuristic weapons, they can expand on something cavemen figured out.&nbsp; In the end it's just a game.</p>

<p>Everyone I've seen posting on these forums say they like Isaac.&nbsp; At least the story that evolves around Isaac and Nicole is unique.&nbsp; That *** threw us a curve ball between the two games.&nbsp; Who would you prefer, someone who doesn't
 have a name or the ability to talk?&nbsp; Maybe play a game from the&nbsp; 90's if that's the case.&nbsp; You know what sounds like an ideal game for you?&nbsp; A game where the protagonist is deaf, dumb, and blind.&nbsp; Insert interesting enemies with a equally interesting back
 story and this should be a a win for you right?&nbsp; I hope DS3 has Isaac and the new chic in it.&nbsp; In one of the games I want to see ISAAC end things with the marker(s).&nbsp; Maybe the new chic mud wrestling Nicole in zero g while the two wear nothing but a bikini
 while Isaac eats Peng-Itz?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Too morbid for such character analysis?&nbsp; Have you ever heard of Resident Evil? There's plenty of character analysis of Chris, Leon, Wesker, Jill, and Claire to go around.&nbsp; The games are pretty morbid.&nbsp; Isaac may have been quiet but
 we still got attached to him.&nbsp; In the future you shouldn't think you can speak for the rest of us.</p>

<p>I think the relationship between Isaac and Nichole is a waist of time. Nichole was meant to be a scary factor but instead turned out to be very annoying. She's scary one minuet, then the next minuet she's this caring mentor(much like a psychologist) trying
 to teach you a life lesson and then turns out to be a backstabbing marker in the end?After DS1 I wanted to know more about the alien race that left the marker behind. Visceral didn't even mention the alien race at any point in DS2. I also wanted to know who
 gave the orders to Kendra in the first game. So many unanswered questions. They probably will never be answered because that would mean the end of the Dead Space franchise and EA would loose one of their babies. Nobody ever takes the George Lucas approach
 on stories anymore (Tell the story and get it over with). It reminds me of the Halo franchise, how we will never know about the forerunners and how Bungie created a "<i>trilogy</i>" with no ending. The story between Isaac and Nichole is a
<b>POINTLESS </b>distraction and instead of being insulted, Thoonkins, you're backing it up with mud wrestling fantasies of a Martha Stewart lookalike. "<i>Come to think of it, that actually might make the game a little scarier.</i>"&nbsp;</p>

    <title>DC1 and DC2 error on replication - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mvb_19  say:</h3>
<h2>            DC1 and DC2 error on replication</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have DC1 and DC2 that encountered failure in replication.</p>
<p>DC2 has a mastery of&nbsp;FSMO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't know what's beyond history of this I took it as my project anyway.</p>
<p>and what we planned was to ADD another DC. </p>
<p>since it has an issue on replication. and there are applications already integrated in AD. and also the issue was joining sample PC usually you will type domain , but it won't join using domain FQDN , rather IP address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>question:</p>
<p>Can we still add DC even there is a replication error in DC1 and DC2?</p>
<p>DC 3 then Demote DC2. </p>
<p>
</p><p>if any suggestions please reply on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks alot</p>

            Seem to be you have upgraded higher version of BIOS ,,Before upgrading BIOS you should check current version and update version<br />
However in this case if machine is in warranty you need to call dell and log a case to re-flash the bios .<br />

            <p>Hello SP-925,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Flashing the BIOS can be fraught with problems, especially on older computers. Unless you know what you are doing I always recommend that you leave well alone. Of course, flashing the BIOS in more modern PC's is a little easier, but not much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if the BIOS has failed you should still have a power light visible on the machine. Before you proceed any further just check the fuse to see if that has blown. It may not have done, but it is best to check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You won't be able to reprogram the BIOS because you don't have a copy of the BIOS you have over-written. As you also cannot get the PC to work you are not going to be able to access anything.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest that you contact Dell technical support and ask their advice. They alone know what can and cannot be done to rectify the problem. Obviously, if your PC is still under warranty, that will be a help. If not you may have to take the PC to a repair
 shop.</p>

            <p>There are some Dell computers that can be recovered from a BIOS update failure by placing the BIOS HDR file which is in the update executable on an USB key, Then with the battery removed for several minutes plugging in the AC supply while holding the END
 key down.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem is the name of the file the BIOS recovery will look for is very specific. This is not a Windows issue or even Microsoft, you would be better posting this question on the Dell forum.</p>

            <p>Hello SP-925,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My apologies I should have been more specific. You need to check the fuse in the plug that fits into the socket on your wall. The easiest thing to do is replace the fuse with either a new one or one from an appliance that you know is working. Make sure the
 fuse has the same rating as the one you are removing though.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just in case you really don't know how to change a fuse here is a link: <a href="http://www.diy.com/diy/jsp/content/knowledge/how_to/change_a_plug/change_a_plug.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.diy.com/diy/jsp/content/knowledge/how_to/change_a_plug/change_a_plug.pdf</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that this is the method used in the UK. if you reside in another country the way the fuse is replaced may be different.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 DVR No Audio &#40;Whens this going to be fixed&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Ok I use the built in DVR which is really good, and doesn't use much resources, therefore 50-60 FPS game recording is great, But I've just bought new headphones and mic, the Asus Strix Headset, now because it's 5.1/7.1 surround Win DVR can't record this
 Audio, So this needs a fix as all other DVR software works fine, but hugs resources.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea when this is gonna be fixed as this has been an issue for a while now.</p>

            <p>Hi thanks for the reply, I have no normal sound issues, As for Drivers there are no drivers, it's Microsoft drivers which are used, As it's connected via USB the Headset connects to a hub which is a USB Sound Card, it's Win 10 DVR when recording cannot record
 5.1/7.1 audio, all other game recording software has NO issues, a way to fix this is in the Windows DVR Software so it records either 5.1/7.1 Audio or let it record WASAPI,
</p>
<p>Win 10 DVR records Mic input from my Gaming Headset which is only Stereo, it records Audio fine with my Cheap £10 Gaming Headset as this is only Stereo.</p>
<p>I would have thought that with Windows 10 being a MODERN OS it's Software should allow for 5.1/7.1 Audio recording within the DVR Software that comes with the OS, This has been an ongoing issue with this DVR, Which is a shame as it's actually a good game
 recording piece of software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank </span><span>you for sharing us the details.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To assist you better I would like to know, what is&nbsp;the make and model of DVR?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since the DVR is connected using USB, I suggest you to go to the device manager and uninstall/reinstall the DVR driver and check.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> and select <strong>
Device manager</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Now click on <strong>Universal serial bus </strong>to expand, right click on the
<strong>device </strong>and click on <strong>uninstall</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Once you are done installing the driver, restart the computer. It will automatically install the DVR driver.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>If this doesn’t help to fix the issue. I suggest you to update the
<strong>DVR driver</strong>. Skip step3 from the above steps and right click on the
<strong>device</strong> and click on <strong>update.</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the above methods did not help to fix the issue, </span><span>I recommend you to go to the DVR manufacturer website and download the latest updated DVR driver for Windows 10 and install the same. If the available driver is not for Windows 10 try
 installing the driver in compatibility mode.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right-click on the setup file of the driver and select<strong> Properties</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Check Run this program in <strong>Compatibility mode</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Let the driver install and then check the functionality.</p>

            The DVR is Microsoft WinDVR software which is built into Windows 10, My headset is connected via usb and is 5.1/7.1 surround sound, I thought I had explained this clearly in the previous posts, there is nothing wrong with my hardware, ALL other DVR Software
 works fine, I was asking when is Microsoft going to fix the Audio recording problems with it's own Game Recording Software when recording 5.1/7.1 Surround Sound..?

<h3> spencer simon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error 0x80070015 Solution - Trying to download Windows 10 updates.</h2>
                    <blockquote>
<p><span>Whenever I tried to download updates for Windows 10, ALL of the updates would end with Error 0x80070015. Since I was unable to use my microphone online in PC games, a "DirectSoundCapture" problem, I thought
 a fresh installation of Windows 10 would fix both problems. The microphone problem was fixed, but I still could not download Windows updates. I have had the same problem for weeks, causing me to go insane enough to go into my registry and tinker with anything
 "Windows Update-related." </span></p>
<p><span>(</span><span><span>NOT RECOMMENDED UNLESS YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE DOING</span></span><span>)!
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I google'd for hours and realized how many people had the same Error code.&nbsp;</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>Link to the post that helped me:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>"</span><a href="https://forums.windowssecrets.com/showthread.php/156457-How-to-fix-quot-Error-5-Access-is-denied-quot/page2?s=1bcf812c597b97fb5a5db478640abcc9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Diagnostic Policy Fix</a><span>"
 I apologize, as I do not know the rules pertaining linking to other sites.</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>To cut it short, the reason that Windows Update was bringing up the Error code was due to the fact that "...<span>Got a message that Network Diagnostics cannot run because the&nbsp;<span>Diagnostics Policy Service</span>&nbsp;is not running.
 Opened Service Control Manager to try and start that service, and got a message that Windows could not start the service on Local Computer, followed by Error 5: Access is denied."&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>I traced the problem to "Diagnostic Policy Service" not "Running" (open "run" using WIN+R, type in "<span>services.msc</span>", and check if the "Diagnostic Policy Service" is "Running".) Right click&nbsp;<span>DIAGNOSTIC POLICY SERVICE</span>,
 and in the properties,&nbsp;<span>make sure that its start-up type is Automatic, Automatic (Delayed), or Manual</span>. ANYTHING EXCEPT "Disabled".</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To fix this problem:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Right click the Windows Icon in the lower left-hand corner, select "Command Prompt (Admin)."&nbsp;</span></li><li>At the prompt, type: "net localgroup Administrators /add networkservice" then&nbsp;<span>press enter. It should follow saying that the command had been successful, or something being a success.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Then type:</span><span>"net localgroup Administrators /add localservice"&nbsp;</span><span>P</span><span>ress enter, then type: "</span><span>exit", and press enter. The same line about the command
 being a success.&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Restart your computer (even though idk why I chose not to).</span></li><li><span>Open the Services task (using the WIN+R or "run" command, and enter "services.msc".</span></li><li><span>Make sure that the task states that it is "Running", and if it does not say so, go into the properties of the Diagnostic Policy Service and click on "Start". If you do not receive any error message(s), and the Service says "Running"
 now, then you are one step closer.</span></li><li><span>Go to Windows Update and click "Retry". Hopefully, you will no longer receive Error 0x80070015, but instead it will start downloading all of those updates, and soon enough, they will all go from Status: Pending install, to Installing:,
 to prompting you to restart your computer.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I was able to download every update that was listed, and after installing my computer, my system is now up-to-date. Hopefully this will help out everyone with the "Error 0x80070015" problem when trying to download updates
 for Windows 10. If it did not help, I will try my best to back track the previous steps not listed, in the case that they did anything useful. Good luck, and let me know what happens!&nbsp;</p>

            Been there done that!! All I know is I tried everything possible but can't find any fixes or repairs for Windows update or system restore programs in Windows 10 pro. Even did a disk repair!! plus a number of other procedures. Ever since windows 10, which
 is a piece of crap, replaced windows 7 there has been nothing but problems not only for me but reading other replies in community areas I think this assessment holds true, Windows 7 was the best version but to earn their salary some employee thought a screen
 of all programs would be helpful but it's nothing but a pain in the ass!! Just more hoops to jump thro. Features in Windows 10 that are supposed to automatically work at startup don't and some features don't even work depending on the version of windows 10
 you have. I check my system and get version 1701 while when I access my account it notes Windows 1801-(can't remember exact versions but they conflict). But back to my question: how the hell without a rescue disk or Microsoft cd do I fix

<p>Nothing taken personally. I empathize with you... regarding this crap of an operating system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try my best to help you out. Since my computer originally had Windows 7, I upgraded via the Windows Update feature to Windows 10. Therefore, when I went to the microsoft website to download the tool that allowed me to "reinstall Windows 10" without
 removing ANY of my documents, music, OR APPS, it didn't ask for any product ID or product key. After the fresh re-install, it fixed my "DirectSoundCapture" issue that hindered me from utilizing my microphone on my gaming headset. Then, I used Disk Cleanup
 so rid my computer of the "Windows.old" folder, in order to regain disk space and remove any possibility of old Windows files causing my grief.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, two things:</p>
<p>1) Did your computer originally run Windows 7, and you upgraded to Windows 10 through Windows Updates?<br />
2) I know it might seem futile, but can you post all of the screenshots of your problems? (e.g. Windows Update failing, Problems with system restore, etc...)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try to help you as much as I can.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply. In fact I got a new Dell computer with Windows 10 pro already installed but to my amazement or lack of knowledge, all my old windows 7 files appeared in C: ! I thought what the hell is going on how could this happen? When I checked
 properties of most programs they were defaulted to either windows 7, Vista and a few to XP Windows. Do I deleted all old files?? If I do will it screw up my computer somehow? I have been avoiding doing a reinstall&nbsp; by taking it into a shop to fix it so it
 only runs on windows 10 pro and it's features because I don't know how to do it myself. I am not a computer officiado&nbsp; but merely a middle of the road layman. What I don't understand is with new computer etc how the hell and why did old windows and properties
 take over???? Again, thanks for replying and hopefully you know the answers to the questions I mentioned above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS:&nbsp; I have a folder I can't scan etc called This computer and the C: folder is within this folder--very confusing.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
When connecting Windows 7 to a wireless, this pop-up window normally shows up to confirm if you want to set a wireless connection to a certain network location. To answer your query, for you to stop this pop-up window to show up every time you connect on the
 same wireless connection, we recommend that you check the box at the bottom beside "<strong>Treat all feature networks that I connect to as public, and don't ask me again</strong>". This option lets the current network set as your Home network and will not
 ask you again if you will connect again on the same network.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further assistance.

            Thank you for the update. If you connect your device to another wireless network, it will detect as a public network because you already set a Home Network to your previous wireless connection where you mark the option "<strong>Treat all future networks
 that I connect to as public, and don't ask me again</strong>". This is actually related to setting a trusted network connection to your device.<br />
<br />
To answer your question, the number appearing in the Network name is assigned by default. You may check the response given by
<strong>Jack MVP</strong> on this <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-networking/wireless-network-name-mislabeled-as-name-2/9a502f7a-0e23-4e57-bc56-2dfb9b76aed7">link</a></strong> that

            <p>Got the similar problem with this wifi card and windows 10. Wifi works kind of weird: after boot all works fine sometimes few hours, sometimes few minutes, after that wifi become unresponsive: can't disconnect from wifi, can't turn off wifi, can't disable
 or remove wifi device. After reboot this happening on and on. I've tried to use latest drivers 12.0.0.128, latest drivers from lenovo's support site 12.0.0.102, but no difference, wifi is broken. I've try to disable bluetooth device (this chipset had both
 interfaces wifi and bluetooth) with a same result: wifi is broken.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally i've tried to use Microsoft driver (ver. 4.0.0.115 &nbsp;date: 23.04.2015) instead of Atheros for WiFi, and Atheros driver (ver. 10.0.0.128 date: 30.07.2015 ) for bluetooth. And the last ~20 hours, all works fine, wifi speed is bit slower, but at least
 do not have to restart my notebook every hour.&nbsp;<br />

<p>That's normal, the background is in motion but if you want the sound version you can scroll down and further below you'll find the trailers and game clip links to the sound versions of the video.</p>

<h2>            Keyboard becomes unresponsive in certain applications &#38; lock-screen in Win10</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I have been having this very strange problem since upgrading to Windows 10, which I DEEPLY REGRET !&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of a sudden and without an obvious reason, the keyboard becomes unresponsive. No matter how much I press the buttons, no clicks are recorded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notes:</p>
<p>1- Windows itself doesn't freeze, I can freely move the mouse and switch to windows without issues, only the keyboard.</p>
<p>2- Buttons like CTRL and SHIFT remain responsive. So for instance, I can switch the input language using CTRL+Shift, but can't type anything.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3- This unresponsiveness strangely occurs in certain applications/interfaces, but not all. For instance, when that happens, clicks are recorded in file explorer, but are recorded in Google Chrome. They are not recorded in a certain software, or even the
 lock (log-in screen), but are recorded in Microsoft Word.&nbsp;</p>
<p>4- The problem occurs if I use both an external (wireless or wired) keyboard, or the built in keyboard of my Lenovo Y50 laptop.</p>
<p>5- I made sure to download and install all available Windows 10 drivers from the manufacturer, and all updates from Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is very disturbing, every time it freezes I am forced to restart the computer. When it happens during idle time, I can't log back into Windows, which means I must restart Windows and lose all unsaved data !!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be helpful and don't give me general tips that you woud copy/paste from your common problems solver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(52, 152, 219, 1)">1. Right-click</span></strong> the <strong>
2. Once in Device Manager locate all devices with a yellow exception mark in front of them. In case of not working keyboards they are most-likely located under Human Interface Devices (HID) and keyboards.
<p>3. Under keyboard<strong><span style="color: rgba(52, 152, 219, 1)">s right-click a keyboard with a yellow exception mark.</span></strong></p>
<p>4. Then choose <strong><span style="color: rgba(52, 152, 219, 1)">Update Driver Software….</span></strong></p>
<p>5. Then choose<strong><span style="color: rgba(52, 152, 219, 1)">Browse my computer for driver software</span></strong></p>
<p>6. Then choose&nbsp;Let me <strong><span style="color: rgba(52, 152, 219, 1)">Pick from a List of Device Drivers</span></strong></p>
<p>7. Then choose <strong><span style="color: rgba(52, 152, 219, 1)">HID Keyboard Device</span></strong></p>
<p>8. Click on <strong><span style="color: rgba(52, 152, 219, 1)">Next</span></strong> and wait for the installation to complete, there should be no error code!</p>
<p>9. Unfold the <strong><span style="color: rgba(52, 152, 219, 1)">Human Interface Devices category</span></strong></p>

            <p>Thanks. However why did you assume there are any keyboard devices with a yellow exception mark?&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are in fact none. Neither under "Keyboards" nor under "Human interface devices".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tolerate my advice: &nbsp;If I were you, since I am not sure that the poster does or doesn't have any keyboard with a yellow exception mark, I would have saved myeslf and him lots of time and provided all the tips I can, so in case one doesn't work or
 doesn't apply, he would try the other, instead of an endless loop of unhelpful tips.</p>

</p><p>I have already stated that I did that. I went to Lenovo's website and downloaded all available updates for Windwos 10, including one for the chipset and one for the BIOS.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That however didn't help. Please understand this is directly related to Windows 10, as this never occurred under Windows 8 or 8.1</p>

            I seem to be having the same problem.&nbsp; There is NOTHING in my device manager that is showing a problem and my drivers are up to date.&nbsp; The keyboard is responding in some applications (such as Firefox at the moment) but does not work for the rest of Windows
 or other browsers.&nbsp; However, there have been instances where it would work in Chrome but not in Firefox and Windows.&nbsp; After a time, the keyboard will become responsive again but it happens frequently.&nbsp; The only sure fire way to get it working again is rebooting.&nbsp;
 This is becoming UNACCEPTABLE and completely unreliable, forcing me to go back to Windows 7.&nbsp;

            <p>I believe I have the same issue with my Lenovo laptop running a wireless Logitech mouse and keyboard.&nbsp; Issues started with windows 10 update.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As others have stated my keyboard strokes become unresponsive / erratic only on certain applications and only
 in certain fields within these applications.&nbsp; Eg.&nbsp; QuickBooks, in the description field I can type without a problem then I go to the amount field and the cursor would freeze OR hop to the beginning of the field and I wouldn't be able to type.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd have to
 click on a different field then return the trouble field and it sometimes would highlight what was incorrectly inputted and I could change content.&nbsp;&nbsp; This happens on the laptop keyboard or the wireless and seemed to have&nbsp;happen progressively overtime.&nbsp; It
 started 1st on a different&nbsp;compact Logitech wireless keyboard I used while traveling, which I thought was specific to that keyboard as my office wireless I had no issues then over the course of time it started to spread to my that wireless keyboard too...both
 times the laptop keyboard had the mirrored problem at occurrence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I also followed previous suggestions to remedy...but all my drivers seem to be updated, no 'yellow' flags in device manager, I even click update driver just to be certain.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh one more symptom I noticed in some instances when I could type a few keystrokes.the cursor would quickly highlight what&nbsp;I typed then erase it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So bizarre...btw, it works fine in this&nbsp;comment field right now. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm hoping Microsoft has a fix...</p>

            <p>Do you happen to be having a Logitech hardware?&nbsp;</p>
<p>DMDMOW_007 above stated that he uses Logitech hardware and he has the problem. I , too, use Logitech hardware: a set of Wireless Logitech Wave keyboard+mouse that use the Unified received and the software Setpoint (last version), and another wired gaming
 mouse G500.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought the problem could be caused by the unified received, so I unplugged it from the USB port, but that didn't help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I have just uninstalled SetPoint, and will see if it helps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, just to narrow it down, do you also use Logitech hardware/software?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please try to uninstall the software and follow up with us to see if that remedies the situation. We apparently must act alone, no one in Microsoft seems to be interested in helping us resolve this.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thank you Wikiyam.</p>
<p>Then now we are confident it's not caused by Logitech hardware or software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suppose your having to reconnect the keyboard is not related to the problem under discussion. I am not certain though ! But for me, I only need to restart windows, no need to disconnect &nbsp;then reconnect the wireless keyboard's dongle</p>

<p>I have been doing an endless amount of jobs for them; thought I was suppose to be the leader. &nbsp;Anyways I figure it has something to doing with collecting all of those pink gems in the gold boxes. &nbsp;There are 24 of them to collect and I have only 15. &nbsp;I'm
 "suspecting" once I have all of those it will be better.</p>

<p>I am sure collecting those strange gems will help a little, but they're mostly for bringing in big piles of gold into your pocket. :D</p>

<p>"when you complete them. you become full fledge guildmaster"</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>You're given Guildmaster as part of the main quest. Completing five of Delvin or Vex's jobs in each of the other four main towns opens another Quest in each town, just a somewhat small task for a citizen there.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>After completing those Quests, they offer to support the Guild's interest in those towns, which has a couple of benefits. Finishing those Quests AND being the Guildmaster grants you the achievement for restoring them to their former glory.</p>

<h2>            How to auto-set Application Mode &#40;dark-light&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The option of switch between light mode and dark mode for most applications is really helpful for daytime or night-time working environment.</p>
<p>Is there a way to set the light mode to automatically switch to dark mode when night comes, and vise-versa?</p>
<p>Can any <strong>registry value </strong>tell it to change automatically <strong>
at specific hours I choose</strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If it is possible,&nbsp;a tougher question will come&nbsp;- can I do it on my mobile phone as well?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 4 won&#39;t recognize USB storage - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrobi1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4 won&#39;t recognize USB storage</h2>
                    <p>Problem started happening since the latest Windows Feature Update.<br />
<br />
My Surface Pro 4 will not recognize any external USB storage when plugged in directly to the surface USB port.<br />
<br />
I know the port is functional because if I plug in my harmony remote or phone it connects to those.<br />
<br />
I've tried multiple USB thumb drives and 2 external hard drives, none of them recognize. These all work when plugged in to other systems. They will also work when I plug my Surface Pro 4 into my Surface Dock and use the USB storage devices on there. These also
 all used to work on my Surface Pro 4 so I know they're compatible.<br />
</p>
<p>I've attempted:<br />
-Looking for devices for possible partition or formatting issues in Disk Manager. They do not show at all</p>
<p>-Running the hardware troubleshooter.<br />
-Updating drivers for Intel(R) USB 3.0 eXtensible Host Controller - 1.0 (Microsoft)<br />
-Updating drivers for USB Root Hub (USB 3.0)<br />
-Uninstalling both of the above and rebooting for automatic install<br />
-Running Microsoft Surface Diagnostic Toolkit<br />
</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated</p>
                </div>

            Sorry you are having this issue. It looks like you've done a lot of trouble shooting already. There is one more thing you can try. Go to <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49498" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a> and download SurfacePro4_Win10_16299_1709001_0.msi to your Surface. Now disconnect from the Internet. Go into device manager and uninstall and this time DELETE the drivers for the two USB items you previously uninstalled. Now run the MSI. When installation is completed, restart your Surface. Try one of the USB sticks that was not being recognized. (Connect to the Internet after trying a USB stick). 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, if you are within 10 days of installing 1709, you should be able to go back to your previous version of Windows. If past 10 days, sadly the only option is to wipe and reimage from a downloadable recovery image <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/surfacereco...</a> (and I know how painful that is).
<br />
<br />1709 seems to be causing issues for folks, although I've only seen one other report in this forum of this USB issue.

<p>Thanks for the advice. Just gave it a try and still nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do notice if I go into the Device Manager and down to either Intel USB 3.0 eXtensible Host Control OR USB Root Hub and then Properties/Events Both of them say Device Not Migrated and it's due to a partial or ambiguous match.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Device PCI\VEN_8086&amp;DEV_9D2F&amp;SUBSYS_72708086&amp;REV_21\3&amp;11583659&amp;0&amp;A0 was not migrated due to partial or ambiguous match.</p>
<p>Device USB\ROOT_HUB30\4&amp;db2fc44&amp;2&amp;0 was not migrated due to partial or ambiguous match.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm only 4 days from the 1709 update so thankfully I can do a roll back if needed.</p>
