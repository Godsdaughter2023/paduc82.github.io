<h2>            Windows 7 Update Repeatedly Updating Amyuni Document Converter 500</h2>
                    <p>Windows Update has installed <strong>"Amyuni Document Converter 500"</strong><strong>9 times since 11/25/2015</strong>. Each time Windows Update reports a successful update. Apparently Windows Update is not recognizing that the update has already been successfully
 installed.</p>
<p>Anyone care to advise?</p>

            Skype does not support customizing voicemail unfortunately.
<br />
<br />From Skype support:
<br />
<br />
<br />Why can't I record a custom greeting with Skype voice messaging?
<br />
<br />Custom outgoing voice messages are no longer supported. Instead, Skype will use the default message for your app language.

<h2>            Windows was unable to get a list of devices from Windows Update. Try again later. Windows 10 1709</h2>
                    I work on windows 10 laptops all day. It seems ever since the 1709 release, I always get this error. I have attempted to do the only fix I can find. Which is go to services, stop the windows update service, delete the software distribution folder within
 C:\WIndows. After doing so restart the services and try again. With no luck I cannot find an explanation or solution for this problem as it is becoming an increasing problem.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Are you using any Roxio or Nero programs? These have been known to cause this problem even<br />
if they were working well for a long period of time. If so check with their support.<br />
<br />
----------------</p>
<p>Check these :</p>

<p>You can use BlueScreenView to paste the BSOD info into a message here.<br />
<br />
VIEW - HTML Report ALL ITEMS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; or&nbsp; Right Click on a BSOD line and select same. Then copy and<br />
paste the lines in to a message here. Be sure and check the filename section. Also check the time<br />
in MyEventViewer for other possible information.<br />

<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>This "could" be a power supply problem though it is not the most common cause.</p>
<p>9f is&nbsp;likely a driver issue.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispware/security programs can also cause these issues.<br />
Have you added devices lately or updated drivers - be sure to check in Windows Updates to see<br />
if a driver was updated prior to this occurring. This could also be caused by a loose card or cable<br />
and even a weak power supply.<br />
<br />
That error means a driver is not handling the power state properly. Check in Control Panel - Device<br />
Manager to be sure major drivers are not shut off during sleep - double click Display Adapter - NIC<br />
and WIFI - Sound and others - Power Management tab - uncheck Allow computer to turn off power.<br />
Maybe only one has an issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Start - type in Search box - MSCONFIG&nbsp; find at top - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
General Tab - check Diagnostic Start&nbsp; - APPLY / OK&nbsp; -&nbsp; REBOOT<br />
<br />
Try it now. If it still blue screens think Video Driver. If not think NIC, Wifi, Sound, or......<br />
(and it still could be video interacting with something else). See&nbsp;troubleshooter link<br />
above for my generic driver update methods.<br />

    <title>How do I delete File History when it is turned off&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nathan sokalski  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I delete File History when it is turned off&#63;</h2>
                    <p>After turning File History off, it still left lots of files in:</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\Users\Nathan\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\FileHistory</p>
<p>
</p><p>I obviously do not want or need these files (I did not originally intend to have File History turned on at all), and they are taking up a reasonable amount of space. Is there a way to delete them (other than just manually deleting them) using some utility
 in Control Panel, File History, or Disk Cleanup? I would prefer to use some utility rather than manually deleting them to make sure I delete everything I can without deleting something that would cause a problem. Is there a utility for doing this, and if not,
 can someone direct me to a site with good instructions on what I can and cannot delete? Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To free up your computer’s hard drive disk space, Microsoft Windows 10 has a maintenance utility which is termed as Disk Cleanup. This utility will inspect your computer’s hard drive to remove unwanted files (which are
 no longer used) and eliminate those particular files. Disk Cleanup blanks the Recycle Bin, removes temporary files moreover system files along with the ones that are not being in use by users.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press Windows key + R to get the run window.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Type “cleanmgr” on the text field and click Ok.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you have many drive partitions on your computer then select Windows C drive or the drive that you wish to clean using the drop down menu of the Disk Cleanup Drive Selection. Follow the on-screen directions to complete
 the process. Once this is done restart the computer.</span></span></p>
<p>

<h2>            Blue Screen, Can&#39;t restore, can&#39;t reset</h2>
                    <p>I opened my laptop today and it booted normally, but as I was logging in using the fingerprint sensor the computer suddenly shut down and power seemed to have went out. I plugged in the laptop and tried booting again, but I kept getting blue screen no matter
 what I do. I cannot enter safe mode, startup repair did not work, I had no restore point to restore to, reset without deleting fiels did not work. I'm stuck now and don't know what to do. I have not had the chance to back up some files I cannot lose so I really
 don't want to use factory reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything I can do about it or is this a hardware issue. (The laptop was somewhat cold when I first booted it, just came back from outside).</p>

            Hi GXQiao
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />You have already tried every standard ways. I would recommend that you should consider a clean install of your existing Windows 10. You can use below guide by Greg Carmack, MVP for this purpose. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />(If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)

<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

<h2>            Upgrading the Dell Precision M4600 from Windows 7 to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Has anyone had any luck upgrading their&nbsp;Dell Precision M4600 from Windows 7 to Windows 10? &nbsp;If yes, please share how you did it. &nbsp;(Note: Clean install is not an option for me...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried twice a month ago and two months ago, but it failed both times. &nbsp;Since then I've accumulated a list of things to do before trying again, but I have yet to try it. &nbsp;(I'm in the middle of a project right now and can't afford to not have the computer
 working for a day.) Here's the list:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disable the service “Windows Error Reporting Service.”</p>
<p>Uninstall “Dell System Detect.”</p>
<p>Turn OFF Windows Defender real time protection under Settings (in Windows Defender).</p>
<p>Disable the Windows 10 unsupported display adapters. (Intel 3000)</p>
<p>Disable Fingerprint reader.</p>
<p>Uninstall iCloud if possible.</p>
<p>Remove the Guest account from Windows 7.</p>
<p>Disable "Turn on fast startup (recommended)" from&nbsp;Control Panel\Hardware and Sound\Power Options\System Settings</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. Your interest in Windows 10 is much appreciated.　</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p><span><span>Try to boot into <strong>Safe Mode with Networking</strong> and perform the Clean Boot.</span></span></p>
<span><span>
<p>Press and hold the <strong>shift key </strong>while clicking on <strong>Restart
</strong>at the login Screen (Bottom right corner).</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><li><span>1. Select <strong>T</strong></span><strong><span><span>roubleshoot</span></span></strong><span><span>and click on
</span></span><strong><span><span>Advanced Options</span></span></strong><span><span>.</span></span><span><span>2. Select
</span></span><strong><span><span>Startup Settings</span></span></strong><span><span>and click on
</span></span><strong><span><span>Restart</span></span></strong><span><span>.</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>3. After restarting, choose </span></span><strong><span><span>Enable Safe mode</span></span><span><span>with networking</span></span></strong><span><span>.</span></span>
</li><li><span><span>
<p>If the issue does not persists in Safe Mode, then perform a Clean Boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as Clean Boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p>Put the computer in Clean Boot and check if it helps.</p>
<p>By setting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</p>

            <p>I seem to have solved the issue, but it is too early to tell. I was also losing my connection to my WHS 2011 with every reboot and had to uninstall and reinstall the connector software after each reboot. The last time I uninstalled WHS Connector, I rebooted
 first before the reinstall. Now, it seems to be stable after reboot, and I have not had the system reboot unexpectedly yet.&nbsp; If that happens again, I will follow your instructions and perform the clean boot.&nbsp; Thank you for taking the time to respond.<br />
</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(31, 73, 125, 1)">Thank you for your reply. I posted above that I thought I had solved this issue when I finally got WHS 2011 Connector to work. That was an issue with Win 10 on this machine after
 the upgrade. After reinstalling it I found it would quit working upon each reboot. I solved that by uninstalling the connector, then rebooting and reinstalling. Now it works properly after every reboot.&nbsp; The problem with the sudden reboot of the system, is
 that it doesn’t happen regularly, but sporadically. Just after my reply today, when I said I thought the problem was solved, the system rebooted suddenly. It has not happened for several days, so I never know when it will happen again.&nbsp; Even if I do make a
 clean boot, as you suggest, it may work well for days before a problem shows up.&nbsp; Are there any log files that might indicate what happened when it rebooted? Otherwise I would have to work for a long time in clean mode which means I would have limited functionality
 for that duration.&nbsp; Any thoughts you might have would be appreciated.&nbsp; My PC is an HP Envy 700-230e with an Intel i7-4770 CPU and 32 GB RAM and a 2 TB drive with 1.44 TB available. I upgraded from win 8.1 to Win 10 the day it was released.&nbsp; If you need any
 other info, please let me know.</span></p>

<p>Not Having an Optical drive is not a problem now a days with laptop/Netbooks. You can easily USB/Pen Drive Boot or boot from an External USB DVD Drive.</p>
<p>I can not solve your problem but assure you you are not in soup.I can not provide you a shortcut to replace missing SVCHOST.EXE.</p>
<p>Purchasing a MS XP &amp; External USB DVD Drive will easily solve the problem.</p>
<p>My suggestion is you better Format your drive to get rid of the virus as SVCHOST.EXE infection is a severe infection Repair install &amp; Replacing a file will not stable your system for long.</p>
<p>You should format &amp; do a clean install of Win XP.</p>

    <title>Massive Problem with Microsoft Billing, Compounded by Poor Customer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Massive Problem with Microsoft Billing, Compounded by Poor Customer Service</h2>
                    <div>It took me 10 hours to find out an answer to a what should have been a relatively easy question to answer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Some background: I have an American billing address and (separate) shipping address, with a bank account in the US. However I am outside the country trying to make the purchase.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried to put a transaction through on the 19th of November, for a Surface 2 bundle. The transaction looked like it was approved (according to commerce.microsoft.com) and then reversed. I tried several times to put the transaction through but it didn't
 go through &nbsp;and I got "Error code: 30225", and so I called customer service in the US (using Skype!) to try and resolve the issue.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>No one had a clue. I called customer service and spent over four hours, before trying chat and spent a spectacularly long session with a rep (see below) where nothing was achieved.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><b>Chat start time</b></td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Answer Tech</b></td>
<td>&nbsp;Susan</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What's worse, her supervisor, Arlene, ended up dismissing me without honestly trying to figure out the problem, I'm sure thinking I was a belligerent customer with insufficient funds in his/her account. This exchange below is after I had repeatedly told
 Susan that my bank had verified that I had sufficient funds.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Arlene:</span><font>&nbsp;I reall would like to
 get this issue resolved . We have the same tools and resources here for placing orders and we don't want to try placing the order again because you might receive another preauthorization amount . For this, we recommend you contact your bank and let them know
 you have already tried using different ways to process the order, however it is still not going through.&nbsp;</font><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Arlene:</span><font>&nbsp;I hope the next time you try
 to place the order, it will complete successfully without any error messages.&nbsp;</font><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">You:</span><font color="red">&nbsp;Is my account flagged in any way?</font><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Arlene:</span><font>&nbsp;We are from the Microsoft Store
 customer service department not specifically from Billing department.</font><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Arlene:</span><font>&nbsp;They will alos provide you
 the same explanation.&nbsp;</font><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Arlene:</span><font>&nbsp;-also</font><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Arlene:</span><font>&nbsp;We apologize for the inconvenience.</font><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Arlene:</span><font>&nbsp;Please try to place the order
 again after you have verified with your bank that the account is okay .</font><br />
<span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">Arlene:</span><font>&nbsp;Thank you for doing business
 with Microsoft Store.&nbsp;</font></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>In the end, it was a customer rep intelligent enough to put all the pieces together to tell me that because of my country location and the different billing and shipping addresses it might have triggered a review of my cards and rendered them unusable
 in the MS store, because an internal review team may have labelled the transaction fraudulent. Chatted with another rep to verify that it might be unusable in the entire ecosystem including in physical stores, and there is no way to unflag the cards, because
 the review team is siloed.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have found several other people getting the same error message and unable to make purchases on other websites, with no answers and plenty of frustration.</div>

<div>It has happened to enough people that supervisors should be aware that Error 30225 might mean your card has been nullified by MS. And unfortunately it means that the Surface that I have waited a year and a half for, will never come to fruition.</div>
<div><br />

<div>Is there another way to resolve this block?</div>

            Just to close the loop (mostly) on my experience, for the benefit of other people hitting this issue...
<div><br />
<div>I have had follow-ups from MS folks and apparently my issues should be fixed. I haven't tried as it's now over a month since the sales and the time I wanted to actually buy things in the store in time for Xmas! Maybe I'll try again sometime but won't rush
 back as this was way too painful.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To summarize and make some guesses about what happened and may affect others in this situation:</div>
<div>1) There was some kind of block on my account which is apparently now removed.</div>
<div>2) I'm going to guess that these are anti-fraud blocks and probably applied automatically by some element of the Xbox/MS Store background systems.</div>
<div>3) I'm going to further guess that the call centre staff aren't party to the details of how the anti-fraud detection works so the mechanism stays confidential, and potentially as there could be investigations or even prosecutions going on. This would explain
 why they're not told anything and unable to help (no excuse for the "it's your bank" line though).</div>
<div><br />
<div>What MS needs to do:</div>
<div>- Change the message on the web and at the MS Store call centre to tell the customer/rep there is an issue with the account and either give them a phone number to call, or have them click a button to request someone investigates and calls them back.&nbsp;</div>
<div>- Get rid of the cryptic error message!</div>
<div>- On the call centre message, please don't tell them to blame the customer or the customers' bank. While I'm sure there are occasions where there's an authorization issue, I'm pretty sure the technology can tell the difference and vary the message!</div>
<div><br />
<div>Good luck everyone hitting this message, I wish you patience... :-)</div>

            To also close out my experience, I finally received my shipment.
<div><br />
<div>The delay in getting a resolution to the issue was because many of the items ordered were continually out of stock over the holiday season.<br />
<div><br />
<div>The two members of the Escalation Team (I'm not sure if I can use their names, so I won't) were very patient and extremely helpful.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I do agree that there are some things to be done. As has been posted in this thread previously, the error is being triggered by some sort of debit/credit card fraud prevention system. Which is absolutely necessary. However</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<ol>
<li>It seems that over at Xbox, they are aware of possible triggers, right down to the CSR level, which does not seem to be the case at the Microsoft Store. Harmonisation of the training to include cross-platform information (like this error) should certainly
 happen.</li><li>I also think a separate error code should appear when this issue arises, with a path to a resolution. With other stores, a simple call to a US customer service rep would circumvent the problem, but in this case your entire MS account is locked with no obvious
 way to unlock it.</li><li>Part of my problem was because I was making the purchase online from another country to a shipping address different from my billing address. A trifecta of no-no's, apparently. Microsoft should realise that there are many people outside of the country (e.g.
 Americans in foreign countries, foreign nationals abroad making purchases for people in the US). A warning should be placed on the website when choosing a region to help guide folk.&nbsp;</li><li>Please, train knowledgeable supervisors. Arlene was dismissive and unrepentant about it, trying as quickly as possible to disconnect the chat by either blaming me or my bank without looking for further resolution. It left a sour impression on me and led
 to my posting on several forums about it. Treating a customer like an idiot wasting your time is a great way to ensure terrible word of mouth.</li><li>Skype was a lifesaver. It spent seven of those 10 hours on the phone through Skype.</li><li>There is no dedicated "payment issues" or store issues section, where something like this would fall under.</li></ol>
<div>All in all, almost two months to the date, I have closed the loop.</div>

    <title>Working Solution To Obtain an Xbox One Live Open Nat - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> battle predator  say:</h3>
<h2>            Working Solution To Obtain an Xbox One Live Open Nat</h2>
                    
<p>This is specific instructions to obtain an <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>Xbox Live</strong></span>&nbsp;open NAT. The instructions work well if your internet provider issues you an IPv4 IP address. Unknown if this will work for IPv6 addresses. Please search for a video on youtube or lookup a tutorial on how to setup a static
 IP for your Xbox One.</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Setup a static IP address for your Xbox One</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Important. You need to port forward <strong>port&nbsp;3544</strong>&nbsp;to destination
<strong>port 3074 </strong>to your Xbox One's IP address. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>Do not</strong></span>&nbsp;port forward port 3544 to port 3544.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Forget about all the other ports Microsoft indicated needed to be port forwarded for Xbox Live at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Check to make sure your router <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>does not</strong> </span>do source port randomization. If it does, set up your router to allow all Xbox One outbound traffic to use&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>static ports,</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Unless you've made modifications to your consumer router's rules set to restrict outbound traffic then the above will work.</p>

<p>The information I've provided above is specifically to obtain an Xbox One Live open NAT. To obtain an open NAT for specific games you may need to forward specific ports. For instance Black Ops III requires you to forward port 3075 to destination port 3075
 to obtain and open NAT. I do not recommend using UPnP or DMZ as it could potentially cause security issues with your network. Let me know if this helps you out.</p>

<p>More ports are required than just 3544 and 3074 with the correct protocols</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Port 88 (UDP)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Port 3074 (UDP and TCP)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Port 53 (UDP and TCP)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Port 80 (TCP)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Port 500 (UDP)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Port 3544 (UDP)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Port 4500 (UDP)</p>
<p>These are just for the Xbox itself, if you want to play other games like Destiny a whole range of ports join in and for those things UPnP can be handy. Since the Xbox One is a closed system there is no direct security threat for using UPnP or DMZ</p>

<p>FearedNightmare based on your post you have no idea of how these protocols works. You may want to look into how keep state etc works to allow inbound traffic back into the system on these ports.</p>
<p>You claim that the Xbox One is a closed system. Sure anyone will agree about that, but you have no clue where the security problems exits. It's usually UPnP that is being exploited not the Xbox. Putting a your Xbox in a DMZ could also pose security issues.
 Do a search on Google and you will find endless security related information reference using DMZ's or UPnP. For you to say there's not direct security threat is absurd. Why do you think Microsoft Windows constantly provides security updates? Many of these
 updates are to patch exploits. Any don't forget Xbox One operating system is based on Windows 10.</p>
<p>There are more advanced ways to isolate your Xbox to from the rest of your network to help with potential security issues. &nbsp;And yes there are some games you will end up having to use UPnP or DMZ if the game uses a vast range of of ports.</p>
<p>My forum post is for a basic system setup with only a single Xbox One system. I explained it was specifically to obtain an Xbox Live open NAT and other ports maybe needed to be forwarded depending on the game. Those of you who actually try what I suggested
 will be quite happy with the results.</p>
<p>Anyways no reason to claim this doesn't work if you haven't tested this yourself. My assumptions are obviously based on what you posted.</p>
<p>For those of you who are having a hard time obtaining an open Xbox One Live NAT on an IPv4 based system I highly suggest you give my solution a try.</p>

<p>Xbox One users Let me make this simple. Forward port 3544 to 3074.</p>
<p>Reason:</p>
<p>Microsoft uses IPv6 so it first encapsulates your inbound traffic that eventually should go to port 3074 (Xbox Live) using Teredo:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teredo_tunneling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/.../Teredo_tunneling</a></p>
<p>That's why port 3544 needs to be forwarded to port 3074 if you have an IPv4 based system. Otherwise if your network is IPv6 based port 3544 will probably not even be used. Quote from wikipedia reference Teredo:</p>
<p>"Teredo should be disabled when native IPv6 connectivity becomes available"</p>
<p>Hope this has made my posts a little more understandable. I'm just trying to help. :)</p>

                    I have a Microsoft Arc mouse for my Surface Pro 2 which works well.&nbsp; I just purchased a Surface Pro 6 but the arc mouse does not work.&nbsp; Is the earlier version of the arc mouse not compatible with Surface Pro 6?

<p>Hi&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/09d1ab0d-3741-470a-aa84-69a9e058ad00" title="GeneRizzardo">GeneRizzardo</a><span> &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for raising this concern to us. As above mentioned the answer is "No". As long as the&nbsp;
<span>Microsoft Arc Mouse requires Windows 10 on a Bluetooth 4.0 Host to connect. If you are unsure whether or not your Host is Bluetooth 4.0 compatible, you may need to work with your Original Equipment Manufacturer.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>For the meantime, we suggest to r<span>emove the Microsoft Arc Mouse from your device.</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Select the <strong>Start&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;button &gt;&nbsp;<strong>Settings&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&gt; <strong>
Devices&nbsp;</strong>&gt; <strong>Bluetooth &amp; other devices</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Microsoft Arc Mouse</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Remove device</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>Do this to your Surface Pro 2 then Restart the device.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> make sure that the Microsoft arch mouse is not paired to the Surface Pro 2 before pairing it to Surface Pro 6.</p>

<p>Per the referenced Wikipedia page I have the Arc Touch Bluetooth Mouse.&nbsp; I purchased this mouse in 2014 when I purchased my Surface Pro 2.&nbsp; According to the referenced Wikipedia page there is the Surface Arc Mouse updated in 2017 which is probably the one
 I should use for my Surface Pro 6.&nbsp; I saw two models&nbsp; in Frys Electronics for $34 &amp; $35.&nbsp; Will pick up one of those.</p>

<h2>            Headphone not detected, disappeared from the playback devices</h2>
                    <p><em>Original Title: My headphones disappeared form the playback devices</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hey<br />
I have a problem my headphones were working just fine on my windows 8.1 laptop, they suddenly stopped working and are not visible in the playback devices and they are not configured and my laptop can't detect them, instead I got a bluetooth hands free device
 detected even though I never used any, I uninstalled it though, and I restarted the laptop many times and I can't figure out what's the problem, and the headphones work just fine on other computers and mobiles!<br />
Any help please? What can I do? </p>

    <title>Mouse Freezing Problem - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Mouse Freezing Problem</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
Ive had an issue that has started happening recently. I can't determine the exact cause even after trying many troubleshooting steps. Occassionally, the mouse will freeze in windows 8.1, 64 bit, running 8 gigs of ram, HP Pavilion g4, 500 gb HD, genuine copy
 of windows. When the mouse freezes, applications still run, web pages still refresh. Some of the function keys still work like mute, volume, and brightness. Also a lot of the keys wont work. If i try &nbsp;to switch windows with alt-tab, the alt-tab window freezes
 on screen, and after pressing it a few times it will change windows, but the alt-tab screen will still be there. I can't use shortcuts like win+D, and pressing escape sometimes brings me back to the windows start menu. On the desktop, pressing number keys
 opens the respective icon on my taskbar (example: chrome is the first icon, pressing 1 will open a chrome window). I suppose it might be something with the ctrl key getting stuck, since usually ctrl+number opens taskbar shortcuts. in order to fix it, i have
 to press ctrl-alt-del and sign out and sign in, then it works fine. Ive looked in the event logs for clues, updated drivers, run windows update, and nothing seems to fix it. If i open task manager, i cant switch to it because i cant change the active window,
 but it looks like everyting is running normally (no unresponsive tasks).<br />
At first i thought this was a problem with chrome, because i started noticing it was happening when chrome was open and being used. However, it happens with windows explorer, my music players, and other programs. The interval of freezing is irregular. Ive checked
 for viruses with malwarebytes and avast.<br />
Please help<br />
Thanks

            Hi guys<br />
ive been away from the internet for awhile so sorry for not updating<br />
Interesting news though<br />
I upgraded my APU today from an a6-4600m to an a10-4400m and have spent about 12 hours on the computer without it freezing once.&nbsp;<br />
I didnt try testing it in safe mode yet<br />
Will report with more updates if it keeps happening<br />
I wouldnt think a processor upgrade would make this happen, but i guess with windows, anythings possible

            Hi,
<div>1. Which is the antivirus program installed in the computer? <br />
<br />
2. Was it working before? <br />
<br />
3. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue? <br />
<br />
4. Do you get any error messages? <br />
<br />
5. What happens when you unplug the USB after the issue? </div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1: </strong></div>
<div><br />
You may also temporarily disable security software and check if you can access Windows explorer while connecting flash drives. Antivirus program ideally works in the background to check if there is any infected files present in Flash drive.
<div>Refer:</div>

<div>Note: Once you are done with clean boot, please follow step 7 in the article to put your computer back to normal startup.</div>

<strong>Method 3: <br />
<br />
</strong><br />
As all the hardware devices have drivers associated similarly USB devices also have it. Sometimes proper drivers do not get detected after the initial installation so reinstallation of the drivers helps resolve the issues.</div>
<div><br />
You may check after<strong> uninstalling and reinstalling the USB </strong>drivers if you are able to connect. You may disconnect all USB devices and then perform the following steps:</div>
<div>a. Click <strong>Start</strong>, and then click <strong>Control Panel</strong>.<br />
<div>b. Click <strong>System and Maintenance</strong>, click <strong>System</strong>, and then click
<strong>Device Manager</strong>. <br />
<div>Note If Control Panel is in Classic View, double-clickSystem, and then clickDevice Manager.</div>
<div><br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click
<strong>Allow</strong>.</div>
<div>c. In Device Manager, double click to expand "<strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>", right click on the
<strong>Host Controller</strong>, click "<strong>Uninstall</strong>" and click "<strong>OK</strong>".</div>
<div><strong>Check if at all there is an exclamation mark along the driver, it suggests issues with the driver installed.</strong></div>
<div><br />
d. Repeat the step 2 to uninstall all items under "<strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>".</div>
<div><br />
Then, restart your computer and Windows 7 will reinstall all USB controllers automatically.</div>
<div><br />
If you still face the same issue then you may check for the updated USB device drivers using windows update. Refer to the below link for assistance–</div>

<div><br />
If the issue sill persists I would request you to check for chipset driver updates which you can get at the manufacturer website. The chipset drivers normally incorporate USB controller drivers as well.</div>
