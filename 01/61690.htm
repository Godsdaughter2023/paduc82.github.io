<h2>            Apps language suddenly changed &#33;</h2>
                    <p>after the latest update some of my windows 10 apps have changed their language from English to Thai. The tile's title is in Thai, as is the menu.&nbsp;I've checked settings&gt;language, and the windows display language is still English, region is set to Australia,
 so should n't all apps be in English ? Apps affected are Mail, Photos, video player&nbsp;and a couple of others, yet some are not.</p>
<p>build version is 1607. I am actually in Thailand at the moment, could it have auto-detected that and changed languages when updating ? For example, the Mail app menu :</p>

<p>Edit : I've uninstalled the Thai language pack, restarted laptop,&nbsp;but the tiles are STILL in Thai ! WTH ?</p>

<h2>            PresentationFontCache</h2>
                    lately the performance of Win7 has gone way down.&nbsp; Both processors seem to spend most of their time at 100% utilization.&nbsp; when I go into the Resource Monitor, about 50% of the CPU utilization is taken up by PresentationFontCache.&nbsp; What is it, and why should
 it be constantly taking so much of the CPUs?

<p><span><span>Hi AndrewPerformance,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The service PresentationFontCache.exe is only usefull if you use WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)
 applications. If not, start services.msc and disable the service.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Go to start and type services.msc and locate the service and set it to manual.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>That state-of-the-art PC you bought last year might not feel like such a screamer after you install
 a dozen programs, load it with antispyware and antivirus tools, and download untold amounts of junk from the Internet.</span></span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to Optimize windows 7 for better performance.</span></p>
<p>
<span>The first thing that you can try is the Performance troubleshooter, which can automatically find and fix problems. The Performance troubleshooter checks issues that might slow down your computer's
 performance, such as how many users are currently logged on to the computer and whether multiple programs are running at the same time.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Open the Performance troubleshooter by clicking the
<strong>Start</strong> button, and then clicking <strong>Control Panel</strong>. In the search box, type
<strong>troubleshooter</strong>, and then click <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>. Under
<strong>System and Security</strong>, click <strong>Check for performance issues</strong>.

    <title>Start menu sign out the user and unable to access the email and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rushfan3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Start menu sign out the user and unable to access the email and settings.</h2>
                    <p>I have been having issue with my account credentials verification, to which I thought was solved until it popped up again today. After trying to see what it was talking about, because all of my information was correct as it's my log in information to my
 Microsoft account, my start button, Action center, and such wouldn't work, and as a matter of fact, my start button was constantly signing me out and requiring me to sign back in to my account, but it never fixed my issue with everything. It was only after
 I tried to click into something did it bring up Edge, and it appeared that Edge was corrupted, BUT, I still am having issues trying to get into the settings part of Your Email and Account settings, as it just throws the dots on the screen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I fix that so I can get it back to working again?? Is there some sort of a troubleshooter program that I can run to try and fix it?</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>I appreciate if you could answer few questions to narrow down to the issue.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What is the make and model of the computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What exactly means when you say, “</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">just throws the dots on the screen.”</span></p>

 restart the computer and log in with Microsoft Account and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</span></span></p>

 of it. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">All Windows updates are current on my machine. The only thing I know of that I did differently in the past 5 days was move files around on my OneDrive, which included deleting extra files that I only wanted online access to instead
 of access on my PC. Oh, and I also disabled my Bluetooth on my PC so that I could use the Bluetooth on my phone instead for music streaming, as I didn't want sounds from my Facebook games to interfere with the music I was trying to listen to.&nbsp;Oh and I just
 renewed my Kaspersky Internet Security no more than 5 days prior to this.</span></p>
<p>There is no way I can access Verify on the settings menu. I am going to add a picture of it to show you EXACTLY what I am seeing. (Dots and all.)</p>

<p>
</p><p>And I edited to also add in that the Start Button and Windows Key issue worked itself out, though, as I said, Edge reset itself so I lost all of my bookmarks and reading pages. But the Accounts issue is what I'm inquiring about because I'm unable to access
 it, as the picture shows.</p>

            <p>Ok... here's what worked, because I fixed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I went into reboot, but to I hit the shift key when hitting restart. That sent me into a menu where I could choose to start in safe mode with Networking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I was in there, I did a system restore from March 11th, which was when I received Microsoft updates. I continued to have issues syncing my accounts, to which I found the solution to that. I put my PC back in safe mode and checked out to see if it would
 load. Yes, it would in safe mode. I disabled my virus protection, and BOOM, there was the issue. So I uninstalled and reinstalled it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Account pulls up.... and the issue that was causing my Account credentials to go bonkers? My GMail account was also linked into my Mailbox settings. And I say Was because I removed it! I also disabled the sync, closed it down, and then restarted to find
 that everything is now back to being kosher. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So there's the solution in a nutshell.... and I don't know why Kaspersky Internet Security did that, but it did. If there's any issues, I will contact them because their product is what caused the issue.

    <title>No &#34;Allow wake timers&#34; option in advanced power settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> randy_845  say:</h3>
<h2>            No &#34;Allow wake timers&#34; option in advanced power settings</h2>
                    <p>There is no "Allow wake timers" option under "Sleep" (or&nbsp; anywhere) in the advanced power settings. The only option under "Sleep" is "Sleep after". Was this removed in a recent update? Might it be something that a group policy removed? Could it be something
 specific to the Surface Pro 4? I need to be able to disable the wake timers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Possibly related information: "Allow scheduled maintenance to wake up my computer at the scheduled time" is greyed out in the maintenance settings in the "Security and Maintenance" control panel and the "Schedule a time" radio button in "Restart options"
 in "Settings" is also greyed out (and supposedly off, but I do not know if the setting is honored when there is no option to change the setting).</p>

            Hi Louis.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to open Task Manager, show More Details, then choose Processes tab, scroll down to Windows Processes, then further down to Windows Explorer.  Right click to Restart, click OK.  Restart PC.
<br />
<br />Next go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p><span><span>Here's a tutorial on doing a complete backup and resotre in Vista that might help you find out what you might be doing
 wrong: <a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial145.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial145.html</a>.&nbsp; You may need to select&nbsp; from another computer if/when presented with that option and then browse to find the backup.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This is an EXCELLENT article on the Backup and Restore Process in Vista
</span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2007.09.backup.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2007.09.backup.aspx</a><span>&nbsp;but it doesn't go into great detail about the restore process - almost considering
 so easy it's self-evident.&nbsp; But it does teach you a lot about what is possible and how to do it.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It also focuses mostly on the complete backup process but it does mention the full backup and restore process as well.<br />
<br />
Here's an article on how to use Advanced Restore (when normal restore doesn't work):
</span><a href="http://www.mayankraichura.com/post/2009/08/06/Avdvanced-Restore-via-Windows-Vista-Backup-and-Restore-Center.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.mayankraichura.com/post/2009/08/06/Avdvanced-Restore-via-Windows-Vista-Backup-and-Restore-Center.aspx</span></a><span>.<br />
<br />
I also found the following (but don't know if it's true or not):</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>After starting "Backup and Restore Center"</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>I selected "Advanced Restore"</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>I wasn't asked for an Administrator password....maybe because my account is an administrator account.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Selected "Files from a backup made on a different computer"</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the Dialog stating "Select the location of the backup to restore", select "Hard disk, CD or DVD......"</span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Under the drop-down box, select your drive/partition and continue
</span></p>
<p><span><span>7.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If there are any backups on your drive, it will show a list of them.</span></p>
<p><span><span>8.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In my case, it did show a backup but in backup location, it will show "Backup location is not available."</span></p>
<p><span><span>9.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>I was frustrated but then I somehow just selected that backup(yes....even though it said that the
<strong>Backup location is not available"</strong> </span></p>
<p><span><span>10.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>and pressed "Next"</span></p>
<p><span><span>11.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Guess what....not error!!!!!</span></p>
<p><span><span>12.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>A window showed up asking me whether I wanted to perform complete restore or I would like to select specific folders/files.</span></p>
<p><span><span>13.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>I selected the folders I wanted to restore and bingo...it restored them smoothly.</span></p>
<p><span><span>14.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>So next time see an error, try to continue with it..;)</span></p>
<span>I don't know if this will help you, but it does provide a lot of information about the process (when it works) even it really applies to the full backup rather
 than the complete backup - it shows that sometimes if you ignore the message and just try anyway it may work..&nbsp; Hopefully you will find some error or discrepancy in your procedure and this will clear it up and allow you to restore.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span>

<p>The partitioning shouldn't matter because you could do a complete backup of only one partition at a time so the complete backup doesn't really know about any other partitions than the one it did a complete backup for (presumably your C:\ drive).&nbsp; Even if
 some of the boot records are wrong because there were multiple partitions before the restore process is not going to recognize this - it's just going to restore what was backed up whether it is currently right or wrong (as long as the partition you're restoring
 to is at least as big as the one the backup came from and they are both formatted the same way which I assume is NTFS).</p>
<p>I honestly don't know what else to suggest.&nbsp; You seem to have done everything right concerning the restore process.&nbsp; Perhaps the backup process didn't work correctly and you don't have a valid backup to restore - but there's nothing I know to do about that.</p>
<p>The only remaining option I know is to go to a data recovery technician to see if they can recover the information.&nbsp; The issue there is that they are VERY expensive and they don't guarantee results (you pay if they recover everything or if they recover nothing).&nbsp;
 Also since this is a complete backup it isn't the same as the normal recovery procedures they use - I'm not sure how they could recover the entire backup so it would restore properly - but I suppose you could call and ask if it's possible and how much it would
 cost.&nbsp; The decision is yours.</p>
<p>I'm sorry I can't help more, but I'm out of ideas here.</p>
<p>I hope this helps (even if it gives no answers other than an expensive recommendation).</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Hi, here's a link to the page detailing how to change the language on your Xbox console:&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/kinect/dashboard-or-hub-in-another-language" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/kinect/dashboard-or-hub-in-another-language<br />

<p>Not all places have English as a selectable language. So it's quite possible that you're going to be stuck in Norwegian unless the site that HammerfellChick posted actually has the English drop down box.</p>

<h2>            HP Envy x360 Won&#39;t Auto-Switch to Tablet Mode</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 2 year old HP Envy x360 with Windows 10. Recently, when I fold my laptop into the tent or tablet positions, it remains in desktop mode even though I have the settings set to "Don't ask me and always switch." In addition to this, the keyboard and
 trackpad stay active when the laptop is folded back, so even when I put it in tablet mode and flip the display manually, I have to hold the device up vertically to avoid keys being pressed or the trackpad being clicked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a real inconvenience because I use my laptop for a lot of reading and watching, which is a lot easier to do in tablet mode than in desktop mode. What should I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Thadian</p>

<p>Hi Thadian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue you're experiencing with switching to tablet mode automatically might be due to a driver misconfiguration. That being said, we'll need more information in order to isolate the possible causes of your concern. Please answer the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you getting any error messages?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li><li>Have you installed the latest updates for Windows 10?</li><li>What is the current <strong>OS</strong> <strong>Build</strong> of your Windows 10 device? You can find this information by clicking the
About your PC</span>, press <span style="font-weight: bold">Enter</span>, and then scroll down to
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, we suggest performing a <strong>clean</strong> <strong>boot</strong> to eliminate the possibility of a software conflict.
<span>A <strong>clean</strong> <strong>boot</strong> is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you use your HP device. Please follow the steps outlined in this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="How to perform a clean boot in Windows">support article</a></strong> on how to perform a

<p>
</p><p>I have not received any error messages; the system simply stays in desktop mode. The only troubleshooting I've done so far is restarting my laptop and then I just tried doing a clean boot, but the problem persists. Windows 10 is up to date. The OS build
 is 16299.214.</p>

</p><p>I installed the updates for both the BIOS and the chipset drivers, but it didn't resolve the problem. I ran the troubleshooter, but it wasn't able to identify any problems. Could it be a physical issue (like a sensor being damaged or something)?</p>

<p>Thank you for the information you provided. There is a possibility that this is a hardware issue but we can't be certain about that. If you wanted to be sure you can contact the Manufacturer of your device and ask if they have the fix for this. You can also,
 perform the following steps below: </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Create new user account</a></strong> and set the Settings again to "Don't ask me and always
 switch" under Tablet mode. </li><li>If the same issue persists, perform Safe Mode to see if this is a driver issue or not. You can head over to this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> for the instructions.

            Hey Thadian, i had the same problem and might have a solution for you. If you go to the Hp drivers page you should find driver called Flip lock driver. Download that and delete the old driver first (if you have it at all) then install the new driver. I
 hope it helps :)

<p>J'ai eu le même probleme que toi, je l'ai acheté le jour de la sortie et j'ai rempli le formulaire et...ecran blanc.</p>
<p>Je sais que pour l'ancienne carte il fallait imprimer un papier avec un code à presenter dans le magasin dans lequel tu voulais retirer ta carte. Mais la dans le descriptif ils disent qu'il faut presenter le code en magasin, peut etre que celui qu'on a eu
 avec le jeu. J'irai voir lundi pour savoir ce qu'il faut vraiment. J'espere qu'on à pas perdu la carte carte le visuel est vraiment stylé pour la version Xbox.</p>

<h2>            computer hanging on &#34;searching for previous versions of microsoft windows&#34;</h2>
                    hello,<br />
i recently turned on my pc after a long period of inactivity (about a year) only to be told that my system32 file was corrupt. decided to try and repair windows using the original xp disc. typing 'r' to repair seemed to be working but then after selecting which
 version i wanted to log onto the computer freezes, the cd drive stops spinning and the harddisc shows no activity. i tried this many times before becoming frustrated and deciding on a complete reinstallation of xp.<br />
the computer loads up all drivers (as shown on the bottom of the screen). everything seems to go fine until it reaches&nbsp; "searching for previous versions of microsoft windows..." at which point the cd drive stops spinning and nothing happens.
<br />
<br />
i've tried 3 different cd drives (including an external usb) and they all get to the same point but not beyond it.<br />
<br />
has anyone experienced this before or know of how i can get around it?<br />
<br />
any help is appreciated.

<h2>            Xbox 360 Games and Achievements Not Showing Up in Xbox One Profile or Activity Feed</h2>
                    <p>I unlocked 14 of 20 achievements from the Xbox 360 Kinect game "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire: 2012 Edition" this afternoon.&nbsp; I was on Xbox Live when I did so, as all the achievements are stamped 09/24/2017.&nbsp; I earned an extra 700 GS, and my GS updated as it would normally.&nbsp; However, the game itself, as well as the achievements I unlocked, do not show up on my Xbox One profile or activity feed.</p><p><br /></p>

<p>Why?&nbsp; This isn't an isolated case, either.&nbsp; "Family Game Night: Fun Pack" has never been listed in my Xbox One profile, too.&nbsp; What gives?&nbsp; Why does my GS update correctly, but the games and achievements NOT show up?</p>

<h2>            zune </h2>
                    
<p>Just recently i bought a zune player I figured i would try to go to zunes web site and download the move dlc that i have purchesed off the xbox zune just to find out that is not the case thay chainged the rights with out telling. Zune just chainged there
 policy and what is&nbsp;downloaded from the xbox zune&nbsp;is not showing up on the zune net . I have worked with zune on this and xbox on this also billing .microsoft do to my purches history with zune the problem is if zune is apart of microsoft thay should not restrict
 the dlc to the xbox systemand alow the acount holder to have acses to the dlc on the z.net web site So in short if you have a zune acount be aware that xbox and zune will pass you around and say that is not the policy but the web says other wise (Buy Once,
 Play Anywhere) <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/Live/Zune" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.xbox.com/en-US/Live/Zune</a></p>
<p>Zune goes where you go. Buy your favorite movies or TV shows on Zune and enjoy them with your Xbox 360 and on your PC, Windows Phone 7 and Zune HD.</p>
<p>as of zunes policy it gos like this( <a href="http://www.zune.net/en-US/support/zunemarketplace/videos/buyingrentingvideos.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.zune.net/en-US/support/zunemarketplace/videos/buyingrentingvideos.htm</a>)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Watch videos on different screens—on a standard- or high-definition TV, on a computer, and on a Zune device.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</li><li>
<p>there is no policy that says that it is restricted to one device. But both will say it is at this time i cant use anny of the dlc i bought off zune xbox on my zune do to the web sit says i have no purches history</p>
</li><li>
<p>If xbox is going to promot zune on it's system thay should support it and not pass the buck same with zune and microsoft do to thay are microsofts productsat this time i have over 150 moves that will not work with my zune do to not purches history on zune.net
 .</p>
</li><li>
<p><strong>the beast support i got was being passed around like candy and being told by&nbsp; xbox and zune I am ( S.O.L *** OUT OF LUCK THERE IS NOTHING THAY WILL DO ) BUT THAY PROMOTE THE PRODUCTS. AWSOME FOR GOLED MEMBERS THAT PAY FOR THE SERVICE.</strong></p>

<p>Oh, ok. I see what this is.</p>
<p>Unfortunatly, certain&nbsp;content, such as movies,&nbsp;are restricted only to the device or console you purchase it on. On the purchase screen, you can see what devices you can view the content on before you purchase.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm going to guess you purchased the content on the console and the purchase was restricted to only be viewed on the console, not the Zune Player, Zune Software, or Windows Phone 7.</p>
<p>If you are wanting to watch content on your Zune Player, you will need to purchase the content from the Zune Software on your PC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helps explain the situation. If it doesn't, I know someone who can help you better than I with Zune-related problems.</p>

<p>MICROSOFT&nbsp; SAID&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overview </p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Device bans are not issued lightly, and occur when a particular Xbox console or Xbox on Windows device is used to violate the Code of Conduct in an egregious or repeated manner. Once a device ban occurs, no
 account can connect to the Xbox Live service from the affected device. Given the severity of this action we take each device ban extremely seriously, and only take action after a lengthy investigation.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Devices can be banned from Xbox Live for a number of reasons, including but not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Xbox console tampering, such as physically opening an Xbox console and modifying it to play illegitimate or unauthorized software</li><li>Online fraud, such as phishing, account theft, or other attempts to defraud Microsoft or other players</li><li>Repeated egregious violations of the Microsoft Services Agreement that establish a clear pattern of nefarious activity</li></ul>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Please note that banning an Xbox console or Xbox on Windows device does not disrupt the underlying functionality of the device, and it can continue to be used offline following the ban. For more information
 about using Xbox One offline, visit&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/using-xbox-one-offline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">xbox.com/offline</a>.</p>

            As stated in your other threads, you cannot add a new account to a banned console since it cannot connect to Live. If you already had an account on the console, you would have to continue to use that.

    <title>Acer Swift 1 Fingerprint Login Issue - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Acer Swift 1 Fingerprint Login Issue</h2>
                    <p style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">
Hi,</p>
<p style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">
I have just recently bought an Acer Swift 1 laptop with Windows 10 Home. On the whole it looks great and performs well for the price, and does everything I need it to.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">
The only issue seems to be the fingerprint scanner is very hit and miss - it takes a long time to register a print in Windows Hello (comes up with multiple "your device is having trouble recognising you" messages), and when it does it only seems to work about
 maybe one in five times (same error message), usually meaning I have to log in with a pin (first world problems etc.)</p>
<p style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">
So far I have tried:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
Updating the driver 2) Uninstalling and reinstalling the driver 3) Deleting and re-recording my fingerprint 4) Recording a different finger, to no avail. I have visually inspected and cleaned the sensor.</p>
</li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">
Does anyone have any suggestions / quick fixes for this? If I cannot resolve it it is not a huge issue (I can just log in with a pin in 2 seconds), and I can't really be bothered to send it back and wait 7 days etc just to repair this one component.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">
Interestingly I had a similar issue with a LG G6 phone last year too, so maybe its me.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">
Thanks in advance.</p>

            Hi there, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />The steps that you've tried are exactly what I would normally suggest. I've also noticed that other users report more success with fingerprint scanners after a clean install of Windows, but before we try that you can give these steps a go:
<br />
<br />Perform a clean boot:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/929135...</a>
<br />Boot into Safe Mode to see if the problem persists:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/12376/...</a>
<br />Run the System File Checker tool:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833...</a>

<br />
<br />If none of the above helps, it might be worth trying a reset of your PC if you're willing to reinstall your apps:

<br />
<br />Please let me know if you need further support! Thanks!

            Hi, thank you for your answer. Bizarrely, I have come in from work this evening and the fingerprint scanner seems to be working perfectly, everytime. I'll see if it keeps this up, and if not will give your solutions a try and let you know how it goes.
 Thanks again!<br />

<p>I would have said yes but since I used the dev console to get all the achievements for Fallout 3 PC, I can't really judge anymore.

<p>Nope ; because that is why you bought a console to play the games that you want . I am planning&nbsp; to buy it later now that is very cheap. I know my kids will have fun with it. If you feel ashamed for games that you played you should hide your games played.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-5.gif" />
 On personal note i don't care what&nbsp; gamers thinks of my games played...they don't give me money to buy games.</p>

    <title>Xbox One Adapter game and chat volume the same&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One Adapter game and chat volume the same&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><span>I bought a pair of XO 7s and I was told that I could mix the game and chat volume with the new Xbox One adapter. This is not working for me. I press the game button and try to turn it up, it works fine, but then I press the chat button to turn people
 up, it turns the game volume up with it. Its like the two buttons are doing the same thing. If I press either button, the game and chat volume will go up and down together. I turn the game volume all the way down and I cant hear anyone speak. I turn the chat
 all the way down and I cant hear the game. Is there something wrong with my adapter? If anyone is having problems with this I found a work around. Turn your headsets up so you can hear people talk and then go into the settings of your game and turn the master
 volume down so the game is not to loud.</span></p>

<p>The Volume + and - raises and lowers ALL volume. The Game and Chat buttons adjust the mix between the two. That means, repeatedly press the Game button to raise the Game volume, in relation to chat. Press the chat button repeatedly to raise the chat volume.
 This is completely independent of the volume.</p>
<p>This of it like a mixing board. You have a slider for the Game track, a slider for the Chat track, and a Master volume slider.</p>

<p>@Skitals, that's wrong. &nbsp;Pressing the game button, then pressing the volume up and down buttons will only change the game audio. &nbsp;Pressing the chat button, then pressing the volume up and down buttons will only move the chat audio. &nbsp;Default when plugging
 the adapter in is game audio. &nbsp;@x1Hx Sounds like there might be a problem with the XO-7's mic being recognized by the adapter. &nbsp;My beats were doing the same thing until I got a mic that was compatible. &nbsp;Also make sure your security preferences under settings
 is set to Everyone under in game chat and not just Friends.</p>

<h2>            Stop making us pay a fee to use Netflix and Hulu&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Other than squeezing more money out of us (because you can get away with it), is there any OTHER reason why we have to have xbox live gold for these? I actually don't play games online, so the fee is harder for me to understand.</p>
<p>Loyal but pissed...</p>

<p>The services are locked by gold only because that's what they have said to Microsoft. Xbox Live is the largest community in the world for gaming. Losing 1 paying customer isn't going to hurt them. This is Microsoft you're talking about.</p>

<p>Exactly and I think many of the people here think Live is more popular than it actually is. Xbox Live Gold only accounts for something like 33% of all consoles sold. I think a lot of you are assuming that most people with an Xbox 360 are paid subscribers.
 So now what happens if the people who do not like multiplayer do not return because they can get things like media options elsewhere for zero dollars extra?</p>

<p>Yeah, my cousin wants nothing to do with online play because he could care less, I tried it by buying one of those 3 month cards and while I gained a small bit of enjoyment from it I don't think I'll be getting anymore cards&nbsp;but you never&nbsp;know as it stands&nbsp;it
 just wasn't worth it to me. And yeah as far as his right to complain I am tired of people being smarted off when they want to complain anyone who is a paying customer has the right to complain and voice their opinion were the ones who make these companies
 rich we should have at least a voice in the services and products they put out.</p>

<p>@Viral. It's not up to the program developers though. It's up to Microsoft because its their platform. Microsoft is not sharing any of those Gold dollars with Netflix. It's more like the other way around and the companies are paying Microsoft to put their
 apps on the console. Microsoft even charges $40,000 just for something like a 3MB patch. They also get paid every time Netflix, Hulu and whoever else wants to advertise their service as a dashboard ad. Those one week ads can get as pricy as hundreds of thousands
 of dollars. During holidays they can get close to 400,000 for a single day..</p>

<p>we are paying for many services and one of which is the service to access the xbox servers to stream video apps as well as play online. the fee also helps pay for customer support. netflix not working on the xbox? you call xbox customer support right? we
 are paying for the people who help us with fixing issues like netflix not working or basically anything not working on the xbox. this is just one thing to think about. because the money we pay to microsoft for the xbox live gold services is not just a fee
 to play online.</p>

<h2>            Remote Access Connection Manager Fails To Start</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 Pro, with latest updates, on a corporate domain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to use my VPN as the Remote Access Connection Manager service is not running, despite being set to start automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try to start it manually I get an error saying that it could not be started and I should check the event logs. The error in the event logs is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Log Name: System</p>
<p>Source: RasMan</p>
<p>Event ID: 20030</p>
<p>"Remote Access Connection Manager failed to start because it could not load one or more communication DLLs. Ensure that your communication hardware is installed and then restart the Remote Access Connection Manager service. If the problem persists, contact
 the system administrator. There was an unknown error."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other people in my company are experiencing the same issue. We use HP laptops and those with Realtek NICs have this problem, but those with Intel NICs do not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried removing and reinstalling all networking devices in Windows. I have also tried installing the latest driver for the Realtek NIC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked that the following registry keys exist and are configured correctly:</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RasMan\Parameters\AllowL2TPWeakCrypto = 0</p>
<p><span>HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\RasMan\Parameters\</span>AllowPPTPWeakCrypto = 0</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked that the services on which RasMan is dependent are running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked that the SYSTEM account has read and execute permissions on ..\System32\rasman.dll + rasmans.dll + rasppp.dll + rastapi.dll</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can tell I've been at this for a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really don't want to have to resort to a system reset as this is also affecting remote users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's hoping...</p>

</p><p>Due to the nature of your query which involves Remote Access Connection Manager while connected on a domain, it'll be best if you redirect this query to the

 more geared towards the ins and outs of&nbsp;Remote Access Connection Manager related problems. Hence, they will be better to provide the best answer to your query.

    <title>Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System driver blue screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stormstrydom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System driver blue screen</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gotten two or three blue screen error recently all because of the&nbsp;Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System driver. I haven't been able to find any answered questions on this site so I'm starting a new one (sorry if there was one and I missed it).</p>
<p>
</p><p>These errors only appear when I resume my computer after hibernation. Can anyone help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some further information: </p>
<p>Dell Inspiron N5110</p>
<p>Windows 7</p>
<p>Windows update already run and no updates for this driver found</p>
<p>My Dell (PC Doctor application) gives: "The "Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System" driver (C:\windows\system32\drivers\acpi.sys) appears to have caused a system crash.</p>
<p>The driver listed above has version: 6.1.7601.17514</p>
<p>Busy sorting out another error with intel where my usb 3.0 drivers have mysteriously disappeared.</p>
<p>Before both the usb 3.0 drivers disappeared and this blue screen first started I did drop my laptop off of a couch. This was about half a meter (about 2 feet) off the ground. Not sure if this might have caused anything so I'm just mentioning it in case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any help would be much, much appreciated!</p>

</p><p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forum.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand that you have issues with random blue screen in the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>But, in order to help you better, I would like to know some more information related to this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1) What is the complete error message that you receive?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2) Did you make any other changes in the computer?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In the meanwhile, please try to follow the suggestions mentioned below to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: </span></strong><span>I would have you boot the computer in safe mode and then try hibernating the computer because, you
</span>get the issue after resuming from the hibernation.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1: </span></strong><span>Refer to the link to boot in safe mode.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Advanced startup options (including safe mode).</span></strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2: </span></strong><span>If the doesn't occur&nbsp;in safe mode, I would suggest you to perform clean boot because, putting you</span><span>r system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are
 causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot. R</span><span>ef</span>er to the link to perform clean boot.</p>

</p><p><strong><span><em>Note: </em></span></strong><span><em>Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong><span>If that doesn’t help then, try to follow the link mentioned below to resolve the driver issue that isn't working properly</span> and see if that helps in fixing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Update the driver that isn’t working properly</span></strong></p>

            <p>Hi, thank you for replying</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I'm not sure what the complete error is. How can I find the details of the error so I can show them here? On the blue screen it says "The BIOS in this system is not fully ACPI compliant. Please contact your system vendor for an updated BIOS."</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I made no changes since the 12 of March 2014. That update was KB2918077. The computer was functioning normally since the update until a few days ago. The only change that occured at the same time was the disappearance of the USB 3.0 drivers (Currently
 in contact with Dell for this error</p>
<p>.) Not sure if the two could be related.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try those suggested methods as soon as a possible. However I have noted the blue screen is not after every hibernation but rather when the laptop is left hibernated over night (ie extended periods of time). After resuming after a 1-2 hour hibernation
 the system is fine and fully functioning. So I'll hibernate it in safe mode and leave it for 8-9 hours and then try system resume and see what happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again for replying and helping</p>
