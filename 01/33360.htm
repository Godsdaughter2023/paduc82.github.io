<h2>            Windows 7 Desktop Wallpaper</h2>
                    A few days ago, I connected to my computer remotely. Ever since then, control panel says: Desktop Wallpaper is disabled by the system administrator. Why is my wallpaper disabled on windows 7, and how do I fix it?

    <title>cannot configure software raid-1 in windows 7 ultimate - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            cannot configure software raid-1 in windows 7 ultimate</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to install Windows 7 ultimate on a new build with 2 drives. I have it working with one disk, now trying to add the second as raid 1 of the first. Windows formatted the first with a 100 mb EFI system partition, and the remainder as NTFS. I've converted
 the system drive to dynamic. Right clicking the NTFS volume and selecting Add mirror asks which disk? When I select the second it says "You cannot mirror the current boot voulmn on another disk with a different partition style." I've tried matching the partitions
 with no luck, however. Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Got-it!&nbsp; Missing step was to convert the second hard disk to GPT.</p>
<p>For whatever reason Windows 7 installer created the boot disk with a GPT while the disk manager partitioned the second disk with a MBR. Totally by accident I noticed that another tool showed they weren't the same. Going back to Disk Manager I saw the option
 to convert to GPT, once that was done the process worked as it should.</p>

            Hi Gene,<br />
<br />
The issue might be due to printer heads got jam. I would suggest you to clean the printer heads and check if that helps.<br />
<br />
If the issue still persists, then I would suggest you to contact HP support.<br />

 keeps setting to £-52 when you are playing the game or during the beginning of the game?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you have selected the Vegas option in Solitaire then the score will be set to default i.e.</span><span>£-52 (this is like you
 pay money to play the game). Once you Start playing the game, the score will decreases from £-52 to minimum and then you my note that the score increases (that is your winnings).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This is the default settings of Vegas mode, if you have selected that Option.</span></span></p>

<p>My last updates were on 7/14/16. If I manually try to check for updates, it does not complete the process.</p>
<p>I also have windows defender which stopped updating on 7/12/16. It tells me to check for updates also, but when I try it manually , it also freezes and does not finish the process.</p>

<p>Thanks Syed, for your response.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I've tried ALL of these suggestions.&nbsp; My system came with Windows 7 and all ports were worked fine for the first few months, then just stopped.&nbsp; Hardware and Devices troubleshooter says there is nothing wrong,
 I downloaded the chipset drivers and any other USB related driver I could find, from the Toshiba Website, I removed and reconnected all the&nbsp;USB controllers (both in regular mode and safe mode)&nbsp;and both Toshiba and Windows are set for auto updates and both
 advise there are no further updates for my my system.&nbsp; In addition, I removed all power sources from the laptap to try a reset, but that didn't work either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use my personal laptop for work and live off my memory sticks.&nbsp; At this point, I'm ready to pound my head on the desk!&nbsp; There seem to be way too many people, on way too many types of systems, all having the same issue for this not to have been figured
 out yet.&nbsp; It's rediculous!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any other ideas?</p>

<p>Hi redtopcane,</p>
<p>Thank you for your post.</p>
<p>It's possible the USB ports on the motherboard are failing.</p>
<p>Do the computer the devices work in use Windows 7 as the operating system?</p>
<p>Does the computer respond with a sound or anything else when you plug the non-working jump drives into the computer?</p>
<p>As this is a new computer, I suggest you contact Toshiba regarding support to see if they are able to test the motherboard or USB ports.</p>

<p>The laptop came with Windows 7 as the operating system.&nbsp; I purchased the Windows 7 Professional upgrade and installed it, before using the laptop.&nbsp; As of today, I have been able to get the zip drives to work again, so I am quite certain it is NOT the motherboard,
 especially since so many people seem to be having the same issue.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm happy that<strong>I</strong> got them to work, however, since I don't know what within Windows is causing the issue, I have the concern that it will happen again.&nbsp; As a consumer using
 Windows I believe it would be greatly beneficial to all if Windows could figure out what causes the issue and how to fix it permenantly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your reponse.</p>

If anyone has by chance installed TeamViewer, it has a "fallback solution" option where you can remotely control whether the remote computer's display is on or off. It Installs a separate monitor driver.
<div>On TeamViewer, go to TeamViewer options &gt; Advanced &gt; Advanced Network Settings &gt; Click "Uninstall Monitor Driver"</div>

<div><b>OTHER DISPLAY DRIVERS</b></div>
<div>If you have installed a display driver that didn't come with your PC, uninstall it and either it should use your default display driver, OR go to your manufacturers website, look for DRIVERS, type your model, etc. and you'll be given a download link to
 the latest, up-to-date, version of it.</div>
<div>This is because some Drivers are incompatible with changing brightness.</div>

<p>Is there a way to turn off voice commands? I've been having issue that while playing on xbox live another player will shout something like "xbox party chat" and my xbox hears it and starts a party chat while I'm playing a game. Hopefully there is a way to
 just turn off the commands all together to stop this from happening.</p>

<p>Okay, so I don't think there is a way to just turn off voice commands but you can turn off the kinect. say "Xbox, go to settings" and go to the kinect settings and you can turn it off. That or you could wear a headset and then other players voices won't
 be going through the tv and you can still have voice commands and hear the other players.</p>

<p>Side not to the above post: You may also want to recalibrate your Kinect because peoples voices on the other end of the TV shouldn't have an effect on your Kinect. Noise reduction is supposed to cancel that out.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Search no longer working.</h2>
                    <p>I just was forced to do the fall creators update and with it my search function in cortana stopped working.&nbsp; I have tried literally every "vouched for fix" I have found listed and search still does not work.&nbsp; When you attempt to search it just displays a
 blank white window with the blue dots running accross the top but it never resolves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows 10 pro version 1703 (OS build 15063.936.)&nbsp; Windows update says I am up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried restarting windows search, cortana, the windows power shell Get-appxPackage, run the troubleshooters, re-indexed my files, created a new admin account, reset and rebooted several times, changed the search engine so cortana uses to Google, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be great.&nbsp; Im hoping this upcoming spring update will fix this.</p>

<br />As the first troubleshooting step, have you tried all fixes here?

<p>Hi Sumit, thank you for the reply.&nbsp; I have actually tried everything listed here along with some other things but I am going to go ahead and try these steps again in case I did something wrong.&nbsp; I have found that windows keeps telling me that all of my updates
 are "up to date" but I have found that several updates are still out there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lack of ability to search is definitely annoying but I can still work around it for now.<br />
</p>
<p>Thank you again and I will let you know what I find out.</p>

<p>Thank you again, These were my results.&nbsp; <br />
1. Check for Updates:&nbsp; Windows says I am up to date, yet my pc is only on 1703 (15063.966) attempting to force an update doesnt work.<br />
2. Restart: I have done this a lot<br />
3. Update drivers: supposedly they are all up to date.<br />
4. Create a local admin account: this did not work for me.<br />
5. Reset your PC..have doen this multiple times too.<br />
<br />
I have also tried the troubleshooters, re-indexing my files, the powershell "repairs" etc...basically almost every "fix" for this I have found online.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cortana/Windows search is still useless for searching for anything on my PC.&nbsp; I'm mainly using windows key combinations to find stuff. Thank you again, but I am starting to think the OS is going to have to be reinstalled and since I don't have time for that,
 Ill just try to work around it and hope a fix is found.</p>

<p>Hi Sumit, I just wanted to let you know that I found a post that went over going through the Cortana notebook, cleared Cortanas cache and I turned off everything I do not need.&nbsp; This seemed to fix the search for some reason.&nbsp; Either the cache had problems
 or I am assuming one of those features may have been corrupt and causing search not to function?&nbsp; Since it is odd, I'm not holding my breath that this fix is permanent, but at the moment I can use the search feature and get results.</p>
<p>

            <p><span>Hi edwardcampbell_839,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft community!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I understand that you have downloaded Windows 8 and cannot access Windows installer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>What do you mean by cannot access windows installer?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let’s perform few methods to resolve the issue:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to upload minidump files to skydrive, as the error message is related minidump.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: Clean Boot.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Perform clean boot to identify if any 3rd party service is causing this issue:</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After performing the troubleshooting steps in clean boot, follow<b> Step 3</b> from the link to start the computer to
<b>Normal start up mode.</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Run a system file checker scan</span></b><span> and check if that helps.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Refer the following steps to run SFC scan:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a) Move the mouse pointer to bottom left of the screen where you see preview of start menu and Right-click to bring up a list of Windows settings.<br />
b) Click on ‘Command Prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated command prompt. Note: Click ‘Yes’ if it prompts for permission.<br />
c) In the command prompt type in the following command: ‘<b>sfc /scannow’</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> It may ask for windows installation DVD to fix and to enable SFC to make more than minor repairs. Some files saved on your computer might get deleted when fixing corrupted files.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3: Update all the possible drivers.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please contact the system manufacturer to update all the possible drivers which is compatible with Windows 8.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 4: Disable the third party antivirus:</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Press “Windows key + C”.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Choose Search, and type in Control panel.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Under System and Security, clicking Review your computer's status.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click the arrow button next to Security to expand the section.</span></p>
<p><span>5. If Windows can detect your antivirus software, it's listed under Virus protection.</span></p>
<p><span>6. If the software is on, check the Help that came with the software for information on disabling it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Important Note:</span></b><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope the information provided was helpful, If you need any assistance please feel free to post. We are here to help you.</span></p>

    <title>Lost calendar data on upgradde to windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grumpybunter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost calendar data on upgradde to windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have recently upgraded from 8.1 to windows 10. Whilst I can access my calendar it will only show historic data for the last 7 days before wiping it off.&nbsp;I had a similar problem with my e mail but updated my settings to mail from any time and resolved it.
 Can't seem to find anyway to do the same with calendar.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The info is all there if I access calendar from another PC via windows live login, but not through my own PC. Has anyone else had this problem and any ideas how to sort it?</p>

            <p>The Windows 10 Calendar is remarkably weak. I say "remarkably" because Calendar is one of the core apps that Microsoft needs to get right if it wants to interest people in Windows phones and Windows tablets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest that you log in to your Microsoft account to get to your calendar, rather than relying on the Calendar app. Calendar is something that will probably get improved with future updates, but for now it's a hit or miss.</p>

            <p>Hi Aswin</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. In answer to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The problem occurred immediately on updating to windows 10, i.e. the first time I went into calendar.</p>
<p>2. The only change I had made prior to this was to update my settings for e mail as that was only showing e mails in the past couple of weeks. I changed the settings to show all e mails received at any time.</p>
<p>3. I did not see any error messages.</p>
<p>4. Not aware of any other apps showing this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will await your reply before trying the two suggested routes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Hard Disk Unusable&#47;Unallocated after Reinstall Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to reinstall Windows 10 and format my C: drive. To do this, I used this&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">guide</a>. All went well,
 I created a bootable USB-stick with the Windows installer on it. Unfortunately, I forgot to disconnect any devices and/or drives before installing. This caused the installer to give a error message when trying to install Windows to C:\. I quit the installer,
 booted back into the USB device and used the command prompt to have diskpart clean and format the disk and tried to install Windows again. This still didn't work when I realized my other disk (formerly named D:\) was still connected. I disconnected D: and
 it did the job, got Windows installed on C: which operates correctly. The other disk (D:) however is now unallocated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first I wanted to save my files from the disk (mainly wallpapers) so I tried recovering software but this took way too long and settled on just cleaning and formatting the disk. First I tried diskpart again, which at first looked as if it worked. But
 when going back into Disk Management (or partition tool) the disk was still <a href="https://imgur.com/a/jcMstXT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
unallocated</a>&nbsp;(D: from here on is the bootable USB-stick). When trying to initialize the disk using MBR (Master Boot Record) it gives&nbsp;<a href="https://imgur.com/sgdNDzh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this error</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried using MiniTool Partition Wizard to scan the disk but this took an absurd long&nbsp;<a href="https://imgur.com/bNJo4Is" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">time</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I doing something terrible wrong or is there just a simple solution to this I'm not seeing? Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<br />
<br />Restart your PC (not shut down)
<br />
<br />Open Disc Management
<br />
<br />Right click that Unallocated space and choose 'New - Simple Volume'
<br />
<br />Accept NTFS as the File System and the default Drive letter when asked to assign a drive letter
<br />
<br />Does that work, if not please let me know . .

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for taking the time helping me out. Unfortunately,&nbsp;<a href="https://imgur.com/5QGxJJm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">DiskPart failed to clear disk attributes.</a>&nbsp;Also, the disk is already 'online' as can be seen on the screenshot. Could this be
 the problem?</p>

            Hi Charles, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

<h2>            Halo 4 missing content.</h2>
                    
<p>Today i tried to play Halo 4, and it said i had missing content. Whenever i try to play campaign, it just says i have missing content. Whenever i try to play multiplayer, it puts me in a lobby and when the game starts, sends me back to the menu. But i did
 download the Crimson Map pack for free, so was the free Crimson map pack something that prevents me from playing? Please answer back.</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>The add on may not be the problem, however I am not too sure. I would like to know if you have a second disk, or a code for another map pack or add on?</p>
<p>If not, you can try deleating the add on and try again,</p>
<p>Please post back the results, </p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>It probably does have something to do with crimson, because they same thing happened to me while I was trying to play matchmaking in war games. I was going to buy it anyway, so I deleted the free crimson and downloaded the ten dollar one. &nbsp;After that things
 seemed fine. Sorry if you're gonna lose crimson :(</p>

<p>The Crimson map pack was only free up unitl &nbsp;the 18th Dec so that is definately the problem. If you wanted to play it after that you needed to purchase it. Just delete it if you don't want to pay the $10 for it and you should be all good again.</p>

<p>Im starting to think that the map pack isn't the problem. I've deleted ALL of my Halo 4 data, bought the full map pack, and it still doesn't work. Could it be my disk? I saw on another post that one of the ambassadors say that sometimes, if the disk is scratched,
 it can't load the downloaded data.</p>

<p>So I'm getting an Xbox One and I want to know if the console supports keyboard and mouse. Also, if it does, will it support a keyboard that uses 2 USB ports?</p>

<p>Since Xbox 360 has USB ports its just a matter of providing drivers for mouse support. i don't understand how Microsoft will loose anything by providing mouse support though it may not be compatible with a lot of games. There are a lot of people with unused
 xbox 360 lying in their homes. They can at the least use it with IE browsing and with some other applications.</p>

<p>Unfortunately MS consider using &nbsp;keyboard &amp; mouse as modding and this will get you banned from Xbox Live if used during online gaming. I found the below site that states keyboard &amp; mouse supported</p>
<p><a href="http://uk.ign.com/wikis/xbox-one/Xbox_One_Hardware_Specs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">uk.ign.com/.../Xbox_One_Hardware_Specs</a></p>
<p>But I guess it can only be used for typing not actual gaming. When I smashed up my wrist last year I asked about this and was told they are not even considering support for the future. Bad times</p>

<h2>            What do you do if the mouse &#38; keyboard do not work but ONLY in Bios&#63; I cannot log in</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do need some urgent help, but please first understand the problem before giving/pasting generic &amp; unhelpful responses like one sometimes gets.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop uses Windows 10, up-to-date, ALL drivers &amp; programs as well was working 100% correctly until yesterday.</p>
<p>I had installed a giveaway version of Kaspersky antivirus I got from some IT magazine, but because it was causing some issue with Firefox, someone in the Kaspersky forums advised updating to the current 2016 version, where that problem is solved.</p>
<p>I discovered after upgrading that the key did not work for that version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried to uninstall &amp; return to the previous version, along the way, there was an error mentioning some driver I did not bother to exactly note down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used iObit unistaller to complete the job.<br />
It however needed a restart before installing. After restart, the mouspad &amp; keyboard were not working. I was forced to use an
<strong>external mouse</strong> + virtual keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The synaptics (mousepad device) in device manager had an exclamation mark. I tried uninstalling/reinstalling device ... same thing!<br />
Even reinstalling the original pointing devices driver runs normally but ends up not helping as the exclamation mark returns.<br />
<br />
The exclamation mark happens not to be because of missing drivers in this case since even Windows said the most recent versions INSTALLED, but Windows failing to all the same load the driver to communicate with the 2 devices.<br />
<br />
<strong>The logical thing was to use one of the restore points. The last 3 all fail because of some Cortana file failing to be loaded, being either deleted or corrupted!!!</strong><br />
<br />
The last thing I need is re-installing Windows as I would lose some programs. <br />
</p>
<p>This morning, tried restore points again to same effect. I connected an external keyboard, ... it also did not work!!!!!! &amp; had the same exclamation mark in the device manager. This has never happened to me before! Such an external keyboard always works.<br />
<br />
In my desperation, I went to <strong>Windows troubleshooting which carried out a number of repairs, but failed to repair the keyboard/moúsepad issue
</strong>as it stated in a report &amp; at least for one of the issues it repaired it needed a restart.<br />
<br />
<strong>After the restart, not even the external mouse was now working, making it impossible to even log in at all, since i cannot even get to the virtual keyboard. ...</strong><br />
</p>
<p>One thing I noted, </p>
<ul>
<li>is if you got to BIOS, the laptop mouse/mousepad &amp; keyboard work. This got me excited thinking all was now OK. Wrong. After booting to desktop, neither mousepad &amp; keyboard, nor the external mouse/keyboard work.</li><li>I tried to boot to recovery DVD ... on that interface, also the mousepad/keyboard work BUT not after</li><li>I tried to carry out via command prompt sfc /scannow &amp; DISM / restore health (dont have commands in my head), both failed</li></ul>
<p>I am trying to avoid re-installing Windows because I do not want to lose some programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had hoped I could carry out an "in-plcae upgrade (? as described here =&gt; http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repair-install-windows-10-place-upgrade.html ) hoping it would repair whatever was wrong, but it seems as stated there, it is only possible
 if you FIRST LOGIN (which I CANNOT) and start the process from within Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway to get into Windows in such circumstances? Please remember external mouse &amp; keyboarss DO NOT WORK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And in any case, how would one solve the problem even IF I GOT IN, because as I said, the drivers which where NOT an issue before .... re-installing them DID NOT HELP?</p>
<p>As said the laptop had ALL software up-to-date before, had no single problem &amp; was brought into this by Kaspersky uninstallation somehow causing damage to:</p>
<ul>
<li>internal mousepad/keyboard &amp; later on AFTEr running troubleshooting &amp; restarting even the external mouse &amp; keyboard are NOT working,. both only work in Bios, though</li><li>restore point files. Some specific CORTANA file was supposedly damaged or missing, as reported in several trials &amp; using 3 or so different restore points as the reason for failure to restore.</li></ul>
<p>I would appreciate some urgent help, but please DO NOT suggest something requiring being logged in
<strong>as the starting point</strong>!! I cannot log in!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upgrade:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found a way to boot in <strong>safe mode, BUT I discovered even then</strong>, the mousepad/keyboard are not usable</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your quick help would very much be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />

</p><p><em>I also see you telling "I tried to boot to recovery DVD ... on that interface, also the mousepad/keyboard work BUT not after". In that case, once you boot into the PC, "</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>That is just a grammatical mistake, because I repeatedly say I cannot no log in &amp; the mousepad/keyboard + external mouse/keyboard d</strong>o not work &amp; there is no way to access ANYTHING inside Windows
<strong>at all</strong>!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should have said, to <strong>START SAFE MODE</strong> ... which requires logging in all the same, some thing I cannot do as I repeatedly say, also that the keyboard/mouse DO NOT WORK at all ...
<strong>except &amp; ONLY in BIOS &amp; that blue interface accessed when you start with the recovery DVD.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to access command prompt is via that blue interface using recovery DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So is there anything that can be done WITHOUT having to log in into Windows (which requires a mouse/keyboard which it is NOT POSSIBLE to use), ....?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>On another note, in the Kaspersky forum, where I had described the problem, someone had said</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"I suspect destroyed upper filter settings for keyboard and mouse; however, I'm not sure. Anyway, the repair would require expert knowledge of the corresponding registry keys and a linux-based registry editor."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Could that be the case?</p>
<p>If that is the case, I would give it a try to avoid installing Windows which was working 100% correctly before &amp; with programs I do not want to lose, however I can only connect the hard drive as an external HDD to a Windows &amp; not Linux PC .... &amp; of course
<strong>if I could be told exactly what to edit</strong> - that can help correct the problem, by allowing me to use the keyboard/mouse again, &amp; if necessary enable Wlan adapter, which I had temporarily disabled, before all this began &amp; is NOT connected to this
 issue. etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I prefer a simpler solution, but if there is no way out, I could try this.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When I tried before serious keyboard/mouse issues started to use one of the many
<strong>restore points</strong> I have created, it consistently failed with the error shown in this screenshot
<a href="http://bit.ly/1QTw0Bv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">bit.ly/1QTw0Bv</a></li><li>That is the same dead end I reach, if I use the recovery DVD &amp; go to the option of restoration points.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Lastly</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I have to re-install Windows ...</p>
<p>I originally upgraded from 8.1 and do not have the key written anywhere. I have read somewhere, if I were to use the USB I created with the media creation tool with Windows 10, I would end up being forced to make a clean install, which is a terrifying prospect
 as it would supposedly require a key apart from loosing programs/files.</p>
<p>If I could somehow get back into Windows I know I can make a clean install from there something i have done several times and that would be OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This admittedly long, but I have tried to provide as much info as possible</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance &amp; kind regards.</p>

    <title>Problems with Internet connection sharing and Bridging - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spartanomega888  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with Internet connection sharing and Bridging</h2>
                    I am having problems trying to activate internet connection sharing on my connection on my laptop to get connection to my Xbox 360 to play Xbox Live.. I use to be able to do it fine, but now I can't.. Whenever I check the box beside "Allow other network&nbsp;users
 to connect through this computer's Internet Connection." It unchecks it right after I checked it.. Then, the bridging will not work either.. It will give an error message "An unexpected error has occurred while configuring the Network Bridge."<br />
<br />
Like I said, it gets very annoying dealing with this problem.. I have a sprint wireless aircard to connect to the internet and connecting with it to my 360 worked in the past.. Thanks or helping if you can.

I would recommend trying to re-install your Sprint broadband card software and then try to re-enable ICS (Internet Connection Sharing).

<p>Shot in the dark, but try setting up the connection in Safe Mode.<br />
<br />
<strong>STEPS TO BOOT INTO SAFE MODE WITH NETWORKING</strong></p>
<p>1. Completely power off your computer<br />
2. Turn your system back on and immediately start pressing the F8 key until you<br />
get to a menu similar in nature to:</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------<br />
Safe Mode<br />
Safe Mode with Networking<br />
Safe Mode with Command Prompt</p>
<p>Last Known Good Configuration</p>
<p>Start Windows Normally<br />
--------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>3. Choose the 'Safe Mode with Networking' option<br />
<br />
Then follow the steps as usual to enable ICS</p>

            Getting a little closer, but the only problem is for some reason, it will not allow my device to work in safe mode, but it did let me Bridge my ethernet(Lan Connection) and Wireless Network Connection together, but I need to bridge the Lan Connection 2
 together with my Lan Connection.. so without my device working in safe mode, it will not display the Lan Connection 2 or the Sprint connection in safe mode.. Ill keep trying stuff, if yah have anymore ideas, let me know

                    <p>Hi ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I configured a CA server in windows server 2008 with rootCA(windows server 2008)--&gt;SubCA1(windows server 2008)---&gt;SubCA2 (windows server 2008)</p>
<p>and configured NDES in SubCA2 and when I send a SCEP request to subCA2 .</p>
<p>It issues me a certificate and CA certificate(public key) and CA certificate only has subCA2 certificate but does not present a certificate chain .</p>
<p>But when I go to issued certificates in SubCA2 it shows the entire certification path till rootCA. Is there a way to send entire certificate chain to SCEP client or is this expected behavior</p>

<p>Hi Papalos,</p>
<p><br />
This may also happen due to insufficient permission set on the system drive I would suggest that you grant full permission on the system drive
<strong>i.e.: c drive</strong> and check</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Right-click the <strong>System drive (C drive)</strong> that you want to take ownership of, and then click
<strong>Properties</strong>. <br />
2.&nbsp;Click the <strong>Security</strong> tab, click <strong>Advanced</strong>, and then click the
<strong>Owner</strong> tab.<br />
3.&nbsp;Click Edit. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
4.&nbsp;Click the name of the person you want to give <strong>ownership</strong> to.<br />
5.&nbsp;If you want that person to be the owner of files and subfolders in this folder, select the
<strong>Replace owner on subcontainers and objects</strong> check box.<br />
6.&nbsp;Click <strong>OK</strong>.</p>
<p>If the above step fails then I would suggest that you format the external drive completely and check if the backup works.<br />
<strong>Note</strong>: Make sure you take a backup of the drive before formatting it.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Hope this helps!<br />
