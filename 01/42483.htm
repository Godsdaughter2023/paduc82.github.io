<h2>            Infinity foot pedal - Windows 10 usb recognized intermittently</h2>
                    <p>I have an Infinity USB foot pedal.&nbsp; My computer running Windows 10 is only recognizing it intermittently, so it works some times and others not.&nbsp; I have plugged in and replugged and when not working does not show anything being plugged in or removed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there an update or download so that Windows 10 will recognize the Infinity pedal?</p>

            <p>I agree with what you said about the in-game cutscenes being choppy sometimes. I had the same exact experience playing on my Xbox One S. Interestingly, I only started playing the game on Novemebr 4, which was a few days after the X1X 4K patch. I think they released a patch for the game for both the Xone One S and X1X, which introduced the choppiness into the in-game cutscenes.</p><p><br /></p><p>Any YouTube videos of the game running on Xbone One (which are all from 2016), don't show the choppiness. I'm hoping Microsoft patches all versions of the game to fix this.</p>

<h2>            Problems with storage on Xbox one</h2>
                    
<p>i am having some problems with the x1 storage and was hoping there is a fix either now or coming in the future</p>
<p>1 - how can you delete a file if it is ready to install but for some unknown reason won't install so it can be uninstalled?</p>
<p>2 - when moving games and game dlc to an external hard drive is some times only copies it even though move was picked and is taking up space on both the internal and external hard drive and it will not allow to delete the copy.</p>
<p>3 - when you delete/uninstall a game why can i no longer see the dlc that is downloaded/installed on the hard drive?</p>
<p>4 - when i try to uninstall a dlc it will let me pick to uninstall it but it will not be removed?</p>
<p>5 - when i try to move dlc items from the internal to the external hard drive it stops the move saying install stopped and will not allow me to move it or even delete it to re try and download it?</p>

<p>Exact same thing happened to me. My workaround was to delete the "copies" on the external hard drive, which deletes them both. After, you download the DLC straight to the external.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I did that the second time it happened, so I have no idea how to fix my first encounter with the bug.</p>

<p>i actually can not delete the stuff of either hard drive because it said it moved it but reall did not and now i can not remove/uninstall it off the internal?</p>
<p>i also have a dlc from ryse that will not install so i can not uninstall it to remove it so it is taking up space on my hard drive and can not even be used because it will not install</p>

<p>I had the same problem after installing my external drive; it would save new items but I couldn't move anything in either direction. What worked for me was after installing it and having no luck moving files, I shut the XB1 down AND unplugged it for about
 10 seconds. Remember, it is never really OFF. When I plugged it back in and restarted it, the system must have properly recognized the external drive better because I was then able to move items back and forth.</p>

<p>I was about to lose it when I just kept unplugging the drive, then hard resetting my system (holding power for 10 seconds). &nbsp;I eventually got it to work like this. &nbsp;</p>
<p>First I unplugged the drive and did a hard reset.</p>
<p>I booted the xbox one back on with the drive disconnected.</p>
<p>I plugged the drive in, it was not recognized (this is a good thing, you're not supposed to be able to plug in a drive while it's on)</p>
<p>I turned it off to standby mode (not a hard reset)</p>
<p>I left the external drive plugged in and turned it back on.</p>
<p>It was recognized and I could sort by drives when viewing games.</p>
<p>I think it was the hard reset and reinit with the drive unplugged that made it so it would let me sort by 2 drives again. &nbsp;No idea why this bug isn't fixed yet, it's not hard to get.</p>

<h2>            MSN News App not working properly</h2>
                    <p>The horizontal scroll/swipe on the home screen of my MSN News app has suddenly stopped working. Works fine in every other screen of the app and other MSN apps, and the News app on another laptop.<br />
<br />
I've reinstalled it and while this fixes the problem initially, the issue returns when I next open it.<br />
<br />
It appears as though the app isn't loading the separate hub sections beyond the main headline and big image. Tellingly, the "GET STARTED" section that you usually glimpse to the right doesn't load (but the Search button does). There's no horizontal scrollbar
 at the bottom as there should be when you move the mouse. Using the arrow keys doesn't work either.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Anyone got any ideas on how to fix this? </p>
<p>

<h2>            unable to install OS as disk is write protected due to disk errors and bad sectors</h2>
                    Hello good people! I hope you are having fantastic holidays and I am sorry to bother you but I would like to take a few minutes of your time with a little of my PC&nbsp; problems.
<br />
<br />
My laptop's hard drive (Acer E-machine D525 2009 Model) has developed disk errors and bad sectors that started to affect its performance when I installed Windows 8 Consumer Preview. The machine would just freeze, after a few minutes and present a blue screen
 with the message "windows encountered a problem and needs to restart". It would do so frequently until I decided to install the final version of Windows 8 Pro thinking this would be a solution but the problem persisted. Last week I run the disk errors diagnosis
 and repair which lasted 6 hours and the situation improved for just a few days. I tried to reinstall the same OS again when the freezing recurred but it failed at 86% and now the 3 partitions it had before are not being recognised by any live CD (I have used
 Puppy Linux and Ubuntu 2.3). That means I cannot install any OS leave alone accessing the HDD.
<br />
<br />
When I use the command prompt to check for available disks using the command "list disk" the whole HDD appears as disk number: 0, status: online, size: 149 GB, free: 149 GB, Dyn: blank space, Gpt: blank space. When I check its properties using the command "detail
 disk", all details are alright except the location path that is detailed as "unavailable". The current read only state is detailed as "no". What I find strange is the fact that when I run the check disk command (chkdsk), it recognizes the file system as NTFS
 while adding "might report errors when no corruption is present, Volume lable is boot, WARNING! F parameter not specified, Running CHKDSK in read-only mode, Read-only CHKDSK found bad on-disk uppercase table - using system table". It goes on to verify files
 (stage 1 of 3), indexes (stage 2 of 3), and security descriptors (stage 3 of 3). The report filed is "Errors detected in the uppercase file". with the recommendation "Windows has checked the file system and found problems.Run chkdsk with the /F (fix) option
 to correct these". But when I do that I encounter the message "The type of the file system is NTFS. Cannot lock current drive. Windows cannot run disk checking on this volume because it is write protected.<br />
<br />
I would be very appreciative if someone could give his/her honest opinion and tips that would turn around my situation and wishes a prosperous year ahead as well as success good health, and pleasure in all your intentions to you and your families.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do want to save anything on the drive, or just be able to Install an OS?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure how your problem developed, but I would think that you could delete and reformat the disk with a 3rd party Partitioning program. There are free ones available that will work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They normally ignore any type of write protection, or being locked.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the three partitions on your HDD is probably the Recovery Partition to restore your machine to "AS NEW'...hopefully you burned some disks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It simply may be that your drive is in fact failing, and needs replaced, but it is also possible that somehow it has become corrupted, and simply needs reformatted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sometimes running multiple OS's and stuff can lead to that.</p>

            Hi Slance310, and thanks for taking your time to give me some tips. If possible, I want to save the data in the disk first but the problem is that the three partitions are not visible at that stage where one chooses to install an OS yet the disk appears
 as "online" when I check it using the Diskpart feature of the command prompt. This problem is also making it impossible to either format or copy data in the other two partitions as you are suggesting (I've tried using Puppy Linux). Strangely, the disk's active
 status indicator blinks normally when the laptop is powered on. This is the mystery I hope to solve and then if lucky recover data in the disk before anything else.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is it possible that the partitions have somehow become HIDDEN?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only other thing I can think of to save data, would be to look for a program that can recover deleted files, partitions, and etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I on one occasion borrowed a friends DiskInternals Uneraser to recover files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As long as the files haven't been written over, they should be recoverable...I only lost like 2 small files out of 250GB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There may even be free programs available to do this, as well as recover entire partitions.</p>

 in my ask post). The issue at hand now is how to make it unhidden. Thanks!

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You might try this...Easeus Partition Manager , or one of their other programs, I think there are free versions, or at least have a free trial.&nbsp; Just make a bootable disk. You should be able to UNHIDE, make ACTIVE, NOT ACTIVE, and multiple other tools with
 this (or other free) programs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Providing of course that it can "see" the drive...which it should be able to do unless it is totally dead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wouldn't think that your laptop would have more than one HDD, or I would advise you to unhook it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The article you linked to is not 100% accurate...Windows doesn't create this partition unless there is a spare partition or HDD on the machine. In other words, if you have only One drive, and you format it to a single partition before or during install...the
 mentioned partition is not created.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On most ocassions, you can actually delete this partition, do a Boot Repair, and be on your way.</p>
<p>On my machines, I normally HIDE all of the extra partitions so they don't waste space in COMPUTER with unuseable stuff.</p>

<h2>            Unable to login due to &#34;incorrect password&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I am unable to login to Windows on my Dell PC. It says I am entering the incorrect password, although I know it has not changed since I started using the computer. I do not have a Microsoft account setup (so I am trying to login locally) nor did I create
 a password reset disk. There is also only one account so it is also the administrator account.</p>
<p>I have tried logging in through safe mode and Automatic Repair through Troubleshoot (sometimes after entering the password, it said welcome and seemed like it was logging in but then gave me Incorrect Password).</p>
<p>I am almost certain that this started after an update- I did not log off/ shut down my computer the night before and when I tried to use it in the morning it asked me to login (I'm guessing it restarted after an update).</p>

</p><p>Unlike the "Microsoft" poster above, I have read your question.&nbsp; I also understand it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am afraid that the only suggestion we are allowed to make in this forum for your situation is to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After you reinstall, create an additional [i.e. spare] password-protected Admin user account and write its password down somewhere that is secure from loss.&nbsp;
</p>
<ul>
<li>If you ever get this problem again then you can use this account to get into the computer.&nbsp;
</li><li>The spare account will be reliable - it is highly unlikely to experience problems because it is generally the accounts that are logged in to that suffer from afflictions such as your current one.</li></ul>

                    Whatever update to Windows 10 that was pushed down around Nov. 26 has made my Pluggable USB 3.0 docking station not work properly. I have a Lenovo X1 Carbon hooked to external speakers and monitor through the dock station. The monitor works, but the external
 speakers and the Ethernet connection no longer work through the USB 3.0 cable.&nbsp; I have tried to re-install the driver, but no luck.&nbsp; Not having Ethernet really sucks.&nbsp; External speakers is an annoyance. Anyone suggest a fix?

<h2>            Webcam issues after the windows update.</h2>
                    <p>Hi ,</p>
<p>Currently I am using windows 10 1809 version and i noticed that my web cam is not working after the update. I have searched for options and workarounds all over the internet and could not find a fix for this issue. I understand that this is a bug in the
 recent update how can i fix this issue? This is really irritating for us.&nbsp; Please suggest us options to fix this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note : I have tried all the possible options available in the internet. Like driver reset, EnableFrameServerMode etc. Please let us know when can we expect a fix from the Microsoft for this issue?</p>

            Hi VishnuPV1
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />There are two actions which you can undertake. You can try them one by one and check after each.
<br />
<br />1. Restore from a system restore point to a point when things were working fine
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. If the issue has been caused due to recent Windows update - I would suggest that you uninstall the latest KB update  and hide it so that it doesn't install it automatically and wait for new update to come which will be installed automatically.
<br />
<br />To know which update got installed
<br />Windows Key+i to invoke Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Click View installed update history.  These KBs should be from the below list. Don't uninstall any other KB
<br />For 1809 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619</a>
<br />Make note of KB and uninstall and block it.
<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; Type: appwiz.cpl &gt; Enter &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Select the required updates, right click, uninstall.
<br />Block
<br />Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update
<br />Download the tool from below link
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions
<br />
<br />--------------------------------
<br />You should report this to Microsoft so that Microsoft developers should look into this to consider this for a fix.
<br />
<br />Windows Key+F
<br />Submit your feedback

            Hi  VishnuPV1
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Camera 
<br />Toggle on Allow apps to access your Camera
<br />
<br />Scroll down and make sure Skype is toggled on
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />
<br />Click Machine name at the top
<br />
<br />Click the Action menu then scan for hardware changes then check if it shows up in the device tree.
<br />
<br />Also, click the View menu
<br />Click Show hidden devices
<br />
<br />Expand Cameras
<br />Right click the camera, then click Uninstall
<br />
<br />Note: If you don't see it under cameras, look under Imaging devices. 
<br />
<br />Exit device manager then restart.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 should redetect it then reinstall it.
<br />
<br />Check if the camera is working again.
<br />
<br />If you have a third party Antivirus utility installed, please remove it.
<br />Also check the manufacturers website for updated driver.
<br />
<br />I would also try upgrading to the newer Windows 10 1903 to see if it works. 
<br />
<br />Download the Media Creation Tool Now
<br /><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the MediaCreationTool.exe file then click Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement:
<br />
<br />Select the option Upgrade this PC now if you want to upgrade right away,
<br />
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. If you don’t, review the following article for instructions how to upgrade to Windows 10 Anniversary Update on a system with limited space:
<br />
<br />Please note, you have the option of choosing what you would like to keep, which includes personal files, apps and settings.
<br />
<br />If you want to perform a new install or just keep your files click Change what to keep. Once you have chosen the desired options, click Install to begin.
<br />
<br />This will be your screen for a little while. During the installation, your computer will restart several times.
<br />
<br />After the first restart, Windows 10 setup will resume. You will notice the setup experience has once again been refined from the previous animated circle. This will be your screen for a while. When complete, Windows 10 setup will restart automatically.
<br />
<br />Sign into your account.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 completes application updates and post setup tasks.
<br />
<br />That’s it, the Windows 10 Feature Update is installed.You can check Windows Update for latest updates, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates.
<br />
<br />How to prepare your computer before upgrading?
<br />
<br />Although updating to Windows 10 version 1903 is a relatively simple process, similar to a repair upgrade; users should perform some basic pre-requisites before initiating the upgrade.
<br />
<br />If you are finding it difficult to carry out some of the steps described below, please review detailed instructions how to perform them:

<p>Skype Status shows that everything is working, but I still can't sign in to my account. I changed my password, posted a message to Skype Communities which has since disappeared and tried to post again to the community, only to find the "Reply" button blocked.
 I don't know what more to do, but since others are having this problem ("Skype is not available. . ."), I can only assume that the problem is not with my computer. I am running Skype version 7.56. I thought that I had updated the version to the latest one
 (though I wasn't asked to do so), but maybe not? Thank you for any help you can give on allowing me to sign in to Skype again. And could you please tell me how I can get access to post a message again? All this has happened very suddenly and without apparent
 cause. <br />

            Hi  mabell93
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Please keep in mind, QuickBooks versions 2016 and earlier are not certified compatible with Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />So, you are likely seeing those errors due to compatibility issues running on Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />You could try launching the application using compatibility mode to see if it resolves the issue.

<br />
<br />Otherwise, your best option is to upgrade to QuickBooks 2019 for optimum compatibility.

<h2>            Dell Inspiron 11 3147 touch screen and USB power not working after recent WIN8.1 update</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>So i have this Dell Inspiron 11 3147 2in1 laptop. After recent update of WIN8.1</p>
<p>- touch screen is not working</p>
<p>- USB 2.0 is not sending power to some devices (thus devices are not recognized by the system)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - wireless mouse is not working</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - audio interface is not powered</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - pen drive is not powered (LED is off)</p>
<p>- some of the devices conected to USB2.0 are recieiving power</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - external hard drive 2,5 (with USB3.0) - one can hear it spins but LED does not blink - of course its not recognized by system</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Nokia Lumia 520 - computer actually charges this phone but its not recognized by the system</p>
<p>- USB3.0 devices</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - same external hard drive (2,5 with USB3.0) is spining, LED is blinking but its not recognized by the system</p>
<p>All of those devices work perfectly on other machine.</p>
<p>Driveres are up to date.</p>
<p>Dell software is up to date.</p>
<p>Physical damage to computer itself is unlike.</p>
<p>I think that new win update has tampered with power management / distribution settings.</p>
<p>Please HELP!!!!!!</p>
<p>Oh. And touch pad wasnt responding for about minute or two after computer came out of hibernation. But that was singular event that happened just today.</p>

            <p>thank you Andre de Costa for your reply</p>
<p>you are not going to believe what happened.</p>
<p>i went to see my IT friend last evening. I described him all the symptoms my computer has after last update. To rule out every option he went to Device Manager --&gt; Universal Serial Bus Controllers and checked every device. Just for no reason, because who
 would have thought that last update switched off one of the devices. Everything went back to normal after device has been switched on again.</p>
<p>I dont know what happened but i know i didnt switch it off so it must have been that update.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Skype app malfunction - unable to reinstall</h2>
                    <p>I've been using Skype for windows 10. Sometime last week, my laptop ran out of battery while Skype was updating and since then the app malfunctions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It won't start and everytime I had to go online through my browser to start it. I looked into Skype support and saw that completely uninstalling and reinstalling Skype could fix this. I completely uninstalled but still can't find an option to reinstall as
 the website says that Windows 10 is already pre-installed with Skype, which can be launched through the Apps tab. But I'd like to have an app on Quicklaunch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone help me on this - to basically reinstall Skype app on my laptop?</p>

            Hi there,
<br />
<br />You can download a Desktop version of Skype, which can be found here by selecting your OS and getting the install file:-
<br /><a href="https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/</a>
<br />
<br />However, if you would like to have the App version I can try and help you with this as well. To make sure you have uninstalled the App version of Skype:-
<br />1) Right click the Windows Start Button
<br />2) Select Apps and Features 
<br />3) Scroll down to Skype and Uninstall. If you have both the desktop version and app version, you will notice that Skype App is the lighter coloured one.
<br /><a href="https://gyazo.com/90a4d496ebdb5aa02bd9b779f10110e0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://gyazo.com/90a4d496ebdb5aa02bd9b779f10110e0</a>
<br />(The one on top)
<br />
<br />To reinstall:-
<br />1) Search for 'Microsoft Store' in the search bar by the Windows Start Button and select it
<br />2) Select the Search Button on the top right of the Store and search for 'Skype'
<br />3) Many apps should come up as the search result, with Skype being one of them. Simply install the App and select 'Pin to Start'
<br />
<br />I hope this helps!

            Hello SWETHAKUMAR<br /><br />I am a fellow Community member here to help. I am very sorry to hear that you are experiencing this difficulty. I know that it is extremely frustrating to say the least.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the new version of Skype is still under development and as such is lacking many of the features and functions of classic Skype and contains many bugs.<br /><br />While there is not yet an ETA, it is expected in the very near future that Microsoft will begin rapidly releasing updates for the new Skype in order to add features and functionality and correct known bugs.<br /><br />In the meantime, Microsoft has listened to user feedback and has decided to continue supporting classic Skype into the foreseeable future. If you are interested in returning to classic Skype for the time being it can be gotten here<br /><br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a><br /><br /><br />if you should choose

            <p>Have you tried the obvious:&nbsp; turn it on (every laptop of which I'm aware is able to enable/disable its wireless adapters (including wifi and Bluetooth).&nbsp; Sometimes this is a physical switch on the side of the laptop and sometime it's one of the F keys, either
 alone or in combination with the Fn key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the Inspiron 1545, pressing the F2 key toggles the wifi radio on and off.&nbsp; If this doesn't work, try pressing the Fn key together with F2 (default is just the F2 key, but this behavior can be changed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>As near as I can determine, the Inspiron 1545 does not have an indicator light that shows whether the radio is on or off.</p>

            Those things don't work at all. I have tried them 1001 times with different combination or hard keys and soft features. I think there's something wrong with the driver. I'm still waiting for the Gerry's response!

<h2>            How to transfer my genuine Windows 10 from my old computer to my new one&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Good morning,</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to transfer my genuine Windows 10 from my old computer to my new one?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My old computer is very...old. But with my genuine Win 10 (upgraded from my genuine Win 7).</p>
<p>My intention is not to use my old computer, practically will destroy it and throw as garbage as it is about 10 years old and there is no point to save anything - processor, video card, motherboard, etc...</p>
<p>And there is coming the question, after buying the new computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot in advance.</p>

<p>It depends on how Windows 10 was originally configured on your computer.<br />
<br />
If its a full retail store bought license online or offline, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.<br />
<br />
If its the free upgrade from a retail store bought Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is transferable to a new computer or motherboard.<br />
<br />
If its the free upgrade from a OEM preinstalled Windows 7 or Windows 8 license, it is NOT transferable to a new computer or motherboard.<br />

<p><span>Hi mizfit,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Windows Vista Community site. Have a couple of questions for you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A) When did this error message pop up first? Have you made any software changes or have you installed any software / operating system
 updates?</span></p>
<p><span>B) Does this error message pop up when you open any .pdf files or any zip files or only particular file?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It's hard to track down exactly what may be happening but the typical reason for this message is that your email client/service is using
 encoding to make the file transfer faster. When the service decodes it on your end, it doesn't recognize it as a PDF and corrupts the file.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>I would suggest you to try out these options:
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>1) Right click on the file and extract the file on to the desktop and open it, to ensure some setting in your email application is a
 cause.</span></p>
<p><span>2) Try opening the file in another computer, to check if the file is not corrupt.</span></p>
<p><span>3) Ask the sender to resend the file without zipping it.
<br />
</span><span>4) If this doesn’t help the error message could be due to corrupt/ missing adobe files. I would suggest you to uninstall the reader and reinstall it.
</span></p>

<p><span>Let me know if that does or does not work. Good luck!</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this is helpful.</span></p>

<h3> hcokercape  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update bricked my Asus</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 update bricked my Asus. I was operating Windows 10 with no problems, I run my business on it. It force me to do an update and now I can't use the computer. So Microsoft are you sending me a new computer and recovering all my work that's in the
 existing computer? I have never wanted to buy an apple, but if future systems require an update that screw up my computer and ruin my business what choice do I have?</p>
<p>This Asus has been beautiful until the forced update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;it came with Windows 10 on it to start with and although there was a learning curve, I got used to it.</p>

            We need more details to get it fixed. The most common issue has the following symptom:
<br />You get a Advanced Recovery option screen and when you select Windows 10 on Volume X you get desktop is unavailable. Is this the case?

<p>Yes that is the case, volume X.</p>
<p>I have been on chat with Microsoft technicians and they are having me download Windows 10 ISO.</p>
<p>I have not been able to load it yet, because I don't have a USB stick. I am trying to do it to a micro disk that has more than 8 gigs of memory on it.
</p>
<p>I have the instructions from the chat technician who assures me that it will be great. The download has taken more than 45 minutes, presumably because of internet speed in the age of the computer on downloading it with.
</p>
<p>I will post here again with the results of the efforts.</p>

<p>So I downloaded it and got back into the chat with the Microsoft people, now they're telling me I have to wait 72 hours because there's a bug in the update that has to be fixed and many people have the same problem.</p>

<p>Microsoft service technicians level 2 could not solve the problem. Told me to wait a week or go to a Microsoft Office location and they would try and see what they could do to recover the data. The other alternative was to find a local technician and pay
 them to recover the data, or of course Microsoft will not take on any of the cost. In my case I am having a friend with a technical company work on it to the tune of $ 300.</p>
<p>Keep in mind this was not an update that I requested, authorized or approved. This was a Microsoft invasion.</p>

<p>Absolutely same situation here! I feel deeply disappointed. The only difference is that here - after endless number of restarts and attempts I finally managed to restore my system to a system image I kept on WD backup device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides, it happened last night????!! Days after multiple users reported same here for the same update, and Microsoft agents confirmed under numerous posts here they were working on it. This didnt obviously stop them into pushing same killing update into
 my PC last evening.</p>

            I tried Microsoft online help five times. I took screenshots of the last chat. I was able to get to level 2 on the phone. But they were useless, in one sense because all they ended up telling me was drive an hour and 15 minutes to Boston to a Microsoft
 professional location and they would work on my computer to try to recover it. I ended up paying a local technician $300 to recover my data, and reset my computer. The first thing I've done is create a restore point. That was one of the problems with the crash,
 Windows 10 did not automatically create any restore points. Now I'm doing them every few days. Once a week I will also backup all my data. And this will not happen again. Part of this is my mistake by not having the data backed up and not having a restore
 point. However, I should not have had to pay $300 to recover from an update that I did not authorize, accept, or choose.

            Same problem last couple of months my sons pc an asus kept getting stuck in a start up loop after windows updates on 2 occasions this week on the 19/07/2018 after an update it got stuck on a black screen saying unauthorized changes have been made change
 boot option... Changing boot options did nothing trying to load different OS did not work either.. (same problem that affected windows 7 asus computers).... So stuck with a useless computer that will not boot. If i by a new motherboard that is not the same
 windows 10 will detect a hardware change and want me to purchase windows again... Microsoft you really need to sort this crap out you are deliberately miss leading people if windows can detect a hardware change than it should be able to detect a asus motherboard
 and not install an update that will brick the machine or are you purposely doing this to force more sales..... NOT HAPPY&nbsp; &nbsp;

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>You've discovered a long-standing problem with Windows 7. To fix this, I recommend a program called FileMenu Tools. You can download the freeware portable version from&nbsp;here:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/PORTABLE-SOFTWARE/System/System-Enhancements/FileMenu-Tools-Portable.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">
 http://www.softpedia.com/get/PORTABLE-SOFTWARE/System/System-Enhancements/FileMenu-Tools-Portable.shtml</font></a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After downloading and installing the program you'll notice that by&nbsp;default every option is checked. I'd be a lot more selective about it, otherwise your right-click menu will be a full page long! When the main window opens you'll see a list on the right-hand
 side&nbsp;of all the items that can be added to the right-click menu. Start weeding through the list and take out all the one's you
<em>don't</em> need by <em><strong>un</strong></em>checking the box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you're done making your choices (de-selections) make sure you click the green checkmark in the row of icons in the top left-hand window&nbsp;of the interface to "Apply" your choices. The program can do much more, but that answers your specific question.
 I'm told the program has a good help file, so try there if you're interested.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know how you fare.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>

<h2>            missing a win.ini file</h2>
                    I too was trying to reinstall HP software and one of the suggestions was to search for the win.ini file to make sure it was not in read only.&nbsp; When I search for the win.ini file it only shows a backup file as a pss file.&nbsp; No win.ini file.&nbsp; How do I restore
 the win.ini file.&nbsp; The HP diagnostic tools keeps telling me every time I reinstall the software after deleting it that I have a registry problem and the software did not completely install.&nbsp; I am clearly missing a win.ini file in windows.&nbsp; I have tried to
 undo registry changes, and I did have some issues with a prior windows service pack install that required a lot of messing around in safe mode.&nbsp; Can't begin to describe what all the microsoft technician had me do, but there was also a lot of work in safe mode.&nbsp;
 I only have a dell installation disk for my operating system. I have a dell computer with oem windows windows xp media center edition 2005.&nbsp; I am afraid to do a system resore as I c

<p>Hi 1959eab,</p>
<p>The win.ini file in XP is only used for&nbsp;compatibility&nbsp;with older Windows 98 programs and therefore is not critical to the running of Windows XP or installation of newer drivers/applications. You may be trying to install some older HP software, please can
 you let me know what it is you are trying to install?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Freezing every 24-48 hours - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> eugenestroo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Freezing every 24-48 hours</h2>
                    <p>Have read every thing I can find on the internet about Windows 10 freezing. Have done most of the reasonable fixes to try and stop this from happening short of a total reinstall of Windows 10 AND all my other software.</p>
<p>Any help is appreciated.</p>

            Have you installed KB3176938? &nbsp;This fixed the freezing issues for me on my two systems.

            <p>Update: All KBs installed. Freezing has been reduced to about once per week now. Still not acceptable.</p>
<p>Any other suggestions?</p>

            <p>I eventually relocated my User folders back to the C: drive. Started to get freezes again. &nbsp;The issue seems to have been with SSD drives, with User data folders relocated to another drive. &nbsp;I did not move the actual data since it would occupy to much space
 on the SSD. I just created shortcuts to the Data folder on the other drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had no freezes since. &nbsp;I too hope that this will be fixed.</p>
