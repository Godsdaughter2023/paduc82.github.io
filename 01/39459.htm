<h2>            How to prevent the mouse cursor from moving up&#47;down when scrolling on touchpad</h2>
                    <p>Before Windows 10, when I swipe up/down on touchpad, the mouse cursor stays at one location. However, it now becomes a little dot and also moves up and down while I'm swiping on touchpad. I don't like this feature for three reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's not a universal behavior in that it only takes place in UWP applications but not in traditional Windows applications</li><li>When there are both UWP and traditional applications, and if the mouse cursor (the little dot) moves to the boundary of the two kinds of applications, it's shape becomes inconsistent and variant (I doubt there might be a bug or glitch)</li><li>It's often very hard to find the mouse cursor on screen once it becomes a little dot -- it disappears, and when one moves the mouse, it just jumps out from nowhere. It's kind of beyond expectations and annoying for one who only wishes to work on computers.</li></ul>
<p>So is there any settings that disable this features? I've found in the mouse and touchpad section with no luck. Thanks!</p>

<p>That doesn't sound like any feature I'm aware of, I think this might be more of an "issue" than just a feature that's turned on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to be clear, this is what happens when you scroll with two fingers at once?&nbsp; You're certainly right that the pointer itself should stay still on the screen as you scroll that way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My first thought is that the touchpad driver is missing and it's just using the default mouse driver, but honestly even that shouldn't cause the pointer arrow to turn into a dot when you scroll. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for your reply. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes. There are a number of different cases. Take UWP application "Microsoft News" and traditional windows application Chrome browser as an example:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>If "Microsoft News" is of the focus, and if the mouse cursor is within "Microsoft News", when I scroll down using two fingers on touchpad, the mouse cursor first disappears and reappears to the bottom of the original position as a small dot, which also
 moves down on screen. After I stop scrolling, the small dot disappears, and the mouse cursor does not reappear, until I move the mouse on touchpad with a single finger.</li><li>If "Microsoft News" is of the focus, but if the mouse cursor is within "Chrome" browser, when I scroll down using two fingers, "Chrome" browser becomes the focus (which should not have happened), and the mouse cursor completely disappears. It won't reappear
 immediately after I stop scrolling and move the mouse with a single finger, but reappear in one or two seconds from the neighborhood of where I would expect it to be. So in this case: 1. I won't expect "Chrome" becomes the focus but it will; and 2. I cannot
 predict precisely where the mouse cursor will reappear on the screen.</li><li>If "Chrome" is of the focus, but if the mouse cursor is within "Microsoft News", the "Microsoft News" becomes the focus, which shouldn't have happened either. Then the mouse cursor becomes a small dot, which is the same as the first case.</li><li>If "Chrome" is of the focus, and if the mouse cursor is within "Chrome" window, nothing suspicious happens.</li><li>For the above four cases, if I scroll using a physical mouse rather than a touchpad, nothing suspicious happens.</li></ul>
<p>This issue takes place every time when a UWP application and a traditional window application are both visible on screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>When two UWP applications are both visible, if one scrolls (not tested with a mouse yet, only on touchpad) over the app not in focus, it becomes the focus, which shouldn't have happened.</li><li>When two traditional windows applications are both visible, if one scrolls (not tested with a mouse yet, only on touchpad) over the application not in focus, the scrolling speed becomes
<strong>very fast</strong>, even if the speed has been set to slow in the touchpad setting panel.</li></ul>
<p>Probably there's no way but waiting for update. But if there's anything I can do to fix them, it would be of great help. Thanks again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I'm using Samsung laptop preinstalled with Windows 10 Home edition. I never turn off Windows update.</p>

<p>Yeah that's a whole lot of things that should not happen.&nbsp; Although one small thing might be a misunderstanding:&nbsp; you no longer have to set focus to a program to scroll the contents of it.&nbsp; Just having your pointer "over" it will let you scroll the contents
 of that window all while never actually switching the active program to that window.&nbsp; At least, on a fresh vanilla system that's how it should be.&nbsp; That is indeed a change from the historical way Windows works, but Microsoft blogged about it several years
 ago when they introduced that feature in 2015.&nbsp; Apparently it was a common customer request (in practice I don't much care either way, although it does sometimes "get me" when I think a window has focus but then my keystrokes go to another window that was
 actually in focus, and considering the contract and title bars don't make it so visually distinct anymore it's all the more aggravating... but I digress).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The cursor turning to a dot, or moving at all during a scroll operation, is super weird.&nbsp; Never seen that before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The cursor pointer should disappear when input modality changes from mouse to touch, and it sounds like the system is perhaps interpreting your touchpad input as a touch screen input.&nbsp; And my best guess there is the mouse driver is emulating it, but who
 knows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this were my machine, I'd perhaps try SFC, as well as removing all mouse/touchpad drivers from device manager and installing them fresh from the OEM.</p>

<p>==================================<br />
Maybe the following free software would<br />
be worth a try.<br />
<br />
FWIW...you can add the date/time stamp to <br />
one or a batch of photos using the freeware<br />
FastStone Image Viewer.<br />
<br />
FastStone Image Viewer<br />
<a href="http://www.faststone.org/FSViewerDetail.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.faststone.org/FSViewerDetail.htm</a></p>
<p>I suggest that you create a new folder and add<br />
copies of your photos for experimental purposes.<br />
If you are unhappy with the result your originals<br />
will be untouched.<br />
<br />
"Basic steps to add dates to image files<br />
using Fast Stone Image Viewer"..<br />
(FWIW...this is easier to do than it is to explain)<br />
<br />
(You'll have to experiment with position, font<br />
size, color and the various Variables to achieve<br />
the result you desire.)<br />
<br />
Tools / Open Batch Convert / Batch Convert tab...<br />
<br />
Check the box...Use advanced options...<br />
<br />
Advanced Options button / Text tab /<br />
Check the box...Add Text...<br />
(If the white field has any text in it...<br />
clear it by selecting and press&nbsp;your Delete key...<br />
<br />
Open the drop window..."Insert a Variable"<br />
choose...EXIF DateTime / Date and Time...OK...<br />
<br />
Browse to the files you wish to append...select<br />
them and left click the Add button...<br />
<br />
Choose an Output Format...<br />
<br />
Choose an Output folder...<br />
<br />
Check the 'Rename' box...<br />
<br />
Click the Convert button...<br />
<br />
When the files are converted..click Done...<br />
<br />
Now browse to your save folder and see the result...</p>

Enter the following command then hit Enter <br />
<br />
Get-AppxPackage -allusers Microsoft.SkypeApp | Remove-AppxPackage <br />

install the 8.30 version which Microsoft is replacing Skype 12 with on Windows 10:

<br />
<a href="https://endpoint920510.azureedge.net/s4l/s4l/download/win/Skype-8.30.0.50.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://endpoint920510.azureedge.net/s4l/s4l/do...</a>
<br />
<br />
If that does not work... <br />
<br />
<del>I recommend you go back to the classic version, since a lot of the functionality in Skype 8 is still maturing.
</del><br />
<br />
<del>Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
</del><br />
<br />
<del>The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report,then reinstall the classic version.
</del><br />
<br />
<del>Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype. </del><br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<del>Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure
 features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched.
</del><br />
<br />
<del>As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on.
</del><br />
<br />
<del>Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

            I recommend you go back to the classic version, since a lot of the functionality in Skype 8 is still maturing.
<br />
<br />Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report,then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a>

<br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-can-i-send-my-usability-feedback-to-skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA12333/how-ca...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

    <title>News App, Weather App, Maps App and Cortana - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matthew.woods  say:</h3>
<h2>            News App, Weather App, Maps App and Cortana</h2>
                    <p>I've been using the news app, weather app, map app and Cortana for a month or so.&nbsp; They are all very promising technologies but seem to be in the beta phase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The news app is very&nbsp;nice looking cute and fast. The problem is most of the news sources are absolute garbage.&nbsp; When I go to google news or yahoo news they have more reputable news sources.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The weather app presents a forecast very different from weather.gov (the official weather site).&nbsp; I used weather.gov in the past. Today I noticed the big difference between the forecasts of the two weather sources.&nbsp; I am going back to weather.gov instead
 of the weather app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The map app is erratic and unreliable.&nbsp; I stopped using it because I can't tell what it is going to do from one time to the next.&nbsp; It malfunctions frequently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as Cortana goes, she is very promising but still far from practical or usable.&nbsp; Cortana works great about 15% of the time.&nbsp; Other times I say: "Hey Cortana", and she doesn't even respond despite several attempts.&nbsp; For the most part when asked a question
 she just inputs the question into a search string an sends the string to Edge (a second rate version of IE).&nbsp; She used to be able to answer routine questions like: "What is the weather?"&nbsp; But when she does answer this question, she probably brings up the broken
 data from the weather app.&nbsp; Cortana could be great with consistency and reliability but is now a poor quality toy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I love Microsoft, Win 10, is awesome, but I think you need to make these technologies I've mentioned much&nbsp; more reliable and practical.&nbsp; Does anyone know a way to import good weather data into the weather app?&nbsp; Does anyone know how to make Cortana a usable
 tool?&nbsp; Does anyone know how to force the news app to use only good sources of news?</p>

            you will NOT notice ANY difference between the two CPUs in usual activities such as browsing ,email ,chat...etc
<div><br />
<div>the difference in clock speed is ONLY 18% at max clock speed ,how many times do you hit max clock speed in a day? if you are on balanced / power saver plans you will NOT reach your max CPU speed and that means you will NOT notice any difference.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Microsoft probably upgraded to the new CPU for factors related to availability / price ,expect other minor updates down the line ,are you going to return your tablet each time? :)</div>

            funny how that works. you buy a device that works, but return it and buy the same thing (Microsoft does not specify which cpu each surface has). this type of action is abusive from the customers, in my opinion.

            Really? &nbsp;My agreement states that within the 30-day period I can return it for "Any Reason". &nbsp;So no, that is not abusive. &nbsp;I might as well have the latest and greatest while I can do it.

<p><br />
Typically, it's 30 days to return from initial purchase, not 30 days every time you exchange it. Beyond that initial 30 days, you cannot return it arbitrarily and&nbsp;can only exchange due to a warranty issue. Most stores are smart enough to put in place systems
 that avoid this "abusive" behaviour... which isn't abusive if the store offers it.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In this case, most people don't expect a product to receive a&nbsp;hardware update, no matter how small or large, within the first 3 months of a product's release. Current early tests by myself and a handful of others are showing somewhere between a 10-20% increase
 in performance in games (eg. World of Warcraft, also video rendering - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfpro2-surfhardware/surface-pro-25-i5-4300u-19-ghz-25-ghz/bb77fa47-1516-4979-ad74-af6b021d6656?page=6&amp;tm=1389732842597">

<a href="http://www.surfaceforums.net/forum/microsoft-surface-pro-2/7534-surface-pro-2-5-a-8.html#post50507" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.surfaceforums.net/forum/microsoft-surface-pro-2/7534-surface-pro-2-5-a-8.html#post50507</a>). If you and others want to use the "you won't notice a difference web browsing, word processing, etc.", then you might as well have gotten a $300-400 tablet
 instead since you also won't notice a difference between the SP2 and these markedly cheaper devices. Those of us not just buying it for&nbsp;a fancy web browser&nbsp;actually care about the maximal performance that the device can reach.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>People are paying a premium price for a premium product. Why shouldn't they expect to get the latest and greatest when they only bought it maybe 1-2 weeks before the updated hardware SILENTLY came out? Maybe if Microsoft had announced this then people could
 make an informed decision for themselves as to whether it's worth waiting for the performance boost or just go with the original CPU since they don't care about the difference.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As an analogy, I'm sure that you would complain if someone bought the same SP2 hardware as you did but got a secret unannounced 10-20% discount a week later from the same store&nbsp;(ie. $100-200 off). This is a similar situation but with a difference in hardware
 rather than price.</p>

<h2>            Frequent system-crashes in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>My Sony Vaio Tap 11 (model: SVT1121C5E) runs very unstable ever since I bought it about 3 months ago. Almost every day the system crashes, sometimes multiple times. Sometimes with prior bluescreen, Windows colleting data and then stopping at 100%.
</p>
<p>Occasionally the device shuts down and automatically restarts. </p>
<p>Sometimes the screen becomes black and the device can be turned off only by holding the power-button for a few seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I´m running Windows 8.1 and all the current device-drivers, bios-update and Windows-updates are installed. I would really need some help here.</p>

            <p><span>Thanks Patrick for your help.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Concerning the Logitech device, and other USB-devices on my machine, you might want to know the following:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have not plugged any USB-devices to my machine, but am instead using&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(66, 66, 68, 1)">a 4-port USB to Ethernet-hub (</span><span><a href="http://www.sharkoon.com/?q=en/content/usb-lanport-400-giga" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(41, 100, 191, 1)">http://www.sharkoon.com/?q=en/content/usb-lanport-400-giga</span></a></span><span style="color: rgba(66, 66, 68, 1)">),
 which allows me to drive my mouse,&nbsp;thumb-drive and ext. HD over my "WiFi-router". In this way I don't need to plug anything to my laptop apart from the power-cable.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(66, 66, 68, 1)">However, due to a very weak internet signal here, my WiFi-router often loses the internet-connection. When that happens, also the USB-Hub (see above) which is physically connected with my router (LAN-cable),
 usually gets disconnected from the Laptop. Therefore the Logitech-mouse etc. will abruptly stop working. &nbsp;Just wanted to let you know.</span></p>
<p>Concerning your suggestions:&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(66, 66, 68, 1)">I have unsinstalled Daemon-Tools now and deactivated AVG.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Concerning&nbsp;http://www.duplexsecure.com/en/downloads I am not sure which of the two versions I need:<br />
a) this one is for Windows 8 64Bit<br />
b) this one is for Windows 8.1 32Bit&nbsp;<br />
But my device is Windows 8.1 64Bit. I guess I can go with option a), right?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(66, 66, 68, 1)"><br />
Furthermore I have just realised that the Wifi-drivers that Sony provided on their website, as well as it´s update-tool, are very outdated. I just downloaded the latest version directly from Intel.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(66, 66, 68, 1)"><span><br />
Do you think there could be a relationship between the Wifi-drivers and my system-crashes?</span></span></p>

            <p>Thanks for the information. Hubs can at times be very problematic, especially if they are constantly overloaded from having too many devices plugged in at once. They can be generally problematic in general. If we continue to crash after the recent recommendations
 you've carried out, it would be best to remove the hub from the equation, and only connect what is 100% necessary to the laptop for troubleshooting purposes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding the drivers, yes, very possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, to answer your question, option A should work just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep me updated.</p>
<p>

            <p>Wanted to uninstall the HUB just to make sure, but somehow it can´t be removed. After uninstall from "Programs and Features", followed by reboot it´s there again, but some files are missing now, so it can´t run either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Re-installing the old or a newer version also doesn´t work because he recognizes that there is an older version installed already. How can I get rid of it for now?</p>

            <p>Is it connected? If it's connected, Windows is probably attempting to just install the device drivers over and over again. You will need to remove the device, and then uninstall the drivers.</p>

<p>Just had another crash.<br />
I was about to load a website into my browser (Chrome), but there was no internet connection at that time. Then, for no obvious reason the device shut down.</p>
<p>I don´t know whether there is a relationship between the missing internet-connection, Chrome, Wifi and the crash, or not. Just wanted to let you know.</p>

    <title>Unknown logins and definate hacking into my computer... - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unknown logins and definate hacking into my computer...</h2>
                    <p>I noticed about 6 months ago&nbsp;my self-built desktop&nbsp;was infected and someone was actively using my computer. I literally was fighting over control of my own computer trying to close out weird services and processes. I found all sorts of files that were being
 transferred from my computer to wherever and vice versa. I have wiped my hard drives, updated my BIOS, etc. and still there are very suspicious logins in the Event Viewer etc. Odd permissions on folders. I just installed a fresh copy of Windows 10 Pro 64 bit\all
 Windows Updates up-to-date, and there are log offs right as I log in with my username with a $ at the end or SYSTEM, etc. with the domain of&nbsp;NT AUTHORITY.&nbsp;The codes are 4672 for special logon, 4624 for logon and 4634 for log off.&nbsp;Logon ID is 0x3E7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a wireless camera attached to my computer that records my home and runs at 2.4 GHz. That could be the only way someone could still access my computer while disconnected from my network. Is there anything that can be loaded into my MB BIOS? There are
 small sections of both hard drives that I can never format or get rid of.&nbsp;I have&nbsp;reset passwords more than I can possibly remember (there has&nbsp;or had to be a key logger on my machine)&nbsp;and I am still dumbfounded. I have been WORKING in the IT field for almost
 10 years and I have never&nbsp;saw anything like&nbsp;this before. I know Windows 10 has a bunch of new features, etc. but not for one minute I can believe there are services that Automatically log on or off right as I do, etc. or set strange permissions to files and
 folders that I cannot take ownership of. I am the Admin on my computer, no one else should be. I am getting to the point of contacting authorities or bringing my computer into work to see what the issue could be. Nothing comes up when running a scan with Malwarebytes.
 I cleaned the computer when I was fighting for control but after I still see the same kind of activity, they are just not brazen enough to control my computer while I am on it, if this is the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there in fact&nbsp;are services\processes logging in and out of Windows right as I do then Microsoft needs to change the way they log things. Logging something as something else makes no sense from an IT perspective or from any! It is almost lie someone loaded
 all kinds of **** onto my computer and are disguising them as Windows services and processes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is my computer and&nbsp;I should control what\who\when log on\log offs occur. Anyone else have Windows 7 or higher that notices all of this in their logs? I downloaded the ISO to install Windows 10 Pro from Microsoft so there is no counterfeit\random version
 of Windows 10 Pro here.......</p>

</p><p>You can not clean up a fully compromised system that can’t be trusted anymore. If you rely on event logs (any data in-there for that matter) to tell you what has been done to your system, you may just be reading what the attacker wants you to read.
<br />
<br />
If you have a system that has been completely compromised, the only thing you can do is to flatten the system (reformat the system disk) and rebuild it from scratch (reinstall Windows and your applications).</p>

            <p>Hi Amandeep, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Welcome to Microsoft Community and we are glad to help you.<br />
<br />
From the description of this issue, it seems there are some issues with Accu Weather Modern App for Windows 8 on the computer as you get black boxes over the screen when you try to open the app. But, when you change the settings to “NO ANIMATION”, you are able
 to view the app.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Let me ask few questions on this issue to get a clear picture:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1) Are you able to access the Weather app when settings for animation are enabled for the app?<br />
2) Is this issue specific to the Accu&nbsp;weather app ?<br />
3) Did you make any changes to the computer prior to this issue?<br />
4) What is the Make and Model of the computer?<br />
<br />
First let’s check if there is a problem with the Weather app on the computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may follow the methods:<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1:<br />
</strong></div>
<div><br />
You can perform App troubleshooter on the computer to check if there is an issue with the Weather app on the computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may refer to the link to download and run Modern User Interface App troubleshooter:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab</a>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the troubleshooter does not help, then you refer to the link to resolve any issue on Windows 8 apps:<br />
<br />
"<strong>What to do if you have problems with an app</strong>"</div>

<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app</a>
<br />
<br />
<div><strong>Method 3:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the method does not help to resolve the issue, then perhaps, there might be an issue with the Graphics driver.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to check for the latest graphics driver for Windows 8 from the manufacturer website.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you do not find the graphics driver for Windows 8 from the manufacturer website, then I would suggest you to download and install the latest graphics driver in Windows 7 compatibility mode.<br />
<br />
You may refer to the link to download the latest driver:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="http://downloadcenter.intel.com/SearchResult.aspx?lang=eng&amp;ProductFamily=Graphics&amp;ProductLine=Desktop+graphics+drivers&amp;ProductProduct=Intel%c2%ae+G41+Express+Chipset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://downloadcenter.intel.com/SearchResult.aspx?lang=eng&amp;ProductFamily=Graphics&amp;ProductLine=Desktop+graphics+drivers&amp;ProductProduct=Intel%c2%ae+G41+Express+Chipset</a>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may refer to the steps to uninstall the current version of the graphics driver and then install the latest driver that you may have downloaded in Windows 7 compatibility mode:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Uninstall the current version of graphics driver from the computer:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note:</strong> Please download the latest driver for the graphics device from the manufacturer website before
<div>uninstalling the current version.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a) Press <strong>Windows and x </strong>key on the desktop screen.<br />
b) Click on<strong> Device Manager</strong>.<br />
c) Locate the graphics driver.<br />
d) Right click on the driver icon and click on <strong>Uninstall</strong>.<br />
e) Follow the onscreen instructions to uninstall the driver.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>After uninstalling the current version, you may install the latest driver that you may have download in Windows 7 compatibility mode.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may refer to the steps to do so:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a) Open the folder which contains the setup file for the latest driver that you have downloaded.<br />
b) Right click on the setup file and click on <strong>Properties</strong>.<br />
c) Go to <strong>Compatibility</strong> tab.<br />
d) Check the box which states “<strong>Run this program in Compatibility Mode</strong>”<br />
e) Select <strong>Windows 7</strong> from the list.<br />
f) Select <strong>OK</strong>. <br />
g) Follow the onscreen instructions to install the graphics driver in <strong>Windows 7
</strong>compatibility mode. <br />
<br />
You may refer to the link for reference in case of running older programs in compatible mode on Windows 8:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the&nbsp;methods above still persists, i&nbsp;would suggest you to contact the App publisher for Accu Weather App&nbsp;to get&nbsp;the details on this issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may&nbsp;refer tio the link to contact them:</div>

<h2>            Windows 10 - The network security key isn&#39;t correct, please try again.</h2>
                    Just done a clean install of Windows 10. When I try and connect to the wifi router I get "The network security key isn't correct, please try again."This is driving my nuts! The key is correct and it works for all other devices in my household. I can connect
 OK with Windows 7 and with Linux. This problem was why I uninstalled Windows 10 back in August - I thought I would give it another try - surely there must be some answer to the problem?<br />

            Thank you but I think the problem may be with the virgin superhub 2 router - I just went into the settengs and changed it from WPA2-PSK[AES] to WPA-Auto and hey presto it connected! Lets now wait and see how long it lasts and what happens with other devices

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have the same problem and tried the solutions above but I cant fix it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cant find where to change WP2 into WP or I followed your advice with the command and the system informed the device is up to date. What should I do next? I already reset the setting and the password is 100% right cos my mobile phone still can access the
 internet with the same password. Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Win 10 reset and now stuck in setup loop</h2>
                    <p>I did a reset on win 10 and now that its reinstalled when I get to the lets get started screen I pick the timezone and use the recommended option after and it just loops back to that screen. I went into setup from startup and did troubleshoot to reset again

    <title>Why my NetMeeting works with Windows 7&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lui gzz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why my NetMeeting works with Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm currently able to use NetMeeting with my Windows 7 Enterprise Professional version (SP1). That's odd to me since all posts I've read mentioned that it shouldn't. And I don't have any VM to use XP or other to do so either. The only guess I have is my
 Laptop was upgraded from Windows XP and some components remained on my hard drive to enable netmeeting feature. It is not in my listed programs. However when&nbsp;I go to RUN, and type "conf", I'm able to open it up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only issue is that when opening or closing my NetMeeting, screen will flash several times until is either closed or open. As some sort of conflict with the video card. Also, if I put my lap to StandBy
<u>while</u> my NetMeeting is open, when turning it on again, it will flash sameway (black screen) before even showing anything on the screen. That's when I need to manually reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Going back to my question, a co-worker asked me how to run&nbsp;NetMeeting in his newly laptop. Other than using alternatives or install Virtual Machine with XP, I've haven't found any other that has my same situation: Why MY NetMeeting works in Windows 7? (I'd
 like to know if there's a way to replicate my settings to his computer (even copying my installed files?)... I wonder. Thanks!</p>

<h2>            How do you recover old files &#47;data prior to a Storage Pool &#40;Delete pool is the only option thus far&#41;</h2>
                    I am looking for any suggestions as I have spent nearly 20+ hours working with MS and reading through blogs and creating/deleting storage pools to simulate scenarios.<br />
<br />
Basically I had storage pool that had a "Retired" drive and when working with Microsoft they asked me to use a USB drive and attach to existing storage pool to remove the other.<br />
<br />
Adding the USB Drive (2 TB w/ 1.5 existing backup data) sorta worked but ended up having to remove the storage pool and recreate.<br />
<br />
However the old pool still shows my old drives + the one "OK" good USB Drive that is part of the pool.&nbsp; But the Storage pool is "Red" and has an error of Inaccessible; check the physical drives section and only allows me to delete the pool.<br />
<br />
I do NOT want to delete in fear (and tested) that it will remove my USB backup drive from the storage but also make my data inaccessible (data on the drive prior to being part of the pool.&nbsp; 2-way mirror<br />
<br />
I purchased data recovery software and scanned the drives and see some of the data but the name/file structure seems a little off and my preference would be to be able to access my original files on the USB (Videos and pictures mainly) and delete the useless
 storage pool.<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how to access data prior to being part of a storage pool or find a safe way to remove/delete a pool from a s

<p>There are any number of reasons why the server might return this error. A common one is a mistake in one of the addresses the message is being sent to. To check this, click

    <title>Microsoft Excel Workbook on Different PC&#39;s - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft Excel Workbook on Different PC&#39;s</h2>
                    <p>We have a shared excel spreadsheet master that when opened appears correct on my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a formula IF cell D1 = A, E1&nbsp;=25, IF cell D1 =&nbsp;B, E1&nbsp;= 30, IF cell D1 = C, E1&nbsp;= 35.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cell D1 has a drop down box and when the spreadsheet is opened default is set to A so E1 reads 25. When I select B or C cell E1 comes up with a error #VALUE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We believe&nbsp;there is nothing wrong with the formula because if I save the corrupted spreadsheet and email to another PC&nbsp;that user&nbsp;can then select A or C and the correct value appears back in E1. We they email it back to my PC with C selected and I&nbsp;open&nbsp;it
 up and all appears correct E1 show a value of 35 until I try to change D1 back to A or B and we go back to the #VALUE error in E1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We assume it must be a setting on my PC as it used to work fine last time I used it a week ago so could it be some setting has changed during a windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any input would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Morning Vijay,</p>
<p>
</p><p>See the&nbsp;formula below its different than I described in my opening email but same principle I was simply trying to make things easy. The formula is in Cell F1 and the drop down select box for RATES in cell G1. As I said earlier we don't think its the formula
 as several people have access to the master spreadsheet and it works fine on their PC's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cell F1 is OK and changes to the&nbsp;correct rate but there are several cells that&nbsp;are = F1 these cells are&nbsp;&nbsp;F3 to F9 and it is these cells that read #VALUE when the rate is change in cell G1. The formula in these cells is =$F$1*SUMMARY!$D$8%+$F$1. Cell D8 in
 the summary page is set at 0 and is used to add a percentage to the core rate if required.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this explains all but let me know if you have any further questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>=IF(G1="NORTHERN RATE","£23.72",IF(G1="SOUTHERN RATE","£27.87",IF(G1="NORTHERN SMALL WORKS","£28.57",IF(G1="SOUTHERN SMALL WORKS","£33.00"))))</p>
