<div>Hi GR,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Are you usder any active domain?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Cause:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This behavior may occur because the Routing and Remote Access Service is unable to start if the Remote Access Connection Manager service, Remote Access Auto Connection Manager, and the Telephony service are disabled.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Precautions:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Ensure that you have entered the right username and password. <br />
b. Make sure that your account is active and turned on. <br />
c. You might also try to enter another Access Number.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>RESOLUTION:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To resolve this behavior, you must use the Services Administrative tool to set the Startup Type of all the Remote Access Connection Manager service, Remote Access Auto Connection Manager, and the Telephony service to Manual..</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>After you have made these settings, you can restart the Routing and Remote Access Service.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>To do that:</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. Click on start button.<br />
b. Type services.msc in the search field and hit enter.<br />
c. In the services window you need to check for these below services and make the startup type as manual by performing a righ click on these services and selecting manual and check if that resolves the issue.<br />
&nbsp;a.1 Remote Access Connection Manager service.<br />
&nbsp;b.2 Remote Access Auto Connection Manager<br />
&nbsp;c.3 Telephony service.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>If the problem persists, you might need to contact your Inetenet service provider.</strong></div>

                    <p>I either receive the above error, or a message telling me that the update has failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run the Windows Update Troubleshooter and initially it tells me that an update is not completed, which it then goes on to say is completed and fixed.&nbsp; However, Windows Update continues to fail to update, and when I next run the troubleshooter it says
 that the registry is not recognised.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried to&nbsp;Run the DISM tool (<em>dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth AND
</em><em>dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth)</em>, but I get error 740 and a statement that "elevated permissions are required to run DISM".&nbsp; I do not have a password to my computer so not sure what this error is.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A corruption in system files is the most possible reason of the Windows Update failure. You are on the right track of troubleshooting your computer. With regard to the error that you get in running DISM, it usually happens when you didn't run it using administrator
 access. Having said that, you can re-run the DISM; but this time, we suggest that you do first the
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">System File Checker (SFC)</a></strong> then followed by DISM.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>With regard to the password, you can actually <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4026923/windows-create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">create an administrator account</a></strong><strong>
</strong>to run the SFC and DISM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know what happens after doing the suggestion/s given.</p>

<h2>            Dashboard error when starting game</h2>
                    <p>Hello all, first post on the forums, I came here last as I have no idea what to do, I’ve already asked Blizzard support and they told me to ask here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night I was doing an update for Overwatch, I decided to play GTA5 during the update, after it was done I inserted my Overwatch disc and upon startup I was forced back to my home screen with the error “TE-1130E” the message told me if it persist to re-install
 the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I power cycled my Xbox about 3 times, did a hard reset, and a soft factory reset (factory reset but I keep my games and apps installed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the aboved has helped, I even re-installed Overwatch and again, it has not helped...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’m at a loss on what to do here... Any help would be great.</p>

            Hi! So it's a system/dashboard notification from your Xbox One and not Overwatch that gives you the&nbsp;<span>“TE-1130E” error code? Usually Xbox One error codes look like&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">“E12”
 or “0x87df2ee7”. May you have received another error code/message?</span>

<p>not sure this will help... have you tried letting it update without doing anything else? i find on my 360 that some updates/downloads stop if i play or use the system during the process. many problems started this year all over with web bases things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>my opinion is the changing of the web codes. some idiot thought it was a good idea (so everyone did it) and now we all pay the price with bad service with any web based service.</p>

    <title>How to successfully reinstall Flight Simulator X Microsoft&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> russell b. davis - atc software developer  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to successfully reinstall Flight Simulator X Microsoft&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have spent 3 days trying to reinstall Microsoft Flight Simulator X. I have removed everything possible that I can locate with FSX or FLight Simulator attached to it. I have removed every folder, every file, every addon, etc. I have ran SpyBot, CCLEANER,
 and Norton Utilities to correct registry issues after removal. I ran REGEDIT and manually searched out every reference (which took many&nbsp;hours BTW) and deleted them by hand. One thing I found is there NEVER any FSX.CFG created under my USER folder after REPAIRing
 the installation. </p>
<p><br />
I then tried to reinstall my licensed copy back on my system. It continues to act as if the software still exists on my PC, and asks if I wish to Repair or Remove. If I select Remove, it takes forever, as to be expected with 14 gb of stuff. I then reboot, and
 try again. As always, I am given the choice Repair or Remove.</p>
<p><br />
If I go ahead and try to run it after REPAIR is completed, I am ALWAYS presented with the error that there is something wrong with the configuration and "reinstalling may correct it".
</p>
<p><br />
I'm here to tell you, that is a fallacy. Reinstalling, repairing does not work. This is nothing but an exercise in futility. Microsoft, this should not be this difficult. Surely there is an app that will remove this from my system correctly. Since I develop
 addons for Flight Simulator X, it is imperative that I get this reinstalled. <br />
</p>
<p>I even opened a brand new copy of Flight Simulator X and it too triggers the same error condition. Can someone please lead me to the solution?<br />
<br />
I am running Windows XP/SP3. I also use Microsoft Visual Studio 2010 in my development.&nbsp; I never had any issues with the program, it was running just fine. I was doing some maintenance on my system and needed to remove and reinstall a lot of my apps due to
 .NET framework issues. So, there had never been anything wrong with the program; until I removed it and tried to reinstall.</p>

            Given the things you've already done, I don't know if the following will work, but see if you can completely uninstall things using either
<a href="http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Revo Uninstaller</a> or the
<a href="http://majorgeeks.com/Windows_Installer_CleanUp_Utility_d4459.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Installer Cleanup Utility</a>.<br />
<br />
Although the Windows Installer Cleanup Utility was developed by Microsoft, it was removed from the MS download servers because sometimes (uninstalling Office, perhaps?) it removed more than it was supposed to.&nbsp; If you make a registry backup first, you should
 be OK in using it -- assuming that it finds anything to remove.<br />

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 Stuck on Working on Features Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an end user that has had her Surface Pro 4 force an update on her when she was in the middle of working on a file. She then left the Surface Pro to upgrade for 2 full hours. It has now been stuck on "Working on features. 100% complete. Don't turn
 off your computer" for over an hour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then I have tried restarts, hard resets (ie power + volume up button) have started in safe mode with networking, tried advanced options &gt; automatic repair (however, when I tried to repair I got the error that a repair could not be completed).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;The user has only had the Surface Pro about 2 weeks from brand new out of the box. I am hesitant to do a system recovery as we want to see if the file the user was working on has auto recovered in Powerpoint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried restarting with no external devices attached (to no avail) and have plugged it into our network via ethernet &gt; USB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone shed any insight as to what else I can try?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            DVD drive unable to read DVDs in Windows 10, only CDs</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had Windows 10 on my laptop for a while now, upgraded from 8.1. &nbsp;After I got all the drivers updated, it's worked pretty well, but the only thing that hasn't is the DVD drive. &nbsp;It worked in 8.1, but I can't figure out what the problem is now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like it can tell the disk exists (spinning up, other assorted sounds) but then stops. &nbsp;Attempting to open the disc through Explorer gives me an "Insert a Disc" message. &nbsp;A few programs tell me it's an "Incompatible Media". &nbsp;Oddly enough, CDs work
 perfectly. &nbsp;I have also tested it with multiple DVDs and multiple CDs, and this is always the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My drive is a Matshita DVD-RAM UJ8E1<br />
</p>
<p>List of things I've tried so far:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Checking whether drivers were up to date in device manager (it said they were)</p>
<p>-Uninstalling the driver and restarting (it came back, claiming to work properly but not really)</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As per the description, I understand that you are facing some issues using Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This might have occurred due to some system conflicts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Perform clean boot to avoid any third party software conflict.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps
 eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to
 perform a Clean Boot.</span></p>
<p>

</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Run the System File Checker tool (SFC.exe)</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>System File Checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files. It will scan your system files
 and to repair missing or corrupted system files in Windows. To run the SFC scan, refer to the Microsoft article below.</span></p>

            Hi Pram.  I I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Make sure to choose the correct version for your license and it will reactivate with the Digital License.  
<br />
<br />It's a far better install than any shop would do anyway.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Pramukta, the repair shop has installed the wrong Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . .etc.)
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 as many times as you need and activation will not be an issue as long as the same Edition is installed as the previous Edition . . .
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />
<br />Go to System - About 
<br />
<br />Whet version of Windows 10 is reported there, is it Pro or Enterprise? 
<br />
<br />Then in the Settings App, go to Update and Security - Activation 
<br />
<br />Does Activation report that 'Windows is activated using your Organisation's Activation server'?

    <title>Windows 10 Latest Update destroyed functionality for HomeGroup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jrthom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Latest Update destroyed functionality for HomeGroup</h2>
                    <p>It has happened again.&nbsp; Each time that Microsoft updates Windows 10 it disables Home Group and makes it nearly impossible to re-establish.&nbsp; I have wasted a morning trying to connect the Home Group and I get a message, "Windows cannot set up HomeGroup on
 this computer".&nbsp; Interesting, because before this update this week, the Home Group (finally) was working after the episode from the last update!!&nbsp; Why can Microsoft not retain the computer and network settings when they do an update?&nbsp; Do you not test your
 process and results before releasing these updates???&nbsp; This is so frustrating and destroys productivity until some workaround is found.&nbsp; When I go to the sites which suggest "fixes", they contain either old information, not relevant to current update or suggest
 that modifications be made to the computer with which I am not comfortable doing.&nbsp; And, of course, there is no way to get Microsoft assistance from a live person.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>

            I think you should delete the HomeGroup, start over first by setting up a basic workgroup:

<p>
</p><p>When all three of the computers are on, each computer's homegroup setting indicates that I have been asked to join a homegroup and to enter the password.&nbsp; There is no password to give, so when I try to choose the option to change the password, it goes back
 to the message: "enter the password". &nbsp;</p>

            There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1709, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Fall Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started.

<p>I appreciate your attempt to help.&nbsp; I went through your steps and even rebooted twice as someone suggested, but it did not fix the issue.&nbsp; Apparently, it does work for some; "lucky" me, it failed!&nbsp; My question remains, "what do I do to get this fixed??"&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Also, why, if this fix works for some, doesn't Microsoft implement the fix <em>
<strong>before </strong></em>releasing to the public?!</p>

            Andre, I tried your solution out of utter desperation but the system simply forces back into the latest update.&nbsp; How do you stop Microsoft from forcing an update?&nbsp; Pushing out updates that are not ready for "prime time" only aggravate the customer and
 drive us to Mac.&nbsp; I now understand that Microsoft is going to ditch Homegroup in future updates so there is no hope if getting my issue fixed apparently.&nbsp; I have attempted to work around through Network but it no longer recognizes all three computers and I
 get an error message that "the folders on this computer cannot be shared".&nbsp; Productivity is shot with Microsoft!

    <title>My Skype continues coming up with an error message. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> julixx  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Skype continues coming up with an error message.</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I try using Skype, it will open, but it won't let me use my camera. I have a camera built into my laptop so it very clearly cannot be disconnected. It works for other applications and even the Skype Windows 10 Application itself. I personally prefer
 using the Skype downloaded version (I'm not sure what it's called, exactly.) but it's begun not working correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I said, the application will open but it will not let me use my camera. It says that there is no camera detected when I attempt to video call. I use this to talk to my boyfriend constantly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error is as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>SkypeSetup (or Skype).exe&nbsp;- Bad Image</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\DPAPI.DLL is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again using the original installation media or contact your system administrator or the software vendor for support. Error status
 0xc0000020</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no idea what this means. There is always two error messages and I have attempted deleting all of my Skype files from my laptop, uninstalling and reinstalling Skype &amp; even restarting my laptop to make it work. It hasn't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any insight on what is happening right now, that would be really nice. I've been stuck using the Skype Windows 10 App and it's extremely glitchy, not my cup of tea.</p>

<p>I know that I have CCleaner and McCafee on my laptop. I don't use the second, but CCleaner has been on the laptop for a long time. The corruption of system files would not surprise me. I'm not exactly sure what would have caused it, though. I haven't downloaded
 anything to my laptop in a while (except pictures from things like Facebook or Discord).</p>

 despise it.</p>

            <p>The $NtUninstallKBxxxxxx$ folders and associated files in these <br />
folders are created during each Windows Update that is installed <br />
on your PC and are safe to remove if you do not plan to uninstall <br />
any security or hotfix updates.</p>
<p><br />
However once deleted you will no longer be able to un-install<br />
a patch or update that was associated with the deleted folder/files.<br />
I would keep the most recent set (last two months just in case) of folders<br />
and delete the older updates.<br />
Note: As a safety net I burn these folders to a CD or DVD before <br />
deleting them.</p>
<p><br />
After deleting the $NtUninstallKBxxxxxx$ folders, <br />
open the Control Panel, select Add or Remove programs, <br />

Need to uninstall that update you burned to a CD:<br />
Copy the folder back to:<br />

<p><br />
For a either a single or dual boot <br />
(you will have two drive letters, so copy back to the correct drive) <br />
this will work for either single or dual boot:<br />

deleted and replaced by a new SP3 $NtServicePackUninstall$<br />
folder to be used if you uninstall SP3.<br />
If you have already installed SP3 then I would leave<br />
this folder as is, at least until you are certain that no bugs have<br />

    <title>Need Help Upgrading Receiver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jupiters caulk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need Help Upgrading Receiver</h2>
                    
<p>I'm looking for a new receiver. I currently have a sony str-dh510, and 2 energy fronts (cf-70's) so far. As soon as they go on sale, I'll buy an energy center and 2 energy rear speakers (and a sub), for 5.1. I'm leaning towards denon, because I like their
 look as well as audyssey calibration. I also could use more power (or sensitivity?).
</p>
<p>I'm currently looking at the denon avr-591 and the avr-1611. I've found both for about the same price (~$250, the 1611 is on sale). My absolute limit is $400, although if that extra $150 doesn't make a significant difference in quality, I probably won't
 go for it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may also be helpful to know I have only 2 hdmi inputs, and one optical input, and I probably won't go 7.1 anytime soon.
</p>
<p>Any suggestions or insight would be much appreciated.</p>

<p>I really would not worry about the power too much. When talking about watts per channel, you're not going to see (hear) much, if any difference at all. Just as a quick FYI, doubling the wattage (going from a 100 watts per channel amp to a 200 watts per channel
 amp) DOES NOT give you double the volume. Doubling the wattage only yields a 3db increase. That is pretty much the smallest increase a human can perceive. So the difference between 80 watt, 100 watt, 150 watt &amp; even 200 watt per channel receivers will be almost
 inaudible. If you want double the volume, you have to increase the wattage 10X (100 watts to 1,000 watts per channel). Also, look for power that's rated as being high current. It is much cleaner sounding &amp; more dynamic. If you have a choice between 100 watts
 of "normal" power or 75 watts of high current power, go with the 75 high current watts. Right now I'm running an 80 high current watts per channel Marantz that blows away my older, higher powered receivers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as brands go, Denon is a great brand (the same company that makes my Marantz). I would be more concerned with features as far as future proofing is concerned than name. In today's digital world, there isn't much room for brands to have their own "sound"
 anymore. I would equate the name more with reliability than sound, as far as receivers go. In all honesty, if you want bang for your buck, go with something like a Pioneer, Yamaha or even Sony (though I'm not a fan of Sony gear). I would look for inputs. The
 higher the count (especially HDMI), the better. You should buy the best, most future proof you can.... It's better to have a little overkill now than to kick yourself a year from now because you need to upgrade.</p>

<p>It just seems like my energy cf 70's would require more juice to not sound strained at higher volumes. They are 300 watts max, and have two sets of inputs on each speaker. I'm wondering if I could get a 7.1 receiver and just use the extra 2 channels to help
 power my huge fronts.</p>

<p>I checked the CF-70's specs... They only require 20 watts to run properly and max out at 300. They do run at 4 ohms though. If the sound is currently strained, it probably has more to do with ohms than wattage. I would check the receiver you're currently
 running to see if it is rated to 4 ohms. Unless you're running a higher end Sony, I would guess it's only rated for 8 ohms. If that's the case, the receiver will end up having to work harder (running hotter) to power the CF-70s. That's where the strained sound
 would be coming from. A high current amp will help a lot as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it were me, I would jump on that Onkyo. In fact, I'm thinking about replacing my Marantz with the next Onkyo up from the one I linked to.</p>

<p>Again, sorry for the double post...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I checked the Sony's specs. It is (as I suspected) only rated to 8 ohms. Don't pay much attention to wattage in your receiver search, because (as I said above) the difference in power between an 80 watt amp &amp; a 200 watt amp is damn near meaningless. Your
 speakers are rated to work properly with 20 watts of power. More importantly, they are also rated to work with a 4 ohm receiver/amp, not an 8 ohm unit. Look for a 4 ohm rating (2 would be even better) and high current power.</p>

<p>Okay so I'm wondering if I would be fine going with the denon avr-1912. I'm not really finding any receivers that meet my price range and needs. The 1912 is rated at 8 ohms and 6 ohms, but I can't find anything about 4 ohms. When I bought the speakers all
 I saw was 4 ohm min/ 8 ohm nominal and I just kind of focused on the 8 ohm part so I thought I'd be fine. The 1912 says "low impedance drive capability, but I'm not entirely sure what that means.
</p>
<p>I bought the denon avr-791 yesterday and hooked it up to the 2 speakers. It sounded pretty good but I just realized it's not rated for 4 ohms. I will probably return it today.
</p>
<p>I just don't want to constantly be overheating the receiver. I've had the 2 speakers hooked up to my 8 ohm sony receiver for like 3 weeks now and the receiver has been fine but I'm guessing it might *** the bed when I hook up more speakers. I'm hoping the
 denon wouldn't.</p>

<p>I would suggest that you pay close attention to the quality of the amp section and the reputation of the brand rather than looking for things like high current, 4 ohms, and watts. Truth is, none of that really matters in my opinion. Any receiver worth your
 money is high current, nearly all modern speakers are rated at 6-8 ohms which nearly all receivers are compatible with (CF-70s are 8 ohms, not 4). As the previous poster said, wattage does not matter. I've heard the 40wpc NAD T 747 sound infinitely more powerful
 than big box stores receivers like a Yamaha HTR-6295, which are about the same price, only the one is rated for over 120wpc.</p>

<p>Sorry for sounding ignorant, I still have much to learn and I realize there are a lot of ill-informed consumers (probably me) out there and I appreciate your help.
</p>
<p>Are you sure they are 8 ohms? I went to the energy website and it said 4 ohm minimum/ 8 ohm nominal. Of course, I didn't know what any of that meant when I bought them, I just paid attention to the 8 ohm and thought it would be fine. Do you think that impedance
 would constantly be overworking/ overheating the receiver?</p>

<p>That is one of the main thing when ppl buy a receiver with a pre out , to ad a external amp to feed the speakers . You may like some brand but if you want to do yourself a favor to run the energy`s buy something with pre-out`s .</p>

<p>Sorry, Silent Paradigm is correct in that the CF-70s are rated from 4-8 ohms (I failed to read beyond the 4 ohm minimum rating). That being the case, an amp rated at a strict 8 ohms will be fine. As for the high current, Silent Paradigm is also correct in
 that any receiver worth your money will be a high current design. The problem is that you say you're not willing to go above the $400 price point. You may have a tough time finding a high quality amplifier section at that price. Admittedly, it has been a while
 since I was in the market for a receiver, so prices may have fallen to the point where you can get a high current amp for that money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I said, equate the brand name with reliability, which is pretty much what Silent Paradigm said. When talking about the quality of the amp section, I also agree that this is important. The problem is that quality is hard to see, especially at lower price
 points. The specs I gave you to look at (high current &amp; ohm rating) are good, simple indicators. Most specs are pretty meaningless, so you need to judge by listening. Unfortunately, you probably won't be able to audition receivers using your speakers in your
 sound environment. Stick with a good brand, and (considering your $400 limit) check for things like high current, ohm rating, THD &amp; number of inputs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Again, the Onkyo I linked to would be a great choice.</p>

            Certain audio hardware/drivers in any OS may be able to still bridge audio across. However, this is not the standard or intended behavior using the latest Skype protocols (unless they intentionally revert a design change). The older Skype protocols did
 not impede system audio. I have a Creative Labs audio card that has a mode (What U Hear) that will still bridge the audio across in Skype, other modes on that card or using any interface on my Realtek onboard audio, bridges no such audio (unless a share computer
 sound option exists in Skype and is used or older protocols are negotiated on a particular call). The ability/inability to bridge audio is directly related to the protocols negotiated during the call, not the Skype client version. This behavior was present
 in both classic Skype and new Skype once the new protocols were used by default.

            There is no guarantee your results with be the same based solely on version number. Once the newer protocols were utilized in the classic version of Skype, results were similar. It generally has nothing to do with client version itself and everything to
 do with what protocols are negotiated to establish the call. This may alternate depending on the differing platforms and sometimes versions used (based on changes to protocols client/server side). Certain combinations may negotiate a differing compatible protocol.
 If a newer protocol is used that requires the share system sound option but the option is unavailable, shared audio might not be heard. If an older or alternate protocol is negotiated during the call, shared audio may be heard even if the option does not exist.
 Automatic echo cancellation and whether automatically adjust microphone settings is enabled or not on one or both ends may also have an effect. I believe the point/advantage to blocking system audio in the newer protocols is to

<h2>            How to fix or reinstall bluetooth</h2>
                    <p><span>For whatever reason, Bluetooth has completely vanished off of my computer, when I was using it the same day it disappeared (error code 45). I tried doing some research, and I was told that one solution to this is to
 completely uninstall all Bluetooth-related software from the Device Manager settings, and that it would reinstall on its own after the computer was restarted. I uninstalled everything and restarted my computer several times. Bluetooth did not reinstall, and
 now I am 100% without Bluetooth. How do I reinstall Bluetooth?<br />
<br />
I have also tried all the recommended step, running the troubleshooter doesn't work because it says my device doesn't support bluetooth. However I know for a fact it does because I've using bluetooth on it all the time, while using WiFi at the same time.</span></p>

            Bob,
<br />
<br />Thanks for letting me know.
<br />
<br />This could go badly in that it could be a hardware fault (if it really is not being recognized in Device Manager at all, something's gotta give), something's preventing the Bluetooth chipset from being recognized. I've had this issue with someone else and the most practical solution was to get it replaced under warranty or pay to get it repaired.
<br />
<br />If you're lucky, it could come back in the future and all would be well in the world.
<br />
<br />If you want to give it a try, look for "BLUETOOTH INTERFACE DRIVER" on this site and reinstall it: <a href="https://www.medion.com/gb/service/_lightbox/treiber.php?msn=30021502&amp;prod=MEDION%20ERAZER%20X6601%20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.medion.com/gb/service/_lightbox/tre...</a>(MD%2060313)%20UK
<br />
<br />Should it not be there, it could simply be a hardware-related issue, caused by a multitude of things.
<br />
<br />Let me know if you make any progress on it or if you're still having issues. Good luck.

<p>I've read on here about how people made their own version of the True Shot potion and it did something stupid like 147% more damage with bows. &nbsp;How can I do this? &nbsp;I'm playing with a Dark Elf right now who's at Level 41 and I'd love to be able to one shot,
 one kill any enemy I come across. &nbsp;Any tips for me?</p>

<p>I'm not sure what the ingredients are for a trueshot potion, but if people were gettting 147% increase in any potion, they were probably using a glitch of some sort. &nbsp;I know there is a restoration glitch that will improve the effects of your fortify alchemy
 gear exponentially. &nbsp;For instance, if you wear 4 clothing pieces with + fortify alchemy enchantments on them, and then combine small antlers with a cyrodillic spadetail, you will get a fortify restoration potion. &nbsp;Drink this, and you will see that your alchemy
 gear has buffed to a greater +alch %. &nbsp;Unequip your alchemy gear, then re-equip it. &nbsp;Make ANOTHER potion of fortify restoration, this time while your gear is already buffed, and you will make an even more powerful potion. &nbsp;Lather rinse and repeat. &nbsp;So basically,
 once your gear is at an alchemy level you are happy with, create your Trueshot potion, and it will be stupidly powerful ... but to be honest, this kind of exploit makes the game less fun to me. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The 147% is a tadd misleading. Bethesdas at it again. How can anything be over 100%. I took a potion of sure shot that gives 40% increase and while wearing my bracers that give 35% and using my bow that is Legendary and does 100 damage. Add it all up and
 you have the magical 175. (NOT?) The effect is that your screen shows 1.75x Dam or as in my case, sneak attacks will sometimes yield 2.0x dam and that enemy is dead with one shot.</p>
<p>If your going to make your own potion? You have to get your alchemy skill up and take an enhancing potion to increase your temporary skill so when you make said potion, it will be that much better. Mind boggling!!! Make a plan and follow your plan for the
 best results.</p>

<p>Yea! That's the ticket! The question was the rhetorical part, my math skills are not quite Mensa or anything like that but we're saying the same thing. I was trying to suggest how to "Make his potion better" by enhancing his alchemy skill.</p>

            Hi, SittonKiddo,
<br />
<br />When you save them there is a dialog box which shows .jpg when naming a file. 
<br />Click the down arrow on the right of the namespace box and select .png
<br />
<br />Are you sure the files weren't originally .jpg files?
<br />
<br />GIF format is limited to 256 colors and is a lossless compression file format, a common choice for use on the Web. GIF is a good choice for storing line drawings, text, and iconic graphics at a small file size.
<br />PNG format is a lossless compression file format, which makes it a common choice for use on the Web. PNG is a good choice for storing line drawings, text, and iconic graphics at a small file size.
<br />JPG format is a lossy compressed file format. This makes it useful for storing photographs at a smaller size than a BMP. JPG is a common choice for use on the Web because it is compressed. For storing line drawings, text, and iconic graphics at a smaller file size, GIF or PNG are better choices because they are lossless.
<br />
<br />JPEGs are for photographs and realistic images. PNGs are for line art, text-heavy images, and images with few colors. GIFs are just fail.

            I had to change my region to UK as despite Guernsey (where I'm located) being on the list, the store does not work if you have it selected.

            <p>Your asking the why windows 8 is not supporting this when you should be asking why HP is not supporting this Scanjet on Windows 8. the Manufacturer is responsible for compatibility of their hardware/software, not Microsoft. I would contact HP support and
 possibly make use of their forums as someone else may have had your problem and solved. But, If this&nbsp;Scanjet worked on XP it must be getting up-there in age, and you may need to replace it.&nbsp;Hope this helps and if you need any further assistance post and we
 will be Glad to help you.</p>
