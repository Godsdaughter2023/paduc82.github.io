<p>
</p><p>The enforcement side of things isn't often one strike and you're out depending on the severity. It is more generally about building up a picture of behaviour and that relies on everyone reporting such actions and infringements</p>

If he was suspended It was foolish to send more abuse 24 hours later as I reported him again. I received a messaage hours later after the first few sent on Friday. How long does it take for the enforcenent team to look at the complaint ? I was suspended only
 minutes after I used profanity.

<h2>            My photos disappear from Windows 10 when I download them onto my computer from my IPhone</h2>
                    <p>There have been two instances of this. &nbsp;The first time I thought I did something wrong, and turned a blind eye to the problem thinking I could solve it. &nbsp;Then when I couldn't I assumed I must have done something incorrectly...</p>
<p>Just now (or about 45 minutes ago to be more precise) I was transferring photos from my iPhone to my laptop. &nbsp;As i did this I created a new folder (on my laptop) with the day's date and began the process and as they transferred over I then began deleting
 them from my phone so that I freed the memory space. &nbsp;As i reached the final pictures to transfer the entire new folder i had created vanished.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not "accidentally" hit the wrong button and delete them from the wrong place. &nbsp;If I had they would have gone to the recycle bin anyway, which I checked for good measure. &nbsp;I have tried searching for the individual file names using a C drive search and
 they do not exist on the computer and nor do they exist on my I-Phone anymore!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So Windows 10 somehow deletes files and in this case pictures and videos of my newborn son which obviously hold a great sentimental value to me and there is no reason for this to have happened nor can they be any acceptable excuse for the loss. &nbsp;I am furious
 with Microsoft right now, it is beyond unacceptable!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any remote possibility that they can be recovered and if so how? &nbsp;If not, then what are Microsoft going to do or do they shirk responsibility?</p>

            <p>Hi Neill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience caused to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all you need to run the iPhone to PC Transfer - iTransfer utility, and
<strong>connect the iPhone/iPod/iPad</strong> to your computer via USB cable. After doing this, all the information on your iPhone/iPod/iPad device will be displayed automatically on the program's main interface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to transfer files from an iPhone/iPad/iPod device to the local drive of your computer, open the appropriate source file list and select the files that you want to export. For example, you want to transfer your iPhone photos to your computer drive,
 click on the <strong>"Photos"</strong> icon, select the photos, and choose the <strong>
"Transfer to My Computer"</strong> option from the Export menu. Alternatively, you can select the photos that you want to copy to your computer, right-click and choose "Transfer to My Computer".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, try to change the source location to other drive if you have any and&nbsp;check if it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the status of the issue.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Anil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for that, I think what you say will be helpful if I ever decide to run the risk of transferring files from my phone to my laptop agin, but unfortunately it does not help to restore the photos that have been lost and I am none the wiser as to how
 (and why) this has happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify my actions I initiated the file transfer by connecting my i-phone to my laptop with a USB cable, but I was not using the iTransfer utility (software?) nor was I aware this is the procedure to use. &nbsp;Presumably the "old fashioned way" (i.e. using
 file explorer to open the relevant folders and just select the files and copy them to my choice of folder) of transferring is still a legitimate way of doing things and should not result in such a catastrophic and inexplicable data loss, should it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any other suggestion to help recover my seemingly lost files? &nbsp;I would appreciate if someone can tell me what has happened and why it has happened. &nbsp;Is this a known "issue" with Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neill</p>

            <p>Hi Neill,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry I can't help you with recovering your files. And I don't think you would ever get them back. But I can tell you I had exactly the same issue, 2 days ago. So don't blame yourself, you did nothing wrong. But we both must admit the reliability of Win
 10 leaves a lot to be desired, at least for the moment. Especially having in mind my folder with 6 pictures in it disappeared not during the transfer, but&nbsp;2 or 3 min&nbsp;later. I was able to see my pictures in&nbsp;the new folder on the Desktop and when I tried to
 move one of them to a different folder, they all disappeared, with the folder.</p>
<p>No more comment.</p>

<p>The photos I have taken for the last four months have disappeared from my computer too! I had an SD&nbsp;disc in my camera, and they disappeared from my camera as well. I had no reason to believe my photo downloading would be any different than what it had been
 before installing Windows 10. Why oh why did this happen? Where can I file an official complaint. I am truly disturbed by this, and I wish I could go back in time to prevent it from happening. And to have pictures of your newborn son--I could only imagine
 your heartbreak, and send you my sympathies.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, can anyone please tell me how to rectify this situation transferring pictures with an SD disc?</p>

            The exact same thing just happened to me!!! I was just transferring all of my photos from my old computer and phone to my new computer using Windows 10. After spending days transferring thousands of photos, I just went in to the folder and they are all
 missing. I transferred them using bluetooth and usb and have gone back and verified they were there numerous times and now all of a sudden they are just gone. How is this acceptable, why is it happening, and what is the solution? Can you guarantee that this
 will not happen again if I transfer the files again?

            I down loaded pictures from my Canon 70D directly onto my son's computer. &nbsp;I selected the feature to erase the sd card when finished. &nbsp;I saw the pictures on the computer. &nbsp;I looked at everyone of them. I then did the same with the pictures from my 60D.
 &nbsp;I saw those pictures too. &nbsp;When I went back to look at the pictures from the 70D to post them on his high school FB page, the pictures were nowhere to be found. &nbsp;The computer is only 4 months old and hardly used. &nbsp;I got on the line with Dell for 5 (five)
 hours trying to find the pictures. &nbsp;They charged me $295.00 and still could not recover the pictures. &nbsp;Between my son's track meets and some pictures I took at a baby party, it was close to 500 pictures lost. &nbsp;Dell told me it is a glitch in the Microsoft Windows
 10 program.

            <p>This happened to me too...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hundreds of pictures from the SD card of my DSLR are now (seemingly) lost forever. Including shots of my newborn daughter, that I'll never be able to replicate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like some of the posters above, I looked through every shot before erasing my SD card. I even opened some of them up in Photoshop to make edits... now the remainder have vanished into thin air!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I had accidentally deleted them, they'd show up in the Recycle bin wouldn't they? So as far as I can tell, this happened for no reason at all...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely there must be a way around this?!</p>

<p>There have been two instances of this. &nbsp;The first time I thought I did something wrong, and turned a blind eye to the problem thinking I could solve it. &nbsp;Then when I couldn't I assumed I must have done something incorrectly...</p>
<p>Just now (or about 45 minutes ago to be more precise) I was transferring photos from my iPhone to my laptop. &nbsp;As i did this I created a new folder (on my laptop) with the day's date and began the process and as they transferred over I then began deleting
 them from my phone so that I freed the memory space. &nbsp;As i reached the final pictures to transfer the entire new folder i had created vanished.</p>

<p>You have my utmost sympathy, but your procedure does raise a big red flag as far as I'm concerned. Basically as far as I can tell the OS was in the process of syncing a folder on your PC with the camera's contents, but since you deleted the files from the
 camera <em>during</em> the process, those deletions got synced too! This is my guess since I don't know how Win10 actually functions internally, but does sound plausible to me (although if this is really the reason then it is a huge UX failure on the part
 of the Windows developers). In any case purely for safety reasons, common sense always dictates to me to disconnect my cameras, double-check that all the files exist on the PC and are viewable,
<em>then</em> get rid of the originals from the devices. I know this is scant comfort to you, but hopefully it helps you and others in the future since I've never lost a single picture yet in any version of Windows while following this method.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally to anyone in a similar situation, don't panic (yet) and follow the basics of data recovery. The most important of which is - stop using the PC
<strong>immediately</strong> to minimize writing any data to the drive which contained the files and thus ruining all chances of recovering them. Close all running programs, download a data recovery tool on another system (for an initial attempt you can try
 a deep scan using the <a href="https://www.piriform.com/recuva/builds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
portable version of Recuva</a> which can run off an external drive) and never, ever recover/undelete files to the same drive which contained the deleted files. If Recuva doesn't find anything there are lots of advanced programs you can try, but I recommend
 you read about them thoroughly first so as not to potentially destroy any remaining data on your drives. Good luck!</p>

<p>Code 0001 is indeed a power supply problem, however it may not be limited exclusively to the power brick and cord alone. Make absolutely sure all connections are clean, including all of the ports, cord connectors, and vents for cooling. Compressed air works
 well for this.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Since you've tried multiple power bricks you may be receiving overheat problems. You could try playing in a well-cooled area with lots of space for your console to breathe in air well with all of its ports.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Unfortunately repairs are around $100 if it is an internal problem; you may want to speak to

<p>Certain games will freeze your console because of in-game glitches. For example Battlefield 3 will freeze on my Xbox 360 because the game lasted so long, and when it gets to the end of the match it freezes.</p>

                    I am at my wits end and i dont know what to do anymore.A week ago my isp came to change our modem which has a speed of 500mbps,and it has dual band.My wireless adapter can connect to a 5ghz wifi network so thats what i did until 2-3 days later when i came
 from highschool and found out that it wouldnt connect me to the wifi network and everytime i tried to connect my wifi adapter would disable itself and enable again and it does this everytime i try to connect to that network,god bless my second router.I've
 searched the internet and i found out that if i disable windows defender i might be able to connect and it worked until the next day when it started happening again.I've read that if my wifi adapter driver is old it wont let me connect so i've updated it and
 it let me connect until today when the signal and power were at full i had lag without having a big ping(i lagged at&nbsp; 80 ms like on 600ms)so i restarted it all well and good until i started lagging again and now i cant connec

<br />
<br />1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase the computer?
<br />
<br />1b. Where or from whom did you purchase the computer?
<br />
<br />1c. Was the computer sold to you as a brand-new, never-been-used-by-anyone-else computer or as a used (refurbished) computer?
<br />
<br />2. Did the computer come with Win10 preinstalled, did you do a clean install of Win10, or did you upgrade a Win7 computer or a Win8.1 computer [&lt;=PICK ONE!] to Win10? 
<br />
<br />3. Who manufactured the computer (e.g., Dell; HP; Acer; Lenovo; ASUS)?
<br />
<br />4. Has a Norton application or a McAfee application EVER been installed on the computer since you bought it? 
<br />
<br />5. Have you ever run the Norton Removal Tool and/or the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool?
<br />
<br />6. What Version &amp; OS Build of Windows 10 is currently installed? 
<br />

<p>It seems i've&nbsp; fixed it for the moment.Until now i had my 2.4ghz and 5ghz connection share the same name and password and set the router up to filter my pc to 5ghz only,but i have changed the name of the 5ghz connection and password and allowed my pc to
 connect to both 2.4ghz and the 5ghz and it seems that this did the trick.However if this fails as well i will come back,now to respond to your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1a.I didnt bought it already finished i bought the pieces myself and assambled them myself.</p>
<p>1b.3-4 years ago,until last year i used my laptop but when my laptop finally died i started buying new parts such as ram and a gpu,at the time i couldnt afford to buy a new cpu and motherboard as well so i had to buy an old cpu and a old motherboard.</p>
<p>1c.My dad brought the case the cpu and motherboard were second-hand and&nbsp; the rest i bought brand new.</p>
<p>2.Clean install of win 10</p>
<p>3.Dell</p>
<p>4.I did installed norton several times but i ended up reinstalling the windows for various reasons.</p>
<p>5.Yes</p>
<p>6.Windows 10 Pro OS Build:15063.726</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Canon haven't produced one since Vista, I found a link to show how to download this and use it for W7 but I have now mislaid where I fied it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scanner is hardly used and I don't want to buy a new one and ditch this one if I can possibly avoid it, but I need a scanner capable of 60x60 slides and negatives which this 2400 will do.

<h2>            Minecraft Windows 10 not working</h2>
                    So I recently got a code for a free copy of Minecraft Windows 10 Edition. I redeemed it but It says I still need to unlock the full game. I don't know whether this is part of the copy or not, but when I look in my library I can't find the copy, and worst
 of all, I can't re-use the code. Either this is a problem you're fixing or not, but if worst comes to worst I would like to request another code for a free copy of the game.

<br />This issue requires contacting support, let them put you through a tier 2 support so they can investigate your Microsoft Account, because that is likely where the issue lies why you can't redeem it.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
</b></span><br />
<br />
<u><b>If you don't know where DMP files are located, here's how to get to them:</b></u><br />
<br />
&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Navigate to the %systemroot%\Minidump folder.<br />
&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copy any and all DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop and then zip up these files.<br />
&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upload the zip containing the DMP files to Skydrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply.<br />
<br />
<u><b>If you are going to use Skydrive but don't know how to upload to it, please visit the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive</a><br />
<br />
<b>Please note that any "cleaner" programs such as TuneUp Utilities, CCleaner, etc, by default will delete DMP files upon use.</b><br />
<br />
<u><b>If your computer is not generating DMP files, please do the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
1. Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
2. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
3. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log'.
<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
4. Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />

            Never did get the Dell AIO 966 to work with Windows 10.&nbsp; Dell says they have no drivers and will not work with Windows 10.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did however got the HP deskjet 1000 to work, which is just as old as my Dell.&nbsp; Doing this I lost my scanner also.&nbsp;&nbsp; There should
 be a solution to communicate with Dell printer older versions.&nbsp;&nbsp; If anyone has any suggestions would love to hear them.&nbsp; Thank you Sherri

<p>Solved it on mine by using Adwcleaner (downloaded from cnet). It found malware that Malwarebytes had missed.</p>
<p>So far so good. Printer came back and works okay.</p>

            Well, I have this printer.&nbsp; When I first upgraded to Windows 10 it worked.&nbsp; It worked for a couple of months with no problem.&nbsp; Then...one day I went to print and it didn't work.&nbsp; Total waste of time since then trying to get it to work.

            Same problem. Initially had trouble with Windows 8 and the Dell AIO 966 but Dell Support was able to rectify this. Upgraded to Windows 10 expecting more trouble but have been happily printing for months, then a few days ago nothing! The printer is still
 marked as Default but documents are not being sent through to it. I suspect interference from the two recent so-called 'critical updates' installed automatically by Microsoft just after Christmas. It is very frustrating to have something that is working perfectly
 well just stop. Online links via both Microsoft and Dell have been frustratingly unhelpful. Have tried re-installing from the original Dell CDs - worked before but not this time. Any suggestions?

    <title>Are the back paddles on an Elite controller unique buttons&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> montygoat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Are the back paddles on an Elite controller unique buttons&#63; </h2>
                    
<p>Are the back paddles unique buttons or do they need to be asigned to "standard" buttons?</p>
<p>Imagine a fantasy game where you can assign buttons to do "quick spells / potions", that's the usual way it's described, a way if assigning a couple of buttons to do stuff without going through the menus. If you have an Elite controller are the paddles on
 the back unique buttons so you could assign 4 more than a normal controller (assuming the game allows for this) or must you map the paddles to be one of the standard buttons?</p>
<p><br />
The game I am specifically interests in is Elite Dangerous which has multiple mappings depending on situation so for anyone with the game might know could you assign the back paddles to do the "standard" flight controls of the right stick and leave the right
 stick to permanently do the "docking / alternative" controls?</p>

            <p>They are not unique or extra buttons, you can only map them to function as other buttons, e.g. bottom left paddle = A, bottom right = B, etc.</p>
<p>As for the Elite Dangerous example, unfortunately the Right Stick cannot be mapped onto the paddles.</p>
<p>I know that's not what you want to hear but I hope it helps.</p>

<h2>            MCPE FRIEND INVITE TO WORLD IS GONE</h2>
                    <p>Ok, so one day, I went into MCPE. When I auto logged in, it crashed. It did that multiple times, but I was able to sign myself off finally. I checked my account on xbox website, and my entire profile page was blank. I signed off and gave it some time, and when I came back, everything slowly restored to normal... but MCPE&nbsp;didn't. I signed back in, everything seemed fine, but when I went into one of MY&nbsp;worlds and tried to invite someone online, my invite screen was blank!&nbsp;I have a bunch of friends, but MCPE&nbsp;was saying that I didn't have any! I'm really stressed right now.</p><p><br /></p><p>Please, is there anyone else with this problem?&nbsp;I looked around and I couldn't find anyone that had this happen to them!&nbsp;</p>

<p>You cannot schedule a download, but you can request a download on the website, and it will download the next time you turn your console on. If you turn your console on during those hours, then it will download then. You can even turn the console back off,
 and it will continue to download if you have enabled that feature.</p>

            <p>Not recommended and I believe you will encounter errors attempting to install it on a system with 1 GB of RAM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whether you have a logo PC or you’ve built your own PC, the recommendations for Windows 8 include:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 GHz or faster processor <br />
<strong>1 GB RAM (32-bit) or 2 GB RAM (64-bit)</strong> <br />
16 GB available hard disk space (32-bit) or 20 GB (64-bit) <br />
DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM 1.0 or higher driver </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One new element to Windows 8 is the requirement that Metro style applications have a minimum of 1024x768 screen resolution, and 1366x768 for the snap feature. If you attempt to launch a Metro style app with less than this resolution (e.g. 800x600, 1024x600)
 you will receive an error message. </p>

<h2>            Do I have a Legitimate copy of Win 7&#63; How can I verify my copy&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Windows 7</p>
<p>
</p><p>About 3-4 years ago I upgraded my desktop computer thru a dealer and purchased a copy of windows 7 at same time.&nbsp; With the up coming upgrade to Win 10, I question the validity of my Win 7 copy as I haven't received an invite to register for Win 10. My Win
 8.1 laptop received an invite for which I registered. My win 7 DVD appears authentic with windows 7 imprinted on the DVD as well as a Windows 7 Home Premium OEM Software sticker on the case with Product Key. The Product Key recorded in System (00359-OEM-8702963-54756)
 is different than that on the DVD&nbsp;<strong>removed product key</strong>&nbsp;Proof of License on sticker X15-53769. I need to know if I have a legitimate license, if yes then has my system recorded the correct information as I had to format &amp; reinstall Win 7 last
 year.</p>
<p>Do I have a Legitimate copy of Win 7? How can I verify my copy?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My stupidity in displaying product key, thanks to whoever edited it out. I have now validated my copy with Microsoft. Thanks to all replies info was useful. I will be more diligent about the info I post&nbsp;in the future.</p>

                    My screen seems to be drifting to the right on my monitor.&nbsp; This is especially noticable when I open an email; the up/down bar is partially obscured on the right.&nbsp; Then today I opened up a game and the screen is down and to the right 3/4 of an inch.&nbsp; I
 don't see any monitor controls and I can't seem to find out in the help in my computer.

            <p>Check the documentation that came with your monitor or Google the model number and visit the manufacturer's support site to obtain a user manual.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Possibly along the (bottom)&nbsp;edge look or feel for several small buttons, possibly next to the power. One should be for a menu - what you're looking for is the OSD section for vertical and horizontal position, some monitors have an auto setting also. Using
 the menu and the + and - buttons should allow you to position the display properly in the monitor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Family account shared in split household</h2>
                    <p>My sons had an Xbox 360 with one gamertag. I bought an Xbox One and used the original gamertag as the primary tag for a Family account. I added a Child account for my 9yo. Now his dad has purchased an Xbox One for them to have at his house and my son wants to play Fortnite when he's there on weekends. Dad set up a whole new profile, but my son was able to add my profile to the new Xbox One. However, we can't figure out how to pull up his Child account on Dad's Xbox. Is this possible? I can't find this specific information anywhere. He won't be playing both consoles at once because he can't be in two places at once, and we don't want to remove him from my Family account to add him to Dad's. We'd just end up with the same problem when he comes back here, and he's here most of the time. Is there any way to do this or is he just out of luck?</p>

<p>
</p><p>You should be able to sign into his account when you sign in &gt; Add Account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will then allow you to add his account on both Xbox Consoles and he will have the same family settings that you have chosen to set.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you can add his other dads account as a parent on Microsoft Family by sending him an invite?</p>

            <p>As SunkNath already said, your son can simply add his own account to the "Dad-Xbox-One" the same way he added your Profile. He just has to use the email you used to create the Child account.&nbsp;</p><p>Be Aware, that downloaded games are tied to the account that "purchases" the game ("purchasing" includes free games like Fortnite).</p><p><br /></p><p>There is a function on the Xbox One called "Home Console", where the owner of these purchased games can allow a single console to share the "owned" games to this console, so anyone can play the games on that console.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>In order for your son to be able to play Fortnite on any console he plays on, your son has to be the "owner" of the game.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>This also means, that games you purchased with the original Xbox 360 account, are not available to your son on the "Dad Xbox One".</p>

            <p>Thank you both! I only got a notification for ArminatorX's message, and I only just found that in my inbox.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>When he first added my profile at his dad's, I didn't remember that his had an email address tied to it, so we couldn't figure out how to add that account. We've since done some other things that brought that to my attention.&nbsp;Now I&nbsp;just have to remember (or reset) the password for his account....</p><p><br /></p><p>My son's account is the owner of the Fortnite game, so that shouldn't be a problem.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Do I have to add his dad to my family account? I'd really rather not. I do see the other console in my Microsoft account since he's added me.</p>

<h2>            Login to my App using Windows Hello</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>i want to ask if it is possible to use Windows Hello in my App. I want to run the App on a PC with my Admin-Account. Now i want other Users to be able to log into my App using their local Windows 10 Accounts with Windows Hello. Is this possible? So far i
 can only use Windows Hello to log the other Users local Accounts into Windows, but not into an App run on my Account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings and thanks in advance</p>

            Hi Ann,
<br />
<br />When you say your App, is this just an app on your account or are you coding an app and want to incorporate Windows Hello as a login mechanism?

            Hi Ann, that can be done, have a look at this article which explains how to do that . . .
<br />
<br />The coded example is a UWP app coded with a XAML front end and C# Code Behind, but I am sure that would transfer to whatever language you are developing in . . .

<p>Hello Dave,</p>
<p>
</p><p>after having worked through the example im not sure how to use this. From what i understand, this assumes that every user in the App is at their own personal PC with their own Windows Account currently logged in. But i want to try an App that runs on a single
 PC and lets multiple users access an App on said PC without changing the currently logged in Windows User. It would be an admin account running my App, but other authorized people should be able to use the app, after proofing who they are via Windows Hello.
 Not sure if i make myself clear. I m having a little bit of a hard time explaining my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greetings</p>
<p>Ann</p>

<p>ya I was, cause I am looking at a very very long time away from online matchmaking. &nbsp;and I just got the defiant map pack and was trying to get candy from a baby and kill 3 people with the skulls achievements out of the way so when I do lose my Gold in the
 next month. &nbsp;I could concentrate on assassinating that damn elite and finishing campaign solo on legendary. &nbsp;I did get the skulls achievement but couldn't find a stockpile game. &nbsp;hmm oh well... &nbsp; &nbsp;

<p>and yeah stockpile one is gonna be a little hard, better be ready with a full team of friends so this way you can al vote for that map/gametype, cause its somewhat hard to find one nowadays

<p>and for the campaign solo on legendary better use the plasma pistol and DMR/needle rifle combo

<p>Ya your right Chain I did. not going to set here be like the others and say oh no I didn't do anything wrong. &nbsp;I am innocent this is a mistake. &nbsp;no I did. &nbsp;but damn it. &nbsp;I say it's to strict. &nbsp;for one i didn't altar the game. two I what I did not affect
 an unwilling gamer in a negative way. &nbsp;three. &nbsp;All I did was manipulate a game that consisted of 3 of my friends an myself by using the giving guest option. &nbsp;in order to boost a couple achievements. &nbsp;that have no true effect on the outcome of my individual
 rank.. &nbsp;so I say to the possibility of a Bungie Employee 343i being in these forums. &nbsp;Chill out relax. &nbsp;It's going to be ok. &nbsp;It's only achievements. &nbsp;No need to be having chronic anal pain over this.&nbsp;
