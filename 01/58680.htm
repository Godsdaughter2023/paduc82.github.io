<p>Verify that you are you logged on using an account that has "Admin" priveleges. Also try creating a new account with "Admin" previledges and then try changing your power plan. If your new account works and the original one does not the that account has a
 corrupt profile, in which case you should run chkdsk and SFC /scannow.</p>
<p><strong>chkdsk:</strong> Open a command Prompt by right clicking and select 'Run as Administrator' and then at the command prompt type:&nbsp; chkdsk&nbsp; /f&nbsp; /r&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then press the enter key.</p>
<p><strong>Run the SFC&nbsp; /SCANNOW&nbsp; command.</strong> This will check and repair if necessary any critical Windows system files.</p>
<p>Click on Start/All programs/Accessories then <br />
Right click on Command Prompt option and select 'Run as administrator'.<br />
At the command prompt enter:&nbsp; SFC&nbsp; /SCANNOW</p>

<h3> barneycalhoun98  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do Microsoft resize Xbox 360 game covers&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When a Xbox or Xbox 360 game comes to Backward Compatibility, their covers are resized to a square, and resized to a 1080p or 4k wallpaper image (when you start the game). I have tried this myself, and the results come pixelated. When MS resizes game covers, the results come in HD (very good actually). How does MS do this??</p>

            <p><span>Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Did you make any changes on the computer prior to the issue?<br />
2. What is the exact error code?</span></p>
<p><strong><u><span>Method 1:</span></u></strong></p>
<p><span>You may follow the steps below and check if it helps you fix the update installation issue.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click on Start and click on Control panel.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Go to Program and Features.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Scroll down to Microsoft.Net Framework 4 Client Profile, right click it.</span></p>
<p><span>d. It will give you a choice of Uninstall/Change, click it.</span></p>
<p><span>e. Then, it will give a choice to Repair it, pick Repairit. It will take about 4-10 minutes to repair (with my PC) your experience may vary.</span></p>
<p><span>f. When completed, go to your update center, and update it again.</span></p>
<p><strong><u><span>Method 2:</span></u></strong></p>
<p><span>If the above steps do not help, access the link below and follow the steps in the article and try to uninstall all the versions of the .NET Framework on the computer, and then reinstall all
 the versions of the .NET Framework on the computer.</span></p>

<h2>            Cheaters pool</h2>
                    I was playing gta online with a friend the other day, when a guy joined the game with a billion bounty, thinking it was a one time thing we claimed it, then shared it, with each other. When we claimed it we thought it would just go after we logged off,
 so we messed about for a little while, but then I came back On and was put in a cheaters pool, i don't see why, I didn't do any modding or hacking, i just claimed a bounty, I didn't know it was a hack.

 year before release to fix all the issues.</p>

<p>Yeah man I totally agree, if gta was like this last year, there wouldn't be so many sales, it's really annoying! If I'm in it for a month I don't mind, but when it says in the bottom corner time remaining, mines "00.00.00" so I don't really know</p>

<h3> .m.m.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10 keeps wake up from sleep &#40;empty -lastwake &#38; wake-armed&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have already disabled scheduled wake up in power management, and every hardware that has the power wake option.<br />
</p>
<p>I have used CMD/Powershell with Admin rights to check powercfg /lastwake/waketimers and -devicequery wake_armed.</p>
<p>/lastwake just shows [0] on record and 0 for wake source, while wake_armed is none.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used Win7 Before Windows 10, and had most frequently used the Sleep Mode rather than shutdown. Now each time I put Win10 to sleep, it would just wake up in an hour or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is bothering me a lot, since I like my system start in an instant. I have a
<span style="color: rgba(84, 84, 84, 1)">ASUS P8Z68&nbsp;</span>board, and the bios startup is very slow (about 1~2 minutes), so regardless how fast Win8/10 had increased their startup speed, it doesn't matter to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:</p>
<p>I have not yet tested, but seems to be Teamviewer issue:</p>
<p>http://www.tomshardware.com/answers/id-2744717/teamviewer-computer-randomly-wake-sleep.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if this is the case, why would TV be able to bypass the system disabled scheduled wake up option?<br />

<h2>            Why cant my PC detect any wireless networks &#63;</h2>
                    Hi, i have a new&nbsp;broadband&nbsp;router from BT, all the other devices such as Iphone's, Ipad's can detect and connect to the network, but for some reason my computer cannot detect the network, in fact it cant detect any other networks at all. i thought it was
 my wireless adapter's drivers that needed to be updated but no that was not the case. I have a Desktop PC not a laptop, i dont know weather to buy a new wireless adapter to see if that works, but i have no idea why it is not detecting any networks, its not
 out of range for connectivity, my phone can pick up the signal so why cant my PC?

            <b>Absolutely follow Try*3 advice.&nbsp; And more.</b><br />
<br />
If you have a backup from before when this scammer was on your machine yoou can restore it to undo most of the corruption.<br />
<br />
<b>If not, follow Try*3 and Spirit for they are right (as usual) </b><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
See the following for additional information about this and what to do and how Microsoft operates:<br />

<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<u><b>If you got caught by these scammers (did any of the things they suggested and especially if you gave them access), I would also proceed as follows:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
It was not a good idea to give them access to your computer or any personal information, but if they had access to your computer or you visited a website they suggested or downloaded anything intentionally or unintentionally from a website or email, they could
 have infected you or made changes (or installed a way to gain access at their convenience in a background download occurring while they were showing you things and installing who knows what). Plus if they installed fee-based products (as is often the case
 since they negotiate deals with such vendors to split the profits on such “sales” – in effect, a kickback), they may have removed other products and when the service is cancelled what they installed may also be cancelled. In some cases, this may be good. In
 others, it may leave you without security protection depending on what they did. So you need to make sure that you eventually have proper firewall and real-time AV protection installed (and remove any they installed unless you did a clean install or System
 Restore as will be suggested shortly – then just confirm things are back to normal and the security is enabled or re-installed).<br />
</b></u><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
See this article: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/securitytipstalk/archive/2010/03/09/don-t-fall-for-phony-phone-tech-support.aspx?PageIndex=10. The article also includes links for things to do if you think you've been a victim of this type of scam and information
 about what Microsoft does and doesn't do so you won't be tricked again.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<u><i>Still, it doesn't hurt to be cautious. I believe the safest thing to do at this point is to backup your data and do a clean install or a restore to factory conditions (however you are setup to start from scratch after doing a full format of the hard drive).
 If you aren’t prepared for such a radical solution (even if it is the safest), please at least proceed as follows:</i></u><br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<i>Do a System Restore to before the call and giving them access. That will hopefully remove anything they may have installed and undo any changes they might have made. Also change your password and security questions with your email provider, network, ISP
 and perhaps others listed below (which a System Restore won’t do – they’ll still be the same until you revise them). There’s no telling what they could have done while they had access to your computer.<br />
</i><br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Then to make sure you weren't infected, please do the following;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
First, try the following programs if you haven't as they may help. I recommend you download, install, update, and run full scans with Malwarebytes:http://www.malwarebytes.org/ and SuperAntiSpyware:http://superantispyware.com/ and then run a full ESET online
 scan: http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner.<br />

&nbsp;<br />
<br />
P.S. In the meantime, I'd contact the bank or credit card company and dispute the charge to try and get my money back (if you actually paid anything - otherwise skip ahead to the P.P.S). Canceling the card is not enough to remove prior transactions that were
 charged to it without disputing them – and there may be more than just this one company if they installed products that cost money that will separately charge you (or already have). That may be simpler than asking the company or companies for a refund - but
 if the banks can't help you at this point, then of course try to get the refund from the company or companies (and keep asking to talk to the person's manager until you get as high as you can) and tell them if they refuse you'll notify the authorities and
 the company that hosts their website and take legal action (even if we know you won't because it's too much of a hassle, they won't be certain).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
How far you want to go in terms of changing all your other passwords, pins, logon information, account information (including all your financial data if on the computer) and such is a decision you need to make for yourself. They are not all related to resolving
 the computer issues and your best bet outside of anything computer-related is to contact those companies or the local authorities and see what they advise (or seek out an attorney for advice).<br />

<h2>            asus external bllu-ray burner unrecognized after windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>After updating to windows 10 my asus external [USB 3.0]&nbsp;12x Blu-ray burner [BW-12D1S-U]&nbsp;is no longer recognized or found (~unknown device usb error).</p>
<p>I have tried the obvious things:</p>
<p>Restarting both.</p>
<p>Reconnecting to another usb 3.0 port</p>
<p>Exploring devices in settings.</p>
<p>Re-adding device through settings/add</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where I have run into a wall is in attempting to reinstall the driver.</p>
<p>I have downloaded the most recent driver suite&nbsp;from ASUS, and windows 10&nbsp;says it is an untrusted publisher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then attempted to right click- general tab- security and&nbsp;checked "unblock" and then tried again to reinstall-&nbsp;However, windows 10&nbsp;will not let me create the directory because the publisher is still untrusted &amp; blocked.&nbsp; I have contacted ASUS without a
 solution thus far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any work arounds to a blocked driver/ software suite?</p>
<p>Can I revert restore to windows 8 to regain&nbsp;productivity?</p>
<p>

<h2>            Can I delete my original user account in Windows 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been struggling to find an answer about the problems I am having with the Windows Store and Store Broker using up all my CPU and not downloading anything anyway. I have tried everything on every website ON EARTH and nothing works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I sign in on a new local account I set up I have no such problems. CPU at 0 percent if nothings happening which I find a good thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when I turn on my computer I would like to sign in immediately to another account without opening my fun microsoft account. IE make another administrator account that is the MASTER account if you like.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, is there a way to do this? and if not:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I delete the original microsoft account I set the computer up with? Preferably without resetting the whole thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for any advice</p>

            Hi
<br />
<br />Thank you for reaching out to us. I'm so sorry you are facing issues!
<br />My name is Margarida, I'm an Independent Advisor. I love helping other users in the Community by sharing my experience with Microsoft products. 
<br />
<br />I am sorry for that. As per Microsoft, Firefox is not included in Skype for web's system requirements
<br />- "Microsoft Edge and the latest versions of Chrome. Skype for Web is not supported on mobile phones or tablets. However, the Skype app is available to download for those devices."
<br />- "Note: Users on Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 may be able to sign in but may not receive the full experience of Skype for Web."

<br />
<br />I understand it's probably not the answer you were looking for, but I hope you'll at least clarify it. If you have any further questions, I'm here to help.
<br />
<br />I wish you a great day/night :)!

            Hi Luu 
<br />
<br />For some unknown reason Microsoft only officially supports Skype for Web App on Edge and Chrome. There does not seem to be an official reason as to why this is the case, like security concerns or whether this is because the new Edge browser will be based on Chromium . . 
<br />
<br />However, as you have realized you can spoof your user agent string in any browser and the Skype for Web App still works, so logically there is no reason for this decision by Microsoft . . .

            But why my firefox just works fine if i just do a small change which is changing my user agent? It's not about you are not supporting firefox, but you guys hate firefox users?<br />

            I doubt it has anything to do with bias and everything to do with what they choose to support. This way they can focus their time/resources supporting the majority, limiting their scope. They probably prohibit other browsers to avoid getting requests to
 fix random things in an XYZ browser. If changing the user agent works, and everything works properly, then I suggest using that workaround. If not everything works, then you understand why.

    <title>Cannot restore Windows 10 image backup - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnmeyer77  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot restore Windows 10 image backup</h2>
                    <p>I have read, literally, hundreds of posts about Windows 10 failing to successfully restore from a Windows 10 image backup, but in all those posts, I have not found a solution. I did a Windows 10 image backup, and now that my drive has failed, I cannot restore
 that image to my new drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I did an image backup, using Windows 10's backup software. I created the image on an external USB drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The old disk drive failed. I replaced the drive and did a fresh install of Windows 10 on that drive so that it would be formatted and partitioned correctly. However, I don't want a clean install, because I want all my programs and data back they way they
 were before the drive failure. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What I've Done</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>So, after installing Windows 10 on the new drive, I selected the backup and restore option, chose to restore from my image, and when the computer rebooted to the repair console, I chose to "repair my computer."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I keep getting the message that "Windows cannot find a system image on this computer." This is crazy because if I select the option to install a driver for my USB drive, I can browse all my drives and see the USB backup drive and all the image files
 on it. What's more, I can use external utilities to read the files. Everything is intact and readable.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The WindowsImageBackup folder is directly off the root of the drive, and I can use third-party utilities to read the VHDX image files. However, those utilities cannot correctly restore the filesso that the disk is bootable (I've tried).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone must have a solution to this, because it has apparently been a bug as far back as Windows 8. The number of posts about this problem, both in this forum and elsewhere, is staggering.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I did everything I was supposed to do (created a backup) and now in my hour of need, Microsoft has let me down. I have backed up and restored dozens of computers over the years using Acronis Trueimage, so I am quite familiar with image backup and restore.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to work around this Microsoft Windows 10 bug? </p>

            <p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As per the issue description you are unable to perform system restore using system image. The issue could be if the service which are responsible for the backup are either stopped or some settings with the backup get messed up.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I&nbsp;would suggest you to try following methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span><br />
<strong><span>Please make sure that the services required for backup are running and set to automatic.
</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. Press <strong><span>Windows + R keys</span></strong>, type <strong><span>services.msc
</span></strong>in run window and press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span>b. In services list, locate the following services and check if they are running.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>- File history service.</span></strong><span><br />
<strong><span>- Volume shadow copy service.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>c. If they are not running, right click the service and click <strong><span>properties.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>d. Please select "<strong><span>Startup type</span></strong>" as "<strong><span>Automatic</span></strong>" and then click "<strong><span>Start</span></strong>" to manually start the service.</span></p>
<p><span>e. Click <strong><span>apply </span></strong>and <strong><span>ok.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Please follow the above steps for both the services.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If it does not help, use method 2.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Perform Clean Boot.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1 won't work and is irrelevant because, if you have actually ever performed an image restore operation, the Microsoft restore is done by re-booting using a system recovery disk. Therefore there is no services.msc to run, no registry, etc. The environment
 is 100% controlled and exactly the same from one computer to the next. Put another way, in case you are not understanding, Windows 10 is not actually running. Instead it is (I think) Windows PE, or something like it, that is actually on that recovery USB stick
 or DVD used for the restore. </p>
<p>
</p><p>There is nothing that can be configured.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the clean boot, apparently you didn't read all the way through my initial post. If you re-read it you will find that I did EXACTLY what you suggested: I installed Windows 10 from scratch and then attempted to do the restore using that clean setup.
 Once again, this completely eliminates the possibility that some other program is interfering, or that Windows is missing some service or component.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>It is a massive problem, and one of the nastiest because it means that people who are relying on Microsoft to protect their data are being let down in their hour of need.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am already recommending to all of my clients that they avoid Windows 8 &amp; 10. This absolutely cements that. I have been buying all my computers with Windows 7. When that becomes impossible, I will finally have to look for other alternatives, probably Ubuntu.
 I was there when Windows was first announced in 1983, and very much in the middle of things when Windows 3.0 came out in May 1990. I've seen it evolve -- almost always improving in each release -- and never thought it would turn into such a horrible mess.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a person cannot rely on the software to perform basic operations like backup and restore, that person will not use that software, even if it is being given away. Windows 10 costs nothing, but it is overpriced.</p>
