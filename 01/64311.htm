<h2>            Problems in Chrome after Nov 11 &#38; 12 Windows Updates</h2>
                    <p>I'm having problems in Chrome after the Nov 11th &amp; 12th updates - </p>
<p>&nbsp; Windows Update (KB3107998, KB3102810)</p>
<p>&nbsp; Security Update (KB3097877, 3101746, 3101722, 3101246, 3100773, 3092601, 3081320, 3100213, 3097989)</p>
<p>&nbsp; .Net Security Update (KB3098781, 3097996)</p>
<p>&nbsp; Office 2010 (too many to list at this point, let me know if relevant) </p>
<p>
</p><p>What was happening is that I was getting ERR_NETWORK_ACCESS_DENIED and ERR_QUIC_PROTOCOL_ERROR.&nbsp; After a search on my phone I found that it was probably a firewall issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>11/12/15 -&nbsp;Went into the firewall to allow Google Chrome through and completely rebooted</p>
<p>
</p><p>This did allow me to access pages in Chrome, but none were working properly.&nbsp; Pictures didn't load, formatting was screwy, links didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I had to get work done, I switched over to use IE (I'm beginning to think that this was the plan all along).</p>
<p>
</p><p>11/13/15 - at the suggestion of another help page, I removed Google Chrome from the firewall access, powered off completely, booted up, re-allowed Chrome through the firewall, powered off again, booted up.&nbsp; Same problems with Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have decided to wait to upgrade to Windows 10 as I was hoping to avoid a lot of the bugs and conflicts (I'm not being paid to be a beta tester, nor do I have the patience).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Windows Home Premium, service pack 1 on a Dell XPS L702X with a 64 bit OS.&nbsp; I also have McAfee Anti-virus&nbsp; v18.0.5011 (updated 11/13/15), SecurityCenter v14.0.5120 (upd 10/12/15), Personal Firewall v15.0.5006 (upd 10/6/15)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any other information that is pertinent? </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to refer to the Microsoft Help Articles given below and check if that helps.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or
 an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may
 temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the
 computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.
</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 Mail App - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> samson joe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Mail App</h2>
                    <p>Can someone please tell me where to go in my Windows 10 Mail App settings to access the option where I can select how long my "inbox" e-mails can be shown and saved in the "inbox" before it automatically deletes on it's own. Here's my problem- when I go
 into my Windows 10 Mail App Inbox alot of my "older" e-mals are not there any more! I can't find them etc. I never deleted any of them! Now, if I log into my e-mail acct with Outlook.com I can still see "all" of my e-mails, new and old from&nbsp;weeks. months,
 years ago. It's frustrating with the Windows 10 Mail App when I go into my "inbox" to look for an older e-mail and it's not there any more! So, can anyone please help me in solving this problem!I'm pretty sure there is a setting in there where I can set it
 where my e-mails wont be automatically be deleted by a certain time frame. &nbsp;I would actually rather set it where non of my "inbox" e-mails do not get automatically delete itself after a period of time. I would rather delete any e-mails manually if I dont need
 them any more. Plus, what is the maxium number of e-mails that Windows 10 Mail App will hold?&nbsp; Thanks!

            Hi Little Ben,<br />
<br />
You may try this:<br />
<br />
i.&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to the iTunes folder. In Windows Vista, the default location is: \username\Music\iTunes.<br />
ii.&nbsp; Right click and select properties. <br />
iii. Uncheck the Read-only box. <br />
iv. Click Apply; click OK to change all the subfolders. Click OK.<br />
v.&nbsp; Now check and see if you can open iTunes. <br />
<br />
If this does not help, then you need to contact Apple Support <a href="http://www.apple.com/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Hi Shane,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The svchost.exe is exactly that: a host for other 'services'. So many use that. Don't know anything specific about that -k UnistackSvcGroup parameter but it certainly is not something you should worry about. For more info, try Bing or Google or better yet
 MSDN.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>So, in your opinion, you think it is OK that new things can show up and run and there is nothing to worry about?&nbsp; What is I sent you a dll called AllowMyToRemoteControlYourPc, update the CurrentVersion/Svchost and added

</span><span>AllowMyToRemoteControlYourPc&nbsp; <br />

Would you worry then? I think you assume there is no way for badguys to update Schhost runs, but here is a link on how to do it.&nbsp;</span>https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30554180/how-to-run-a-dll-as-a-service&nbsp;<span><br />

                    When I turn on my computer this block shows up instantly. States that when a solution is found I will be notified. Problem started last week. Before that, never had any problems. Computer will run for a couple of mins. then start freezing up ( pointer
 won't move) then sometimes it will move, then freeze again. Then it will shut down &amp; display : operating system not found in left hand corner of screen. I'm not really computer literate, so be gentle.

<p><span><span>Hi Martyp1234,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Answers.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span><span>Which version of Windows Vista is installed on your computer?</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span><span>Have you installed any software or updates before this issue occurred?</span></span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>It seems to have bad sectors on the hard drive and memory.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>I have few steps which might help you.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Method 1</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Perform a System File Checker [SFC] scan on the computer which will replace the missing
 or corrupt files.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To do this, follow the steps given below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click the Start button</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. From the Start Menu, Click all programs followed by Accessories</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. In the Accessories menu, Right Click on the Command Prompt option</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. From the drop down menu that appears, Click on the 'Run as administrator' option</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. If you have the User Account Control (UAC) enabled, you will be asked for authorization
 prior to the command prompt opening. You may simply need to press the Continue button if you are the administrator or insert the administrator password etc.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6. In the Command Prompt window, type: sfc /scannow and then press Enter</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>7. A message will appear stating that 'The system scan will begin'</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>8. Be patient because the scan may take some time</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>9. If any files require replacing SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your
 Vista DVD for this process to continue</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>10. If everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message "Windows
 resource protection did not find any integrity violations"</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>11. After the scan has completed, close the command prompt window, restart the computer
 and check.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For further reference check the link given below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>How to repair the operating system and how to restore the operating system configuration
 to an earlier point in time in Windows Vista</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936212" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936212</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Method 2<br />
</span></span><span><span>Check if the hard disk has no errors. To do this, follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Open Computer by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Computer.
<br />
</span></span><span><span>2. Right-click the hard disk drive that you want to check, and then click Properties.<br />
</span></span><span><span>3. Click the Tools tab, and then, under Error-checking, click Check Now.&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password
 or provide confirmation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span><span>To automatically repair problems with files and folders that the scan detects, select Automatically fix file system errors. Otherwise, the disk check will
 simply report problems but not fix them.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span><span>To perform a thorough disk check, select Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors. This scan attempts to find and repair physical errors on the hard
 disk itself, and it can take much longer to complete. </span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span><span><span>To check for both file errors and physical errors, select both Automatically fix file system errors and Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Click Start.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For more information refer the below link:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>Check
 your hard disk for errors<br />

<h2>            Nvidia GeForce 8500GT Blue Screen nvlddmkm.sys error</h2>
                    
<p>original title:&nbsp;Nvidia GeForce 8500GT BSOD nvlddmkm.sys error</p>
<p>Any time I try to install video drivers, I get the same BSOD pointing to nvlddmkm.sys. I have tried all kinds of drivers from the default one provided with Win7. All give exactly the same fault. Including driver updates and elimination of older versions
 of the drivers have been suggested. None of them work.<br />
I am now running on Standard VGA Graphics Adapter. My system has never had any problems running Windows XP. Does anyone know what's causing this and if there's a fix?</p>

<p>First do use trhe driver cleanup tool, instead use add/remove option to uninstall the NVIDIA software.</p>
<p>Next look in the windows/system32/drivers folder and rename nvlddmkm.sys to<br />
nvlddmkm.sys.old.</p>
<p>Reboot and locate the NVIDIA folder and delete it.</p>
<p>Now install the latest driver.</p>

            <p>Because it would involve reverse engineering the DS system it would have to be officially sanctioned by Nintendo. As that is an active environment still being sold an emulator is going to have some impact on their market so it is unlikely to be seen soon.</p>

<p>I guess doing a simple Google search was out of the question. Try to type Microsoft Zune Support and you should see the first link pop up as this&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CGsQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zune.net%2Fen-us%2Fsupport%2F&amp;ei=3y0yUIn4DOHs0gGm2YHIDw&amp;usg=AFQjCNFYSfTzy0mUvz5JzsOdem2pIpbZDA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.
 It's also it's own link at the top right of Microsoft Zune's own website Zune.net - "<strong><a href="http://www.zune.net/en-US/support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Support</a></strong>". Contact them and simply request a refund, they offer refunds to people who have trouble with getting
 the videos started and of course if you were charged twice.</p>

    <title>How to disable safe mode booting in windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to disable safe mode booting in windows 7</h2>
                    <div>Is there a sure way to disable safe mode booting in windows 7? My kids tried to use it to install programs without my permission. I have to find a way to disable it. I know that this means I will not have access to safe mode when I need,
 but I am fine with that. The worst case is to re-install the whole OS, and I have periodical back up on the system so I will re-install OS when necessary.<br />
<br />
The search on the internet is in-conclusive. Some say it can't be done. Some point to a commercial tool which some says works while others say not working.<br />
</div>
<div>
<div>Of course all accounts on my PC&nbsp;have password.</div>
<br />
Some point to this way which I am not too sure will work for sure:<br />
Enable 'Administrator' account and enable password on it, so when it goes into safe mode, it always requires password.<br />
</div>
<div>I have already done this and 'Administrator' account now requires a password in safe mode booting. Is this a sure way to impose security on safe mode? Or are there still ways to circumvent the security in safe mode?<br />
<br />
Any authoritative answer?<br />
<br />
Thanks a lot.</div>

            <p>Your Admin account is always required to authorise installations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you already had a password on it then that password would still have been required when booting into Safe Mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your other users have standard user-level accounts then they cannot abuse Safe Mode unless they have discovered what your password is or if they know about booting into another environment using a USB/DVD connected to the system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- - - - - - - - - -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It sounds like you have enabled the Built-In Admin account [often called Default Admin].&nbsp; This is not necessary and it is best to keep that account pristine [any user profile can get corrupted in use and you might need to rely on using the Built-In Admin
 to rescue you one day].&nbsp; Create a conventional 2nd admin account for <em>normal</em> emergencies - if just one admin account exists then it might be that one that suffers user profile corruption; recovery [though possible &amp; not too difficult to do] can be
 a bit nerve-racking the first time.&nbsp; Having a conventional spare Admin account ready means that you can get in using that to sort out whatever has gone wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- - - - - - - - - - - -</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only extra step you should consider is setting the BIOS to be password-protected.&nbsp; This needs careful consideration as losing that password would cripple you.&nbsp; Setting the BIOS password then setting the system to boot from the HDD-only prevents your
 little darlings from booting from an external DVD/USB and gaining complete control over the system despite whatever you have set up in user accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This precaution will force you to go back to the BIOS &amp; enable booting from a DVD/USB on those occasions when you need to do so [during troubleshooting&nbsp;/ repairs].&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The BIOS passwords that are possible&nbsp;&amp; the significance of each one varies between PC makers&nbsp;and they all use different names for them&nbsp;[my Dell has 3 possible passwords in the BIOS &amp; each one does a slightly different job].&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Look through your BIOS [often this is done by pressing F2 during bootup but your manual will tell you] to see what BIOS passwords can be set up, what each one does &amp; what the relationships between them are - one of them might be a master password, one might
 control what you can boot from [HDD/USB/DVD] &amp; one might be a password for&nbsp;HDD access.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Personally, I have the bootup password set so it can only be booted from the HDD &amp; I have the master password set so nobody can get in the BIOS &amp; change the first password.&nbsp; This does mean that someone could remove the hard drive from my PC &amp; read its contents
 in another PC but I accept that risk.&nbsp; This combination means that there are no extra passwords to remember during normal use [only when I want to boot from a USB].</p>

            <p>I enabled the built in 'Administrator' account because it seems that this is the reason that my kid gained access through safe mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I already have 'admin' account set up for admin. I can't figure out how my kid gained administrator access, Searching of&nbsp;the internet seems to suggest that 'Administrator' account will become passwordless in safe mode if it's not enabled (which is the case
 by default). So I enabled it and add a password to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now based on what you said, it's possible that my kid gained admin right through booting from DVD.&nbsp; But then how can he install program when booting from DVD? I thought that you need to boot from HDD to be able to install program. Are you saying that you
 can boot from DVD, then add another 'admin' account, then boot from DVD and use that admin account to install program?</p>

            When you attach a password to any admin account then that password will stick in any mode. However, there are means and ways of promoting an ordinary account to admin level. The technique is based on booting the machine with some boot CD. You can prevent
 this like so:
<div>
<ol>
<li>Check the children's account. Demote it if it is at admin level.</li><li>Get into the BIOS setup.</li><li>Find out which key is used to invoke the boot selection menu (it is often the Del or the F12 key), then disable this selection while still in the BIOS.</li><li>Check if this measure is effective.</li><li>Get back into the BIOS setup and set an admin password.</li><li><b>Carefully note this password</b>.</li></ol>
<div>On most BIOSs this measure will prevent users from changing the boot device, thus preventing the use of boot CDs or boot flash disks.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If this is a laptop and if you forget the password then you have to return the machine to a service center to have the password reset. If it is a desktop then removing the motherboard battery for 10 minutes will do the trick. If your kids are smart then
 they will soon figure it out for themselves . . .</div>

            <p>Hello Try*3,</p>
<p>Please pardon the interruption, but in your response you state, " if just one admin account exists then it might be that one that suffers user profile corruption; recovery [though possible &amp; not too difficult to do] can be a bit nerve-racking the first time.".
 I am in need of that nerve-racking method, I think.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you would be good enough to see my thread in the 'Other Windows Apps by Microsoft'&nbsp;forum, "Control Panel Apps "Not Found" ", I would be extremely appreciative.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you in advance,</p>
<p>Regards,</p>

            <p>You were right to put a password on the Built-In Admin account.&nbsp; As you had already done so I thought my reference to making sure you had admin account passwords would not contradict you.&nbsp; For the avoidance of doubt, I agree that having a password on that
 and all other admin accounts is worthwhile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was just trying to explain that it was worth having that account disabled so it has little chance of being affected by any user profile corruption - such corruption can occur in use.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Built-In Admin's&nbsp;password remains in force even though it has been
 disabled&nbsp;&amp; that password would be required if you ever decided that you needed to re-enable it [or they tried to do so behind your back].&nbsp; You can test this yourself.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your own Admin account ever suffered from user profile corruption then you would have&nbsp;a problem.&nbsp; That's why I suggested creating&nbsp;a second one as a fallback.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you boot from a DVD/USB then you are not in Windows 7 but are in whatever OS is on that DVD/USB.&nbsp; Your accounts are only of significance&nbsp;to Windows 7 so if you have booted into something else then you have no protection.&nbsp; You might boot into a Linux [OS]
 CD, for example.&nbsp; [You are also booting into a different OS if you ever boot up using your Windows 7 Installation DVD/USB, your Windows 7
<em>System repair disk</em> or the recovery CD of a backup-restore/antivirus utility].&nbsp; Personally, I would not know how to use Linux or anything else to alter the Windows 7 settings&nbsp;or installed applications but, at the very least, all your HDD's content would
 be exposed for unregulated manipulation limited only by the nature of whatever OS has been booted into.&nbsp; But I do know, again just for example, how to boot into the Windows 7 Installation DVD/USB&nbsp;or the Windows 7
<em>System repair disk</em> in order to get in &amp; reset the Built-In Admin account [you'll read about this in the link I gave you before - you will probably be as shocked as I was when I first found out about this which is why I then investigated how to avoid
 the risk - the article starts at <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-security/a-guide-to-recovering-from-lost-passwords-or-other/598818cf-b57e-4cba-a1b5-a75fdd424529">
A guide to recovering from lost passwords or other faults preventing...</a> and the earlier link was to the section of it dealing with a specific topic within the article].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- - - - - - - - -</p>
<p>So, in short, having a password on all the admin accounts should include the Built-In Admin account even though it has been disabled.&nbsp;&nbsp;That prevents people abusing Safe Mode.&nbsp;
<em>Leaving the Built-In Admin disabled just reduces the risk of its user profile becoming corrupted through usage.&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;To prevent other, completely unregulated access, you would need to prevent booting into other OS and therefore would need to prevent booting
 into&nbsp;other drives such as DVD/USBs.</p>

I have never seen an exception in desktop PCs. I should actually call it a "CMOS" password. The BIOS is a ROM (Read-Only Memory). It cannot store any passwords.

<p><span><span>Hello WL2149,</span></span></p>
<span><span><span>
<p><span><span>Standard users have limited administrative privileges and user rights—they cannot install or uninstall applications that install into %systemroot%, change
 system settings, or perform other administrative tasks<br />
</span></span><br />
You will have to be logged in to one of the Administrative account to be able to change the account Type from Standard to Administrator.</p>
</span></span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Login to one of the Administrator account and follow the below steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Open User Accounts by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking User Accounts and Family Safety, clicking User Accounts, and then
 clicking Manage Another Account.<span>&nbsp; </span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Click the account you want to change, and then click Change the account type.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Select the account type you want, and then click Change Account Type.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Here is an article that will give you information on how to change the account type:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Change-a-users-account-type" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Change-a-users-account-type</span></a><span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Here is an article that will give you information on ‘Understanding and Configuring User Account Control in Windows Vista’</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc709628(WS.10).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc709628(WS.10).aspx</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>So I suggest that you login to one of the Administrator account and install the programs, these will be available on all the accounts.<br />
<br />
The parental controls built into Windows Vista help parents determine which games their children can play, which programs they can use, and which websites they can visit—and when. Parents can restrict computer use to specific times and trust that Windows Vista
 will enforce those restrictions, even when you are away from home. <br />
<br />
Here is an article that will give you information on how to setup Parental controls:

<p>Sir i don't understand. What is mean by subsequent patches. That means can i get the app store during windows update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sir is there any possible way that windows update option find the app store is missing and install it itself during update. If i check the update manually it only shows defender update only. When it will check that app store is missing and ask me to install

            1809 had few bugs and was paused for roll out. Windows update option will not set the app store missing problem.
<br />
<br />A repair upgrade can do the trick. But if you do repair upgrade, you will lose the flexiblity to go back to 1803. So, take an appropriate call. Better would be to go back to 1803.
<br />
<br />Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

                    <p>Im not sure what I am doing wrong. When I switch between say Netflix and my Apps or the settings on the Xbox&nbsp;One&nbsp;X, the sound bar turns off automatically. I&nbsp;have the Bravia sync turned off, the HDMI&nbsp;CEC on the soundbar is off.. but for some reason, the sound bar will turn off when i switch between apps. I&nbsp;thought maybe it was because it was connected to the HDMI/ARC&nbsp;input, so I switched the input it was connected to, but it continued to happen. I&nbsp;played around with my PS4, Cable&nbsp;Box and&nbsp;Fire TV but it only happens on the Xbox One X.&nbsp; Is there an option somewhere to tell the Xbox dont send out a signal to turn on/off.&nbsp;I&nbsp;thought I had all of those set to off... but I&nbsp;am obviously missing something.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Upgrading to Windows 10 from OEM Toshiba Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I have a Toshiba laptop with Windows 8.1 bundled as stock with an OEM version from Toshiba. I hate to say it's the most awful version of Windows I've used and I'm thinking it's maybe down to Toshiba. I was wondering where do I stand on the Windows 10
 upgrade? I know it's free to all 7,8 and 8.1 Users within the first year of release but what's the status with OEM versions since they're tied to the motherboard? Can I completely install it fresh without a key and will it override everything Toshiba has put
 on it including the recovery partition? I'm just so confused but hoping Windows 10 will fix a lot of issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main issues I've had are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>WiFi crashes and goes to 'limited'. I have to disable the driver in Device Manager and hard reboot by holding the power button</p>
<p>Excessive crashing and slowness which it shouldn't since it's a fairly new laptop I only got it last October and it has moderate specs to keep it running at a nice rate since I don't do much on it, I rarely even use Word I use Google Docs for writing the
 only heavy applications I have are PhotoShop and iTunes but it just seems so sluggish even when opening search</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help and information given,</p>

</p><p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upgrade version (Retail):</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p>OEM :</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM licenses </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the end user license agreement:</em></p>
<p>15. UPGRADES. To use upgrade software, you must first be licensed for the software that is eligible for the upgrade. Upon upgrade, this agreement takes the place of the agreement for the software you upgraded from. After you upgrade, you may no longer use
 the software you upgraded from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>17. TRANSFER TO ANOTHER COMPUTER. a. Software Other than Windows Anytime Upgrade. You may transfer the software and install it on another computer for your use. That computer becomes the licensed computer. You may not do so to share this license between
 computers. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Should I upgrade my existing version of Windows to Windows 10 Preview?</strong></p>
<span><span>
<p>Since Microsoft made available the first pre-release build of Windows 10 in early October 2014, there has been some misunderstanding that this is not a product you should use to replace a production installation of Windows such as Windows 8 or 7 or Vista.
 Instead, if you must test it on a single machine, the best recommendation is to create a partition or have an a spare hard disk ready where you can install it. Windows 10 in its current pre-release state will expire and at the same time, it is unfinished work.
 So if you must evaluate it, the best way is by installing it beside your commercial installation of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do choose to upgrade your existing version of Windows to Windows 10, please be warned, it will make your recovery partition in operable, requiring that you have separate recovery media for reinstallation if necessary.</p>

My recollection of this capability goes back to Windows ME which included the option to uninstall the operating system and restore to a previous version of Windows (I was running Windows 98 SE at the time). Microsoft has supported this functionality in its NT based versions of Windows too, albeit not in a seamless way. The ability to restore a Windows 8.1 installation to Windows 7 required knowing some command line operations that in some instances didn't guarantee the process would go according to plan. With Windows 10, it seems Microsoft has listened and has provided a welcome option to its recovery tools to make it easy to uninstall Windows 10 and go back to your previo

<p>
</p><p>I am unable upgrade to Windows 10 Home, version 1511, 10586. I have run the update from Windows update and it fails at 40% with the error:</p>
<p>Windows could not configure one or more system components. To install Windows, restart the computer and the restart the installation.</p>
<p>I have used the Media Creation Tool and I get the same error.</p>
<p>I have run countless SFC scans. I always receive the message: </p>

<p>So from here I have tried to run DISM to repair my system.<br />
Now I receive this error:</p>

 It says I'm trying to install a different edition than I'm currently using. I've been on hold with M$ support for over FOUR hours! I cannot find any solution. The windows update says I'm up to date which is of course incorrect. Install date was 8/8/15. My
 laptop is on 1511 but my desktop won't update. Please tell me how to fix this! I'm not trying to use any language packs or anything. Using Win10 Pro and I downloaded the "Win10" ISO from the media creation tool. Every version I've tried doesn't work. My only
 option at this point is a clean install which is unacceptable! Please HELP!</span>

<br />
1. Are you using wired or wireless connection?<br />
2. Did you make any changes on the computer prior to the issue?<br />
<br />
<strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><b><br />
</b><br />
<strong><span>Temporarily turn off firewall on each machine and check</span></strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off</a><br />
<br />
<strong><span>Note:</span></strong> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats.Â In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily
 disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.<br />
<br />
<strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong> If the issue persists I would suggest you to try the steps in the link mentioned below and check if it helps.<br />

<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:
</span></b><span>Try connecting the external hard drive in different USB port or try connecting the hard drive in different 64-bit computer and check if you are able to access it.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:
</span></b><span>Also check if it is detected in disk management.</span></p>

<strong><span>b. T</span></strong>ype diskmgmt.msc
<strong><span>in start search box and hit enter.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>c.
</span></strong><strong><span>Check whether the external drive is detected.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Try to run the hardware troubleshooter and check what the issue is

<p><b><span>Method 4:</span></b><span> If the issue persists then I would
 suggest you to update an USB driver, the following links will help you to update USB driver.

<h2>            Cannot create system repair disk - error 0x80070057</h2>
                    When I run recdisk.exe, I get "System repair disk could not be created. The parameter is incorrect.(0x80070057)"<br />
<br />
I have verified that the CD/DVD drive works flawlessly from explorer.<br />
<br />
I have checked (by copying) the contents of the Recovery folder in the root of C. The contents are :<br />
Recovery -&gt; d5a96a4c-c58e-11de-894d-e667195c4e90 -&gt; boot.sdi and Winre.wim<br />
<br />
I have also verified that the main drive has a 100MB System Reserved partition<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what my problem may be ?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />

<p>The F8 Was not needed.&nbsp; Just follow below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What Debbie posted was not exactly what I encounter.&nbsp; I post my comments/clarfications [in brackets]</p>
<p>You may try booting your sytem up on the Windows 7 installation disc. <br />
[must pwr off or restart to main DVD/CD R/W you have as bootable]</p>
<p>When it gets to the main setup window, click on Repair from the lower left corner.<br />
[don't worry just follow next continue till you see her "Repair"]<br />
Select Command Prompt from the main Repair menu.<br />
[works fine, but note your drive letters will be all different than normal]&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the command prompt type in "recdisc", then ENTER.<br />
[works fine]</p>
<p>You'll get the popup to choose which drive letter to create the Recovery disc to.<br />
[you must determine which drive is the DVD R/W (if you have 2).&nbsp; Now the only one my system would write to was the one that had the Win 7 installation disk in. {I actually switched to each drive letter and did a "dir" to see what was on each drive.} So remove
 your Win 7 installation disk &amp; put in the blank DVD as bleow]</p>
<p>Have a clean DVD in the Dvd drive - select start.</p>
<p>This should get your System repair disc created.</p>
<p>[This worked fine for me with the modifications.]</p>
<p>Thanks Debbie</p>
