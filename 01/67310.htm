<h2>            Watching Youtube or Twitch randomly disables sound and access to Start Menu, Cortana</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed Windows 10 from Windows 7, and have encountered a problem where the sound randomly shuts off when watching Youtube or twitch.tv videos or streams.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the sound shuts off (with no indication other than the abrupt lack of sound), it seems impossible to re-enable it, and Device Manager shows sound drivers updated and working just fine. The lack of sound is not just for Youtube or Twitch, but rather
 for all apps (even default windows sounds were missing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In conjunction with this, some default icons on the taskbar (Start Menu, Cortana, Wireless Status, Volume Control) cannot be left+clicked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes the sound would randomly start up again, but accessibility to the taskbar icons are not restored, and loss of sound continues to happen randomly after.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is: Has anyone else encountered this problem? If so, what might be the cause, and what fixes are available?</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: The problem goes away when restarting Windows, but it's more of a stopgap measure. I would like to know the root cause of the problem and how to fix it permanently.</p>

<h2>            On Ear Detection Not Working</h2>
                    When taking off the headphones the music should automatically pause, then resume again when they are put back on. This used to work intermittently, but this has been working less and less. The headphones are stuck thinking they are not on my head. The
 volume works, but there is no noise cancellation and the noise cancelling dial does nothing and the touchpad is not responsive. Does anyone know how to fix this or how the headphones detect if they are on ear?

<p>Hi&nbsp;Lidaliza_B,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same problem now multiple times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<ul>
<li><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>What is the music app you are using and what device is connected to the Surface headphones?</span></span></span></span></span></span></li></ul>
</blockquote>
<p>I am currently just using YouTube opened in Google Chrome. The headphones are connected via Bluetooth to my Laptop at work, which is a Dell Latitude 5480 with Windows 10 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><em>"What are the troubleshooting steps performed if any?"</em></span></p>
<p><span>The first time the problem occurred&nbsp;I successfully performed a factory reset via the Cortana device setup app.&nbsp;</span><span>The second time I tried to reset with holding the power button
 20 secs. The reset worked, after it was reconnected it blasted the music with 80% out of nowhere and the noise canceling still didn't work. So I tried the firmware reset with the cable. The
</span><span>noise&nbsp;</span><span>cancelling worked, till I talked to my colleague again, after that the headphones reactivated only after a minute or two, normally it was way faster.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am using these headphones now for nearly 2 months since December&nbsp;and I had no problem at all in the first month. For this price tag I want a seamless experience and don't want to reset the headphones every two days.
 Any help on this would be much appreciated.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you’re using Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) or any other antivirus program which comes bundled out with an antimalware program, Windows Defender
 would be automatically disabled in that case. If that’s the case, you can safely ignore the error message.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In the meantime, I’d suggest you to check for the status of “Windows Defender” service and ensure that it’s started and running.
</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click “Start.”</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type “services.msc” in the Start Search box and hit “Enter.”</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Double-click “Windows Defender.”</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>U</span><span>nder “Service status” in the “General” tab, click “Start” to start the service.</span></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker's Support, their on-line documentation, and ask in their forums (if any).<br />
<br />
Setup/Settings (BIOS/CMOS) often F2 as you boot so watch the screen which will tell you how - set<br />
the Boot Order to CD/DVD drive first. Some systems use F12 or other keys to allow a one time change<br />
in the boot order.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

    <title>Windows 10 &#34;Photos&#34; app not always displaying fine detail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gregs200  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 &#34;Photos&#34; app not always displaying fine detail properly</h2>
                    <p>I have discovered that when I view an&nbsp; image with the default Photos application, fine detail is not rendered crisply. When this happens, I can get it to display the image properly by clicking on Zoom, then zooming in at least one step, and then selecting
 "View Actual Size". If I omit the zoom operation, selecting "View Actual Size" does NOT work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have made a test image in PNG format available&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_KJzbJLIsl9cHFZWl9CV0QtWVE/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>&nbsp; (I had to ZIP it up because Google Drive insisted on providing the image in
 webp format, for some reason. You'll have to unzip it - sorry)</p>
<p>It is a 1280x853 image with a dark grey background, with a SINGLE bright red pixel positioned approximately in the centre.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I double-click on the file to open it with Photos, the pixel will be visible, but it will be very dim. If I then select View Actual Size, it will get a bit brighter and sharper, but it still won't look like it's supposed to. If I then click Zoom, then
 zoom in (click anywhere on the slider), and then select "View Actual Size", it will then look very bright and sharp.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same problem occurs for JPEG images, and in fact is worse with JPEG. I just thought I'd use a lossless format to demonstrate the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that when I use a much smaller image, it works properly. So, it may be something to do with the application doing an initial re-size to fit the window. That's why I have made the overall image reasonably large.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Environment:</p>
<p>Windows 10-X64</p>
<p>Dell M4500 laptop with nVidia Quadro FX880M graphics</p>
<p>
</p><p>All other applications I have tried (including the older Windows Photo Viewer) work properly.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t install update KB2919355 from Windows Update</h2>
                    <p>Good morning,</p>
<p>I have a problem while installing the update KB2919355 on my laptop with Windows 8.1. The error coe that appears in Windows Update is 800F081F.</p>
<p>If I look for the update in the list of "Updates history" in Windows Update, it appears as "not correctly installed". I looked for it in the "Installed Updates" screen in Programs and Features in the Control Panel, it appears as installed on March 18, 2014.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What should I do? All the others updates (important and optional) so far have been installed with no problems.</p>
<p>I'm sorry if this is a duplicate question.</p>
<p>I hope my question is understandable; I'm not a native English speaker.</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you for replying!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the troubleshooter but it didn't solve my problem, it still can't install that specific update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I wanted to install this update manually (without using Windows Update), should I first uninstall the KB2919355 installation that appears in Programs &amp; Features?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would it be safe to uninstall it? Are there other updates that maybe depend on that KB2919355 installation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope my question is understandable.</p>

<p>Update: I tried to uninstall it via Programs&amp;Features but there's no "Uninstall" option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found this link,&nbsp;http://www.thewindowsclub.com/windows-8-1-update-fails-to-install, which says that I should type the following commands:</p>
<p>
</p><p>-&gt; DISM /online /remove-package /packagename:Package_for_KB2919355~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~6.3.1.14<br />
<br />
-&gt; DISM /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup<br />
<br />
-&gt; DISM /online /cleanup-Image /restorehealth</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this reliable? Is this the right thing to do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry for the stupid question but I'd like to be 100% sure of what I'm going to do. I wouldn't want to make the situation worse.</p>

<p><strong>Deployment Image Servicing and Management</strong> (<strong>DISM</strong>)is a command that can be used to service a Windows image. This is one of the troubleshooting steps we would have provided as well. The commands that was given on the site is
 correct and you may try to uninstall the update. To know more about <strong>DISM</strong>, you can also check on this article:

<p>I looked for the error on the internet, I only found a previous post in this community, but the one who managed to solve the problem apparently didn't get the same log that I got (https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows8_1-update/dism-online-restore-health-function-gets-error/4183685b-7d52-458c-b818-045369b98380).</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Reset &#40;Keep my files&#41; &#38; Office 365 &#38; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> allen bingham  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Reset &#40;Keep my files&#41; &#38; Office 365 &#38; OneDrive</h2>
                    <p>My computer has been suffering since about 9/11/15 with the Critical Error Start Menu problem ... &nbsp;meaning I can't get to the Start Menu ... and more importantly NONE of the truly Windows 10 apps (non-desktop) do not work (e.g., Edge) ... and recently I
 realized that all the files I have been backup up to my "One Drive" (local C: drive location ... that should then upload to the 'cloud') ... have NOT been uploading --- I assume because the One Drive application is a Windows 10 app now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless ... I have been suffering along waiting for some resolution from Microsoft until now ... and with my discovery about the One Drive issue decided I need to 'bite the bullet' and reset my computer. However the question arises about what the following
 means in regards to preparing for the reset:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e78150f8-2e31-46c0-a217-64873939ac03" /></p>
<p>specifically ... I'm wondering if "Remove apps and drivers you installed" includes Desktop programs as well?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The more important question I have right now --- is whether or not I should go to my Microsoft Office 365 account and 'remove' this particular computer from the list of 'seats' available, before I reset --- or will that be taken care of automatically by
 the reset?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also are there any specific issues about linking back up with my One Drive account after a reset?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks-Allen Bingham</p>

            <p>Hi Allen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reset Windows 10 will&nbsp;set your Windows 10 to default, thereby, giving you a whole new experience of Windows 10&nbsp;again. It may keep your&nbsp;personal files if you select the option
<strong>Keep my files</strong>, however, it will delete all the drivers and application that you have installed apart from the pre-installed applications offered by Windows 10. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>No,&nbsp;reset will not erase your computer name listed in the seats available&nbsp;to install&nbsp;Office 365 on systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>OneDrive is a cloud storage application which&nbsp;allows you to store data on the server. Therefore, if you keep a&nbsp;backup of your files in&nbsp;OneDrive folder it will be stored in the server and will not&nbsp;be affected by&nbsp;the reset. However, I would suggest you to
 keep a back up in a USB or DVD&nbsp;as well just to avoid any further issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Please respond if you have further related queries.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jesinta Rozario&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Jesinta Rozario,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows 10 installation was an upgrade from Windows 8.1 Pro (to Windows 10 Pro), and as such the following statement you made needs more explanation for me to fully understand:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>... <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
however, it will delete all the drivers and application that you have installed apart from the pre-installed applications offered by Windows 10.</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>The confusion I have arises from the issue regarding desktop programs that were installed PRIOR to upgrade:
<strong>do those just go away (in my case these include Quicken 2013, Family Treemaker 2014. to name two)?</strong> Can you provide additional clarification?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also wondering why I couldn't just revert back to Windows 8.1 Pro ... and upgrade again ... seems that would have potentially solved the problems I'm having --- but I see that Microsoft has taken that choice away from me since my upgrade was more than a
 month ago --- not really a question just an editorial comment!</p>
<p>Thanks-Allen</p>

            All your desktop programs will be removed. Try to look in the programs before you reset to see if you can find a key.

            <p>So the question now arises, is there a way to do a clean install of Windows 10 Pro, w/o such a drastic result?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems to me what MS has done is tantamount to a bait-and-switch, as in they tell me I'm eligible for a free update to Windows 10 ... and if I'm not happy with it I can revert to my previous version (at least that is the case with Windows 8.1) ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>... but the fine print being that you need to revert prior to 30 days (or so?) &nbsp;after upgrading ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>... never did I imagine that on our about 9/11/15 my installation of Windows 10 would become useless for what appears to be a problem 'infecting' hundreds if not thousands or possibly more users (as evidenced by the numerous postings and "Me Too" on this
 site regarding the "Critical Error - Start Menu, etc." issue --- that nobody at Microsoft has come up with a fix that consistently works).</p>
<p>
</p><p>See my other posts in this forum for a description of the problems I have had --- note I have followed a number of suggestions by Microsoft Support Engineers to 'fix the problem' --- none of them have worked --- so hence my decision to maybe reset my machine
 --- and then as such needing answers to the questions I have posted in this 'conversation'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, see the beginning of this reply for my additional question now.</p>
<p>

            I'm afraid I cannot answer the question as I don't know. I assume the reset option is to clear any possible problems you may have with the installation of Windows 10 and removing programs that may or may not be causing issues is the easiest option. Sort
 of what would happen if you took your PC to a shop and they fixed it for you.

            <p>I am having same issue with the start menu and this just started happening. &nbsp;Windows 10 from windows 7 here. &nbsp; I cant understand why this very huge issue in my book has not been resolved yet. &nbsp;That being said, I have no problem with a reset because I created
 separate drive on my laptop to store all my sensitive info for just this reason. But, I want to to a FRESH install, NOT an upgrade again. &nbsp;Will the reset do this? Or will it be an install of my old OS then upgrade again? &nbsp;Are the system files stored on the
 HDD? &nbsp;I want to wipe clean C:\, format, re create the partition, and install fresh.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when I do all this and get it working again...wont Windows just update with Windows Update again and we have the same issue all over again, or is the issue with upgrading an OS to Windows 10?</p>

            <p>The Windows reset function in Windows 10 will reset back to a fresh version of Windows 10. Now whether there are still any elements of the previous OS there I can't say.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to clean install then that is done by creating media booting from it and wiping the current install. As you would with any previous system. You don't need a key so when asked select "skip".</p>

            <p>Windows will carry out updates as it did before. I would suggest if you can to actively find Video drivers yourself. You might also want to look see if there are any audio and/or network drivers for you hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your PC is a named build check their website for Windows 10 drivers.</p>

                    I just bought a new laptop and upgraded it to windows 10pro.&nbsp; But the data it consumes is a lot in such a small amount of time. I stopped all the background apps and even set my network as metered but the consumption won't stop. In data usage, it shows
 that the most data is used&nbsp; by system. How can I stop this?? A friend of mine uses windows 10 too but the data consumption rate is not as much as that of mine.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bccbca16-0ad9-4876-b249-cc007c842d5e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bccbca16-0ad9-4876-b249-cc007c842d5e?upload=true" /></a>

<h2>            Anybody else want MW3 to be bad&#63; lol</h2>
                    
<p>Personally, not sure if im gonna buy it still (although my decision will be made tomorrow when the trailer comes out that will provide me with enough information), but i actually hope its bad</p>
<p>if its bad, i have no reason to buy it and it will give me more time to play gears 3 bf3 skyrim etc</p>
<p>if its good im gunna have to buy it (dont say blah blah u dont have to buy it if its good, im gonna want to, ive played like all the cods) and find time between all my games during a semester of college which will be impossible lol</p>
<p>i also hope its bad so developers realize you cant come out with the same stuff every year and be successful (not including monopolized sports games), i believe more innovation from different games could come out of another same-old cod game that sells less
 than black ops</p>
<p>regardless, even if it is good, black ops will have always sold more than mw3, so all you ppl that think mw3 is gunna sell crazy are a little crazy</p>
<p>as ppl have said before, hating call of duty is the new cool thing to do, ppl will not buy it just to say they dont have it</p>

<p>I've met people who thought it was cool to hate the cods before. They have all purchased every game that has come out so far. It just took them a little longer than others. MW3 will be a huge release and it will most likely out sell BO. That can be proven

<p>on a side note i just bough alan wake today and it is one of the most remarkable games of this generation so far, presentation, story, atmosphere everything is top notch and Remedy really deserves a greater profit and its a shame that the next alan wake
 is only gonna be on xbla but i will make sure to buy it and support them so more innovation is in games and the alan wake stays alive...sadly ppl dont wanna buy a 17 dollar game (i got it for 12 with a five dollar coupon) and would rather spend 90-100 on the
 same product every year cough cod cough</p>
<p>i hope everybody gives alan wake a chance you will become captivated in his world in a way that the "cod universe" will never be able to create...mostly because cod has no personality to begin with</p>

<h3> paulae.  say:</h3>
<h2>            font size change after email is sent</h2>
                    <p>the font size I use in aol emails changes to a tiny font after the FIRST line of the email. Every time. I see this when I look at the "sent" email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>AOL is of no help whatsoever. I use Chrome, WIndows 10, I have all the settings to the right size and locked in. I'm not sure but I think it only happens in Chrome but maybe someone here has an idea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is completely random. I have changed no settings on my laptop regarding any programs. There are tons of people on line with the same problem, different browsers, and no solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe some one could help me. It is so unprofessional and ugly to have an email arrive looking like that to a friend of a business. Same laptop, past three years. Started about six months ago. I have no extensions or other things. Everything is basic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this must be an AOL problem btu I thought i'd try here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>or a chrome problem. The chrome forums are impossibly stupid</p>
<p>

            Hi Paula.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Have you tried a different browser?  I would have several browsers on your task bar so there's always one that's best for the task.  I use Firefox, Edge and Chrome in that order of preference.  It's easy to share bookmarks between all of them in their settings under Import Favorites from another Browser.  Set the preferred one as Default in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Default Apps.  
<br />
<br />I would also add AOL and any other Office or webmail accounts to Windows 10 Mail app which has a huge inbox to merge all your accounts an even bigger ad-free reading pane.  It really streamlines answering mail.  See here to get started:

<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before trying the below methods, disconnect all external devices from your computer expect Mouse and Keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Windows Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check if your Windows is up-to-date by going to <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>
Update and Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Windows Updates</strong> and install all the Windows Updates if there are any.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong>: Clean Boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perform a <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Clean Boot</a> and see what exactly is causing this error.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE</strong>: A 'Clean Boot' starts Windows with a minimal set of drivers and startup programs, so that you can determine whether a background program is interfering with your game or program. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality
 while in a clean boot environment, however, that functionality will return when you reset the computer to start normally after you have finished your troubleshooting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Clean Boot works, then don't forget to place the computer to normal boot by going to 'Reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting' section in the Clean Boot link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you got the help you needed by clicking Yes or No.</p>

    <title>Windows Live Movie Maker not responding - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Live Movie Maker not responding</h2>
                    <p>I'm editing a video on Windows Live Movie Maker to publish on my YouTube account. The file that the video creates is not a supported file by YT, so I have to convert into an acceptable file format. This is includes me having to go to the file menu, select
 save movie, select "recommend for this project" and then click save. I did everything and selected save. It starts to save, but then goes to "Windows Live Movie Maker (Not Responding)". I keep repeating these steps over 5 times, but the same window pops up!&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm using Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As well as that, every time I try to open the windows store app, it shows up and immediately closes. I've tried opening it multiple times for weeks and it does the same thing. I even when on the windows website store, and tried to download a software from
 there. I click the "download" button, but it does the same as when I try to open up the store app. I don't know what to do!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help! I'm trying to publish my video on YouTube!</p>
<p>Thanks :)</p>

<p><span>Console bans are not handed out on a whim. With that said, if you are looking for OFFICIAL answers from the XBL PET about your console ban then you need to post your query in
<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/41.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HERE</a>. However you should be aware that MS does not discuss console bans and you will only be directed to
<a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-us/consoleban" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HERE</a>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you bought the console USED I would suggest you take it back to the retail outlet you purchased it from for a refund or exchange. When possible it is always best to purchase BRAND NEW to avoid these situations.
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>There are numerous reasons for a console ban, not just for playing pirated games or modding the console. Excessive violations of the Terms of Service and/or Code of Conduct could result in a console and/or
 account ban from XBL.<br />

<div>Hi Praseetha K Nair,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank for your kind and detailed advice</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The system will not successfully back up to WD external drive - 'back-up failed to complete'</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Re your question of where I was trying to create a new folder - on a 2TB external Hitachi drive.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I guess I will have to take the chance that I will not loose any data that is important.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Only hardware changes made have been the connection of external USB disk (Hitachi) Never had problems with this previously though.</div>

            Hi&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/7cd2cc10-92e2-4e83-84e9-296fb860c930">Praseetha K Nair</a>,
<div><br />
<div>Am able to Create New Folder on system HDD but not on any external USB HDD?? Currently have to USB HDD drives: 1 WD 2TB and 1 NESO HDD by Hitachi.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also still not able to complete a system backup on my WD 2TB external USB drive - Fails to complete successfully - No idea what is going on here as in the past I have always been able to backup on this WD drive.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>A little more information that I missed earlier. HP support led me though a re-install last November - not sure if there is anything there that may point to an issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Kind Regards,</div>
<div><br />
<div>Vic</div>
<div><br />
<div>PS. How do I give you KUDOS for you excellent help and assistance?</div>

<h2>            Internet for multiple user accounts</h2>
                    
<p>I have Windows 7 32bit running on intel quad . I have 2 administrator accounts and i have made changes to the default settings to the privacy and other account settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The problem is that whenever I connect to internet ( requires a user name and password everytime &nbsp;I log in) this connection is under Dial - up and VPN the internet functions normally ,but when I switch accounts the connection of the&nbsp;previous account
 is lost also I need to reconnect to internet again with account I have switched to&nbsp;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Also the option while connecting "Save this username and password for the following accounts --&gt; Anyone who uses this computer " is GREYED out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus, Im unable to keep my internet connection active simultaneously for both the accounts. I was able to do this in Windows XP 32-bit .</p>

    <title>Window 10 Photo App - no readable content - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> miketxb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Window 10 Photo App - no readable content</h2>
                    Have just downloaded Windows 10 and have added folders to the photo app to view. &nbsp;Have created a number of folders in File Explorer, with pictures taken by the same camera with the same settings on subsequent days. &nbsp;On the photo app some of the folders
 can be opened and photos viewed and the left/right arrow clicked to move to the next picture - on others the folders cannot be opened (you click on it and just get a revolving circle) or there is no readable content. &nbsp;The photos in these folders can all be
 viewed individually though, but you cannot use the left/right arrow to move to the next photo in that folder. &nbsp;The settings on the pictures and folders are all the same. &nbsp;Any help would be appreciated.

            That is all you have?&nbsp;&nbsp; I have the same problem and apparently others do also.&nbsp; Do you need more information in order to find and fix what is wrong with this application?&nbsp; All other picture viewing software I have used reads the folder (and pictures) fine.&nbsp;
 We need you to provide us with a clue as to why Photos on Win10 does not?

            In the end I had to wipe the hard drive and re-install Windows 10, a completely clean install, and everything works. I had originally upgraded from Windows 8.1 and had this issue with the Photos app and Microsoft was unfortunately not able to solve this.
 But a clean re-install did solve this, it's just a lot of work and annoying, but it fixes all issues.

<h2>            Windows 10 Offline Files Sync Center and Sync Setup and Manage offline files not working.</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>From the Sync Center in the Control Panel, I see a message "There are no sync partnerships that can be set up on this computer."
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d9762933-f73f-48d6-9514-9ca1731e16e8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d9762933-f73f-48d6-9514-9ca1731e16e8" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click on the "Manage offline files" link in the menu, nothing happens....when doing this should bring up the Offline Files settings menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionaly, Windows Explorer does not display the "Always available offline", "Sync", or "Work offline" from the "Home" "Easy Access" tab when browsing a non-local folder....</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is on a LAN with a couple other Windows 10 PC's with folders shared in a HomeGroup that are not having this issue. &nbsp;I am able to read/write/delete from the PC with the problem. &nbsp;This should also work with external storage but it won't do that either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The app in the control panel is called "mobsync.exe"</p>
<p>
</p><p>This seems like it could be a registry and or dll issue.</p>
<p><br />

<p>
</p><p>Do you have any third party anti-virus program installed on the computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to run <strong>Incoming Connections troubleshooter</strong> and <strong>
Home Group troubleshooter </strong>and check if it helps. Type <strong>Troubleshooting</strong> in the
<strong>Search</strong> to get the troubleshooters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't help, I suggest you to disable third party anti-virus and check.</p>

<p>&nbsp; A NOVICE QUESTION REQUIRES SIMPLE INSTRUCTIONS FOR SYNC ISSUES</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a Chromebook user with (Linux) Chrome OS. &nbsp;I wish to sync Google apps in addition to Remote Desktop Setup with Chromebook. I've been unable to setup as I don't know the port, or the windows url, which password, etc. Important to me is GDrive storage
 of all the many years of data, Google Cloud, compatible OneDrive app to share, but it is not possible to use for years of Data. &nbsp;Use of GDrive storage is more tha 100G &nbsp;GDrive, ($19.99 annually).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the necessary info is how to Remotely connect desktopChromebook &nbsp;HP14-q04wm, on my HP Windows10. &nbsp;Remember I am a novice and please do not send me elsewhere or a URL to click on. &nbsp;You know the answer and just give to me instructions so I can begin to
 setup my business. All data is stored in GDrive, including backups of Window XP, Vista, 7.1, 8 and 10 OS. &nbsp;Nt user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS Edge Browser is great. Problem I find problems &nbsp;"unrecognized browser", requiring IE to move as browser. &nbsp;I finally setup Chrome Browser. It was like pulling teeth but I believe it is installed.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Familiar with and has stored passwords, apps, and contacts, bookmarks, is all in one place using G Chrome browser.Security software is Kaspersky Total Security. It has Password Keeper and Secure Connection included in package. I feel secure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would you please help by getting into details on the use ips as in use of periods vs proxy ip using dashes etc. Recall that I am a novice and basic instructions but detailed is best for going forward and accessing the data for startup of an online business.
 I am a novice technically, and paid thousands for setup assistance from (thought) Microsoft, but not!</p>
<p>
</p><p>New subject of warning of these useless predators. They install Microsoft security Essentials, something I could do. Invested $215.00 to iYogi, off shore India based scam artists. &nbsp;They sold me to be my computer setup and fix problems that come up. Once
 money is cleared so are they? &nbsp;Some lately say iun phone call, they are Microsoft checking on my setup, or an issue.// I called Microsoft and they advised me no one ever phones a unknown individual ever. &nbsp;The numbers used by scamm artists change in an 10 second
 lull. No longer gullible&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sync setup "no new sync partnerships can be setup on this computer". Wow! &nbsp;Drive, Dropbox, Google Photos are sync partnerships. &nbsp;Why are they no shown or denied sync status?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I always have to redirect to MS OneDrive to find Google files I frequently use. &nbsp;It &nbsp;is best to have on desktop and synced to open for easy access. The windows apps offered have no Google apps normally used to open or sync with Chromebook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Include all fill in the boxes "details". &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance of hopeful detailed response. &nbsp;The message here is important and ow you choose to help will measure the level of care or value of this customer. If read as I have requested one message asked and answered. &nbsp;Put simply and please do not send
 another Microsoft URL to read and write same to them. &nbsp;Better yet, forward it to the proper place for my need is important and if valued as a Microsoft customer, the details I need will be provided</p>
<p>
</p><p>Advice for MS Tech Support, Training and Developers:</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a novice, no longer in workplace, technology has sped up so fast I am unable to keep up. &nbsp;It has gotten more cluttered with icons, apps using half of Gigabytes on system, , in addition, my needs are simple, no need to set up a theater, movies, formulas
 for advanced mathematics, outlook has so much going on I am unable to properly use it. &nbsp;I was confused as to how to add my own email. &nbsp;So I use Gmail and Yahoo. &nbsp;Sad since I purchased 365. &nbsp;I have MS Professional office 2003, included Business Contact Manager,
 and works excellently until no further support and after a year Bus cont mgr was gone. &nbsp;I have Outlook that is not intuitive, nor useful in details to set up or ad contacts. I have 5000 contacts and not going to add each one into outlook. Gmail has them, Yahoo
 as well. &nbsp;Outlook 2006 has many but not recognized. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have extra problems I've had to overcome, as mind was wiped of memory, and body has loss of 9 in of height. &nbsp;I had a Y2K software development and consulting Company, and Fortune 500 were my clients, providing the expertise to move systems; &nbsp;legacy mainframe;
 and build the client-server model in use today &nbsp;Diagnosed with cancer May 2005, successful surgery, pressured to get the insurance chemo following surgery, as chemo was not that bad, and I changed doctors for aftercare chemo.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Microsoft can't leave those who beside you built the #1 operating system, worldwide standard! Yes, us, the baby boomers who retired or soon to retire, After leaving the workplace, having training/demonstrations, is no longer available. You may lose the
 baby boomers opting for simplicity. Copy of WIN XP like OS would sell fast and surprisingly well. Should another computer company decide to create XP like OS, copied its simplicity and functionality, a great money maker is born!. I wish I had the funds to
 create the system, and market to baby boomers. Does all I need a computer to do. Win XP was best system ever! &nbsp;Win10 is not user friendly, actually foreign with senseless icons cluttering, or complicating the once sleekest OS. now more like a 2015 Fiat, not
 the reliable, less complicated 98 Ford Taurus 3.0L&nbsp;Vulcan engine (cast Iron, not plastic as today's cars hare made of) Google Chromebook do not have standard compatible systems and little memory. Great for internet surfing and cheap, comparably. &nbsp; MS developers,
 were born into computers while we were the first users. &nbsp;They have their need for fast, cool looking, gaming, and fast moving plugged in lives. &nbsp;Not us. Leaving us to live with windows latest offering is not thinking smart. One system such as XP+, simple,
 where you are administrator, passport identifies you, and office apps provide all tools needed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I like template offerings and they were available on office online. The youth cannot leave one third of users confused, tech novices, lacking skills n expertise of current OS users of retired age. We are not dead but living it up with time to get into your
 passions, and need an OS system programmed by personal choices. &nbsp;Once I left workplace, I feel as if the language on Win10 is &nbsp;Martian (not familiar language).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to know in detail how to remote connect with Chromebook, and sync my Google amd Dropbox apps, not only OneDrive as single source of storage.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Microsoft Flight mouse controls - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> luciferno  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Flight mouse controls</h2>
                    <p>
I wanted a flight simulator, and I was enjoying Flight as a free download. I had a problem that I assumed was associated with the free aircraft, since many things were limited in the free version. &nbsp;So I purchased additional content, yes Microsoft, a paying
 customer.</p>
<p>Okay, I have a mouse that I was using for this game and I can't do acrobatics. That is to say that the the mouse at the very edges of the screen will not roll
 the aircraft no matter what. And, from a maximum airspeed dive, the mouse at the very top and bottom of the screen will not pitch the aircraft. I can't seem to find the setting that will allow the mouse to control the aircraft without restriction.</p>
<p>
If I attach an Xbox controller, I can get full rudder/aileron control with a catch. The catch is that it's like driving finish nails with a front end loader, the absolute minimum movement rolls the aircraft 30 degrees. This is not a precision instrument at
 all.</p>
<p>
I've spent about two hours looking for the solution to the problem, including talking to Microsoft Customer Support on the phone. &nbsp;The first surprising thing that they told me is that they couldn't help me at all, that I could only rely on the forums on this
 website. &nbsp;Another thing that&nbsp;disappointed&nbsp;me is that the man on the phone stated rudely to me that I was a jerk for complaining about a FREE game. &nbsp;I have paid (not wisely) for content for this supposedly 'free' game. &nbsp;The solution is simple, if there is a
 resolution I will be a happy camper and keep playing. &nbsp;If there is no solution or an apathetic response, I shall simply demand a refund and forget about this unpleasant experience.</p>

<p>Following running a defrag I'm getting a Windows Installer window telling me that the feature I am trying to use is on a cd rom or other removable disc that is not available. It's Logitech Video Enumerator, don't have a disc. Can't close this window, or
 download anything which might fix it or shut down my pc. Also got a Server Busy message and webcam icon at the screen footer. Any help gratefully received. Have tried the services.msn and setting to manual solution suggested elsewhere.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now solved using; a suggestion by Dinesh Lakkaraju on a later question on Windows Installer. 'Go to run type msconfig. Then go to startup and check if there is any thing related sonic activation. Uncheck it and click ok. and then restart your machine.'</p>

<h2>            App Store - Change Install Folder</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(44, 44, 44, 1)">Hi all,</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(44, 44, 44, 1)">I would like to change the folders of where apps install from the windows 10 App store. I have not used the store that
 much and only own a couple of apps, but now they are adding the Play Anyway feature that gives you the ability to buy Xbox games from the Windows App store im sure i will be using it a lot more.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(44, 44, 44, 1)">Currently i have tried to change the install location by going to the Settings&gt;Storage option but that only allows me
 to change the drive. I use brows the root of my drives often and like to keep them organised. So i changed the default drive from C:\ to D:\</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(44, 44, 44, 1)">But after doing this i now have 3 new folders on the root of my D:\ drive and its driving my ocd crazy. The 3 folders
 it crated are "WindowsApps" "WpSystem" "WUDownloadCache"</span><br />
<br />

 all the other folders it needs would be crated in side of that directory?</span><br />

            <p>Hi Joe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to inform you that you cannot all these folder in one folder. This has to be in a different folder it is by design.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(44, 44, 44, 1)"><strong>WindowsApps: </strong>This folder will have Windows apps fiels.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(44, 44, 44, 1)"><strong>WpSystem: </strong>This folder will have system files.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(44, 44, 44, 1)"><strong>WUDownloadCache: </strong>This folder will have app history and cache</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(44, 44, 44, 1)">Do let us know if you have any other query. Thank you.
</span></p>

            <p>Hi thanks for your answer. I think you may have misunderstood me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im not looking to replace the 3 folders in to 1 folder, i know each folder is their for a reason. What im looking for is a way to have each of the 3 folders moved in to a new folder so i dont have each of those individual folders sitting on the root of my
 D drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example this is the folder structure i currently have;</p>
<p>
</p><p>D:\WindowsApps</p>
<p>D:\WpSystem</p>
<p>D:\WUDownloadCache</p>
<p>
</p><p>and i want a folder structure like this;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(44, 44, 44, 1)">D:\Program Files\Windows App Store\</span>WindowsApps</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(44, 44, 44, 1)">D:\Program Files\Windows App Store\</span>WpSystem</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(44, 44, 44, 1)">D:\Program Files\Windows App Store\</span>WUDownloadCache</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(44, 44, 44, 1)"><span>This way it keeps the root of my drive clean,&nbsp;instead&nbsp;of it having 3 extra folders showing. As i say i like to keep my folders organised and it&nbsp;currently&nbsp;is
 driving my ocd crazy having those 3 folders on the root of my D drive.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(44, 44, 44, 1)"><span>From what i can tell&nbsp;their&nbsp;is no option to do this, you can only pick the drive you want it on then it just dumps it all on the root of the selected drive.
 It would be far better if you could actual pick a location. &nbsp;But im not sure if this is still doable by&nbsp;altering&nbsp;some&nbsp;registry&nbsp;keys or from another tweak.</span></span></span></p>
