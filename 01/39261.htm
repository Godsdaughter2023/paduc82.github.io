    <title>External hard drive shows up in disk management as unallocated space - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            External hard drive shows up in disk management as unallocated space</h2>
                    
<p>I pulled a hard drive from a computer that I couldn't get to work and installed it in an external enclosure and connected it to a working computer (to&nbsp; pull the data off the drive before I did anything drastic).&nbsp; The USB Mass Storage Device shows up under
 Device Manager as working properly but Disk Management shows the hard drive to be unallocated.&nbsp; How can I access the data?&nbsp; If I partition it, won't it wipe the disk clean?</p>
<p>Thanks for any helpful suggestions.</p>
<p>B</p>

<p>Well you were right - it would not boot.&nbsp; But I found the manufacturer's menu and was able to clear the partition table and master boot record and get to the system recovery program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And thanks for the response - it's nice to know there are knowlegeable people out there willing to help when you get frustrated working on windows ____.</p>

    <title>After Installing and Running Windows 10 Update, My HP ENVY Sleekbook 4 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> georgemacawile  say:</h3>
<h2>            After Installing and Running Windows 10 Update, My HP ENVY Sleekbook 4 Now Stuck in Bootup</h2>
                    <p>Just 4-5 days after a successful transition from Windows 8.1 to 10, my HP <span>
HP Envy TouchSmart Sleekbook 4-1115dx,</span> remains stuck at the "Please wait..." screen with the HP logo on startup. I was prompted to restart the laptop when it would not enter hibernate mode upon closing the screen (a setting that I had specified when
 I first got the notebook years ago) and when the mousepad wouldn't let me tap to click (instead I had to physically push down to click). Once it restarted, it remains stuck forever in the "Please wait.." screen as mentioned before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am able to run system diagnostics (from F2 command) and initially the results revealed that the memory module failed. So I replaced the RAM chips with 2 old ones which I happened to have around. I re-ran both the quick and extensive system diagnostic tests
 and passed with no failures, but I'm still unable to get past the "Please wait.." screen. I've also tried disconnecting the battery and holding down the power button for 30 seconds while connected to A/C power supply with no luck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After scouring through the forums, there doesn't seem to be any solutions that I can use to fix this problem. My F9, F10, and F11 buttons do not function properly as they do not bring me to the boot device options, BIOS setup, or System Recovery. Instead
 all three immediately return the notebook back to the "Please wait.." screen and my notebook gets stuck again. I also cannot boot in safe mode by hitting F8, as it is like the computer can't even recognize the command. On top of that, I cannot get past the
 "Please wait.." screen so it is impossible for me to login at all and get to the command prompt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help is greatly appreciated and I hope anyone that has this problem will benefit from this post. Thanks.</p>

1) I already disconnected the mouse and there are no peripheral devices connected to the notebook. However, the problem still persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I also, as it is an ultrabook, I do not have an internal CD/DVD drive so I would have to create a USB. I will attempt this solution, however I did explain that I cannot reach the Bios setup or boot menu as my F10 and F9 functions respectively do not work
 for some unknown reason. The computer just continues back to the "Please wait.." screen.</p>

<p><span>Hello KonstantinosH,<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>We would like to clarify some information in regards to the batteries and warranty services that apply to all Surface devices.
<br />
<br />
As it does state on the box that the battery has a finite amount of charge cycles that it will be able to go through and may require replacement, this must also be paired with the warranty information found in section 3B of the Surface manufacturer’s standard
 warranty found in the documents </span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/documents" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">here</span></a><span><span>.
<br />
<br />
Section 3B states: “<span>If Microsoft or the retailer determines that the Microsoft Hardware or Accessory malfunctioned due to a defect in materials or workmanship during the Warranty Period under Normal Use Conditions, Microsoft or the retailer will (at its
 option) repair or replace it, or refund the </span></span></span><span><span>purchase price to You.”</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Due to the nature of how the Surfaces are manufactured and constructed, whenever there is a hardware related issue the device is replaced entirely either through our Service Center or via a physical Microsoft Store.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>To see how to get the longest life from your battery, please view our <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/performance-and-maintenance/clean-and-care-for-your-surface?os=windows-10&amp;=undefined#BatteryW10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
battery health</a> information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For added peace of mind, you can get extended hardware and accident damage coverage through the purchase of the
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/accessories/microsoft-complete" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Complete for Surface Extended Service Plan</a>. You can purchase this with the device or if you purchased your Surface in the last 45 days.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When and if your Surface product needs service, you can find out how in our <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/how-do-i-get-my-surface-serviced" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Vista upgrade on a Gateway with all updated drivers with audio - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chris h johnson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vista upgrade on a Gateway with all updated drivers with audio distortion.</h2>
                    I have a Gateway desktop that came with XP Media Center Edition. It has SigmaTel audio hardware and drivers. When I did a Vista Home Premium&nbsp;<u>upgrade,</u> and installed all service packs, I also went to Gateway and got most current SigmaTel audio drivers
 and installed them. My audio is distorted and has a constant high-pitch whine in Media Player, Media Center, video calls, and on internet. My speaker system is o.k. I get the distortion with the speakers off, using headphones.
<div>My tolerance has run out. Can someone help me fix this, should I get an independent sound card, does Vista audio work only with USB speakers?</div>
<div>What am I doing wrong? Any solution will be profoundly appreciated.</div>

<p>&nbsp;How do I stop my music from skipping or breaking up when I play it? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Applies to these editions of Windows&nbsp;Vista Starter Home Premium Business Ultimate Enterprise
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the music in your library skips or the audio breaks up when you play it in Windows Media Player, there might be a problem with the audio driver installed on your computer. Typically, this type of problem occurs only toward the end of songs (in the last
 20 seconds or so). In some cases, you can work around the problem by disabling optional speaker effects that are collectively known as enhancements. If disabling speaker effects solves the problem, this usually means that there is an underlying issue with
 your audio driver. If an updated driver is available, we recommend that you install it so that you can reenable speaker audio enhancements. Hide all
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To disable speaker audio enhancements Open Audio Devices and Sound Themes by clicking the Start button , clicking Control Panel, clicking Hardware and Sound, and then clicking Sound. On the Playback tab, click Speakers, and then click Properties. Click the
 Enhancements tab, and then select the Disable all enhancements check box. If you don't see an Enhancements tab in the Speakers Properties dialog box, those features are not available for your speakers and this procedure is not applicable to your computer.
 If disabling audio enhancements solves the audio problem you're experiencing, this typically indicates that your audio driver needs to be updated. If disabling audio enhancements does not solve the problem, contact your computer manufacturer for further assistance.
 To update your audio driver If disabling audio enhancements solves the audio problem you're experiencing, this usually means that there is an underlying issue with your audio driver.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check to see if an updated driver is available for your computer. Here's how: Go to Windows Update and install any available audio driver updates. For information about using Windows Update, see Install Windows updates. If no updates are available or if
 installing the update doesn't solve your problem, go to your computer manufacturer's website and search for audio driver updates for your specific computer model (updates are usually available in the "Support" or "Software Downloads" section of the company's
 website). For example, if you have a recent Dell computer and you've been experiencing audio problems with Windows&nbsp;Vista, see the Dell Forums webpage for information about downloading the latest audio driver for certain Dell models. (Optional) After you've
 updated your audio driver, try enabling speaker audio enhancements again. To enable speaker enhancements, follow the instructions in the procedure "To disable speaker audio enhancements," but, in step 3, clear the Disable all enhancements check box instead
 of selecting it. &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try different drivers, not necessarly the latest.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>

<h2>            Free disk space needed for Windows 10 upgrade from 8.1&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've got an Asus SSD tablet (T300L) but the drive C is only 100G, and I have only 16GB of free space. Can W10&nbsp; be upgraded with this amount of free space? The other partition is 128GB with plenty of free space.<br />
<br />
And if it can, will the upgrade delete all the old W8.1 OS files to save space?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And will it keep all the programs installed as they are now?</p>

<p>
</p><p>System requirements</p>
<p>If you want to upgrade to Windows 10 on your PC or tablet, here’s what it takes.</p>
<p>Latest OS:&nbsp; Make sure you are running the latest version either Windows 7 SP1 or Windows 8.1 Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Windows 8.1, see the following article:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/install-latest-update-windows-8-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/install-latest-update-windows-8-1</span></a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Windows 7, see the following article:</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Processor:&nbsp; 1 gigahertz (GHz) or faster processor or SoC</p>
<p>RAM:&nbsp; 1 gigabyte (GB) for 32-bit or 2 GB for 64-bit<br />
Hard disk space:&nbsp; 16 GB for 32-bit OS 20 GB for 64-bit OS<br />
Graphics card:&nbsp; DirectX 9 or later with WDDM 1.0 driver<br />
Display:&nbsp; 1024x600</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How much actual free disk space is required by Windows 10 setup?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 uses approximately 10 GBs of disk space. The minimum disk space available is to facilitate the installation process. Some install files are compressed and need to be expanded during setup. Some files are temporary and are deleted during or after
 installation. Also, because you might have data and apps on the hard disk, they will be moved around during migration.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My Tablet does not have 16 or 20 GBs of free space and I am not able to free up any additional space. What should I do?</strong></p>
<p>Windows 10 will support systems with compressed installations. Windows 10 can upgrade such systems with as little as&nbsp;8.5 GBs of free space.</p>

Factors for this includes the data we store on the drive such as our documents, photos, music, videos and other files. Limited space is especially an issue if you are using a Ultrabook which often comes with a low capacity SSD drive. There are some common work arounds for this which includes archiving older files to an external hard disk. For some persons though, this is not an option. So whats eating up that space and how can I free it up to get back some of it? Lets find out."><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">How

</p><p><strong>Will upgrading from Windows 7 or later preserve my personal files, applications and settings?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, upgrading from Windows 7&nbsp;or a later version will preserve your personal files (documents, music, pictures, videos, downloads, favorites, contacts etc, applications (ie. Microsoft Office, Adobe applications etc),&nbsp; games&nbsp;and settings (ie. passwords, custom
 dictionary, application settings). </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will my existing programs, hardware and drivers&nbsp;work on Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most applications and hardware&nbsp;drivers&nbsp;designed for Windows 7 or later should work with Windows 10. Of course, with significant changes expected in Windows 10, it is best you contact the software developer and hardware vendor&nbsp;to find out about support for
 Windows 10. Windows 10 setup will keep, upgrade, replace and might require that you install new drivers through Windows Update or from the manufacturers website.</p>

            Last item - does the W10&nbsp; install delete all the W8.1 files? Is it close enough to a "wipe the disk and do a clean install of W10" as far as disk space used?

<p>We appreciate your response. If the problem does not occur while your computer is in clean boot mode, a background program is likely causing interference. Determine which background program is causing the issue, start by turning off all drivers, third-party
 programs or services, and startup items that load with Windows. If you'll not experience the issue, turn back on half of these services to try to isolate the interfering service.

</p><p>If the issue is not resolved at this point, you will repeat this process until you have isolated the interfering service. Finally, if you are able to determine which specific program or service is causing the issue, contact the program manufacturer to determine
 whether there is a solution. You can also disable the program or service to address the issue.

<h2>            Boot issue after updates installed</h2>
                    <p>Hi I have a Windows 10 PC that does not boot after some Windows updates were recently installed.</p>
<p>It gives the error text INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE, then the machine reboots and it gives a different message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error 0xC0000017 There isn't enough memory available to create a ramdisk device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run a memory diagnostic and that passed, I have also run a chkdsk on the Windows partition and that didn't find any issue.</p>
<p>I have also tried running a start-up repair from the Windows 10 disc, but it is unable to repair the issue. The log file SrtTrail.txt gives this text:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Root cause found: <br />
---------------------------<br />
A patch is preventing the system from starting.<br />
<br />
Repair action: System files integrity check and repair<br />
Result: Failed. Error code =&nbsp; 0x490<br />
Time taken = 1256688 ms</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I have tried a system restore but it says there is no restore point available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to resolve this?</p>

            <p>Is this a UEFI BIOS mode PC or Legacy?</p>
<p>
</p><p>After booting with the Windows 10 install disc, instead of choosing Repair, try hitting Shift-F10 to get a Command Prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Type <em>diskpart</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>list volume</em> - see what drive letters are assigned</p>
<p>
</p><p>for each volume with no letter (except MSR if it is there):</p>
<p><em>select volume 1</em></p>
<p><em>assign</em></p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>list volume</em> - again to see what drive letters there are now (the letters used are not important, just take note of them)</p>
<p><em>exit </em>- to end diskpart</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes letters may not be as you expect.&nbsp; A UEFI/GPT disk will have a System EFI&nbsp;FAT32 partition, a Recovery partition and a Boot/Windows partition.&nbsp; The disc or USB you booted from will have a letter also.&nbsp; A MBR disk will probably have a System/Recovery
 partition and a Boot/Windows partition, both NTFS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows is C: and the FAT32 partition is E: you can run bootsect to fix the System partition:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the FAT32 EFI partition (UEFI) is other than E: then use that letter.&nbsp; For MBR disk (Legacy BIOS) use the Recovery/System drive letter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If necessary, you can fix the boot menu:</p>
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="margin-left: 30px">-- replace the letters for C: and E: with whatever Windows and the System partition letters are.&nbsp; When Windows boots, it will make the drive letters look normal even if they appear different here.</p>

            <p>Hi Don,</p>
<p>The machine uses legacy BIOS boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried diskpart list volume but for each volume it has already assigned a letter. The C: drive is a recovery partition (NTFS) and D: is the Windows partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run bcdboot D:\Windows /s C: /f ALL but still see the same issue.</p>

            <p>When you ran chkdsk, did you run it on drive D: which was assigned to the Windows volume at the time?</p>
<p>chkdsk D: /X will check the volume, even if it has not been marked as having errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, in the Repair Environment, try running (assuming Windows still shows as drive D:):</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes it has been reported that Startup Repair will fix issues if run a few times.&nbsp; Also, after Startup Repair, sometimes you can start Windows in Safe Mode if you get the boot menu and can get to the menus:&nbsp;Troubleshoot - &nbsp;Advanced options - Startup
 settings - <em>Restart</em></p>

<p>
</p><p>If nothing else works to get Windows to boot and you need to rescue any data from C: you could shrink drive C: by 32-64GB using diskpart and then install a clean copy of Windows 10 to the blank space created on the disk.&nbsp; You could then use this new copy
 of Windows to get files&nbsp;from the original C:\Windows partition.</p>

                    I can't access to a website and I think the port 80 unopen is the problem. I use the website canyouseeme.org to check that and see Connection timed out. Here is the problem by Windows Network Diagnostics:<br />

<p>I am a little confused by your post. First you say:</p>
<p><em>I have found my father's Windows 98 CD.</em></p>
<p>Then you say:</p>
<p><em>He said that the CD is missing as some stole it.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you perhaps saying that you found the CD that your father believed to be stolen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you found the CD, why do you need to make a copy of it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And why would you install a 20 year old operating system that is unstable and that is unlikely to run on a current PC?</p>

</p><p>Sorry, i just edited the post so it makes sense, I found the box with the product key on it but the cd was missing i wonder how may i acquire an legal copy of it to burn on any cd.</p>
<p>I'm also an passionate of old technology FreeDOS may do the thing of replacing discontinued MS-DOS</p>

<h2>            My HD 1080P Webcam is very blurry &#40;Linux&#41;</h2>

<p>Skype&nbsp;8.18.0.6</p>

</p><p>My camera is detected on Skype but the webcam quality it is very low. I can't seem to change it. If I am using a different webcam app such as 'Cheese' (Gnome) it works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a setting on Skype that will allow me to change the resolution or is this a known issue?</p>

<li>Internet speed</li><li>Room lighting</li><li>Having not enough RAM and CPU </li></ul>

                    Hi - does anyone know how I deselect the Free Select Tool on Gimp 2.8&nbsp;please?&nbsp; I wanted to blur the background on some photos and could not get any of the Tools to deselect so had to do it the laborious way with the Blur/Sharp option.&nbsp; I remember from
 using Photoshop before that I could easily select/deselect the Magic Wand tool if I wanted to change a background, but cannot find how to deselect in Gimp.&nbsp; Have tried various options I&nbsp;found on the web/Gimp manual but none seem to work.&nbsp; Thank you.

<h2>            Verizon Jet Pack Issue on Windows 10</h2>
                    I have a Verizon Jet Pack model 4G LTE Mobile Hotspot - AC791L. I can connect and get online using the tethering usb cable, but it will not allow me to connect wireless wifi. I have went in and did a factory reset on the jet pack, still wont connect to
 wifi. I have also went in and forgot the network, added it back, still unable to connect. It shows my Dell laptop is connected to the jet pack, but it won't access the network with internet. I have called Verizon and spoke to tier 2 tech support and they are
 telling me it is my laptop. My wife has a Mac Book Pro and she is able to connect to the jet pack and get internet with no problem. I have performed all Windows updates. I am at a total loss on how to access the internet with this jet pack. Also at first I
 thought it was a defective jet pack, so Verizon sent me another one, but it's doing the same thing on my Dell laptop. Does anyone know how I can resolve this issue? Thanks in advance. I also tried the troubleshooter on Windows 10 bu

<p>Hi Robert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could be a possible internet connection issue or has something to do with your laptop's performance. For us to verify this further, we would like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Aside from your laptop, are there other devices connected to the Verizon Jetpack?</li><li>If yes, what are those devices? Were you able to get online on those other devices?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If the problem only happens on your laptop, then we suggest that you look into the troubleshooting steps for the

<p>
</p><p>If other devices also experiencing the same issue, then we suggest getting in touch with the manufacturer of Verizon Jetpack for further assistance.</p>

<p>How you configure your ip address has no relevance on speeds it just not a valid question really. Its like asking does the colour of your car affect its top speed.</p>
<p>Manual ip addresses can be useful (but not necessary on some routers) when you want to set-up port forwarding or a DMZ, but from a speed perspective, no difference.</p>

<h2>            Spellchecker has stopped working.</h2>
                    <p>Since the April update of Microsoft 10 my spellcheck won't work on anything but Microoft Office. I go into my setting, language etc and there is an option to turn the spellcheck on or off but it is greyed out.<br />
I am not&nbsp; great typist and when trying to type quickly mistakes alwayd occur but I can no longer glance along a line for the tell-tail red underlined word or two and end up sending messages of Facebook posts with typos in them.</p>
<p>Can anyone help please?</p>

    <title>Lost internal bluetooth radio after clean install of windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cah8861  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lost internal bluetooth radio after clean install of windows 7</h2>
                    I have a Gateway MD7818U laptop that came with windows vista home premium. It has an internal bluetooth module installed and an intel 5100 wifi radio. Both radios worked fine with windows vista. After doing a clean install of windows 7, I still have my
 wifi 802.11n radio and works good connecting to my home network. But I have totally lost my internal bluetooth radio- it might of been because I forgot to turn it on before I upgraded to windows 7. I cannot get it turn on using the FN+F6 keys, it does nothing.
 I do not see it listed in device manager anywhere. I have tried searching for drivers but they all say the radio must be turned on which I cannot do. When I reboot I see the bluetooth radio indicator light come on while the screen is displaying the Gateway
 logo, but as soon as windows starts the light goes out. I have been trying to figure this out about 2 weeks with no answers yet. Gateways support is worthless. Please help.

            Hi, I have tried many times to download the updated driver from gateway for my laptop. When I try to install&nbsp;it I get a message saying that there is no bluetooth radio installed and the installer closes. I have solved my bluetooth problem the only way
 I could- I purchased a bluetooth dongle and installed the drivers that it came with, it works great. Although it is very frustrating that I have an internal one and cannot get it to work.

    <title>Time zone keeps changing after Laptop restart - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Time zone keeps changing  after Laptop restart</h2>
                    <p>I seem to be having an issue with 2 of my laptops. Neither of them have ever been out of the US. After restart the time zone is changed to Kuala Limpur(sp) sorry not sure of the spelling. I check settings date/time and see it is the wrong time zone. I turn
 off auto time zone, change to the correct zone then turn on auto zone and it changes back to kuala limpur. If I leave time zone to Auto under settings date/time and go to Control Panel date/time and change the zone there it keeps the setting until a restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both laptops are running Windows 10 1803 Build 17134.48. What is going on and how can I fix it. One is an Asus Laptop the other is a Lenovo Ideapad 320</p>

            Hey dfontana1959,
<br />
<br />This has been happening recently, are you from Australia by any chance? I've had people from Adelaide and Sydney have this issue.
<br />
<br />What does it say for the location if you were to go to: <a href="http://ip-adress.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://ip-adress.com</a> (misspelling intended)
<br />
<br />I'd venture a guess that it's the ISP that's causing an issue with location precision or could be something with how Windows perceives the location.
<br />
<br />Let me know.

<p>To answer your first quest, no I am in the US. Haven't been out of the country in a long time (years)</p>
<p>
</p><p>when I checked the info from ip-address.com it reported the correct ISP information and the next town over which has always been normal for me to see. The IP address also appeared to be a good IP address for the ISP.</p>

<h3> javalin197  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana, SearchBar, Start Menu &#38; TaskBar Malfunction</h2>
                    <p>I have been having issues with the entire Windows 10 TaskBar in general. It does not happen immediately after booting up my desktop, but after running for a few hours, it starts to act up. The bugs that occur involve:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Start Menu not opening</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Cortana search bar not responding</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Extended menus for various programs pinned to the taskbar not opening</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Right-clicking on the toolbar has no response (but right-clicking works everywhere else)</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Right-clicking on pinned programs in the taskbar has no response (but right-clicking works everywhere else)</p>
<p>
</p><p>-Pinned programs in the taskbar get highlighted when the cursor is hovering over it, but does not go away when cursor hovers off the icon</p>
<p>
</p><p>and sometimes the entire taskbar may become completely unresponsive and grey-out, finding the "program is unresponsive" prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running a Dell, with a Intel(R) Core(TM) 7-3770, CPU @ 3.40GHz, and a Nvidia 740 GPU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does not necessarily halt me in any progress of any projects of mine, but it has become quite an annoyance. A solution is most helpful.</p>

            For the record, I have exactly Javalin's problem once or twice a month. I cannot detect a pattern. Method 1 had no effect. I tried method 2, or something very similar with DISM but it did not stop it. &nbsp;The simplest suggestion that worked best was just
 to close as many applications as I could (usually all of them) and then logoff and logon again (without shutting down). The windows icon was inactive and it cannot now be done from task manager, but is offered after CTRL+ALT+Delete. &nbsp;This does not remove the
 problem, but makes it less painful! I hope an MS update will fix it in future.

            <p>Thank you for the methods. I am performing both methods to be safe. The issue does not happen right away, nor does it occur everyday. So, I will report back in a week or two if the issue does not show up again.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also note from the methods:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1 stated that it did not find any violations in the programming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2 gives me " Image version: 10.0.10586.0" &nbsp;And finishes with "The Operation Completed successfully"&nbsp;</p>

    <title>touch functionality for external monitor - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            touch functionality for external monitor</h2>
                    I just purchased a Dell U2713HM touch screen monitor to use with my surface pro 2 and there is no touch screen functionality. &nbsp;I am using an HDMI cable to connect I suspect this is the problem. &nbsp;Can anyone confirm if a specific connection type is required
 to use the touch screen features? &nbsp;Or is there a set up process I need to do through since I can not run the CD? &nbsp;

            <p>My five minutes of research says that you don't have a touch screen monitor. The Dell U2713HM does not have touch. If you had a Dell P2714T - it comes with a USB 3.0 cable to enable the touch functionality. So which monitor do you have?</p>

                    After the latest update, fall creator, I'm having an issue with the driver. The recommended Broadcom driver won' sstart and the official tp link driver is the same. I downloaded the newest drivers via phone. What should I do? I already ran the troubleshooter.&nbsp;

            Can' submit through feedback hub because the network adapter doesn't work. Went to a previous version of windows instead until there is a fix.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to Skype Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, there are three options available whenever someone is calling your Skype during an ongoing call. You can either
<strong>merge</strong>, <strong>answer </strong>or <strong>decline&nbsp;</strong>the incoming call.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not want to be called while on an ongoing call, you have to click on the decline button instead. There is no hold option for the incoming call.
</p>

<p>Hello JosephV_A</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the feedback. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I think to be forced to do something during a call can be very disturbing and should be an only option and not a default.</p>
<p>A behavior as a dumm as an old land line phone (giving just a busy indication) is a missing feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll post this to the user voice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>Michael.</p>

<p>BTW: what I'm looking for is not a "hold option" as described, but a reject option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I'm in a business call and I have to respond manually every 5 minutes to an incomming call, it's just every disturbing and prevents me from using skype for serious calls. (I guess it's not designed to be a toy only ;))</p>
<p>
</p><p>this feature is needed for iPhone</p>
