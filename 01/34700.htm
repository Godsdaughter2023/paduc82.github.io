<h2>            Laserjet 2100 direct connect network help needed</h2>
                    
<p>Hello techies.&nbsp; I need some help please.</p>
<p>I've acquired an HP Laserjet 2100 printer with a Jetdirect 600n card (J3110A) that I'm trying to use with my Compaq V2615US notebook network jack as a direct connection.&nbsp; That is without a server between the computer and printer.</p>
<p>Been struggling for over a week. Time for me to reach-out and ask for some help.</p>
<p>It is not being recognized.</p>
<p>Printing a Jetdirect Cofiguration Info page I get the following information:</p>
<p>LAN HW Adress:&nbsp; 001083F3A247</p>
<p>I/O Card 03 NOT READY External Loopback Error</p>
<p>TCP/IP STATUS:&nbsp; 55 BOOTP/DHCP IN PROGRESS</p>
<p>HOST NAME: NPIF3A247</p>
<p>IP Adress:&nbsp; 0.0.0.0</p>
<p>IPX/SPX STAUUS:&nbsp; 29 Unable to sense net number</p>
<p>NODE NAME:&nbsp; NPIF3A247</p>
<p>I was able to CLEAR&nbsp; the loopback error by making a loopback plug.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Using the Network Printer Wizard I've tried inputting individually either of the above Host Name, IP Address, LAN HW Address, or Node Name in the appropriate block.&nbsp; NONE of these worked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Somewhere I saw a reference to a supposed "default" IP Address of 192.0.0.192.&nbsp; Tried that as an IP address to no avail. Received a screen message stating that it was a "default address" and suggesting that it was not correct.</p>
<p>My computer's network card is a Realtek 8139/810x Family card that is reported as working correctly by my computer and was previously used in the past in this manner with another printer.</p>
<p>Key Questions are:</p>
<p>1 What am I missing or doing wrong?</p>
<p>2 Is this a dead Jetdirect card?</p>
<p>I can get access to a Jetdirect 620n card but the applicability list that I saw DID NOT list the 2100 as an applicable printer.</p>
<p>Would it be worth me trying out a substitution of the 620n for my 600n card ?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance for your kind help.</p>
<p>John</p>

<div>Without any kind of switch between the printer and the computer you absolutely need a crossover cable for your "ethernet" connection.&nbsp; You will NOT be able to use a standard ethernet patch cable.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Once you find that crossover cable and have run a test printout on the printer to find&nbsp;the default IP address (read the printer or jet direct card's instructions to find out how to printout or otherwise find the settings of the Jetdirect
 card) you can then create a new "printer port" using the IP address of the jet direct card to attach the two.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 192.0.0.192 is generally NOT a&nbsp; default IP address of any device (I've never seen this anywhere.)&nbsp; More likely it would be something like 192.168.1.xxx.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You should also be able to purchase a 4 port switch and do the same thing with standard ethernet cables.&nbsp; Plug the computer and printer's jet direct card into the switch.</div>

<h3> benjamin bleser aacom  say:</h3>
<h2>            HP Desktop&#47;NVIDIA GeForce 9200&#47;9300GE&#40;s&#41; Monitor display blank at BIOS</h2>
                    <ul>
<li><a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/product?cc=us&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;product=3740333" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><u>HP m8530f</u></b></a><b><u><br />
</u></b>
<ul>
<li><b><u>Prod#: KT334AAABA</u></b></li></ul>
</li></ul>
<i><b><u>==========================================================================================================================<br />
<br />
<br />
Initial Summary:</u></b><br />
<br />
My original operating system on this machine was Vista Home Premium<br />
The problem occurred most acutely during the installation of Windows 7 Professional, and hasn't gone away since.<br />
When I start up the computer, the monitor is completely blank until the Windows OS initializes all the way.<br />
This means that BIOS is completely inaccessible, unless you do guess work.<br />
I will explain it from beginning to end to, as best as I can recall, so maybe somebody could identify an issue.<br />
</i><br />
<u><b>Here it goes:</b></u><br />
<br />
I am unable to view, navigate through, or change any element of my BIOS settings because when I start my desktop, the monitor is completely blank. The power button is still on "Standby/Hibernate", and the only thing I can tell is that my computer is thinking
 really hard about what it's doing because I hear either the Hard Drive whirring, and spinning in really fast, short erratic bursts, or I hear what sounds like the motor of a fan or even an actual fan.<br />
<p><b>Some key knowledge (With Vista still installed)<br />
</b></p>
<p>- When I bought the computer, it came with a DVI -VGA adapter plug.</p>
<p>- I was told by an HP customer service representative to unplug the DVI-VGA adapter at one point in time while troubleshooting a similar issue.</p>
<p>- I was told by this same CSR to plug the VGA into the VGA port and the DVI into the DVI port and plug both into my monitor at the same time.<br />
</p>
- That fixed the problem at the point in time.<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<b>BEFORE EVERYTHING:</b><u><br />
This problem is about 4 years old. This first occurred when I reformatted the hard drive. Here's what I can remember (as vividly as possible):</u><br />
<ol>
<li>I bought the computer in 2008, and used it for about 7 months; this HP Desktop was a Windows Vista Home Premium Media Center bundle, so the initial operating system that was installed on the drive was Windows Vista Home Premium.</li><li>So after ~7 months, I said ,"Eff that," and I bought Windows 7 Professional; I was so excited to get rid of Windows Vista.</li><li>I then backed up what I wanted from my hard drive, reformatted, and began installing W7HP.</li></ol>
<p><b>The first idiot light comes on:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Shutting down the computer, then restarting with the setup disc in the drive, I notice that, after about 3 hours...the progress bar is still at half.</li><li>I also notice that the optical drive has gone completely silent...and so has the computer...aside from the occasional whisper of a crank...</li><li>As best as I can remember...I believe I did NOT remove the disk as I shut off the computer.</li></ul>
<p><b>The second idiot light comes on:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>This is where it gets frustrating: The first initial step for installation passed this time, and I went through the first standard restart for the installation...but then...when the restart came, the BIOS screen did not display.</li><li>The monitor was blank for a good hour before I got worried...so I restarted...and decided that I would just wait to see what happens.</li><li>The installation failed.</li></ul>
<p><b>The third idiot light comes on:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>By the second failure of the installation, I had just about fabricated a plan as to how I might go Ed Gein on Bill Gates, but then I finally got it to work by waiting the full length of time after reformatting just to be safe.</li><li>At 4am I installed Windows 7 Professional....</li><li>The screen was blank until I heard the Windows theme tune confirming that it was installed.</li><li>And every consecutive restart, the screen was still blank...even when I restored all my files and updated all of my drivers...the screen was still blank.<br />
</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I decided I could live with this minor annoyance, for the time...because at least it wasn't Vista.</p>
<p>That is until.............I wanted to BOOT from an EXTERNAL DEVICE and needed to change my STARTUP settings in....-----&gt; BIOS &lt;------<br />
</p>
<p>Or when I got a nasty VIRUS and needed to go into SAFE MODE to restore to an earlier image.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><u><b>Barring [Trial &amp; Error] With A Baseball Bat:</b></u><br />
</p>
<p>Here's what my efforts have been in attempting to solve this problem:</p>
<ol>
<li>I remove the VGA cable and rely only on the DVI I/O - <b>[Fail]</b></li><li>I remove the DVI cable and rely only on the VGA I/O - <b>[Fail]</b></li><li>I rely on Geek Squad to take care of the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - <b>[Fail]</b> <i>(They upgraded my graphics drivers)</i><br />
<ul>
<li>To be fair, this did solve the issue with relying on VGA, for a period of time, from what I can remember.<br />
</li></ul>
</li><li>I update Windows 7 Professional - <b>[Fail]</b></li><li>I use both cables at the same time again. - [<b>Fail]</b> <i>(Now I can't see anything...only with DVI]</i></li><li>I use the adapter plug. - [<b>Fail]</b></li></ol>
<p>So, about a year and a half ago, I attempted to use the adapter plug again, and it actually worked. I recently attempted it again, and I can't remember whether it was successful or not. I believe I have either lost it, or misplaced it., since then. But for
 good measure...it would still be in the VGA port if it worked, so I believe it failed.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm not willing to throw out the possibility that it has to do with maybe an issue with the analog video graphics array signal...maybe it's just not present? In which case, maybe I need to check to see if there's a short? But it seems unlikely. So allow
 me to summarize once more:<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Summary<br />
</p>
<p>After formatting my hard drive that originally contained Windows Vista Home Premium, and installing Windows 7 Professional, I was unable to view the start up screen for my desktop. BIOS is completely inaccessible, and POST makes no beeps. Now, after a few
 years, when powering on the tower, a device from within the computer makes loud whirring noises. The noises I believe to be a possible result of dust accumulation (the Processor Fan, or the GFX fan could need to be cleaned) since I have not cleaned it in quite
 some time. <br />
</p>
<p>Restoring drivers has not worked.</p>
<p>Using different cables and monitors has not worked.</p>
<p>Adapting the DVI signal with a DVI-VGA plug has worked partially.</p>
<p>There is still a Windows Vista Home Premium recovery partition on the Hard Drive.</p>
<p><b>I can provide additional information as needed upon request.</b><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'd really like to get this resolved. I've taken this to Geek Squad twice. I don't know what I'm paying them for because it wasn't fixed.<br />
I've partially fixed it on my own, but the issue is recurring. <br />
</p>
<p>If anybody has the slightest inkling of what the problem could be, please let me know. I've provided all the information I think is relevant and necessary. Filler aside, I think I've got it pretty accurate.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks <br />

            <p>There is a single Bios update from HP for this model, have you updated it?</p>
<p>The Bios screens should appear prior to win starting and are not reliant on any win7 drivers, thus your problem appears to be hardware related, but then you have tried different monitor cables/monitor and the different connectors, so I'm perplexed</p>
<p>HP as you will have realised doesnt supply win7 drivers for this model.</p>

            That's a good idea. I can't believe I didn't consider the BIOS itself, although I did remove the battery for CMOS for quite some time.<br />
<br />
I guess, if that doesn't work, the only thing I can see working is reinstalling the OS. But I don't suppose that'd really do much if it's a hardware issue.<br />
<br />
I'm going to have to find my adapter. I want to give that one more try too, I suppose. I've just been unable to do anything in regards to recovery, or anything related to the BIOS configuration.
<br />
<br />
And I'm really not big on reinstalling Vista Home Premium. <br />
<br />
So, I'll have it updated and I'll see what it does and just post of it works. Guess there isn't any other answer. :/<br />
<br />
Thanks though. I hope for my sake it works. <br />

<h2>            &#34;Ongoing Call&#34; Message in pop-up Window</h2>
                    <p>When I make or receive a call on Skype for Android (v8.35.0.71) on my mobile, once the call is answered there appears an additional pop-up window at the top of the phone that says "Ongoing Call" and it makes a sound which is quite distracting. During the
 call, this pop-up window reappears periodically and keeps making a sound each time, so it's very distracting and the person on the other end of the call often asks what is the noise so now I can't use Skype for important calls as this constant interruption
 becomes a significant distraction to the person called.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why does this additional window appear and can I stop it?</p>

            <p>Troubleshooter did not fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be more in depth about problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 external hard drives connected thru a USB bus and 2 internal hard drives.&nbsp; I am running windows 10.&nbsp; When I try to copy files, folders, etc (using windows explorer) from the internal drives to the external drives, or even from the external drives
 to each other, the system just hangs for about 5 seconds, the screen goes black, comes back to the desktop (which is blank of icons) and then starts to set all of the icons on the desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows explorer is closed and the function is not completed.&nbsp; At no point does an error message appear.&nbsp; I am listed as an administrator for the system, I have made sure that all permissions are set to full, and all of the drives are fully shared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did go into safe mode function for windows 10 and there were not problems copying files and folders back and forth; but when I re-booted back into full windows, the problem "re-appeared"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanx,</p>
<p>

<p>However, when I look over to the right, my latency is at like 262 ms and its not supposed to be that high I believe. It just caught my eye cause is it something I should be majorly concerned with?</p>

<h2>            How can I add Win 10 to a new partition &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Win 10 32 bit after upgrading from Win 7 pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find I need to up to the 64 bit but I have many programs installed and don't want to lose them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was thing of 2 options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.Create a new partition and install Win 10 64 bit on it, then slowly add the programs and see if they all worked. I would still have them all on mthe 32 partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Clone my Primary Win 10 disk and then try and convert my 32 to 64.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any better solutions please. I do not want to have to buy a new licence as I had just bought the 7 one recentl.y before the up to 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>If I had to check my old programs work on 64Bit machine, I would just try installing them on an already existing 64bit machine. Maybe on my friends machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the programs works fine then they should work fine on my "64 bit supported" computer too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would Image backup my 32 bit Win 10 computers' C drive using "backup and restore" option to my Ext. hard drive and clean install 64 bit version over the C drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please begin with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 10 Media Creation Tool</a>&nbsp;(Select 64 bit (x64)).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it doesn't work out, you can safely restore back using your Image backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Yes thank you. I have done an image with True Image 2016 to another drive and also a full clone to an ext disk I attached for the exercise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The clean install would require a new $$$ licence I guess. Shame as the upgrade from 7 will not be used once I get the 64 happening.</p>
<p>

    <title>Can I not Spark on Windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> muddycait  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I not Spark on Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    I had windows 7 on my laptop, and found the Project SPark app, decided I wanted to try it. I see two choices for the download , 'xbox' which I do not have, and windows 8.1, and I click on the windows 8.1 box. At this point I get a message pop up that says
 I must update my system to Windows 10 to continue. So I do that. Then I go back to download Project SPark, and various and sundry pop ups for xbox appear, and the game is on a reload loop of the opening sequence. Very pretty. Not much fun though. Is it not
 possible to play Project Spark on Windows 10?

<h2>            Windows 7 Crashes when I try to connect an external monitor - Worked fine with Vista</h2>
                    
<p>I have a year old dell inspiron 1525 (that was originally installed with windows vista) that I would hook up to my big screen tv to watch movies. My hard drive got corrupted and we lost everything. Windows 7 was installed in the repair. Now, when I try to
 "connect to an external monitor", windows 7 tries about 5 times to do something, blacking out, and then crashes. I saw one blue screen saying something about the drivers and a fatal dump error. I have tried setting all the different resolutions, but that doesn't
 seem to help. Are there any more driver updates I can try?</p>

<p>I have a year old dell inspiron 1525 (that was originally installed with windows vista) that I would hook up to my big screen tv to watch movies. My hard drive got corrupted and we lost everything. Windows 7 was installed in the repair. Now, when I try to
 "connect to an external monitor", windows 7 tries about 5 times to do something, blacking out, and then crashes. I saw one blue screen saying something about the drivers and a fatal dump error. I have tried setting all the different resolutions, but that doesn't
 seem to help. Are there any more driver updates I can try?</p>

<h2>            Cannot play news videos on my laptop that uses Windows Vista. Help&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,Two days ago, I did something to erase my ability to play videos on American sites and I believe it has something to do with Adober Flash Player. If I try to play a video on CNN, MSNBC, New York Times etc., I get a message to install Adobe. When I try
 to do so, I will get to 50% and the program stops and instructs me to turn off internet which I don't know how to do.Can someone out there please try to help me?</p>
<p>By the way, I have no problem playing videos on German news sites. </p>

<h2>            My Hard Drive Major Partition won&#39;t show up in Defragmenter</h2>
                    So, this is odd, but when I start my disk derangementer, it won't show my "c" drive.&nbsp; I have 2 drives, a "C" drive and a "D" drive.&nbsp; D is just for backup while C is for all program/system files.&nbsp; So naturally, C needs defraged to make the computer run
 smoothly.&nbsp; Does anybody know a good work around or if I can re-install disk defragmenter from somewhere (please include link to any sites if used if you have a re-instal method). Also I've tried scheduling it as a task and C still won't show up.<br />

DanSiroky</a>,</p>
<p>Windows is reporting that by using its built-in algorithms and by those standards the drives<br />
do not need defragmenting. However there are other commands to change how the defragger<br />
arranges the files on the drive. 3rd party tools also can be used for added functionality and/or<br />
different methods for file arrangement.<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I understand that you are unable to install updates for
</span><span>Microsoft Security Essentials and get error
</span><span>0cx80003f3 and you have issue with Windows updates.</span></p>
<p>Let me know if I have misunderstood.</p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>What
<b>exactly happens</b> when you try to install Windows updates?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may be unable to install Windows updates if the updates components are corrupted.</span></p>
<p><span>To troubleshoot issue with windows updates:</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: Run the troubleshooter</span></b></p>
<p>Refer the site: </p>
<p><b>Open the Windows Update troubleshooter</b></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Update-troubleshooter</a></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Install the updates in clean boot state</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>When the computer is started in clean boot, non Microsoft programs will not be started and any interruption
 from them would be avoided.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the site mentioned below:</span></p>

<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>:
</span><strong><span>Once you are done with clean boot, follow step 3 in the article to set your computer back to normal startup</span></strong><b><span>.</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><strong><span>
 If in case you are connected through a wireless connection then when you start the System Configuration Utility to perform clean boot, click Startup &amp; Services tab one at time and ensure wireless related entry is Checked (Enabled).</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Ban Appeal - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chaoticpotato69  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ban Appeal</h2>
                    
<p>I was banned April 9th, 2014 and again on April 10th 2014 all within a few hours of each other (late at night then early in the morning) &nbsp;for "tampering with my device." Before this ban had occurred, I was already expecting such a thing to happen, though
 I did not know what I should do about it. My best guess for it is that I had been hacked, but I know hackers tend to do so for the contents of your credit card. I do not have my credit card linked to it, so that option is ruled out. My Xbox 360 had the characteristics
 of a modded Xbox 360. A few of my games were modded, and my character was too with blue skin. My Xbox was off and in my room while I was asleep and at school the next day. I came home from school to the suspension message. I did not do any of the tampering
 myself, and I don't have any siblings who would do it. If you would like to review my current Xbox Account (Gamertag: ChaoticPotato69) you will find it has not been tampered with. I have no motives for tampering my game play, I have a pride thing where I like
 to do everything on my own. I play survival in MineCraft and refuse to let myself go into creative to get items. It's just something up with me, I'm not sure why. I would like to have my ban on Bassbully398 appealed because I had some great friends on their
 I'd enjoy playing with once again, and I invested much of my money into the games and avatar store available. I am familiar with the Codes of Conduct and I know that device tampering can result in a permanent suspension, so I have no motive for throwing all
 that money and enjoyable time with friends away. I have tried to get this ban appealed before, though I never received emails or notifications about it, so I'm not quite sure what happened. The banned account's Gamer Tag again is BassBully398, tied to the
 email <strong>[Mod Removed: Please do not insert private email adresses on a public forum]</strong>. Also, I spoke to a support member of the Microsoft team and we already tried to do it through the Case Review of the Policy &amp; Enforcement page, though it would
 not allow me, so she recommended this. Thank your for taking time out of your day to read this. It means a lot to me.</p>

    <title>Surface 3 literally unusable with these two problems - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface 3 literally unusable with these two problems</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello guys. I love my Surface 3 but it has two major problems. Both of these problems prevent me from doing anything in my beloved Surface.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p><span>For a bit of backstory, I got this Surface in 2014 and the warranty period has long ended.</span></p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p><span>The problems are as below:</span></p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p><span>1. Randomly shuts down</span></p>
<p><span>My laptop started randomly turning off since the day I got it. I didn’t care since it didn’t happen so often. Now it happens everytime I turn my Surface on. Usually,
 just accessing the Desktop will crash it. Sometimes, opening up an application will crash it. Other times, it won’t even turn on. It just displays “Surface” and a spinning wheel and then turns off, instead of giving me the log-in screen as it should. After
 several crashes, when I try to turn it back on again, it will display a message saying “Scanning and Repairing Disk (C:) 0%” and proceeds to scan and repair for several minutes but obviously it never fixed the issue. I’ve heard people say it is a known hardware
 issue with the Surface 3, so if it’s possible, please line me up for getting a new one.</span></p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p><span>As of now, the applications that seem to cause this problem are: Google Chrome, MuseScore and iExplorer.</span></p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p><span>2. Plugged in, not charging</span></p>
<p><span>Almost everytime I look at the battery icon, it displays a charger at the side of the logo. When I click on it, it displays “16% (Plugged in, *not charging* .)
 As a student with quite a bit of a technologic knowledge myself, I reckon that it is charging, just so slowly that Windows doesn’t care about the flow of energy. Usually, it will charge for 10~14 days before the battery level gets increased again by a little
 (20~40%). It takes me almost a month to get it fully charged. After plugging the same A/C adapter and wire (Micro-B) into my other devices, it seems like only my Surface 3 laptop is getting this issue as all the other devices I have charges normally and usually
 gets 100% battery in 3~4 hours. Because of the disproportionately long charging time for my laptop, for about half of every month, the laptop is literally unusable. I hope you understand my pain.</span></p>
<p><span>After digging on the internet, I again found that this is quite a known issue with the Surface. May users have been reporting about the slow charging and sometimes
 even the battery draining extremely quickly.</span></p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p><span>Both of these problems may be solved by the time I am writing this, and a new product without all of these problems might have already been released into the market.
 If that is the case, I would not mind to buy it but with all these problems right now I cannot move any of my files to the new laptop anyway. I hope you can give a fix to my problem as soon as possible as it is quite urgent. But anyways, thank you and happy
 π day to y’all!</span></p>

I purchased this from my friend, who bought it a year earlier than when I bought it from him.

<p>I'm having exactly the same problem with charging.</p>
<p>Bought the device new less than 3 years ago.</p>
<p>So, based on your reply to Truncation, I come to the same conclusion: the Surface 3 is basically a disposable device that is good for the trash bin when the battery goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is outrageous--built-in obsolescence at its worst. At this price point I would have expected better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really enjoyed using this device and my husband was planning to buy one as well for his work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never again with this garbage.</p>

<p>I was able to solve ALL charging issues with my Surface 3 by purchasing the Surface 3 docking station off Amazon (probably can also purchase off eBay). &nbsp;Make sure it’s the Surface 3 docking station and not the Surface Pro docking station.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The micro USB charging cable and power adapter are worthless on the Surface 3!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Surface 3 docking station solved ALL of my charging issues since it uses a different port to charge the Surface 3.</p>

<p>So the only solution is to get a docking station!!! Then it no longer serves as a portable device.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too am having surface 3 frustrations. I travel a lot for work and liked that, I didn't have to lug a laptop around. Now the device has gotten so unreliable that I cant use it. I was thinking of upgrading to the surface pro, but now.......... I'm thinking
 Lenovo.</p>

<p>I started getting the random shutdowns of my Surface 3 when the battery was still at 30% charge or so.&nbsp; Over that level, it's OK.&nbsp; I now get a few hours running on battery which is really no surprise since the device is about 5 years old now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did buy the dock earlier this year and the S3 works w/o problems with it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also recall reading that plugging the charging cable in first to the S3 followed by plugging in the charger to an outlet often "fixed" that charger issue.&nbsp; Certainly worth a try.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
