<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
This fix is likely the same for your issue :</p>
<p>How do I stop my music from skipping or breaking up when I play it?<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/How-do-I-stop-my-music-from-skipping-or-breaking-up-when-I-play-it" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/How-do-I-stop-my-music-from-skipping-or-breaking-up-when-I-play-it</span></a><br />
<br />
1. Right Click Speaker Icon near clock lower right&nbsp;- Playback Devices<br />
<br />
Highlight Speakers - Properties (lower right same page) - Enhancements&nbsp; Tab - Check Disable all<br />
Sound Effect&nbsp; Apply - OK&nbsp; - look at the other settings there and on other tabs.<br />
<br />
2. Control Panel - Device Manager - Sound, Video and Game Controller<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High<br />
Definition Audio&nbsp;(that is an example and yours may have an entirely different name/maker).<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version.<br />
Now Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers.<br />
Then RIGHT CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click on<br />
and RUN AS ADMIN (This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE : Sound drivers often rollback so check the version after installation and the<br />
reboot to see if the version you installed is there, if not repeat the install&nbsp;- reboot<br />
until it is. It can take several tries depending on how many rollbacks it does.</strong><br />
<br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
</span></span></span><br />
Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
<strong>Also Right Click Speaker near clock - Playback Devices - right click in the box area -<br />
check Show disable and disconnected devices. Highlight speaker and on the&nbsp;lower<br />
Right click Properties check settings for Device Usage enabled and so on. Also do<br />
same for Configure on Lower Left of that box.<br />

<h2>            Minecraft Marketplace Transfering</h2>
                    I recently bought minecraft for xbox one and realized the marketplace content from my Nintendo Switch didn’t transfer. I’ve been searching for a solution but have been left empty.

            Yeah the content does not transfer over. If you want to play it on the platform you are using now, then you will need to pay for it again.

<h3> john m fahmy  say:</h3>
<h2>            wlmail.exe - System Error__The program can&#39;t start because d3d10_1.dll is missing from your computer.</h2>
                    
<p>I had a serious chronic error with Critical Update for Silverlight that failed more than once, so until I could find a solution for that problem I was always disabling that update and 2 others related to Microsoft Office updates that failed too, until I
 notice a NEW UPDATE for Windows Life Mail which was running on my system perfectly well, I authorized the update and left it to work ...It installed msn messenger, photo gallery, and then suddenly popped a window asking for information on Silverlight that
 were the original cause of failing to install that update on this particular window I clicked cancel, the window closed and continued the installation, or lest us say seemed to continue the installation installing some ActiveX components, live mail, it was
 reaching somewhere 70-80% done then would start rolling back to zero% telling me Installation failed click to see...</p>
<p>On troubleshooting that problem I could clearly see there was a problem with installing the photo gallery and mainly on that stage I was always prompted to answer where the original Silverlight Installation was ...a location was there that windows could
 not find and I could not replace it until I contacted Microsoft Technical Support with Silverlight update and got it sorted out....</p>
<p>When trying to install that update and failing it was telling me that everything was rolling back as it was and really I could still use msn live, wlmail and all other components of windows life essentials that were installed and working perfectly good prior
 to that update, I tried once more just to give it a try it happen exactly the same error and rolled back to the original windows live essentials and everything was working as usual, I tried the help link which took me back to the stat point of installing the
 update so I thought to eliminate the photo gallery update and left msn and mail selected and tried to update, which worked the same way like if I was installing the whole update and failed again rolled back here I tried a 4th time deselecting all components
 leaving only Live Mail selected, again same procedure happened but when rolling back and trying to access my wlmail.com I got that dll error!! At the beginning it was telling me d3d9.dll was missing try reinstalling the program it might correct the problem...</p>
<p>It is then when I decided to find a solution with Silverlight update failing to install and contacted the Microsoft Technical support with that problem which they helped me solve it and thought I had found the magical solution for windows live update as
 now silverlight was installed and run again that update it did not ask for Silverlight it went all the way to 90% then failed and rolled back the reason this time was photo gallery was not responding! I run the windows clean up utility which solved me problem
 with Silverlight update I found about 4-5 occurrences or each windows live component that is 4-5 msn messenger installations, photo gallery, ...wlmail.com so I cleaned them all and run the update which finally got installed, but the ERROR REMAINED it was d3d9.dll
 now changed to d3d10_1.dll is missing...</p>
<p>I'll appreciate any technical advise including a real download for the missing dll file(s) as I tried lots of sites which lead to some advertising to download some program or another that will magically solve my problem!!</p>
<p>Thanks for your support!!</p>

<p>PA Bear MS MVP</p>
<p>Thanks for your quote, I did follow the link and did as advised I could not uninstall Windows Live Essentials 2011 as it kept giving error and rolling back, so in an self effort I tried to uninstall Windows Live Essentials 2011 component by component i.e
 WLMSN, WLMAIL, and so on I could finally uninstall all of them with the exception of Windows Live Photo Gallery his at 26-27% gives two errors and rolls back so now only Phot gallery can not be uninstalled, I posted the detailed error on that site and got
 a private response from the moderator almost a week ago I was asked to export my Install register to verify which version is Installed and I did upload it got no feed back so far I still have the missing dll error at the start up from dwm.exe -which I have
 no clue which program is calling it but for sure it is a Microsoft start up program as when I did a selective start up and disabled all start up programs including the Microsoft ones the error disappeared, once I re-enabled Microsoft services it appeared again!!</p>
<p>Bottom line the Roll Back of failed installation of Windows Live Essentials 2011 screwed up my wlmail which I can no more access it no MSN messenger and no activex due to those missing DLLs!!</p>
<p>I really need back my wlmail.exe working and I'm to the point to do a restore or wipe out the whole hard drive and re-install Windows 7 so please your urgent support is required!!</p>

<br />
<br />
Note the fact that you're computer is 64 bit is not really the issue.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are using the 64 bit version of Internet Explprer or another 64 bit browser then the 64 bit Java is also needed.&nbsp; Otherwise not so much.<br />

<h3> useful43  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#39;Directory name is invalid&#39; when trying to access files on mapped network drive</h2>
                    <p>The file server on this local area network is running Windows Server 2012.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On any of the Windows 7 (Pro 64-bit) PCs on this network, when trying to double-click on a file on a mapped network drive, the error 'The Directory Name is invalid' is displayed and the files cannot be opened.
<br />
<br />
Opening the same files on the mapped drive by first running their respective applications and then selecting 'Open' opens any of the files fine, as does using 'Open with' and then choosing the relevant application, as does copying the files from the mapped
 drive to a local drive and then&nbsp;using double-click.<br />
<br />
I would be grateful if someone can solve this mystery for me.</p>

    <title>No sound in some games - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zenzechen  say:</h3>
<h2>            No sound in some games</h2>
                    <p>I know that this isn't a Microsoft question, and I'm sorry, I've asked on all forums and I haven't came up with answers yet. I need help.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Games like: Call of Duty Black Ops 4, Ravenfield, Borderlands 2, Battlefield V and etc. There are more games that I just haven't discovered that don't have sound. Some games do have sound for example, Fallout 4, Counter Strike Global Offensive, and etc&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I think is the problem: I think the problem is I am missing a driver because when I looked in my device manager awhile back there were two drivers for sound drivers, High Definition Audio Device, (which I think came with windows or something) and Realtek
 High Definition Audio Device. Currently only Realtek High Definition Audio Device is there. Maybe that is the problem? That i'm missing the High Definition Audio Device?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC: MSI GET72VR Apache Pro</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specs:</p>
<li>Windows 10 Home</li><li>I7-7700HQ processor</li><li>NVIDIA Geforce GTX1050TI</li><li>17.3" FHD, Anti-Glare Wide View Angle 120Hz 5ms&nbsp;

            Hi Zen.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give you all possible solutions for Sound problems.  If you have any problems performing any steps I'll be standing by here to help you.
<br />
<br />1)  Update the sound driver from the PC or device maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model, if it is newer than the one presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  While there compare to make sure you also have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display, Network and all other drivers.  
<br />
<br />2) Restore the Windows Audio Service which may have become disabled: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-restore-default-services-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/57567-resto...</a> 
<br />
<br />3) Next try this checklist:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4026994/windows-fix-sound-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/402699...</a>
<br />
<br />4) Right click Volume icon in System Tray, choose Sound Settings, from the Output and Input devices dropdown menus, choose then one(s) affected to see if that helps.  If not use the Troubleshoot button nearby. 
<br />
<br />5) Run the Playing Sound troubleshooter at Start button &gt; Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />6) Try rolling back the sound drivers in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Choose Sound controller and other audio devices, then Driver tab, then Roll back if available.  
<br />  
<br />7) If no newer sound drivers then uninstall the one presently installed in Device Manager, reached by right clicking the Start Button.  Restart PC to reinstall.  
<br />
<br />8) Try other and older drivers for your model Sound controller, too.  For example, try the next oldest driver in the model's online Support Downloads list.  To try all previous drivers installed on your system, in Device Manager choose Sound controller's Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick.  
<br /> 
<br />9) If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />10) If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />11) You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />12) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />13) If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

            Hi ZenZeChen
<br />
<br />If you have sound in some games or in other apps on your PC, then logically, the problem is definitely not your Audio driver, and most likely not with Windows at all . . .
<br />
<br />Is there any specific sound settings in the games that you have no audio on that needs to be adjusted?
<br />
<br />My laptop is very similar to yours, at the bottom right of your screen do you see a blue icon for Nahimic - that is the main sound processor on an MSI device
<br />
<br />If not you need to download and install that from the MSI website, then check through that utility to see if there are settings that need to be adjusted on that . ..

<p>I do have Nahimic and I do see the blue Icon on the bottom left corner, but I've checked through all the sound settings in all of the games and all of them are set to 100 master volume. If I do go into Nahimic what setting am I looking for?

<br />If you do not have any audio at all on your laptop, open the Settings App, go to Update and Security - Troubleshoot, from there, run the Playing Audio troubleshooter . . .

            Hi again -
<br />
<br />You should not have to enable the Built-in Administrator as there must always be one Admin User account on the PC to even have any other accounts.  
<br />
<br />Why are you not operating under an Admin account?  See here how to change:  <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/how-change-user-account-type-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.windowscentral.com/how-change-user-...</a>
<br />
<br />If you don't have an Admin account then enable Hidden Admin by one of these methods to change your account to Admin or create a New Admin User account to operate under, move your files over, test all programs work before deleting the old account:

<h2>            Backspace randomly stops working</h2>
                    I will be typing something and have to hit the backspace and it does not work unless I grab the mouse and click the curser in front on the sentence I am trying to backspace/ correct. It then works for several minutes but that is all. I'll be typing another
 email or something and randomly it stops working again. I cannot figure it out. Is this a windows 10 issue? I never had problems until I bought this new computer with windows 10.

<h2>            Taskhost.exe is running at 50&#37; CPU&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>In the last week or two I've noticed that at certain points (I think only when my laptop is plugged into the AC power source) my laptop fans start running loudly, which attracts me to notice that suddenly taskhost.exe (under the user name "LOCAL SERVICE")
 is taking up continously 50% of my CPU power.This doesn't happen constantly, just a random sporadic ocassions. The allocation of 50% will then no subside until I do a system restart.</p>
<p>Clearly windows shouldn't be doing this... Can someone provide any assistance? I've read another answer
<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7performance/thread/0882ab46-43ee-4d90-8404-6802f8f4f2cf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> but that doesn't answer my problem - I've run a full system virus scan and cannot detect any virus present.</p>
<p>Microsoft, can you help?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern and frustration you have been through. I will be glad to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Did clean up system files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could theoretically run any Operating System, including the Windows 10 Tech Preview, off of an external HDD. However, I would not advise you to do so, as USB 2 and 3 are very slow when compared to SATA 2 or 3.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Refer the link below and check.</p>

</p><p>If&nbsp;you need to free up more space, you can also delete system files. refer the link below.</p>

<p>Everyone in this thread who is having connection issues, here are some steps that should help your resolve the problems.<br />
<br />
To reset the TCP/IP stack go to this article and either click on "Fix it for me" or follow the instructions to fix it yourself:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299357" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299357</a></p>
<p>Disable the IP Helper service:</p>
<p>1. Hold the Windows key and type R, enter "services.msc" (without the quotes) and press Enter<br />
2. Scroll down to the IP Helper service, right click on it and select Properties<br />
3. In the dropdown box that says "Automatic" or "Manual", set it to Disabled and then click on "Apply"<br />
4. Then click on "Stop" to stop the service from running in the current session<br />
5. Click OK to exit the dialog</p>
<p>Disable IPv6:<br />
Try uninstalling IPv6 on all interfaces, removing any IPv6 virtual adapters, and resetting the TCP/IP stack.&nbsp; To remove IPv6, go into the properties for each network adapter and either uncheck the box next to the protocol "Internet Protocol version 6 (TCP/IPv6),
 that will disable it, or select it and click uninstall, which will remove it off the computer.&nbsp; Then go into device manager and remove any 4to6 adapters,&nbsp;miniport adapters, or tunnel adapters.</p>
<p>NOTE: You should do this for each network connection.</p>
<p>Disable the DHCP Broadcast Flag:</p>
<p>Link: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/928233" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/928233</a><br />
Important This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection,
 back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:
<br />
322756&nbsp; (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/</a> ) How to back up and restore the registry in Windows</p>
<p>Windows Vista cannot obtain an IP address from certain routers or from certain non-Microsoft DHCP servers<br />
To resolve this issue, disable the DHCP BROADCAST flag in Windows Vista. To do this, follow these steps:
<br />
Click Start, type regedit in the Start Search box, and then click regedit in the Programs list.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.
<br />
Locate and then click the following registry subkey:<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\Interfaces\{GUID}<br />
In this registry path, click the (GUID) subkey that corresponds to the network adapter that is connected to the network.<br />
On the Edit menu, point to New, and then click DWORD (32-bit) Value.<br />
In the New Value #1 box, type DhcpConnEnableBcastFlagToggle, and then press ENTER.<br />
Right-click DhcpConnEnableBcastFlagToggle, and then click Modify.<br />
In the Value data box, type 1, and then click OK.<br />
Close Registry Editor.<br />
By setting this registry key to 1, Windows Vista will first try to obtain an IP address by using the BROADCAST flag in DHCP Discover packets. If that fails, it will try to obtain an IP address without using the BROADCAST flag in DHCP Discover packets.</p>
<p>The only program I'm aware of that currently relies on IPv6 is the new Windows Meeting Space. The first 2 changes will cause that program not to work - but will leave all of your normal (IPv4) connections unaffected. If it causes problems that you can't
 overcome, simply revert back to the original settings.</p>
<p>To flush the DNS cache:<br />
Click Start, type cmd in the Start Search box, and then click cmd in the Programs list.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.
<br />
Once at the command prompt, type ipconfig /flushdns<br />
<br />
If having problems connecting to a wireless router:<br />
Try changing the channel on your router.&nbsp; Start at channel 13 and go down one channel at a time.&nbsp; There could be a non-broadcasting router in your area on the same channel as yours.</p>
<p>Go to Control Panel &gt; Network and Sharing Center. Click on "Manage wireless networks".
<br />
Remove all other networks except yours. <br />
Right click on your network. <br />
Click Properties. <br />
Open Connection tab. <br />
Do checkmarks on "Connect automatically when this network is in range"<br />
and "Connect even if the network is not broadcasting"; and remove checkmark<br />
from "Connect to a more preffed network if available".<br />
<br />
Let us know if this resolves your issues.<br />
Thank you,</p>

    <title>Error message when using Movie maker &#34;the video device cannot be - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> need an answer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error message when using Movie maker &#34;the video device cannot be used at this time because there has been an error when starting the device&#34;.</h2>
                    I'm attempting to use Movie maker (v2.1) to CAPTURE video (and sound) from a web cam that is connected to the PC via a USB port (the audio is connected via a microphone input).<br />
the device works just fine with many other applications (Skype, other video capture applications, Logitech apps. etc.) but Movie Maker (v2.1) continuously declare that "the video device cannot be used at this time because there has been an error when starting
 the device".<br />
There is no provision that I'm aware that allows (via MM application or otherwise) to correct this problem. I was able to use such setup a while back and it is also works great (with MM2) on another PC. I ned help in finding the correct place (registry or otherwise)
 to fix this.<br />
<br />
HELP!

            Like all ports, my firewire port isn't responding. I've been capturing video from my JVC fir 6 years and like usual, it's a hassle to try and figure out why the cord isn't connecting it. The first thing I did was read some instructions saying to uninstall
 the device. Under Portable Devices (I think) there showed an error icon, so I did. Nothing happened. So I find out what a fireware is and look under IEEE 1394 Bus host controllers. Search all over the internet, chat to a live person. Conclusion is it's a bad
 cable or bad hardware. So I have to get the port replaced? I don't see why computer's ports have to suddenly stop responding.<br />

<h2>            Windows UPDATE &#34;We couldn&#39;t connect to the update service. We&#39;ll try again later, or you can check now. If it still doesn&#39;t work, make sure you&#39;re connected to the Internet.&#34;</h2>
                    <p><br />
What were the steps? I just updated <strong>THREE </strong>computers and <strong>
NONE </strong>of them are able to connect to Windows Update. I did an "in-place upgrade" on one of them and it did
<strong>not </strong>resolve the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>MESSAGE</strong>: "We couldn't connect to the update service. We'll try again later, or you can check now. If it still doesn't work, make sure you're connected to the Internet."<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE is KB4476976 (OS Build 17763.292)</p>
<p>
</p><p>And, yes, I am connected to the internet. This is very annoying. If it is an issue/bug (and it must be) how does MS plan on rolling out a fix if users cannot connect to Windows Update? I have tried all the known fixes out there (stop/start services related
 to WU, run various commands in an elevated command prompt, perform an in-place upgrade, you name it. Nothing works).</p>
<p>

<br />Update servers are currently down and you look to be affected by this issue. Please wait for another 24 hours and see if the issue persists.

            Yup, this has been an issue since Yesterday. The volume of affected people is a bit less, so it might take a while for MS to acknowledge this and fix.

            Seems like the servers have been down for at least two days, if not longer. Could this be an attack on Microsoft? I would think that it would be on the news but I haven't heard anything. Microsoft should say something regarding this issue. Sweeping it
 under the rug won't do any good.

<p>This is an unacceptable and widespread issue that has been going on for me since late evening on 29th Jan. It seems to be globally affected as I am in the UK. Quite why MS think it is acceptable to leave devices relying on virus definition updates to Defender
 unable to update and be potentially insecure is beyond me. I have seen suggestions that DNS changes can fix but this is not acceptable either and will be lost on the masses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case defender definitions get stuck on downloading (0%) and eventually after 30-60 mins error out. Store app is flakey, taking a long to time to check for updates when I click 'get updates', eventually the box stops circling and goes blue but I am
 not sure it's checking properly as I no longer see message 'your apps etc are all up to date blah blah blah' that usually comes up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tweeted MS support but they seem incapable of grasping the situation firing back canned responses and not actually acknowledging they have an issue.</p>

<h2>            My Headphones Don&#39;t Work on my PC &#91;SOLVED&#93;</h2>
                    My Razer Kraken headset recently stopped working on my Windows 10 64bit Lenovo Desktop PC. The headset works perfectly with other devices, however when I plug it in to my PC, I can't hear anything. I checked the control panel to see what was wrong and
 it says that my headset is disconnected, but it is clearly plugged into the computer. The headset was working perfectly until one day I plugged it in to play a video game and I couldn't hear anything. I made sure to un-mute the headset, restart the computer,
 tried to set the headset to default on the control panel, but nothing worked. I've also plugged in other headsets to see if they worked, but I couldn't hear them. It seems like the problem is coming from my PC, but I don't know how to fix it. Please help,
 I need my headset working ASAP! Thanks! :)

<p>Hi Wilfredo,</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply! I ran the troubleshoot on my headset and it said "device isn't set as default." I opened up sound settings and made sure the headset was set to default. I then tried to watch a video, but got no sound at all. I went back to my sound
 settings in the control panel and apparently my headset is "disconnected". I really don't understand why I keep on getting the "disconnected" error even though my headset is clearly connected to my computer. I've even tried connecting it into the other jack
 but still got the same error. Thanks again for your fast reply! I hope I will be able to resolve this issue soon.</p>

            I was able to fix the issue last night. Apparently, my Bluetooth speakers were interfering with my headset, so I deleted the speakers from the computer, plugged in my headset and it worked like a charm!

                    I have been using Windows 7 for about 1 year. I finally got up the courage to try to burn a DVD of my photos. I inserted the blank DVD-R but when I click "Burn", I get the following message: DVD-R is not a writable disc. What am I doing wrong?&nbsp; I use Windows
 Media Player. Any advice would be welcome.

            <p><span>Hi MikeShulman,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can try running the DVD troubleshooter and check.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-playing-and-burning-cds-dvds-and-bluray-discs-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Open the Playing
 and Burning CDs, DVDs, and Blu<span>‑</span>ray Discs troubleshooter</a>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the disc you inserted is identified as "Blank disc" in the Navigation pane but a message in the List pane instructs you to insert a writable
 disc, the disc might be defective or no longer writable. You can try using other blank discs and check if it works.</span></p>
<p><span>You can refer to the following KB article and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929542" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Error message when you try to use the Create CD/DVD wizard to write to a DVD on a Windows

</span></p>
<p><span>Note: This applies to Windows 7 also.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful.

<h2>            Windows 10 Activation after upgrade  using Media Creation Tool</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My&nbsp;previous version (Windows 7 Home Premium) is valid for upgrade to Windows 10. An upgrade was reserved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then successfully&nbsp;upgraded&nbsp;to Windows 10 using Media Creation Tool (windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install?ocid=ms_wol_win10).</p>
<p>
</p><p>But my current the problem is&nbsp;"<strong>Windows can't activate</strong>" while&nbsp;the system reported that the
<strong>five last digits of current product key is different from those in my valid Windows 7 HP key</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do now? Or do I have to roll back to Windows 7 HP and then wait for auto upgrade?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Real time notification not working on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hii .. &nbsp;I have upgraded from windows 8.1 to windows 10 Home . &nbsp;Except from Mails app rest for all the other apps (such as facebook ,twitter etc ) there is no real time notification popping up . I always have to manually open these apps and see what 's new
 . &nbsp;I consulted some of my friends and for them these apps are working just fine . They get all the real time toast notification for all the apps which can pitch any notification . &nbsp;</p>
<p>But for me , only mails app work that way . I am thinking this might have to do something with app loaded in memory i.e. suspended or running but i am just amateur . Please reply soon and I am hoping to avoid resetting windows 10 as some of my installed
 softwares are one time install and can not be recovered that easily .</p>

            Yes &nbsp;,.. My app notifications are turned on ... BUT surprisingly in " notifications and actions" settings only those apps show up which have pushed any notification at least once .. Those which has not yet notified me are not shown in this list ( which

            <p>Hi SamarthPawar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have collected some things for you to try.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>From Microsoft...click on Run Troubleshooter, then click Open on the bar that pops up at the bottom of your window.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read that sometimes manually updating your store apps will help fix apps that are not working correctly.&nbsp; Open the Microsoft store app and click on the people icon next to the search box.&nbsp; Your name will show at the top and on this menu you can check
 for updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/check-for-updates-for-apps-and-games-from-windows-store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/check-for-updates-for-apps-and-games-from-windows-store</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the store isn't working correctly, there are fixes for that, too.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your help but I Tried the solutions you posted . It did not fix the issue .&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) troubleshooter did not detect any issue</p>
<p>2) I manually update all the the apps and i am waiting for facebook app update but they haven't released any . I also tried uninstalling and reinstalling but it is all the same ..twitter ,facebook ,.. no notification what so ever.</p>
<p>3) I had already tried resetting store ( clear stoe cache ) but did not work back then and did not work now .</p>
<p>4) That tutorial was relevant but it did reset my Icons but not the notification it self .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the problem is much deeper because microsoft apps works fine but not the other apps . I fluently get notifications for mails app . Also i noticed on the forum that you suggested many people are facing this issue .</p>
<p>Please let me know if you find some more solutions . &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>What are you seeing in your Windows Firewall settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click on Start.</p>
<p>Click on Control Panel in that menu.</p>
<p>At the top of the Control Panel window, View By: Large Icons.</p>
<p>Look for and click on Windows Firewall.</p>
<p>In the left panel, click on "Allow an App or Feature through Windows Firewall.</p>
<p>If your apps are not in the list, click on "Add another app...." Click on Browse and look for the apps executable or .exe file.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I you use a third party firewall, see if the settings need to be tweeked since installing Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, open Task Manager&nbsp;by right clicking on the taskbar.&nbsp; Click on the Services tab and see if Windows Push Notification Service is running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What antivirus do you use?&nbsp; Is it possible something is blocking the store apps?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know your result.&nbsp; I can continue to research.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit:&nbsp; I thought of something else.&nbsp; How often do you restart your computer?&nbsp;At the first sign of trouble, restarting your computer can sometimes help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I'm seeing in your list is that the apps that are installed are apps that are installed when the upgrade is installed.&nbsp; Your store apps are missing from the list.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your efforts .</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) &nbsp;Facebook , twitter and most of the apps are already in the "allowed" list of firewall .</p>
<p>2) Windows Push notification Services .. it is not running :( &nbsp; &nbsp;It showed stopped when i checked . I manually turned on and did a small &nbsp;test of fb , twitter app but still No change.. i get notifications only if i am in that app ( that too not a toast notification
 &nbsp;) &nbsp;. If that push notification is off i should not even receive my mails too . But Mail app has last update status in the bottom . And it appears Mails app is automatically updated time to time as the last updated status keeps on changing frequently . So
 it is possible that windows push notification services too automatically goes into running state and then back to stopped stage !</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;I frequently restart my laptop . My First choice preference is to shut down and then turn on again when needed . But if something is not right ( which is rarely the case because except from the notification issue ..everything works perfectly well on
 my System ) &nbsp;I restart my Laptop . So lately i do restart just to check if the notification problem has been solved or not .</p>
<p>My System Details :</p>
<p>Hp Pavillion G6&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intel Core i5 - 3230M @ 2.6 GHz.</p>
<p>RAM = &nbsp;8 gb .</p>
<p>First bought with windows 8 then upgraded to windows 8.1 and now to windows 10 .</p>
<p>Also I installed Windows 10 from Media tool available on Microsoft's site .</p>
<p>I had got the pop up that windows 10 is here for download (default method of installing windows 10 )</p>
<p>but download failed twice due to slow net connectivity So i moved to media tool method.</p>
<p>After few days of installing i reset my laptop removing everything ( can be assumed as if i did a clean install ) .</p>
<p>Unfortunately , I could not test &nbsp;whether these notifications for apps were working or not before resetting . But I know it should work as one of my friend also did the same reset . And his notifications are pitched just fine . Ironically , he did not have
 windows 8 or 8.1 in first place . His system is too much outdated and had windows 7 pre-installed . &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another Important Point . In the beginning Mails App was also not working . But Some how it got fixed . &nbsp;I kept on updating whatever updates were released for that app in store . Also window's automatic updates were also installed . So don't know which one
 fixed it . But facebook ,twitter both apps are not giving notifications .So it has to be about my system and not the apps .</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) &nbsp;I use bit defender internet security 2015 &nbsp;. I have tried that before . Turning off firewall and also antivirus and then testing .. same case . no notification</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) &nbsp;Also , if u know some other apps which give real time notifications and are not from Microsoft , Please suggest me So &nbsp;that i can check those too . To get a more clear picture .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You .</p>

            <p>Might you have to authorize your device to use Facebook or Twitter?&nbsp; I use a music service app and I have to login to their website and allow my device in the security settings.&nbsp; I don't use either, so I'm not familiar with what security settings would be
 on their internet site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could also try going to the store and search for a calendar or reminder app that is capable of giving you a notification.&nbsp; I think you can set up notifications in some note-taking&nbsp;apps.&nbsp;

            <p>Hii</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) NO .. I have already checked the sites (fb , twitter ) and there is no external &nbsp;permissions required as these apps are designed by the actual product owners itself .</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I am currently trying all those non- microsoft apps which will give real time notifications ,.. If others do give notifications or there is any improvement in the situation , I will revert back to you (here ) . But until then You please keep on looking
 for any possible solution.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>About the restarting.....Windows no longer shuts completely down.&nbsp; When you choose Shut Down, rather than Restart, you are just sending the computer into a deeper sleep state.&nbsp; Restarting will load everything new, like drivers, settings and such.&nbsp; I try
 to restart every day.&nbsp; It doesn't take much to restart while you are fixing dinner or something.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I overlooked this in your previous email. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When you installed using the media creation tool, did you tell the installation to Upgrade?&nbsp; Did the installation activate?&nbsp; Check to see if you are activated now.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on Start, then Settings, Update and Security, Activation</p>

            <p>Hii ..</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I too restart my laptop more often .. almost 4 times in a week .</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I first upgraded to windows 10 from windows 8.1 and then few days later . I went to settings&gt; &nbsp;Update and Security &gt; Recovery &gt; Reset Your Pc &gt; Remove everything &nbsp;. &nbsp;After that all &nbsp;my HP softwares and all the bloatware that came preinstalled at the time
 of purchase of this laptop was cleaned .&nbsp;</p>
<p>I followed this tutorial from cnet after the upgrade : &nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNKIiHWMugI &nbsp;.</p>
<p>Also I created Media creation tool on my pc itself . So did not create a flash drive bootable or an iso image . I simply Downloaded and Upgraded windows 10 &nbsp;( And after that ..remove everything option ) .</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) My Windows 10 show activated and rest everything works fine except from the discussed issue .</p>
<p>
