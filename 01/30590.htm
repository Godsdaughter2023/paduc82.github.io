<h2>            account transfer, and membership payment</h2>
                    
<p>my problem started off when i tried to sign in to xbox live on the xbox and i get a error message saying "Your account has been suspended due to a problem with your payment option. Please use a different payment option or update your current information
 in Account Management" at first glance i thought this meant that my subscription for xbox live gold hadnt been paid and that was the reason for this issue, so the next day i checked my parents' email address and saw that they had recieved a tax invoice and
 it had been paid off already but the problem still persisted, so i checked the payment option in account management and verified the credit card details i had in there, and it seemed to temporarily fix the problem as my account showed that i had a xbox live
 gold account but when i tried to play a game online i recieved another error code '8C020008' (also it didnt show any of my friends in my profile). So when i couldnt get onto xbox live i tried to access my windows live account and check billing information
 and any other emails that might tell me what was happening but it turns out my account has been hacked into, and i have tried numerous times to regain control over it but everytime i try it doesnt work. i then tried to transfer my gamertag and xbox information
 to a new windows live account i have created but cannot complete the process because when i try and sign in to the old account, i get a message saying my password is incorrect. i dont know what to do, if i could resolve the xboxlive connection problem without
 having to go into my windows live account that (im assuming) would make this easier, but if not is there any way that id be able to transfer information from my original xbox live account, to a new one under my new windows live account? and how do i fix the
 connection problem? &nbsp; &nbsp;(please note that the account i am using to make this post is a new one i have created under my new windows live id)</p>

<p>You can use any mouse with the keyboard, but you MUST have the small USB "dongle" that goes with the keyboard.&nbsp; If you use a wireless mouse, you will need a SEPARATE USB "dongle" for the mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you didn't get the USB dongle with the keyboard, throw the keyboard away; it's worthless to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you did get the USB dongle, plug it into any USB port on your computer and put 2 AA alkaline batteries in the wireless keyboard.&nbsp; See

<p>
</p><p>If you want to activate the special keys on the wireless keyboard, download the appropriate software and install it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have the Wireless Keyboard 3000 v.2, you can use the Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center 3.2.&nbsp; Pick 32-bit or 64-bit as appropriate for your system:&nbsp; https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/downloads/mouse-keyboard-center</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have the Wireless Keyboard 3000 with no version number, you can use IntelliType 8.2.&nbsp; Again, be sure to pick 32-bit or 64-bit:&nbsp; https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-sg/d/wireless-keyboard-3000</p>

<h2>            Is there a way to get the old screen sketch back for my surface after the update&#63;</h2>
                    So I loved the old screen sketch functionality with the Surface Pen on my surface. It does what I need it to do and it does it very well. I really don't like how Microsoft packaged this experience in an new app that made it worse by a lot. I really just
 need the crop functionality to take partial screen shots from e-book and presentations and put them in one note. The scroll bar on the right interfere with the cropping process. I just want the ability to choose to have the old option. Is there anyway that
 I can get it back?&nbsp;

<h2>             Can&#39;t delete an item from my external, backup hard drive.</h2>
                    Using Sync Toy to transfer data from my external, backup hard drive, to my brand new laptop, I find that the transfer goes well but gets stuck towards the end of transferring. It takes forever and I see no movement on the progress bar. I see that it gets
 stuck on a path:&nbsp; “Windows\winsxs\winsxs\x86_policy.8.0.Microsoft.VC80.CRT_1fc8b3b9a1e18e3b_x-ww_77c24773”. I don't know how that got onto my external, backup hard drive previously.<br />
Interestingly, there is no file at the end of this path. When I go about deleting the various cascade levels of the path, I get a pop up with:<br />
"An unexpected error is keeping you from deleting the folder. error 0x80070091: The directory is not empty"<br />
How can I delete this, what appears to be, superfluous item?

    <title>Issues with Downloading and Installation in Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crazylaika  say:</h3>
<h2>            Issues with Downloading and Installation in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very recently, for reasons that I cannot understand, I have been unable (Or found it extremely difficult) to download applications from the web and install some programs. This issue is frustrating and I&nbsp;would&nbsp;appreciate assistance as soon as possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first, I assumed that it was an issue with Google Chrome, and so I uninstalled the browser and attempted to download it again through Internet Explorer. I found this almost impossible, however, as I was notified the download "was interrupted" (Something
 that I would later find affected all files I attempted to download). Being forced to resume the download multiple times, I finally downloaded the Chrome setup program and tried to install the application. This problem not only affects Internet Explorer but
 also Microsoft Edge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the installation had supposedly completed, it simply started installing again, and this repeated once more before errors reading "Egads! Installation Failed." and finally "The download failed."&nbsp;popped up. Attempts to install other applications recently
 (Yousician and Firefox for example) have failed too as the launchers/setups have been interrupted for some unknown reason, so this installation&nbsp;problem is not unique to Chrome and may be linked to the downloading&nbsp;issue as both problems arose at around&nbsp;the
 same time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then&nbsp;assumed that the problem may lie in my internet connection, but there has been&nbsp;no indication of a failure to connect online. I attempted to download something on my tablet, and it went perfectly smoothly. I have attempted to restart my system multiple
 times and even rebooted the system once, all to no avail, and attempts to install programs through running as administrator, and using safe mode, have not helped. It seems&nbsp;as though I have exhausted all the possibilities, and I'm feeling helpless right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a Dell Inspiron 5567 laptop with Windows 10, 64-bit. Windows Firewall is active but it does not seem to be blocking my attempts to download anything as when Firewall is&nbsp;inactive, I have the same issues. Please help as soon as you can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<p>Good day Laika,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might be due to a software conflict. It would be great if you can tell us more about your concern.</p>
<ul>
<li>When did the issue start?</li><li>Do you have a security software installed on your PC?</li><li>Have you tried performing a <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot</a></strong>?</li><li>Have you installed the latest updates for Windows 10?</li><li>What is the current version and build number of your Windows 10 PC?</li></ul>
<p>If you have a security software installed, try to temporarily disable it then install the app again. A
<strong>clean boot</strong> is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install an app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To check for the latest update for Windows 10, click the <span style="font-weight: bold">
Start</span> button, go to <span style="font-weight: bold">Settings</span> &gt; <span style="font-weight: bold">
Update &amp; security</span> &gt; <span style="font-weight: bold">Windows Update</span> then select
Start</span> button, type <span style="font-weight: bold">About your PC</span> then press
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>Hi again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.&nbsp;As far as I am aware, the issue began just&nbsp;this morning, and I can't think of anything I could have done to cause it like download harmful software or altar my PC's settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from Windows Firewall, I have McAfee LiveSafe installed on my laptop and temporarily disabling both programs did not seem to solve the problem. As you suggested,&nbsp;I also attempted to perform a clean boot, and while my issue in installing software like
 Google Chrome (As well as Yousician and Firefox) persists, the problem of downloads constantly being interrupted appears to have gone, even after ending the clean boot, and I am not sure why (Edit: The download issue seems to still exist somewhat&nbsp;as, when
 trying to download items like the Chrome setup program, it sometimes fails with a notification reading "ChromeSetup.exe couldn't be downloaded" and I am forced to retry - The issue has become considerably better now, however).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In attempting to check for new Windows updates, I was given a notification stating "There were some problems installing updates, but we'll try again later. If you keep seeing this and want to search the web or contact support for information, this may help:
 (0x8024402f)". As for further information regarding my Windows 10&nbsp;PC, its version is 1607 and the build number&nbsp;is 14393.0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: I have finally gotten Firefox installed. Ideally, I would get Chrome operating, however. I would also still like to know what caused the issue in the first place.</p>

<p>Hi again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did as you instructed and ran the troubleshooter. The results were that the following issues were resolved: Service registration was missing or corrupt, Potential Windows Update Database error occurred, Windows Update components must be repaired, Check
 for pending updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am afraid that the issue persists. Since yesterday, I am still having great trouble downloading anything without the process being interrupted, and installing programs like Google Chrome or Firefox still leads to&nbsp;failures. I have rebooted my laptop again,
 completely this time, and the problem continues to affect it. This&nbsp;leads me to believe that it may be a hardware issue, but I cannot see how or why. An update for the&nbsp;system has begun, but it&nbsp;has remained at 17% for the past hour and every feature of the update&nbsp;has&nbsp;"Failed
 to install".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: There is another issue that I have run into concerning downloading content from the internet. When trying to download OBS Studio, I ran into an error reading "C:/Users/NAME/Appdata/Local/Temp/CG_t4626.exe.part could not be saved, because the source
 file could not be read. Try again later, or contact the server administrator." This is a notification that has come up several times when I attempted to download other programs, and upon clicking "Ok" and going to download again, there is no issue. Is it that
 this may be connected to my other problems, or may this be just an error specifically with Firefox. Thanks</p>

<p>Hi again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried what you suggested but it does not seem to have solved the issue of updates failing to install, and I am still having difficulty downloading and installing programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am planning to bring my laptop to a specialist tomorrow in order to get to the bottom of the issue, hardware-related or not, but if you still have advice for possible solutions I would be very willing to try them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: I went to see someone today about the issue. My laptop operated perfectly fine when connected to their wireless internet connection, leading me to now understand that the problem is not with my system, rather it is probably with my router. I will get
 in touch with my internet providers later and arrange for the device to be replaced. Thank you for the help and apologies for the trouble</p>

<h2>            Windows Update Error 0x80070424</h2>
                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>
</p><p>So when I try to update my laptop (the last update was in July!) I get this error: 0x80070424. Now I've tried all of the solutions that I can find here and elsewhere on the internet, but I keep running into the same, or at least a similar, problem. There
 is no Windows Update option for me to click on in the Services directory. Is there a way to fix this? I'm using Windows 10, by the way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for your time and help!</p>

            <p>OK Claire,</p>
<p>First thing I would try is an in-place reinstall to see if we can get things working again. Go to this site and download media creation tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Right-click on tool when downloaded and run as administrator. Accept the license and then Choose upgrade this PC now.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a49f3960-8ccc-41ef-ace3-3fe9495859c1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a49f3960-8ccc-41ef-ace3-3fe9495859c1" /></a></p>
<p>It will take a while to download.</p>
<p>Choose to keep files and apps and let the update run until finished and then let me know if there are problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know since even if it works there are some more actions you must take,</p>

<p>Hello Soggy, </p>
<p>As gds1972 stated, game demos meant for the Xbox 360 are not playable on the Xbox One because they are not Backwards Compatible. Also mentioned above is the Games with Gold special. If you are a Gold member, you have access to two (2) Games from Xbox One
 and two (2) from Xbox 360 every month for FREE* [active payment method required to download the games but there are no charges].</p>
<p>Hope this clarifies things!</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
This error is usually cause through something interfering with the Windows Update process. Perhaps your anti virus program is interfering.<br />
<br />
Follow these steps and check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
<br />
<p>Try installing the update in a clean boot mode (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Note:</span> Follow step 7 to restart your computer as usual.<br />

<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Step 2:</span><br />

<p>If all else fails and you still can't install SP1 (Service Pack 1), you may be facing a repair install.</p>

            Canadian Tech, that all sounds fine.&nbsp; However, what about Firefox?&nbsp; Additionally, I use SeaMonkey, the former Mozilla Suite, which is browser, default email client and newsgroups (I do not use that service).&nbsp; Also, though I thank you for both your intentions
 and promptness, this longterm solution does not solve the immediate problem.&nbsp; My preferred search page has links; but regardless of which browser, instead of looking for the quick links to click on to go to commonly visited sites, I must read fine print under
 their placeholders.

<p>The current versions of both Firefox and Chrome discourage the use of Flash.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not certain of how closely the timetable described in the following article has been followed, but it's pretty accurate:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Plugins/Roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Plugins/Roadmap</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>At the moment, the current versions of Firefox (62) and Chrome (69) can use Flash if you're really determined.&nbsp; I regularly use FF, do not have the Flash plug-in installed, and can't recall having come across a website that uses Flash at least for the past
 several years.&nbsp; As of this past April, Flash is used on less than 5% of websites (<a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/software/flash-used-on-5-percent-of-all-websites-down-from-285-percent-seven-years-ago/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/software/flash-used-on-5-percent-of-all-websites-down-from-285-percent-seven-years-ago/</a>).&nbsp;
 Currently, that number seems to be 4.3% (<a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cp-flash/all/all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cp-flash/all/all</a>).&nbsp; Flash isn't as unused as Silverlight (or Java), but
 it's getting there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as Seamonkey is concerned, if I were you, I'd stick with Firefox and Thunderbird.</p>

<p>History:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>First, there was Netscape Navigator, a browser.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Then came Netscape Communicator, which was an "all in one" product, including a browser, an email &amp; newsgroup client, an address book and an HTML editor.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Then came Mozilla Application Suite, which was similar to Netscape Communicator.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Mozilla being an open-source project, not everyone agreed on the direction development should take.&nbsp; One group focused on a browser; that became Mozilla Firefox.&nbsp; Another group focused on email/newsgroups; that became Mozilla Thunderbird.&nbsp; And yet a third
 group liked the idea of an all in one suite; that project became SeaMonkey.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Basically SeaMonkey is a combination of Firefox and Thunderbird.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>When you wrote "what about Firefox?&nbsp; Additionally, I use SeaMonkey," I thought that perhaps you were using both Firefox and Seamonkey.&nbsp; If you're satisfied with SeaMonkey, stay with it, although it's my understanding that SeaMonkey isn't as robustly supported
 as Firefox and Thunderbird.&nbsp; See, e.g., <a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1200012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            I thank everybody for the responses I received; but I made a relevant discovery today that I did not notice before.&nbsp; With regard to this troublesome update, my IE11 displays the images not visible in the other browsers I have that are supposed to be less
 trouble, Chrome, Firefox, Torch and SeaMonkey.&nbsp; So, without the level of support other browsers receive, and the most sluggish one of all, IE11 shows this images that do not show in other browsers, indicating that the ActiveX components are working.&nbsp; Strange!<br />

<p>Only Internet Explorer uses ActiveX, so it's to be expected that a page with ActiveX elements will not display properly when viewed using other browsers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There used to be plug-ins for Firefox (and presumably SeaMonkey) and Chrome, but the Firefox plug-in is no longer supported by the current version of Firefox.&nbsp; Apparently you can still get it for Chrome (<a href="https://www.ietab.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.ietab.net/</a>).&nbsp;
 I don't know about Torch.</p>

            Thanks for your reply.&nbsp; FYI Torch is a Chromium based browser that looks like Chrome except it has a media grabber.&nbsp; Just about all my music files I obtained through Torch except currently I have nothing to play them through.&nbsp; The reason I am not playing
 these files are are due to my other current thread, "Three Neros On Windows 7."&nbsp; I am returning to this thread because, after getting a little "real work" done - and very little of that - I am going to implement a few steps.&nbsp; That will consist of going into
 Safe Mode With Networking to see how sites look in different browsers.&nbsp; Possibly I will reset some of those browser settings.&nbsp; Then someone suggested that I remove Flash, if Safe Mode allows.&nbsp; Today, a Flash update come up which I naturally ignored.&nbsp; Lately
 I noticed that sometimes Torch shows the graphics correctly; but this happens "hit and miss."&nbsp; Then, upon doing Searches, I saw that the Images tab brings up placeholders instead of images

            I am now in Safe Mode With Networking.&nbsp; SeaMonkey froze; so I could not test it.&nbsp; In all other browsers, I can see the graphics that I could not see in full Windows.&nbsp; Though I could not view in all browsers what addons were active, in Firefox they were
 disabled.&nbsp; I made no other changes to the system.&nbsp; Now that I am back in Safe Mode With Networking, I will try to reset my browsers.&nbsp; Now, where did I go wrong?&nbsp; After seeing graphics on the sites I visit regularly in Safe Mode With Networking, in full Windows
 I now see garbage.

            I have this problem fixed for Firefox and SeaMonkey.&nbsp; For each it was a matter of reconfiguring my setting - options or preference, whichever the case - so that there is no proxy and that the browser connects directly to the Internet.&nbsp; So, I have images
 for pages in Firefox and SeaMonkey when previously they did not show.&nbsp; However, Chrome and Torch still have the problem.&nbsp; IE11 does not show the problem, but those two Chromium browsers work of the same settings; so I do not know yet what to do to fix it there.

                    My laptop has started losing the brightness of the lcd screen during work and won't return unless I restart....now it has gotten to the point that it will not illuminate at all.....It will work with an external screen linked thru a port with a patch cord,
 but the laptop screen will not get any brightness.&nbsp; You can see the images if you hold a flashlight along the edge, but no internal illumination.

 point).&nbsp; It sounds like it is time for a visit to your local repair shop.&nbsp; A quick Google search for "xps m140 backlight" seems to indicate that it could be either a power inverter (cheap/quick to fix) or the backlight itself (more difficult).&nbsp; Here are a

<p>Eu sei que grande parte dos jogos que estão disponiveis na live norte-americana não esta disponivel aqui por causa do nosso bendito sistema de classificação de hipocrisia. Mas estou com uma duvida.</p>

<h2>            Skype webcam doesn&#39;t work during calls</h2>
                    I've got a new HP computer bought just few weeks ago. Windows version is Windows 10. I would like to use Skype for videocalls but unfortunately the webcam doesn't work. In the settings it says that another app is using it, but which one? I removed other
 app that used it but the problem goes on. Could you please help me, I'm lost...

            The solution was in those settings, but when I open them Skype was already allowed to the camera. The point is that using skype appeared the sentence that another app was using the camera. So I just disactivated some other apps, one by one, keeping just
 skype and a couple. Then I tried again skype and it was working! Thanks

<h2>            Can I re-use the same windows license that came with my laptop in new windows installation&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an ASUS laptop that came with a genuine Windows 8 license. After it was released, I was able to upgrade to windows 10 under the same license. I was planning to swap the HDD that came with the laptop for a SSD to improve performance, but I wanted to
 start with a clean installation instead of installing an image of my current drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if there's any way I can re-use the same windows license that came with my laptop? If so, where can I find the license number/certificate? The laptop didn't come with any windows sticker on the bottom or in the box, so I don't know where
 to find it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Claudio.</p>

            Hi Claudio, there will be no problem re-installing Windows 10 on your system, provided you follow the steps below during installation
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers
<br />
<br />Click this link:
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-downlo...</a>
<br /> to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 4GB) using that tool or create the ISO file which you can later burn to DVD
<br /> 
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS)
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS, go into your BIOS and make the following changes:
<br />1.	Insert the Bootable Media
<br />2.	Disable Secure Boot
<br />3.	Enable Legacy Boot
<br />4.	If Available enable CSM
<br />5.	If Required enable USB Boot
<br />6.	Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order
<br />7.	Save BIOS changes and restart your System

            Windows 10 Digital License
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.

    <title>Explorer Touch Mouse - Remap Horizontal Scroll &#34;Wheel&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thx1200  say:</h3>
<h2>            Explorer Touch Mouse - Remap Horizontal Scroll &#34;Wheel&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I own a Microsoft Explorer Touch Mouse.&nbsp; I really like this thing except for one annoyance.&nbsp; Intellipoint has no way to remap the scroll "wheel" gestures.&nbsp; In addition, the horizontal scroll gesture does not even expose itself as a normal Windows horizontal
 wheel event, so I cannot remap the gesture to anything else using any third party application.&nbsp; I even went as far as to create my own program with a low-level mouse hook and printed out all mouse events.&nbsp; There was no event when the horizontal scroll gesture
 was activated.&nbsp; Of note, the normal virtical scroll wheel gesture works as expected and is easy to remap with third party applications.</p>
<p><br />
Is there any way to remap this?&nbsp; If not, how can I request this feature?&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't see why Microsoft would use a proprietary horizontal scroll event system when they invented the standard!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am running the latst version of Intellipoint from Windows Update.&nbsp; I'm on a Windows 7 64-bit system.</p>

            I am not developing my own application.&nbsp; That was just a step in a process of figuring out a way to remap the horizontal scroll gesture on the Explorer Touch Mouse.&nbsp; The mouse does not emit the standard horizontal scroll event, which is what I was looking
 for.&nbsp; My goal is to remap the gesture to do something other than horizontal scrolling, which is something I do not use.

    <title>No sound via nVidia 7650 GS &#47; Realtek High Definition Audio on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shakunt patel  say:</h3>
<h2>            No sound via nVidia 7650 GS &#47; Realtek High Definition Audio on Windows7 Platform</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don't understand why I'm getting no sound from my PC via HDMI cable to my TV.&nbsp; I've never used the HDMI port since purchasing my PC, but I've had a look at the internal on board connecions and can see that it should as it has a link between it and the
 built in sound card on the motherboard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My TV has an option to hear sound via 3.5mm jack or if the TV detects HDMI cable is able to provide sound, then it will use the HDMI cable as the sound source.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've installed the latest drivers for my video and sound card (275.33 &amp; 6.0.1.6410 respectively)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is what I have found out so far, I have no option in my sound settings for HDMI out, I only have the devices 'Speakers &amp; Realtek digital Output'.&nbsp; The speakers playback device provides sound via 3.5mm jack and the realtek digital output provides sound
 via the digital audio toslink od the digital audio coax.&nbsp; I would not mind using the 3.5mm jack for my sound soource while using my pc on my TV, but the TV is receiving an audio signal of some sort from the HDMI cable and disables the 3.5mm jack source.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I remove the nVidia driver and use Windows standard driver, then the TV only receives a video feed from the HDMI cable ane thinks its a DVI cable, therefore letting me use the 3.5mm jack as a sound source.&nbsp; Only problem with this is that the windows standard
 plug and play driver does not send a HD video signal to the tv, it's a standard VGA signal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've checked other forums and one person states they had the same problem and states they've got it working by using old versions of the nVidia and realtek drivers, I've tried the same, but no luck.&nbsp; Link
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/sound-audio/33398-no-sound-hdmi-device-nvidia-realtek-hd-audio-4.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.sevenforums.com/sound-audio/33398-no-sound-hdmi-device-nvidia-realtek-hd-audio-4.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm positive that the realtek card and the nVidia card are not talking to each other as I'm unable to find a play back device in my sound settings for HDMI out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can you help?</p>

<p>I know you have to attach a rope to cart with the rocks in it,thyen ctank to make it come up.Cut the rope with a knife making the cart roll down and knock the truck off&gt;This causes a tremor that makes the other truck fall out of the way.</p>
<p>Without a bow equipped I cannot attach a rope.</p>
<p>I cannot equip a bow unless i can get to a fire.</p>
<p>I cannot get to a fire because there is no way to go back across the rop attached to said truck.</p>

<p>You are asking for actual game play instructions which IS NOT a problem with the game itself. &nbsp;Just because you haven't been able to figure it out doesn't mean it is a glitch. &nbsp;Can you not start that section of the game over now that you apparently know
 what the answer is?</p>

<h2>            XBox One Requires IR to Control DirectTV but I need RF to work &#40;lost cause&#63;&#41;...</h2>
                    
<p>I just got an Xbox One and it seems that <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
requires</span> <strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">IR</span></strong> (line of sight) to control my DirectTV box.&nbsp; For reasons too long to explain, I
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">MUST HAVE</span>&nbsp;my DirectTV be configured to use
<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">RF</span></strong> (shoots through walls).&nbsp; I believe most "remote extenders" actually convert&nbsp;
<strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">IR</span>-</strong>&gt;<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">RF</span></strong>-&gt;<strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">IR&nbsp;</span></strong> (the last step converting
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">back</span> to <strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">IR</span></strong>).</p>
<p>This last "step" in the remote extender process would require that my DirectTV box be configured to
<strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">IR</span></strong> (which I can't do).</p>
<p>I really just want <strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">IR</span></strong>-&gt;<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 1)">RF</span></strong> so the Xbox IR will be converted to RF (but
<em><strong>NOT</strong></em> back to IR).</p>
<p>Does anyone have any ideas?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Too bad DirecTV refuses to allow you to use both simultaneously. My guess is that they do this because they know that when you usually need to use both, that you are usually using splitters to share to another TV.... In which they would rather sell you another
 receiver$$$</p>
<p>Not sure if they make them anymore, But a Harmony 900 remote, while costly, would give you the best of both worlds... as it's RF, and comes with several IR blasters.</p>
<p>I have no idea of what you're setup is, but perhaps there's an IP/wifi solution that you could use?</p>

            I don't know where you are located, but you can try asking Support to send you a recovery image on USB
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/contact-us</a> - I downloaded the image in less than 5 minutes this morning as a test.
