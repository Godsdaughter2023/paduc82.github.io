</p><p>If you're not seeing the tools button, it can be because you're using Skype for Windows 10 version 12.xx. This version is different from classic Skype when it comes to its interface and functions and you need to click your profile picture in order for you
 to see the app settings. For more information on how you can find your way around Skype for Windows 10, please visit this article:

                    Laptop had a virus which hid and emptied all files in the start menu. Trying to do system restore but I get the Restoration Incomplete error. I uninstalled/deactivated any antivirus programs because I read that that may be the problem. I tried it again
 and still getting same error.

<p><span>1. What is the exact error which you receive while trying to perform system restore?<br />
2. Have you made any changes on the computer prior to this issue?<br />
3. Do you mean to say that start menu is completely empty?</span></p>
<p><span>Run virus or malware scan and check.</span></p>

            <p>1. The error reads: Restoration Incomplete Your computer cannot be restored to (insert checkpoint date of any time) No changes have been made to your computer. To choose another restore point, restart System Restore.</p>
<p>2. This is my friends laptop and she wanted me to try to fix it after getting a virus through an email.&nbsp; So I am not sure what changes were made prior to the virus,</p>
<p>3. I have managed to use the unhide.exe to show recycling bin on desktop, some start menu options, but for the most part all the folders are empty such as system tools, microsoft office, all of them really. This is why I have to get to System Restore through
 command prompt. </p>

            Hi, <br />
<br />
Well the first thing we want to make sure of is that you have totally removed the virus from the computer. What antivirus software do you have? Have you ensure the virus is totally removed?<br />
<br />
Also, do you (or your friend) by any chance still have the original XP disks that came with the computer?<br />

            <p>I doubt that Acer makes their own drivers. Go to the Manufacturer's website and get the latest drivers from there. Or if you have just looked on Acer site&nbsp;contact their tech support and ask them about windows 8 drivers. If these suggestions don't work then
 you may be out of&nbsp;luck. Hope this helps and if you are in&nbsp;need of further assistance post and we will be glad to assist.&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
Your computer is not supported by the manufacturer under the OS you have chosen.&nbsp; Your problem is between you and the hardware manufacturer(s).&nbsp; Whether that is Acer or the actual manufacturer of the wireless device - it's still not between you and Microsoft.&nbsp;
 ;-)<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Unfortunately - my cursory search just told me that there can be various types of Wireless network devices inside that particular model Acer Aspire system - nothing specific such as "RealTek, Broadcom, etc.&nbsp; Then when I look at the
<a href="http://support.acer.com/us/en/product/default.aspx?tab=1&amp;modelId=401" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
drivers support page</a>..&nbsp; Eep.. "Pro-Nets" or "liteon" branded wireless?&nbsp; Weird (to me.)<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Tried getting the proper driver for Vista, extracting and installing in Compatibility mode?<br />

            <div>@Richard Carruthers according to Acer's site support is not an option because the machine is beyond warranty period. I left a message on their support forum but 90% of the questions there go unanswered, so I'm not optimistic! I know two possible brands
 for the wireless manufacturer, but not anything specific like a model number. Still, I'll try the manufacturer's websites.</div>
<div><br />
@Shenan Stanley First of all, this is not a complaint! I recognize that Microsoft isn't to blame here. Nonetheless, I have a problem and seek a solution from any source.
<div><br />
<div>Regarding which driver, the Acer site is vague, as many PC websites sites are, even if you have entered your specific serial number. It's either a Liteon or Pronets wireless driver. I downloaded both for Vista 64. I tried to install the drivers via device
 manager and "have disk" but both times windows said no compatible driver was found.
<div><br />
<div>You mentioned opening the driver in compatibility mode. I know how to run a program this way but not how to install a driver.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To install a program in compatibility mode you will have to right-click on the installer file and select 'Troubleshoot Compatibility'. This will take you throught the process of selecting the version of Operating System with which the driver needs to installed.
 You may also refer to the following article:</p>
<p>'<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Make older programs compatible with this version of

                    <p>I have a new Toshiba S50t-B computer, Have loaded Legacy 8 (Family tree software) have never had any problems with this Software.</p>
<p>Also loaded Trend Security Software. Microsoft Office 2010 Business. and a few other minor programs.</p>
<p>I have had six BSOD episodes and have followed all protocols to fix including restoring to earlier date to minimize software problems, this has failed.</p>
<p>Today I checked the DMP file and this is what is Says:</p>
<p>A problem has been detected and Windows has been shut down to prevent damage</p>
<p>to your computer.</p>
<p>The problem seems to be caused by the following file: NETwbw02.sys</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is the first time you've seen this stop error screen, restart your computer. If this screen appears again, follow</p>
<p>these steps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check to make sure any new hardware or software is properly installed. If this is a new installation, ask your hardware or software manufacturer</p>
<p>for any Windows updates you might need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If problems continue, disable or remove any newly installed hardware or software. Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing.</p>
<p>If you need to use safe mode to remove or disable components, restart your computer, press F8 to select Advanced Startup Options, and then</p>
<p>select Safe Mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Technical Information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*** STOP: 0x000000d1 (0x0000000000000000, 0x0000000000000002, 0x0000000000000000,

<p>I have no new hardware and or Software to disable, I have followed all the suggested BIOS memory options, ran safe mode etc. All a failure. Microsoft must surely have a fix for this??</p>
<p>By the way my BSOD is caused by the same file every time&gt;NETwbw02.sys. Can this file be replace, will this Help.</p>
<p>I have contacted Toshiba and have been told it is a Windows 8.1 problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really like some help please.</p>

<h2>            Wireless connection problem - No Wireless Connections Available</h2>
                    <p>After updating my Windows 8 installation to Windows 8.1 on my Compaq Presario CQ57-420EA, I am no longer able to get a wifi connection under Networks my connection is shown as No Networks Found. I have tried reinstalling the same driver that was installed
 with Windows 8 and nothing works.</p>

<p>The Wifi device within my system is a Ralink RT5390 802.11b/g/n Wifi Adapter, I have checked the support pages of HP/Compaq and no drivers are offered for this model of laptop. The drivers offered on the MediaTek website don't fix the issue.</p>

<p>Hi Zaki J</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Not sure if you fully read my post of just glanced at it, the error messages are clearly displayed in black and white, I have also mentioned that I obtained the latest driver from the manufacturers website which made no difference. Further information is
 that compatibility mode made no difference as with drivers for Windows 7.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This problem was also present in Windows 8.1 preview<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please also note that&nbsp;the following link that u provided made no difference as this was an&nbsp;Windows 8 install and updated to Windows 8.1 and not a clean installation &nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows/network-connection-problem-help#network-problems=windows-81&amp;v1h=win81tab5&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows/network-connection-problem-help#network-problems=windows-81&amp;v1h=win81tab5&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1</a></p>

This is just not good enough at all. I have just bought a brand new Alienware 17 R5 and everything was working fine until I installed this update and now my WiFi card will not find any WiFi networks. Reinstalling the adapter makes no difference. Not happy at
 all! <br />
<br />
By the looks of the post above you have not even read what the last poster has written and just fobbed him off with fixes that even my mother who has no ideas about PC's would try before contacting you.<br />
<br />
Also this happened to a shed load of people in your preview by the looks of things and you still have not fixed it. Sort it out! I expect more from a company that supposedly prides itself on its innovation!<br />

<p>I had the same issue with Windows 8.1 Preview and of course there was no fix available and Microsoft don't provide a reasonable way of submitting bug report and feedback, instead they relay in Problem Reporting feedback which doesn't always work.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It's very unusual to not have a&nbsp;Microsoft Support Rep provide feedback or offer a fix or even to say that they are aware of the issue and they will provide a fix for it, instead nothing and we are left with these issues on hardware that worked perfectly
 fine before the Windows 8.1 update.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I didn't pay good money for Windows 8 to be treated like this!!!<br />

            <p>This sounds like the problem that's been haunting Windows 7 users for several years and for which Microsoft still haven't bothered to find an answer. &nbsp;There's a 51 page thread on the link below that has now been locked but hasn't been resolved. &nbsp;It looks
 as though the same thing has followed through to 8 and/or 8.1.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Come on Microsoft, you have hundreds of unhappy Win7 users out there and you're just going to let the problem run into 8 as well? &nbsp;Definitely not good enough. &nbsp;I've got two laptops that I can't use on 7 and I'm certainly not going to try them on 8, so either
 I use XP or Linux, neither of which makes you any money Microsoft.</p>

<h2>            High Definition Audio Device has a Code 10 error</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have a Windows 8.1 on my Asus laptop. I have a error on my High Definition Audio Device, in Device Manager it shows the yellow triangle icon; also under the sounds, audio and game controllers I already Realtek and NVIDIA.&nbsp;I've tried using the Playing
 Audio troubleshooting which gave me :&nbsp;High Definition Audio Device has a problem; not fixed. I've already done a windows update, there is nothing else to update. I've tried updating the driver in the Device Manager, says driver is up to date. I've just fixed
 Code 28(i think it was) problems for other drivers. This is the only yellow triangle icon left. Please help.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>1. Delete the Skype for Business sign in information. Click the status and select
<strong>Sign out – Delete my sign in information</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Clear all the Skype for Business cache files. Open the
<strong>Run</strong> bar in your computer and run <strong>%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\</strong>, select
<strong>Office – 15.0 or 16.0 – Lync</strong>, then delete all the sip files and all the files in
<strong>Tracing</strong> folder, don’t delete the tracing folder itself.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>if the issue persists, to look into the issue, can you please confirm the following information?</p>
<p>1. Do you have Exchange server and Skype for Business server deployed in your organization? If yes, have you deployed Exchange Hybrid or Skype for Business hybrid?</p>
<p>2. Do other users in your organization have the same issue?</p>
<p>3. If you use another computer in another network, do you still have the issue?</p>

            Unfortunately the joystick on the G13 cannot be moved. <br />
Certainly looks that way, but no.<br />

Not sure what you are asking here. Are you talking about a XBOX PC controller ?<br />
I can't say as I don't have an XBOX or XBOX controller. If there are no clues in the<br />
links above then the XBOX specific forums,&nbsp; would be the best place for details regarding XBOX and it's peripherals.<br />
There are quite a few threads on this forum regarding XBOX controllers as<br />
well. Just type XBOX controller into the search bar.<br />

            It has nothing to do with particular download sites, and for several years (since the start of&nbsp; "Games for Windows" )&nbsp; the XBOX controller has (unfortunately for some of use who don't use the XBOX controller) been the default controller setup for most,
 or at least,&nbsp; many games.<br />
<br />
A&nbsp; quick search reveals -<br />
Why&nbsp; the&nbsp; XBOX controller is not compatible with some game ( pre- Monopoly$oft games for windows mostly)&nbsp; -<br />
<a href="http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360-controller-support-for-pc/92-2465/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.giantbomb.com/xbox-360-controller-support-for-pc/92-2465/<br />

I have noticed that some XBOX controllers are advertised as being a PC version. This may be due to the PC version having different software than the controller for XBOX<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/p/xbox-360-controller-for-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/p/xbox-360-controller-for-windows</a><br />
<br />
A bit of&nbsp; XBOX&nbsp; for PC&nbsp; propaganda - <br />
<a href="http://www.xboxcontrollerforpc.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.xboxcontrollerforpc.net/</a><br />
<br />
What is really comes down to is making changes to the button assignments to suit you via the games 'control' settings options&nbsp; or making a profile using the software that comes with the controller.
<br />
Controllers that have their own Win7 compatible profiling software&nbsp; will work with any game. It's just a matter of a few minutes to assign buttons to the commands.<br />
Logitech controllers will work with any PC game as the have both&nbsp; Xinput and Direct Input support (Monopoly$oft's incursion into PC gaming has made this a little less user friendly with some games) .<br />
<br />
I recognise you probably are used to the XBOX controller and may want to save money but -<br />
for FPS, and action games no controller beats a mouse and keyboard for accuracy. <br />
Keyboards are also better for RPG's and other games with many commands.<br />
Personally, I never liked using a keyboard so I use keypad style controllers - Logitech G13 is the
<br />
best yet. The Belkin&nbsp; Nostromo n52 &amp; n52te, are good to. It's more comfortable having the keys in line, and the joystick on the G13 works well too.
<br />
<br />
If you are looking for simple plug and play gaming&nbsp; then console is the best gaming option. PC offers more versatility for those who don't mind tweaking.<br />

    <title>Microsoft Surface Pro 4 - Mouse Double Click Feature Problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jgreg7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Surface Pro 4 - Mouse Double Click Feature Problems</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased a Microsoft Surface Pro 4, with the Windows 10 (x64) operating system, and am using a Logitech MX anywhere 2, Bluetooth mouse.&nbsp;&nbsp; The mouse uses a "Logitech Options" software to customize the buttons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am currently having problems with the "double-click" when I try to open a file.&nbsp; When I double-click a filename, the action opens the filename for editing, and does not open file as I would anticipate.&nbsp; I have tried multiple stings on the double-click
 speed, however, this seems to make no difference in the action resulting in the filename edit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Logitech MX anywhere 2, Bluetooth mouse also provides a "double click" feature which works well on every other computer I have, except that it does not work with the Microsoft Surface Pro 4.&nbsp; As with the manual double-click, the action goes to opening
 the filename to edit the name.&nbsp; I have tried the mouse on difference computers with earlier Windows versions, and it works fine.&nbsp; I have also tried another Logitech MX anywhere 2, Bluetooth mouse that exhibits the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, the only way to open the file is to highlight it the hit Enter.&nbsp; While this works, it now takes both hands to open the file - not most convenient way to operate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am convinced that the problem is either with Windows 10, or the Microsoft Surface Pro 4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to correct this issue to make the computer open the file on a double click?</p>

            <p>Hi Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To better understand your concern, can you confirm the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>When did this issue start?</li><li>Have you tried to check for and install the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/performance-and-maintenance/install-software-updates-for-surface?os=windows-10&amp;=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
updates</a>?</li><li>Have you also tried a different mouse?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            <p>The computer is new, as is the mouse. &nbsp;The problem has always occurred.</p>
<p>The computer has been updated to the latest Microsoft updates - automatic update is on and current. &nbsp;The Logitech mouseware is also the latest version.</p>
<p>I have tried two different mouse (mice?), both Logitech, both with the same symptoms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: the double click problem also occurs when I double-tap on the keyboard mousepad - it opens the file name for edit rather than executing/opening the file. &nbsp;The only way to open the file is to highlight it, and hit enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For troubleshooting, I have tried: </p>
<p>- different mouse settings, changing the double click speed&nbsp;</p>
<p>- reinstalling the Logitech mouseware</p>
<p>- a different mouse</p>
<p>- testing the mouse on another computer (worked correctly)</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, The problem seems to be with the MS Surface Pro 4 itself. &nbsp;There are not many settings in the Windows control panel for the mouse, and none seem to correct the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            <p>That was strange, Greg.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You can try to disconnect and reconnect both your type cover and mouse from your Surface Pro 4. You can also reboot your device and check for the symptom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You can also <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/restore-or-reset-surface?os=windows-10&amp;=undefined#resetW10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Thank you for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I learning to use this Microsoft Surface Pro 4, I have used it as a tablet (with and without the pen), as a regular laptop (with keyboard and mouse), as a tablet with the mouse, as just the computer and keyboard using the touch pad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a very versatile computer, however I am beginning to think that the versatility comes with a compromise with some features. &nbsp;I would have used the mouse with the USB transmitter, however, since I only have the one USB port, that is not really an option.
 &nbsp;The bluetooth seemed like a good solution, however the reliability with the mouse is not the best.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;The computer has been rebooted several times, and updated once again. &nbsp;This last MS update seems to have fixed the double-click issue with the built-in mouse pad, however the mouse still has the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not ready to try the reset yet. &nbsp;In my experience, there is usually some loss with this approach, and I have just got all of the other adjustments completed. &nbsp;(the display size was the biggest hurdle).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will chase this problem through Logitech to see if they have come across this before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again!</p>

<p>Following up on this issue. &nbsp;As it turned out, the new Windows 10 operating system crashed - irretrievably.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft walked me through the download and re-installation of the operating system. &nbsp;I then had to re-load everything. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system works well now, but then again, it worked fine at first too, then became corrupted. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After having the system crash so soon with a new computer, especially one that is used infrequently only as a portable unit, I am loosing confidence in the Windows 10 operating system (or it could be the MSS Pro 4). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either way, I would not consider this to be a reliable system just yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will post back after it runs for a while, and update this thread with the status.</p>

<p>Hi vj_internet,</p>
<p>- Did you make a system image backup, by chance? <br />
- Which application did you use to create the backup?</p>
<p>VHD is Virtual Hard Disk format.</p>
<p>The reason why you have a VHD file is because you’ve created a system image backup. A system image includes Windows and your system settings, programs, and files. You can use a system image to restore the contents of your computer if your hard drive or computer
 ever stops working. When you restore your computer from a system image, it is a complete restoration; you can't choose individual items to restore, and all of your current programs, system settings, and files are replaced.</p>
<p>You cannot restore VHD files using the “backup and restore” center in Windows.</p>
<p>However, you can mount the image (.VHD file) using the steps listed below:</p>
<p>a. Right-click “Start” and click “Manage”</p>
<p>Note: You must have administrative privileges to do this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>b. Click “Disk management” on the left-pane. <br />
c. Click Action and Attach VHD.<br />
d. Specify the location of external hard disk on your computer.</p>
<p>For more information refer to the "Extracting files from a system image (advanced)" section in the following article:</p>

<p>Both consoles are capable of supporting 1080p. However, the Xbox One is NOT capable of displaying 1080i. This means that if your TV doesn't support 1080p, you'll only be able to see the Xbox One's display settings at 720p. Interlace (what the "i" stands
 for) is a thing of the past. The Xbox One was designed to pave the way for the future &amp; is progressive only (what the "p' stand for) as a result. It's the same reason the Xbox One isn't backwards compatible - it's trying to move forward. Perhaps it's time
 you should too...<br />
<br />
In other words, you need a new TV.</p>

<p>1080i is not better then 720p. The 'i' stands for interlaced. Interlacing basically means that your scan lines alternate vs all scan lines being produced at the same time. I would take 720p over 1080i.</p>
<p>Further... I'm playing Forza 5 and NBA2K14 right now all of which are displayed in 1080p.</p>

<h2>            Keep getting disconnected when I exit games</h2>
                    Hi guys, For about 2 months now I've been having a issue of when I exit games I get kicked offline from Xbox live its weird because ill play a game with no issue whatsoever then go to change games then get kicked and have to reset either my console or
 connection to fix the issue which gets annoying. I have tryed phoning the xbox support team they keep pointing the finger to BT and BT point the finger right back and say my nat is open and ports are all supposedly open too. I temporarily fixed it by turning
 my Xbox back to factory settings and re installing everything and a week later of no issues my Xbox is back to its old tricks. Has anyone else had this issue and fixed it? Thanks Murray

<p>Hey there Muzzirenti. Try refreshing your gamertag on file by redownloading it.
</p>
<p>To redownload your profile </p>
<p>Press the Xbox guide button on your controller</p>
<p>Press X to sign out of your profile</p>
<p>Select Download profile</p>
<p>then sign in to your account</p>
<p>that's should refresh your account</p>
<p>Tell us if you are still experiencing the same issue after</p>
<p>also please try to do a test xbox live connection.</p>
<p>Thanks hope to hear from you soon.</p>

<p>Hi SgtAdmael, please have a look at the date before bumping a thread as this is over 4 months old.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Generally with this issue if you delete your profile from the console (profile only), clear the system cache 3 times. Restart the console and re-download your profile it will clear up random disconnects when switching between games and apps.</p>

    <title>W10 boot problem... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zeronthegreat  say:</h3>
<h2>            W10 boot problem...</h2>
                    <p>For a week first, been experiencing the BSOD, then later on can't log in no more, the password box nor the user is present, now I cannot access anything. When I go to the startup menu, the boot menu goes straight into the w7 theme to system recovery, and
 the only option available is only the factory reset, when booting up just goes to that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last night when I had access atleast couple more times, I got this blue screen detector that tells you what caused the crashed and carelessly deleted the hal.dll and some dll close to ntosrnl.exe. I think that what its called--because I was ignorant and
 made a foolish, careless mistake of removing it having a thought it was a virus that caused BSOD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cannot access command prompt, nor safe mode, I really want tp avoid factory reset, which is unfortunatly the only access I believe I have. When I had access to other options in system recovery, I wouldn't first let me recover anything, and this morning they're
 not highlighted anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To sum everything up...</p>
<p>
</p><p>*I had BSOD first</p>
<p>*last night foolishly deleted hal.dll, and another dll, starts with an "n", close by above ntosrnl.exe, on my computer shares similar date.</p>
<p>*no login, nor password box</p>
<p>*don't have automatic repair option anymore</p>
<p>*boots up automatically to w7 theme system recovery</p>
<p>*3 out 4 options in system recovery not available anymore</p>
<p>*could not back up data</p>
<p>*factory reset is the available option</p>
<p>*boot menu, cd/dvd drive, and hard drive still windup to w7 theme system recover (I'm registered as w10)</p>
<p>*F8 key doesn't work.</p>
<p>*I'm loosing myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another reason of how I foolishly thought it was a cause, the hal.dll and ntsornl.exe is because the blue screen of death started on july 18th, and both of them had the same date, and saw a video of "how to remove them." It may be a valuable lesson for me,
 but no one ever wants to go through this and believe that factory reset is their only option available.</p>

<p>Ah okay, so I'm at this part where it says that "Windows cannot be installed to this disk. The selected disk has an MBR partition table. On EFI systems, Windows can only be installed to GPT disks." Couple times I passed through this, but stopped a bit when
 it's downloading what's on the list, restarts and go through it again, and could not set up a new partition. I searched up ways to come over.this, but that involves clearing my hard drive, or this one that involves Rufus, and it doesn't work for me.</p>

<p>ok here is a question</p>
<p>are you using the original gamertag that purchased the content?</p>
<p>if you purchased it on another console</p>
<p>the ORIGINAL purchasing gamertag on the new console has to be signed into live at all times to use the content</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>content is only assigned to the purchasing console and gamertag they are not sharable except to all profiles on the original console</p>
<p>&nbsp;only the purchasing gamertag can use it on other consoles and only when signed into live</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>from the sounds of it your friend purchased the content with his gamertag am i correct?</p>
<p>&nbsp;also nothing is transferable between accounts</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ok two things like i said only the purchasing console can use the content offline . The purchasing gamertag can only use the content if it is signed into live at all times</p>
<p>For example let's say your friends console is the purchasing console A and your console is console B and his gamertag is gamertag b and yours is gamertag A
</p>
<p>If gamertag A purchases the content on console A all profiles can use it as long as they are on console A however to use the content on console B gamertag A has to be signed into live anytime you use the content and redownload the content .
</p>
<p>However if gamertag B is the one that purchase it then gamertag B must be on console B and signed in into live</p>

<h2>            Xbox One Won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t let me sign into my account, Also please tell me there is a way to turn the layout back to the old format.</h2>
                    
<p>Xbox One just updated on its own without warning. At first I thought my console had home screen had loaded improperly and rearranged all the windows into a weird layout. Then, sadly, I realized that this was a the new layout. After a few second I couldn't
 stand looking at it. So I tried to go into my settings to see if there was a way to change it, but I can't find anything that lets you reload to the last update or change the layout back to what it was.</p>
<p>Afterwards I figured I could just deal with it, if I simply ignored it and played Fallout 4. But I realized that Xbox one had logged me out. When I tried to log back in I get this notification that "another user on this device uses this Microsoft account,
 so you can't add it here." Which doesn't make sense at all because I'm trying to log in not add one. And where the heck is the other user? I have one controller. Ive tried shutting it off and on multiple times but nothing works. So now I just spent $60 and
 an obscene amount of time of a character in fallout that is just wasting away because my Xbox One is now a useless paper that wont let me access any of my apps unless I'm logged in.</p>

<h2>            Error code 0xc0000225</h2>
                    <p>I recently updated my bios because my audio was fuzzy, I realised I actually needed a driver update and basically after I installed the update I received a blue repair screen error code 0xc0000225 blah blah blah. After a good while I decided to wipe my ssd
 and reinstall window. After it finished in booted my pc back up and it came back to her blue screen, I have allready tried all of the repair tools and cannot get anywhere with my problem. I have &nbsp; custom built pc and here are the specs just in case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intel i3 6100</p>
<p>Nvidia 750ti sc 2gb</p>
<p>2x4gb ddr4 crucial ram</p>
<p>120gb ssd</p>
<p>320gb hhd</p>
<p>4tb hhd</p>
<p>750w psu (upgrading pc soon)</p>
<p>Windows 10 64bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>I couldn't reset bios so reinstalled the version I had before and still getting blue screen, I think&nbsp;</p>
<p>maybe my ssd could have gotten corrupted in the process and need a new one?<br />
BTW I think my old psu was faulty because my pc was turning on and off randomly and I THINK while the bios was updating the pc shut off and disrupted the update and cause the blue screen not sure though because I wasn't paying attention and it could have just
 been the pc resetting after the bios update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the brief explanation at work right now so I am rushing typing this but any help is much appreciated.</p>

</p><p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this Problem you need a <em>Current Version Bootable USB or DVD</em> of Windows 10 .</p>
<p>
</p><p>After Booting Up Setup Appears And look for<strong> Repair PC</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>After Clicking You got <strong>Recovery Menu </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>In Recovery Menu you need to Choose <strong>Advance Options </strong>and look for<strong> Command Prompt</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>After Opening Command Prompt you need to Follow Steps given Below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Type<strong> Diskpart</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>After Getting Diskpart on Command Prompt Type <strong>List Volume</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then Type<strong> select volume #</strong> <em>"in replace of # you need to type that number which volume associated ESP label"</em></p>
<p>for example <strong>select volume 2 </strong>[ Image is Given Below for Example]</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5a44541a-e202-4ca7-8088-23d515d85157" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5a44541a-e202-4ca7-8088-23d515d85157" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then Type <strong>assign letter z</strong> 👆👆 [ as shown in&nbsp;upper&nbsp;image] 👆👆</p>
<p>
</p><p>after assigning letter Type <strong>exit </strong>command. now it will get back command prompt or you may
<em>reopen command prompt again.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>now type command <strong>bcdboot C:\windows /s Z: /f UEFI &nbsp;</strong>(replace C: with the volume letter that is named “OS”)</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ae1a609a-858d-4e55-9cc6-65f581950410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ae1a609a-858d-4e55-9cc6-65f581950410" /></a></p>
<p>And then <strong>Restart Your PC</strong> and <em>make sure that<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> your PC boot in your current operating system
</span>not Bootable DVD or USB.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Bingo! Now You are All Done Reply here your Status :)</strong></em></p>

            <p>Hi again, I tried what you instructed but none of the volume lists has ESR? beside it.</p>
<p>Anyway I tried unplugging my ssd that had windows on and started up my pc and I still got the blue screen. I am now starting to think that maybe my motherboard is responsible, but I can still access my bios....</p>
<p>I have tried resetting bios by he cmos and the jumper with a screwdriver because mine didn't come with a cap, I am not too sure how to do it from within the bios I have a msi carbon pro mobo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am really stuck here.... I haven't came across a problem this annoying before but if you might have any ideas that could help it would be much appreciated.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 major updates fail - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7 major updates fail</h2>
                    <p>My installer tells me KB4490628 (an update to the updater, it seems) is already installed, yet EVERY bigger update that
<strong>requires a reboot</strong>, fails miserably on my <strong>multiboot PC</strong> (Win 7, Win10 Pro and Linux Mint 19.1).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After initial setup of the update, my PC will reboot and continue to install, but hangs when it reaches 100%. My patience runs out after 15 mins of that, and I switch off. After that, ANY time I reboot Win7 (but it has also happened with Win10), EVEN in
 safe mode, it wil 'continue' installing the update and HANG. As a consquence, I keep on restoring my system from a backup. What is going on there?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem has been pestering me for a couple of weeks now, and I am getting very tired of it.
</p>
<p>I thought maybe Acronis Active Protection was causing the problem, or Magix' Network Sync, and I had them both disabled, but the problem still occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS's Disk Cleaning ('Schijfopruiming' in Dutch) reports some 19 GB of old update files on my SSD, but each time it fails to remove them, and sometimes, my free space is even less than it was before.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been running MS Update Troubleshooter regularly, but, as soon as a major update (ie: one that requires a reboot) is installed, the problem reoccurs. And, sometimes, the update seems to install itself,
<strong>without ANY notice</strong> to me. Then I'll only know about it when I switch off my PC, and it is TOO LATE to refuse the update, or try to prepare for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I've said, I have a multiboot PC, and when I <strong>do get notice</strong> before a major update, I make sure that the OS involved is the first to boot. But, even that does not do the trick. I regularly run MS Security Essentials, and it finds no threaths
 on my system. Each OS has its own SSD or HDD, and I keep any data on a separate HD. I have Secure Boot disabled (it would not allow me to run Linux Mint otherwise) in my BIOS. My system is all UEFI-enabled, and my Win7 SSD contains Windows Boot Manager, plus
 all the UEFI-partitions. I think even Linux Mint boots from the SSD, as the SSD reports itself in my BIOS as Ubuntu etc. I always create a backup of the
<strong>whole SSD</strong> and do a restore of the whole SSD, including UEFI-partition AND MBR.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done a Restore just a couple of hours ago, and dread the moment I switch off my PC; it might just try to install an update again, and it's driving me nuts!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can think of 3 causes of the problem: </p>
<p>-a corrupted MBR or Boot Manager from an earlier failed update;</p>
<p>-a corrupted update-file in the folder where they are stored (and which may report as still active and hence, will not allow the folder to be cleaned up);</p>
<p>-a special file I have installed some years back, to prevent MS from forcibly upgrading Win7 to Win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The latter two are less likely, as the problem has occurred in Win10, as well (I have set Win10 to postpone updates).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Info: MB is ASUS Z87-K, CPU is Intel Core i5 4670K, RAM is 2x 8GB, Win7 is SSD 240GB, Win10 is SSD 120GB, Linux Mint is appr. 200GB on a 1TB HD (the rest of the HD is NTFS, with data), and I have another 4TB HD purely for data.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently taken the plunge and installed several major updates in both Win 7 AND Win 10; all installed without any glitch. I had already regularly installed all minor updates, like definitions for Defender/Security Essentials.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this mean, that the problem has now been <strong>solved</strong>? </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NO</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no clue as to what caused those issues, and do not have ANY guarantee that they will NOT occur again in the future.
</p>
<p>I have uninstalled Magix's Network Sync, and found a link (and removed it) to 'webssearch' in my Firefox settings (in a file called 'prefs.js'), but I doubt if those were responsible for the problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I were superstitious, I'd be knocking on wood, keeping my fingers crossed AND rubbing a rabbit's foot, but I would be too busy with that to get anything else done on my PC.
</p>
<p>Instead, I make weekly backups of my SSD's, and hope that will help, if Windows goes belly-up again. And, I have made sure that Acronis Active Protection is enabled (and STAYS enabled).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a list of the updates I've installed recently:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win 10: KB4465065, KB4494441 (2), KB4497932, KB4499405, KB890830.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Win 7: KB4505050, KB4499178, KB890830, KB4503292.</p>
