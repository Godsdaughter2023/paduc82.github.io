    <title>Cannot remove a &#34;Retired&#34; drive in Windows 10 Storage Spaces - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> georgetaus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot remove a &#34;Retired&#34; drive in Windows 10 Storage Spaces</h2>
                    <p>****I asked this question in Windows Tech Net, but got no response. I am not an IT Pro, so maybe I posted in the wrong forum. This issue seems to be happening to others and the Windows Key + X.... solution I saw elsewhere on this forum did not work for me.
 Here is my question....*****</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 16 USB drives pooled in Windows 10 Storage Spaces (mostly 3TB to 5TB drives). Most of the pool is used as parity storage volume. I also have small 2 and 3 way volumes and a simple volume with little data on them. The pool was at about 68% capacity
 before a 5TB drive failed. Storage Spaces automatically moved data off the failed drive and currently reports: 0.42% used, providing 4.54TB pool capacity. Error code for the failed drive in Physical Drives listing reads: Retired; add a drive then remove this
 drive. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The Parity Storage Spaces volume now reads: Warning, Low capacity: add 2 drives. Because when data was reallocated to the remaining drives, the parity volume is now over 70% full.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I bought a new 5TB USB drive and added it to the storage pool. Attempted to "remove" the failed drive in the GUI Physcial drives listing. Got an error with detail: "Drive could not be removed because not all data could be reallocated. Add an additional
 drive to this pool and reattempt this operation." I don't understand how adding a new 5TB drive to the pool was not large enough to reallocate the remaining 0.42% data used on the failed drive. Thought maybe the 70% low capacity error message had something
 to do with it. So....</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I then added two smaller USB drives (200GB, 500GB) to the pool and the "low capacity" and "add 2 drives" messages were cleared. I attempted to once again remove the retired drive in the Storage Spaces GUI, but got the same message as before that the pool
 was not large enough to reallocate the remaining data on the failed drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After googling this issue of how to remove Storage Spaces retired drives, I believe I am not the only one with these concerns and I have yet to find an answer. I have effectively replaced one failed 5TB drive with three drives providing almost 6TB and yet
 Storage Spaces will not let me remove the failed 5TB drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The failed drive is only about 4 months old, so I would like to remove it from Storage Spaces, run diagnostics on it, and RMA it for a replacement. However, don't want to "crash" the Storage Spaces by just unplugging the failed drive and physically removing
 it on my own when the GUI says I can't.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Storage Spaces is still running fine despite the one failed drive, so no complaints. Just want to know how to get this retired drive off my pool. Have started learning how to use Powershell, so willing to go beyond the Windows 10 Storage Spaces GUI if needed.
 Any help appreciated.</p>

            Thanks for the replys, guys. I'm just trying to find the right forum to ask my question, understanding that Storage Spaces is relatively new and perhaps not "many" people are familiar enough with it to answer this question. I did originally post in the
 Tech Net and will try a little bump there on the post to see if anyone responds this time around. I really like Storage Spaces for my needs, but the program does not yet appear to be very mature. Storage Spaces works great most of the time, but small issues
 come up and it is difficult to find answers. I hope that, over time, these issues will be addressed and worked out to everyone's benefit. Again, thanks for the responses.<br />

            <p>Unfortunately, I never got a response from the Technet people. I ended up closing out the thread myself, as I will also do with this post here. Long story short, I had a Simple volume on my Storage Spaces pool and when one drive failed, that's when the retired
 drive issue started. After getting no responses from anybody, I just tried to manually remove that failed drive without permission from the Storage Spaces GUI, I crashed the ENTIRE Simple volume (about 1.8 TB of backup media files). So I ended up plugging
 the failed drive back into the pool (still read as retired) but then the Simple volume was back up and running. I transferred the entire Simple volume data to a Parity volume (about 18 hours). Then Storage Spaces would allow me to delete the Simple volume,
 and then I was finally able to remove the failed drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems like a lot of manual, and time consuming work, to do for just one failed disk in the pool. The lesson I took away from this experience was NOT to use any Simple volumes on my Storage Spaces pool. All the Parity and 2 and 3 way mirror volumes automatically
 reallocated data to other pool drives without any problem by Storage Spaces itself. If I did not have that Simple volume on my pool, I would have saved about 2 weeks of troubleshooting and the expense of 2 additional USB HDDs I purchased to throw into the
 system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I think we need is some kind of "vacate drive" command that will allow us to tell Storage Spaces that we want to remove a selected drive, and Storage Spaces can get on it's business of reallocating all data on that drive to other drives in the pool.
 For example, if I want to remove an older 1TB HDD, I would like to tell Storage Spaces to vacate the 1TB drive and reallocate the data to the other drives in the pool. That just seems to be a more civilized way of conducting business than having to unplug/disconnect/manually
 remove a drive to cause an error state that triggers Storage Spaces to rebuild. I would hate to think what might happen if you have another drive fail while Storage Spaces is rebuilding the system from the drive you just manually removed.</p>

            <p>After spending a few more hours on YouTube looking at everything about Storage Spaces, I found one video where a guy shows how to use the Powershell commands to "retire" a specific drive in the Storage Space pool of drives. This essentially tells Storage
 Spaces to reallocate the data on the selected drive and prepare it for removal. The reallocation works on Parity and 2 and 3 way mirror volumes, but NOT for Simple volumes, which he added in his comments section. Since I no longer use Simple volumes in my
 Storage Spaces pool, the "retire" Powershell command would do everything else I wanted in my proposed "vacate drive" command. I can live with the Powershell retire command until the Storage Spaces GUI adds a method to retire a drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, I talked to a few other local computer guys who tried Storage Spaces on their systems. Both said that they had used Simple volumes as part of their pool, and everything was great until it wasn't. Both reported that they lost ALL their data in their
 Simple volumes when one drive failed. Fortunately for me, my failed drive was still seen by my Storage Spaces and was automatically "retired." I was able to manually transfer all the data on the Simple volume to a Parity volume. If the drive had totally failed
 and was no longer recognized by Storage Spaces, I guess I would also have lost everything!?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was under the impression that if you had a Simple volume on a multi drive pool, and one drive failed, you would only lose data on that drive. What I think people are experiencing, is that the ENTIRE Simple volume, spanning multiple drives, will lose ALL
<p>
</p><p>At best, if you need faster read/write times than a Parity or Mirror volume on your server, then a Simple volume should only be considered as a limited TEMP file storage solution. For me, it's no longer worth it and if I need a simple backup of my data,
 I'll just use a standalone USB HDD not associated with Storage Spaces.</p>

<p>Hi George,</p>
<p>Curious to know how this all panned out after you applied the November update?</p>
<p>This seems to be a major issue (not a minor one) and deserves some special MS attention to rectify.</p>

<p>OEM is Original Equipment Manufacture, aka what came from the factory so a OEM drive is the drive that was in a 360 if it came with one or one you bought at a store that sells 360 systems and accessories. &nbsp;so in a word no, if you have a OEM drive nothing
 bad will happen to you.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, OEM is also used by eBayers to refer to third party HDDs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unless the seller is stating the drive was pulled from an original console, it doesn't apply. If the drive is not 250GB or 320GB, it doesn't apply. You're much better off buying a retail drive.</p>

<p>Ok. I had talked to a microsoft rep on here and they said that I wouldn't get into any trouble for using a third party hard drive. They just couldn't guarantee that it would work with the system. And is the term thrown around as loosely on amazon?</p>

<p>3rd party hds dont always meet the read write requirements of xbox for usb storage</p>
<p>You can only used a 3rd party hd without issues as usb drives If It has a decent controller</p>
<p>Using 3rd party hds as xbox hds many result in a Consoles ban</p>

<p>[quote user="LivinRugby"]Ok. I had talked to a microsoft rep on here and they said that I wouldn't get into any trouble for using a third party hard drive.[/quote]If they are referring to a HDD that attaches to the HDD port on the console, they are incorrect.
 Third party HDDs are not authorized accessories. Unauthorized accessories are prohibited as per the Terms of Use.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If they are referring to a USB-attached HDD, that's fine. It's treated as a USB Memory Unit. As of the latest update, USB Memory Unit capacity was doubled, to 32GB per device.[quote]And is the term thrown around as loosely on amazon?[/quote]Yes, it is. If

<h2>            skype message</h2>
                    I have credit on my Skype account. I can call with Skype, but when i send a message it does not get sent. Also the sent logo that one used to get is no longer there, just a small wheel like object, so one never knows if the message was sent or received
 successfully. Any ideas? Thanks.

<h2>            Network Sharing and Homegroup not working after update--PLEASE HELP&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Desperately hoping that someone can help me. I work from home and went to do some work yesterday only to find that my photo editor was no longer working. I spent hours yesterday trying to fix it to no avail. After several hours and speaking to several different
 people, I decided to restore my version of windows 10 to a previous version. Turns out, after a recent update there were issues with the photo editor and it was not my computer that was the issue, but rather a bug with the new update. Long story short, I spent
 the rest of the day yesterday downloading all my apps and software again since they were deleted after the restore. This morning I logged in again ready to do some work, typed my password into the homegroup and was unable to log in. I tried again, same thing.
 I then deleted the homegroup, disconnected all computers, and tried to create a new homegrou but continued to get an error message stating "homegroup cannot be created from this computer". Ok, thats annoying. I tried to create a new homegroup from my other
 computer and it worked. I went into my office computer which is now displaying that there is a homegroup to connect to, I type the new password and still get an error message "unable to join homegroup". This is a nightmare. So I did some research and see that
 after a new update to windows 10, the homegroup will be discontinued. So im thinking that maybe the homegroup is not a thing anymore? So I tried to connect via network settings. On the office computer that i work from, the network is showing both computers,
 however, on the laptop that was not restored it is only showing itself and cannot see the office computer. What is going on?! I tried to call microsoft in the hopes that one of their techs could help me but after waiting on hold for 20 minutes I just continued
 to get people that made me repeat the issue over and over again, and kept stating that they could not hear me and that I needed to take them off speaker phone (they were not on speaker phone. I was using my iphone 8 plus on the verizon wireless network-- I
 had full bars and could hear them perfectly and the volume was turned on high). In the end, I got frustrated because they could not hear me and I am wasting another workday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping that someone can help me figure out why the laptop cannot see the office computer in the network settings.....I really dont want to spend money on a Mac but its seeming like there are too many issues with the windows 10 network and its preventing
 me from doing my job.&nbsp;</p>

            Hello chel. Unfortunately home-groups were removed in 1803 
<br />
<br />more information here: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4091368/windows-10-homegroup-removed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/409136...</a>
<br />
<br />HomeGroup has been removed from Windows 10 (Version 1803). However, even though it has been removed, you can still share printers and files by using features that are built into Windows 10.

<p>1. What is the <em>full name</em> of your installed anti-virus application or security suite and

<p>4. Why wasn't SP3 installed <em>years ago? </em></p>

            Why do you repeatedly respond to this problem with "why wasn't SP3 installed years ago"? Do you somehow imagine this to be helpful? In what way do you imagine it helpful? It isn't helpful. It's insulting. Would this problem somehow be less frustrating
 to the user if it had occurred years ago instead of now? Please simply answer the question or don't, but don't demean the person with the problem with this comment.

<h2>            Too many windows services are stopped in task manager</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all my laptop is Dell XPS 9530&nbsp;</p>
<p>Intel i7-4712HQ &nbsp;CPU @2.30GHz</p>
<p>16 GB memory and 512 SSD hard drive </p>
<p>My OS is windows 8.1&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got this laptop last December and it did not suffer any problem before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second , I noticed today in the task manager that there are many windows and Microsoft services have stopped running in the task manager. Here are screenshots of those services that stopped running</p>
<p><a href="https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=333930840EEA2F90!8071&amp;authkey=!APOkIXuWN90Vo2w&amp;ithint=folder%2cPNG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=333930840EEA2F90!8071&amp;authkey=!APOkIXuWN90Vo2w&amp;ithint=folder%2cPNG&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>I had a couple of Blue Screen of death "BSOD" earlier this time. It was caused one &nbsp;by "&nbsp;srv.sys" and then by "kernel data inpage error"<br />
I noticed that it occurred when I played an audio file in Windows 8 native Music app. It is worth to mention that BSOD used to collect the info it needed 100% and did not restart automatically. I had to restart it myself. I downloaded a new audio file and it
 worked fine. No more BSOD but I feel there is something wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>On that day&nbsp;noticed that Intel Smart Connect technology was not working and I had to enable it from the Bios.&nbsp;<br />
I ran all the tests whether hardware tests or software tests , windows maintenance tests or Dell diagnostics tests and they say nothing is &nbsp;wrong with my laptop. I have the latest updates for windows. There is one update remaining for the bios in Dell. I was
 lazy to do it because I am waiting Dell to release a newer BIOS for Dell XPS15 9530 after the release of windows 10 by the end of the month.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>I wish I could have kept a scan from the Bluescreen viewer but unfortunately I used CCleaner without noticing that it would delete the minddump files too. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I noticed that the laptop is getting hotter faster than usual. I know it is summer and I live in Egypt but I feel there is something wrong&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not suffer from slowness or any other problem, the pc is still fast nevertheless I feel it is getting hotter faster than usual just by using Google chrome "yes I know chrome eats memory"&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time and Please tell me that I do not have to reinstall the windows&nbsp;<br />

    <title>Microsoft Edge has huge problems since 1511 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Edge has huge problems since 1511 update</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft Edge has been playing up a lot since 1511 (Pro x86-64) , although, <em>
overall it's still smoother than 10240</em>. </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>There was a bug where only intranet history was being recorded (not internet history), and this was solved by clearing history.</li><li>Now, sites on the top sites tab are randomly disappearing. Two days ago, I had all 8 filled, yesterday I lost three (that I still use frequently) and today I lost one more (that I use always!)</li><li>Edge PC and edge phone DO NOT sync even after enabling the sync option. I don't know how to force the sync, but it really doesn't.</li></ol>

</p><p>Oh wait - there's a problem with snapping! I just happened to snap Edge to the left and then Bam! All the eight tiles are filled. I close Edge when snapped and it shows up with four, I close edge when not snapped and it shows up with eight.</p>

            <p>Having tried about a zillion things, including tweaking the three different "AutoRecover" Edge policy settings in the registry (no effect, what-so-ever) this registration PowerShell script did the trick, finally!</p>
<p>I had been VERY frustrated with this problem after the 1511 "November" update, to the point I was starting to use Chrome, depite being a die-hard Windows fan, since the Win 3.0 days (except Vista and 8)...</p>
<p>This should get more keywords tagged, I've intentionally added the "AutoRecover" and "1511" and "November" ones to try and help people searching on a solution get this match earlier than myself, hopefully it'll help others.&nbsp; I found MANY frustrated users
 along the way, in many different forums, same issue.</p>
<p>MS should really issue a "Fixit" or similar to bail people out here, not everyone may be comfortable running PS, and the first reset fix didn't do it for me.</p>

            <p><span>I ran the PowerShell snippets—and it worked—but the next time I closed and opened Edge, it did not.&nbsp; This, combined with the inability to save open tabs, is a major usability issue.&nbsp; For the most
 part I switched to Edge while running build 10240, but now I think I’m going to install Chrome since Microsoft can’t be bothered to fix this for months in their latest and greatest product.</span></p>

<h2>            computer freezes when connecting&#47;disconnecting usb&#63;&#33;&#63;&#33;&#63;</h2>
                    recently, when i try to connect my ipod, iphone, flash drive, or portable harddrive to my vista computer the screen will get all jumbled up and freeze then show a blue screen error message and automatically restart. i have no idea what is causing this.
 ive tried different usb ports but i get the same results. the device will work if it is already plugged into my computer before it starts but when i try to disconnect in any way the computer restarts.&nbsp;

            Hi,<br />
<br />
This is mainly for drives.<br />
<br />
Tips for solving problems with USB devices -&nbsp;and a Mr Fixit<br />
<a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/c39bd203-f729-47a4-8351-83291e13c8a81033.mspx#EGB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/c39bd203-f729-47a4-8351-83291e13c8a81033.mspx#EGB</span></a><br />
<br />
Also :<br />
<br />
Control Panel&nbsp;- Device Manager - USB Serial Controllers - USB Mass Storage Devices (you may have<br />
more than one - if so check all) - double click and on Driver Tab - Click Driver Details - the defaut is<br />
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\USBSTOR.SYS&nbsp; (the C:\Windows is where you have windows installed<br />
if not C:\Windows\)<br />
<br />
Check this again as you proceed through these.<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<p>Make a Restore Point</p>
<p>Control Panel - Device Manager - click in the blank area - then VIEW - Show Hidden Devices</p>
<p>now look everywhere EXCEPT USB Controllers for your device (may not find ANY) and if you find<br />
it RIGHT CLICK and UNINSTALL them all. The Device is your drive(s) or similar.</p>
<p>now go to USB Controllers and UNINSTALL EVERYTHING in the category but the category itself.</p>
<p>APPLY/OK</p>
<p>REBOOT</p>
<p>This will refresh the USB stack and hopefully allow the device to install. (You may need a powered hub)</p>
<p>Here is the similar procedure in XP, Vista's is the same except we need to clear the specific device if present.<br />

<p>Here is a utility to help but do the above 1st.</p>
<p>USBDeview is a small utility that lists all USB devices that currently connected to your computer, as well as all
<br />
USB devices that you previously used. Run it Options and check the 1st three choices to see if any are there.<br />
Try removing all instances and rebooting then plug in the drive.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/usb_devices_view.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/usb_devices_view.html</span></a></p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Check this :<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows Disk - find Windows Disk Management on list at top -<br />
Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN&nbsp;&nbsp; look to see if there is a driver letter assigned or a conflict or the<br />
drive letter assigned is not the one you are used to seeing. This of course may not show the
<br />
drive&nbsp;at all, this is just a check.<br />
<br />

<br />

    <title>Initiating a network connection in Windows 10 Pro IR - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikecastignani  say:</h3>
<h2>            Initiating a network connection in Windows 10 Pro IR</h2>
                    <p>The process requireds to initiate a network connection (typically where a user has multiple ADSL accounts) is not as slick as was the case in Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that a user is required to have a pop-up bfox, select the account, click the connect button is a more complex and disjointed process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is not necessary to pop-up a dialogue box of the the etire Network and Internet setup in order to initiate a connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find this to be slower and and less convenient than Win 8.1 where you can iitiate any connection by simply clicking the network connection in the taskbar and initiating the desired connection in the pop-up list of connections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Build 10158</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still enjoying the rest of Windows10!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mike</p>
