<h2>            Windows Updates failed to install with the error code 8024200D</h2>
                    <p>* Original Title: Code 8024200D</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have windows 7 pro and have found a i have a rather large list of failed updates. The latest coming with the above error code. I have run the windows troubleshooter and still this error occurs. I shut down my AVG antivirus prior to last update to see if
 it is part of the problem but still it has happened.</p>
<p>Can someone give me some idea as to what to do next!! Last couple of times i started my computer I saw in the bottom right hand corner the writing that my copy of Pro7 isn't authentic, but when I go into check all my computer info it tells me it's a registered
 authentic copy on that page.</p>
<p>All suggestions will be listened to as have tried everything I can think of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>Owen</p>

            <p>I tired the update readiness tool and still got the same problems with it. Will try the other suggestion and come back to you with whether or not it has worked. Am still trying to figure out why it suddenly stopped doing the updates properly? Has me puzzled
 as can't find anything that may have blocked it or stopped it from completing them.</p>

            <p>Sharief,</p>
<p>Have tried as suggested and still no good. The Microsoft genuine advantage tool tells me that my copy of windows is the real deal but on start up in the bottom right corner my screen tells me the opposite.</p>
<p>Have tried numerous times now to download the updates that haven't been downloaded and it three parts of the way thru and stops. Have been thru everything suggested but nothing seems to be fixing this problem. Have even run torjan software and malware killers
 in case something has gotten in but I run a pretty secure system and the software I use I am sure hasn't let anything in, but you know how it goes, you second guess yourself just incase.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am debating now about updating the system to Windows 8.1. It doesn't seem to bad and am hopefull it will get rid off this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<p>A Clean Boot for Explorer</p>

<p>It might be caused by a shell extension.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Explorer (explorer.exe) is the program that is the Start menu and taskbar, folder windows, and the desktop (which is a folder window).</p>

Explorer is built on addin programs called Shell Extensions. The standard ones are supplied by Microsoft but programs add their own.</p>

<h3> quiteirritated  say:</h3>
<h2>            What are the Hex Designations for the Keys on a Standard 105 Key UK Keyboard&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have been searching for this for weeks but I can't find it. All I come up with is ALT codes, ASCII codes, alternate character codes, binding new functions to keys, weird programming stuff etc. How can this be so hard to find?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is all I want:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Standard 105 Key UK keyboard, EG Logitech K120;</p>
<p>Every key on that board must have a number or code designating what the key is;</p>
<p>One of those keys has to be Key Number ONE;<br />
Some other key has to be Key Number 2;</p>
<p>Some other key has to be Key Number 53;</p>
<p>Some other key has to be Key Number 104;</p>
<p>That designation is probably in Hex, like 0x01, 0x0e, 0x2f etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I find out which key has which code, so if I see something like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>KeyBinds 0x4e = Null, I know which key it means?</p>
<p>
</p><p>SOME one must know!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Many Thanks</p>

    <title>P&#58;&#47; is not accessible. The parameter is incorrect. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> usedapples  say:</h3>
<h2>            P&#58;&#47; is not accessible. The parameter is incorrect.</h2>
                    <p>So, here's the story that has gotten me up to this point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My fiance's laptop broke a few years ago (Dell Inspiron, Windows 7). She had dropped it against the bed frame and it'll start up, but once it gets to that area where you'd have to put in a password to get into the computer, it just sits there on that bluish
 background with nothing else but the cursor. We ran a diagnostic and the hard drive came up with Error Code 2000-0142, which when I looked it up, was just listed as "hard drive failure."</p>
<p>
</p><p>She really only wants her files back, so I recently took the hard drive out and stuck it in a usb case and hooked it up to my computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two folders are there-- Recovery O: and Local Disk P:. I can open the recovery folder, but not the local disk folder. "P:/ is not accessible. The parameter is incorrect."</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I downloaded two different recovery programs; the first one just freezes at a certain point (I went to bed and woke up to find it in the same spot) and the second one just crashes completely when I try to open the P drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I opened command prompt and tried&nbsp;Chkdsk /f /r P:, but it says it's a RAW file system.&nbsp;"RAW file system is a state of the hard drive or other storage device which has no known Windows file system. Because no file system exists on the drive, there can
 be no files or folders on the drive, and it cannot be used to store data." I assume this is why Windows 7 wasn't loading up on her laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I downloaded another program that's meant to search in RAW hard drives and it crashes after I load P:/...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how can I get these files off her hard drive? I'm not exactly sure what happened to it after she had hit it on the bed frame... it will
<strong>sometimes</strong> make a soft clicking noise...</p>

            <p>Disks that make clicking noises are a lost cause. To retrieve any data from them you need specialised software, special skills and a lot of patience, if only because files are stored on the disk in numerous fragments. You would need to learn in detail how
 NTFS works so that you can reassemble the pieces. Start by looking at the Wikepedia entry for NTFS.</p>
<p>It's probably a harsh reminder for your fiancée to back up her data regularly (e.g. weekly) to an external disk.</p>

            Well the thing is, it isn't clicking now at all. I'm not sure if it even would in it's usb case but it's running fine. I was thinking that I'm probably going to have to take it to someone to look at... and if she can't get anything back from it, I suppose
 I'll just have to buy her a new hard drive and OS for her laptop.

    <title>Window LIve Photo Icon covering each photo -WHY&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeniertmer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Window LIve Photo Icon covering each photo -WHY&#63;</h2>
                    I've been using Windows Live Photo gallery for some time now but before, each folder showed a tiny piece of a photograph in it that you could view as you scrolled down and also, when opening a folder previously, all the photos in there showed on the screen.
 Now, when I scroll down through the folders, any photos in there show only the flower photo icon which makes if very time consuming then to click on each photo to see what it is, especially if you want a pic to use in a blog post or to e-mail to a friend or
 family member. When and WHY did this change take place? Now, I have to make sure I name each photo in there and then, look in each folder for the named photo I want to look at or use.<br />
<br />
Having the icon covering each photo I download from my camera -as well as previous photos that are in my account -and there are many, many photos in there -that I now have to go in, one at a time to view, then give the photo a distinctive name, etc.is a very
 time consuming task for me now. <br />
<br />
Just kind of makes me think of Facebook and how they frequently make changes to their set-up under the guise that it makes life so much easier for those using their setup and sometimes it really just mucks up the works.<br />

<p>
</p><p>I lose color calibration on my laptop (ASUS) whenever i extend display &nbsp;via HDMI, but it doesn't happen when i mirror the display, i already went to color management, i already checked "use my setting for this device", and is set as default.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All drivers are up to day, including windows.<br />
</p>
<p>I'd really like a solid solution, or an explanation to why this is happening, as i tried everything i could think of to solve this.<br />
</p>
<p>Calibrating color manually every time i extend to the display is becoming a real hassle.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Can I use a drive that already has data without erasing it&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have a 2TB drive that I back my computer up on. I would like to use this drive for storage with my 360 as well if I can. Don't know if this will be a problem but I run both Windows 7 and OS X Snow Leopard on my iMac using Boot Camp. I have partitioned
 my backup drive so that I can backup both operating systems. 1TB is FAT32 and 1TB is Mac OS X Extended Journaled.</p>
<p>Here's my real question. I read through some stuff on this site and it said you can choose customize in order to choose how much space to use for 360. When I plug it in and choose customize instead of configure, which will erase and format the drive for
 360 use, It still says that all content will be removed! So... both configure AND customize will erase what you already have on the drive?</p>

<p>if you plug any external hard drive it should be backed up because the 360 will format it before setting up that 16 gig partition to be used on the 360, leaving the rest of the drive blank. &nbsp;at least that is what I have seen and heard on other 360 forums.</p>

<p>Thanks, that's what I suspected. You can use it with both AFTER you format it and set up the 360 partition. You can't take a drive with stuff already on it and start using it with 360 without erasing that stuff first.</p>

<p>So I just figured it out. You were right that the 360 will reformat the drive if it is not in FAT32 format which is the case for me, mine is NTFS format. Someone with a usb drive already in FAT32 format CAN create a 360 partition without losing what is already
 on the drive from their computer. If the drive is not FAT32 you will lose all data on it when it is formatted.</p>

            <p>Yes, you can do this. All you need to do is create a Fat32 partition using a program like AOMEI Partition Assistant. It is very simple to do and will take somewhere around 10 minutes to complete if you don't have to defragment the hard drive first. Using a tool like this or a similar one, shrink the existing partition down the amount that you want to have for Xbox 360 storage space (maximum of 32GB). Once you have done this, you will see unallocated space for the amount you shrunk the partition for. Right click this and create partition. Select type as Fat32 and Primary. Make sure it is PRIMARY. After this, just apply the changes and plug it into your Xbox when it finishes and you will have your storage device ready to go. :)</p>

Once you have done this, you will see unallocated space for the amount you shrunk the partition for. Right click this and create partition. Select type as Fat32 and Primary. Make sure it is PRIMARY. After this, just apply the changes and plug it into your Xbox when it finishes and you will have your storage device ready to go. :)</p>
 
 </blockquote> <p>I'm not sure what file system the Xbox One uses, but you should be able to use a similar method for that if you even have to for the Xbox One.</p>

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>It appears that the mouse is the problem....&nbsp; I neglected to mention that it was a wireless mouse in original message.&nbsp; Battery is good (1.59v).&nbsp; After running the sfc/scannow&nbsp;command as advised,&nbsp;no errors are reported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I swapped out the mouse with&nbsp;another machine, and now it appears that that cursor is functioning properly on the original machine that I inquired about....</p>
<p>
</p><p>After exchanging the mouse(s), it appears to be&nbsp;responding&nbsp;erratically on the second machine (Windows 7 Home Premium).&nbsp; It doesn't pulse, but sometimes doesn't move.&nbsp;&nbsp;Device manager shows best driver is up to date and installed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, I assume your assessment is a mouse that is failing?</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Michael</p>

            <p>Have you tried a wired mouse...?...I have a few...everyone has a wired mouse lying around somewhere?<br />
I use an older infa red wired mouse because it works so <strong>much better </strong>
than any wireless one ...this one I use on any surface and it responds perfectly on my
<em>desktop</em>. ...I bought a couple new wired mouses and only one of them work fine the other one needs a pad</p>
<p>underneath .</p>
<p>I also am using a wireless mouse for my <em>laptop</em>...it also requires a pad since it is flaky.</p>
<p>so there you go...my take...some even new mouses do not function well.</p>
<p>This does not really give you the answer for your circumstances i guess...with out really working on your system My self I am just suggesting.</p>
<p>I don't have the site right now but there is a long thread in the Windows 10 forums on this issue....try a search of the forum....'<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/search/search?SearchTerm=mouse+lag&amp;IsSuggestedTerm=false&amp;tab=&amp;x=16&amp;y=8&amp;CurrentScope.ForumName=Windows&amp;CurrentScope.Filter=windows_10-update&amp;ContentTypeScope=#/Windows/windows_10-update//1">Mouse

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>I tried a "wired mouse" and the problem continues, so I have my doubts that it is the mouse malfunctioning.&nbsp; I have found a remedy for the pulsing, but it's a less desirable solution.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I don't allow my computer to go into sleep/hibernation mode, then it doesn't pulse.&nbsp; I have set the&nbsp;computer to never sleep, but still allow the&nbsp;laptop screen to go into a sleep mode.&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon awaking, it is okay.&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously discussed, if it goes into
 sleep, it will pulse until it is restarted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And while I can live with&nbsp;this situation, would you recommend re-installing windows again?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Michael&nbsp;</p>

<h3> kindred.  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#8220;Critical Error &#8211; Your Start menu isn&#8217;t working.  We&#8217;ll try to fix it the next time you sign in.&#8221;</h2>
                    <p>Like many people, I have been having issues with the <span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><span>“Critical Error – Your Start menu isn’t working.<span>&nbsp;
</span>We’ll try to fix it the next time you sign in.” </span></span>message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This probably started sometime around the November update...&nbsp; but has been getting progressively worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>originally, I tried several of the fixes suggested....</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- re-registered the start menu app package from command line.</p>
<p><strong>Get-appxpackage -all *shellexperience* -packagetype bundle |% {add-appxpackage -register -disabledevelopmentmode ($_.installlocation + “\appxmetadata\appxbundlemanifest.xml”)}</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tried this previously and it fixed the issue for a whort time. However, after additional updates have come in from Microsoft, when attempting this, I get access denied error. &nbsp; So that doesn't work at all any more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get-appxpackage : Access is denied.<br />
Access is denied.<br />
At line:1 char:1<br />
+ Get-appxpackage -all *shellexperience* -packagetype bundle |% {add-ap ...<br />
+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + CategoryInfo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; : NotSpecified: (:) [Get-AppxPackage], UnauthorizedAccessException<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; + FullyQualifiedErrorId : System.UnauthorizedAccessException,Microsoft.Windows.Appx.PackageManager.Commands.GetApp<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; xPackageCommand</p>
<p>
</p><p>2- I tried registering a local admin account - logging into that account and then going back to my main, account</p>
<p>Again, this worked for a little while.&nbsp; After some update in the past week, it has stopped having any effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3- Safe mode -&nbsp; can't even get there...</p>
<p>
</p><p>4- reset Windows -- seriously? You seriously consider this an option to "maybe fix" something?&nbsp; Ummm... no.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have content on these systems which I can't afford to lose -- and even resetting and restoring would be a HUGE amount of work.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can not ask
 people to lose all their content and settings because of a bug in your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been ongoing, on my desktop machine as noted.</p>
<p>As of 2-3 days ago, however, my tablet has started acting the same way - except worse.</p>
<p>I can't even create a new local account...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally...&nbsp; </p>
<p>a- the Windows Store has disappeared from my taskbar and (since I can't get to the start menu) I can't manually start it.
</p>
<p>b- any links to windows apps in firefox fail to load the windows store.</p>
<p>c- Edge has disappeared from my taskbar...and (since I can't get to the start menu) I can't manually start it.
</p>
<p>d- Cortana fails (of course)</p>
<p>e- all of my active icons in the bottom right section are unclickable...&nbsp; I can right click on them, but left clicking triggers no action at all.&nbsp; This includes the volume, the networking and the action center as well as individual running-app icons</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Microsoft folks... please fix this.</p>
<p>This gets progressively worse eahc time I read new reports from other users... and if getting progressively worse for me.</p>
<p>Right now, two of my machines are only semi-functional and - if thie continues, will essentially be as useful as a brick.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is unacceptable behavior on the part of an operating system -- and one which we were essentially conned into upgrading to...</p>
<p>FIX YOUR SOFTWARE!</p>

            <p>Well, ****.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After posting all that information, I came across another user who noted that after uninstalling Dropbox, the start menu started working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lo and behold... yup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now... the million dollar question is: Whose fault is it?&nbsp; If it's a Microsoft issue, then the fix should be a lot easier to target, since we seem to have a vector...&nbsp;&nbsp; if it's a Dropbox app issue, then we'll go yell at them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, dropbox is a NECESSITY gicen the multiple devices and files that need to be transfered between them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(and the bonus question is: Why isn't Microsoft saying anything about this???)</p>

<h2>            Acer Veriton L480G problems to upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a Laptop (ASUS on Win 7) &nbsp;and a PC (the Acer on Win 8.1) at my home</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday i tried to upgrade both after receiving the notification that the upgrade is ready</p>
<p>The Laptop upgrade went well and all is good, the PC upgrade has failed 3 times and i don't know what is the problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>It download all the files and start the upgrade, it complete the copy files phase but when it reaches the updating drivers and features it stuck on 91% and the screen freeze (moving the mouse with no response)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to reboot the PC and it tried to continue the installation but at the end it just rollback to the last working windows version that i had (8.1) - which is nice i must say</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help with this issue will be welcome (since i tried it 3 times with no success)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            I am having the same issue with the same veriton L480g, however I have checked the system requirements prior to installing and still it wont install. This maybe a harware issue however in the program setup of windows ten i believe microsoft should have
 the install program automatically make a report on failed attempts to install so as microsoft can supply a solid answer as to why it didn't work. this clearly isnt an isolated incident and warrants further attention by microsoft.<br />

            <p>Hi Steven</p>
<p>I agree with you that Microsoft should have mentioned that this hardware is not support for the Win 10 upgrade and in the pop-up window that they created in order to promote the upgrade it was mentioned that the check was passed successfully for the upgrade
 (this to answer the guy aboce you)</p>
<p>But after checking in the Acer official site i found out that this type of PC is not supported for the Win 10 upgrade - so i guess we will have to stay win Win 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>For all the otheres Veriton L480G useres info - don't even try to upgrade, it won't work</p>
<p>
</p><p>Btw as a side comment , i spent 2 long hours with Microsoft support people and none of them new about this problem - what was easy to find in Acer support site , again i think Microsoft should do thier homework better</p>

<h2>            Old PC games troubleshoot&#58; Black &#38; White 2</h2>
                    I just recently bought one of my old favorite games online, Black &amp; White 2 and it arrived today. I installed it onto my computer, which runs windows 7, and the installation completed, however; when I try to play it, it states, "Please login with administrator
 privileges and try again." I only have one account on my computer so I'm guessing I'm already the admin and I also tried right clicking and "Run as administrator." but nothing seems to work... how do I play older games on windows 7? Please help I'm so desperate
 to play one of my favorite childhood games again! Much appreciated.

            <p>Same problem, right now.</p>
<p>I've tried several different compatibility modes, tried to launch it from both the disc and in the game directory, but no matter what, it doesn't open; keeping an eye on the task manager and the process simply stops a second later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Patching the game with the two original patches doesn't help the problem.</p>

            <p>Similar questions have been asked and answered in other threads on this site. Black &amp; White 2 and many other games using the same DRM technology were rendered useless by this update : "KB3086255", which came around 8th September.</p>
<p>Microsoft considered this update to be necessary for security purposes, but didn't bother to make it clear to people who would be affected.</p>
<p>The KB article does explain how to get around the issue, though : <em>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3086255</em></p>

            <p>Yes, it worked perfectly fine for me. </p>
<p>I can't remember if I re-installed the game (but I probably did during other attempts to get it to work), but it shouldn't really have a say.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try explaining how to do it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First you must open the elevated command prompt. This is done by searching for the command prompt and opening it as Administrator. (Which may require certain permissions).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Type in<br />
<em>sc config secdrv start= demand </em></p>
<p>and hit enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Type in</p>
<p><em>sc start secdrv</em></p>
<p>and hit enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now run the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For security reasons, do NOT forget to disable this again when you're done playing.</p>
<p>Open the elevated command prompt again;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Type in</p>
<p><em>sc stop secdrv</em></p>
<p>and hit enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Type in</p>
<p><em>sc config secdrv start= disabled</em></p>
<p>and hit enter.</p>

            Everytime I try the command prompt, it says access denied "service cannot be started, either because it is disabled or becuase it has no enable devices associated with it." What am I doing wrong?

    <title>Windows 10 in Endless Blue Icon &#47; Preparing Automatic Repair Loop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jerry r2  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 in Endless Blue Icon &#47; Preparing Automatic Repair Loop</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 downloaded and installed in the background on my Windows 8.1 HP Desktop a couple of nites ago, per my reservation, and started up once after installation.&nbsp; After 1st restart, it continually gets stuck at blue Windows icon screen, with text below
 either blank, "Starting" or "Preparing Automatic Repair".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried startup recovery from "Windows Boot Manager", for Windows 10 options, as well as for previous Operating System.&nbsp; I also tried booting from Windows 10 ISO boot disc that&nbsp;I created using Microsoft download and tools. &nbsp;My machine starts to access the
 ISO boot disc, but always stops along the way, so I never see "repair" options.&nbsp; (Please note that I know boot disc is good, because I tried it on other machines.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have my original Windows 7 and Windows 8 Upgrade discs, and both boot on my machine.&nbsp; With Windows 8 Upgrade disc, I can't do much, but it appears that Windows 7 disc provides the "refresh" and "reset" capabilities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what to do at this point....&nbsp; other than start anew with original Windows 7 disc.&nbsp; I believe that would require a great deal of work, i.e. all Windows 7, Windows 8 and Windows 8.1 updates over the last 2+ years&nbsp;to rebuild my system, not to mention
 all the programs, drivers and settings,&nbsp;and hopefully assuming that all my personal files are still OK on my hard drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some other solution to "repair" Windows 10&nbsp;???&nbsp; ...... or to revert back to my working Windows 8.1, without rebuilding the entire system ???</p>
<p />

            <p>Hi Santosh .... and Thx much for the reply.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't have any "error" messages, other than Windows icon, with no text, or&nbsp;with&nbsp;"Starting" or "Preparing Automatic Repair", where all got stuck/hung, and never further&nbsp;continued.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also did try&nbsp;Windows 10 ISO Boot disc, using&nbsp;Microsoft download and tools generation, and&nbsp;my machine wouldn't boot off of that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally tried a Windows 8.1 ISO Boot disc, since my machine was previously at that version, and was able to get my PC up-and-running, although lost my programs/settings/etc., but still had my personal data files.&nbsp; Had to go thru 100's of updates, but got
 the machine going again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, I decided, before I loaded all my programs/app's, would try to load Windows 10 off of the "ISO Boot disc"&nbsp;I created.&nbsp; All worked fine until, after startup, I tried to change my&nbsp;graphics screen to a higher resolution.&nbsp; Once I did that and restarted
 Windows 10, all went back to a "hung" situation, and then I had to start all over again, from Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appears that the problem is associated with my Graphics Controller and Windows 10, i.e. my ATI Radeon HD 2600 PRO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now going to try to NOT change my graphics resolution to a higher quality, but leave it at the default that Windows 10 set it at, which is 1024x768.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, I'll see what happens.......</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else have any further comments on this ?????&nbsp;&nbsp; Thx, Jerry2.</p>

<h3> davidwhittakerau  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 to Windows 10 upgrade - SD card reader and finger print swipe sensor that no longer work</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell Latitude E6430 ATG that was custom ordered with an SD card reader and a finger print swipe sensor.&nbsp; Neither of these items worked after I upgraded to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After contacting Dell I was told that the drivers&nbsp;for the SD card reader are now looked after by windows and I was put onto a Microsoft site that gave me the option of downloading an even later version of Windows 10.&nbsp; This worked and the machine could then
 find my SD card reader and read it.&nbsp; (For a while at least.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>After searching the net based on info that Dell had told me I created a Microsoft account and then chose the option of local sign in.&nbsp; That process was a little disturbing as Cortana asked for my work address and attempted to take my picture (I work in a
 secure industry and I am not supposed to give out that sort of information).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case after the process the log in still uses my PIN and not the password I selected, the finger print swipe still does not work so I can not log in with it, the options for selecting local sign in seem to have disappeared and also the computer now
 no longer acknowledges the existence of the SD card reader again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I go back to Windows 7 in such a way the I can come back to Windows 10 when Microsoft have actually got the thing working?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, how do I get Windows 10 to recognize and use all of the hardware that is built into my laptop so I can use it without compromising my personal, banking and employee security?</p>
<p>

            <p>The laptop came with Windows 7 already installed so there is no Windows 7 disk.&nbsp; I did however take the precaution of making a Windows 7 repair disk and a image of the hard drive just before the Windows 10 upgrade.&nbsp; I was hoping however to use that combination
 as last resort.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my endeavors to get Windows 10 working&nbsp;I did come across a command for going back to Windows 7&nbsp;under
<strong>Start&gt;Control Panel&gt;Systems and Security </strong>but I &nbsp;would like a bit more information before taking that option.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Q. </strong>What is <strong>Windows 10 ISO</strong>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I was talking to the support people from Dell they suggested that I create a disc using Windows 10 Media Creation Tool but when I went to create the disk I got an error message I did not understand and the DVD burner did not request a disk.&nbsp; A
<strong>Media Creation Tool </strong>is listed in the downloads but I do not know what to do with it from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oddly when I attempted to change the settings to local login (so I could use my old password and finger print swipe) the external card reader I had plugged into one of the USB slots to read my SD card stopped doing so as far as the laptop's File Explorer
 and other software was concerned.&nbsp; The external card reader had been able to read the SD card for my laptop up to that point in time.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Q.</strong> Should I request a Windows 7 disk from Dell to ensure that I get the version of Windows 7 I paid extra for when I ordered the laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Q.</strong>&nbsp; Also is there a way of getting my finger print swipe, SD card readers, and anything else I discover doesn't&nbsp;like Windows 10&nbsp;to work without going back to Windows 7?</p>

                    <p>i was banned after someone initiated a conversation with me so they could harrass me and then they reported me after i defended myself. This is not okay. They need real people to go over these reportings so that the true criminal can&nbsp;be banned. Xbox if trying to help the community with these bans and the evil people are loopholing around it like nothing and maling it worse . I have payed monthly for xbox live for a long time and this is my reward? Ive had xbox live for 8 years... this is unacceptable. Next time i wanna defend myself ill just make sure i dont use any profanity and i can say really horrible things to them and ill get away with it. Btw... Jana C was very unhelpful in assisting me with my ban. It all seems very automated. And unprofessional. You set up the anti cyber bullying enforcement team and they are worthless at identifying true claims and reports... its all automated and a program probably just looks for profanity.. like i said .... next time ill just dish it ou

            How come every response from a Microsoft ambassador. Just lists the terms of service and reinforces the issues we ALL have with banning...all we want is for the other persons insults to be taken into account during the banning process. You can say even
 by defending yourself you are violating the terms and service all you want. It just reinforces our view that the banning process is very flawed and doesant take into account context of this situation. This is honestly ridiculous and just proves how ridiculous
 current situations are when people taking advantage of a flawd system are valued over loyal customers. Just the fact that LITTERALY EVERYONE has at least had a ban prooves that this system desperately needs to change.&nbsp;

            While I understand your frustration, it goes back to the old saying of two wrongs dont make a right.&nbsp; You are responsible for ensuring you dont break the T&amp;Cs yourself.&nbsp; You can chose not not respond and to mute, block and report yourself instead of responding
 as many of us do.&nbsp; This is the advise given by Microsoft and if followed will ensure you dont find yourself banned.

    <title>Windows 10&#58; How to add a secondary keyboard layout besides English - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ahangama  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10&#58; How to add a secondary keyboard layout besides English &#40;US&#41; like US-International</h2>
                    <p>Since 2006, a sizable community has been using a keyboard layout somewhat like Icelandic to type Romanized Singhala. It is used in Linux and Macintosh as well.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Windows 8.1 was updated to Windows 10, we had the OS assuming we are using Unicode Sinhala. We think that it guessed it from the
<br />
LOCALENAME&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"si-LK"</p>
<p>line on the keyboard definition. So, it added Complex Scripts options to the Font dialog. Then it placed the Unicode font Iskoola Pota as the reining font on the Complex Script side undermining our font. It does this by forcing numerals like a year such
 as 2006 to be from Iskoola Pota displayed in its size as in the Font dialog.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The result is that we are not allowed to select the font even for characters that are in the SBCS. This is clearly a bug in the OS.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We tried to remove our keyboard, but the OS did not list the keyboard in the installed programs list! We deleted it manually from the sysm32 and sysWoW64 folders and removed an item from the registry too. Incidentally, for the first time, we saw the regedit.exe
 stop responding toward the end of the database searching for a string. This behavior was repeated on two such searches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having removed the keyboard, we changed the problematic line to the following:<br />
LOCALENAME&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;"en-LK"<br />
We know that this is not a registered locale, but consistent with the accepted pattern. We installed the edited keyboard that you can view here:<br />
http://smartfonts.net/sing/keyboard/win/singlatn.klc</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have to add this font under the Language English (US) not under any other language and certainly not under Sinhala. Unfortunately, we cannot because it is not listed as an available keyboard. All older OSs listed all available keyboards. Strangely, Windows
 10 doesn't. At least it does not list freshly installed keyboards. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is going to be a big problem for us as more people upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any help.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thank you, Sujata.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, the links you gave are for Windows 8.1. Perhaps I did not make it clear that the system I have is Windows 10. Windows XP through 8.1 behaved similarly in what we want to do., but Winodws 10 deviates. Please read the following carefully.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you are an engineer at Microsoft, let me explain what we do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Imagine, we want to add þ, ð to Alt-T and Alt-D positions of the regular English keyboard. And the reason is that we want to type the word 'the' as 'þe' and 'this' as 'ðis'. This is the way Middle English was typed. You'd say why don't you use US-International
 keyboard. That is not the solution we want. We want to do more than just adding those two letters. Therefore, we must make our own keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator for this purpose. Our real purpose is to make a keyboard that can be used to type romanized Singhala which encompasses Pali and Sanskrit. We also want to make the keyboard EASY TO TYPE. It is NOT LANGUAGE SPECIFIC
 because Singhala, Pali and Sanskrit are three distinct languages. Think of English QWERTY keyboard. It is used by Malays just the way it is. So, to call it English is only a convention, just like calling the text we read Latin, though it is not Latin. Latin
 has only 22 letters, all caps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, to create the keyboard, we open the English (US) keyboard inside the keyboard creator and make the changes. Then we create the installation files for it and install it. We have been using our keyboard in Windows XP through 8.1 for years. Now we want
 to use it inside Windows 10 UNDER ENGLISH.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please find the Language option in <strong>WINDOWS 10</strong> this way:</p>
<p>Settings -&gt; Time &amp; Language -&gt; Region &amp; Language<br />
In the dialog box, under Language area, click on English (United States)</p>
<p>Click on Options button</p>
<p>In&nbsp; the resulting dialog box, click on the Add a Keyboard</p>
<p>Now select the keyboard from the list provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That list does not pick up the keyboard we just installed. Obviously, our steps are wrong. What are the correct steps, please.</p>
<p>

            It isn't quite clear what you are trying to do. You can't use your SP4 as a wired second display by connecting to its mini display port from another PC. 
<br />
<br />You CAN use the SP4 mini display port to  MDP, HDMI or DVI to connect to the HDMi or DVI *IN*  port of another monitor/TV (HDMI is better) and some PC's DO support video in. 
<br />
<br />If you draw ON your Surface and are connected to another monitor, you would select "duplicate" mode and whatever you are drawing/inking on your Surface would display on the SP4 and the 2nd monitor. 
<br />
<br />Hope this helps. Please DO mark as Answer if it was of assistance.
