<h2>            System Crash Error Code 0xc000000f </h2>
                    I have an eMachine with Windows 7 Home that has crashed.&nbsp; It's giving error code 0xc000000f "boot section failed because a required device is inaccessable.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
It says to insert the Windows installation disk, restart, and select the repair function.&nbsp; This PC was bought with Windows 7 preloaded and there was no Installation disk provided.&nbsp; I created a System Recovery Disk during initial setup on the PC but the system
 does not recognize it.&nbsp;<br />

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

<p><span>Hi Wes Yancey,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may try and boot into system recovery options and try doing a repair from there.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following Microsoft article for more information on how to boot into system recovery options in Windows 7:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What are the system recovery options in Windows 7?</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you do not have the installation disk, and since this is an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) computer, I’d highly recommend you to contact
 eMachines support for further assistance:</span></p>

            Hi Xia, it looks like Windows Installer is in a loop, trying to install something . . . 
<br />
<br />
<br />Open a Command Prompt Window as Administrator 
<br />
<br />Run these commands one at a time and hit Enter after each one: 
<br />
<br />MSIEXEC /UNREGISTER 
<br />
<br />MSIEXEC /REGSERVER 
<br />
<br />
<br />If the issue is not resolved, there may be something in your Startup that is causing this: 
<br />
<br />Task Manager and indeed Msconfig offer only limited control over Startup items . . . 
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a small free utility that does not require installation 
<br />
<br />When the file downloads, unzip it. 
<br />
<br />Depending on your system, run Autoruns or Autoruns64 as Administrator 
<br />
<br />With that utility, you can right click and delete any startup item in Windows 
<br />
<br />Just be careful not to delete any required process . . .

<h2>            Cannot remove event from Agenda Calendar &#40;Windows 10 Professional&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I cant even believe this stupid issue is happening.....<br />
<br />
I created an event using the agenda function to remind me about a meeting, later that day they cancelled so I went to remove it from the calendar but could not find ANY way to remove it,&nbsp;or even modify it for that sake.<br />
<br />
I don't get it...all I see is an option to "Save and Close" and the other options appear as locked and grayed out (disabled)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm just glad this was a one time event (I hope) because if I had to put up with being harassed by a calendar everyday it would drive me nuts!
<br />
<br />
I have spent two hours looking for a way to remove a dumb event I've never seen anything so silly, what is going on here?<br />

<h2>            I need Classic windows explorer view</h2>
                    I want my classic windows explorer back. And I would like the classic start menu as well. I cannot understand why Microsoft continues to try to get me to do things their way instead of allowing me to do it the way I want. For many of us the policy ought
 to be "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." I don't want to justify myself to someone else just to be able to use the computer the way that works for me. If other people want the new features that is OK with me as long as Microsoft does not mess with the features
 I like.

<p>There's not much you can do about Windows Explorer. However, right clicking on a blank area of the desktop and select the Windows Classic theme will get your start menu a bit more reminiscent of the older look Windows.</p>

<p>Install Classic Shell with the Classic Start Menu option. See the links below.</p>

<p>Unfortunately when Microsoft redesigned Windows Explorer they made some pretty horrendous decisions - of which many people have complained about. There are many other file managers available, both free and for a price. One of them might be easier to use
 and have the features you want, here is a list of most that are available:<br />

 clicking a folder in the left pane can also cause this problem.&nbsp; <strong><a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/WindowsServerFeedback/feedback/details/621426/bug-when-expanding-folders-in-explorer-server-2008-r2-and-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Vote to fix it.</a>
</strong><br />
<br />
3) When multiple files are selected they should stay selected when changing the sorting order (ex: Name to Size). Maintaining selected files when sorting should be a requirement and this feature should not have been removed.<br />
<br />
4) The option to remember each folder's view settings (remembering individual folder window sizes and positions).<br />
<br />
5) The option to remove "Full row selection" for details view. "Full row selection" is very annoying when the folder is full and has no empty space to click on. Also, when dragging/dropping files to a different folder - if you release the file on the row of
 a subfolder or .exe/.zip/.rar file "full row selection" causes the file to be moved into the subfolder or .exe/.zip/.rar file rather the the intended folder.<br />
<br />
6) A search window with all the advanced search options. No syntax required.<br />
<br />
7) The option to always show free disk space and folder size in the status bar and/or details pane. Also always automatically show the size of selected files (when many files are selected it will not show the total size).<br />
<br />
8) The option to scroll the pane your mouse is in with mouse wheel even if that pane is not selected.</p>

<p>Left pane scroll bug (and other fixes):</p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Using Classic Shell To Restore Some Features To Windows Explorer</span></strong>
<p>After installing the free <a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Classic Shell</a> you can customize Windows Explorer closer to how you want it, the quote below is just one way to do so.&nbsp;<a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/features.html#explorer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Click here</a> to see some of the options you can
 customize, and here is the&nbsp;<a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/faq.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">FAQ page</a> for Classic Shell.</p>
<blockquote>A solution which did work for restoring some features.
<p>1) Install the free&nbsp;<a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Classic Shell.</a> &nbsp;This is very customizable, and works as a mod for Windows Explorer rather than a full blown replacement. You didn't need to install the Classic Start Menu
 option, but you can if you want.<br />
2) Reboot the computer.<br />
3) Launch Windows Explorer (Start - Computer) and turn on "Always Show Menus" (Organize - Layout - check Menu Bar). This is just for configuration, you can turn it off again afterwards if you want.<br />
4) Right click on the menu bar and turn on the "Classic Explorer Bar". This adds a series of cut/copy/paste icons to Explorer. Crucially, it also adds the "Configuration" icon.<br />
5) Go into the configuration and from here you can tweak things to your heart's content. To kill the horrible Windows 7 folder-jumping, switch the "Navigation Pane Style" to Vista. You can even knock it back to XP mode if you want (this adds in the lines to
 the folder tree and adds a classic "+" icon for expanding folders). The Windows Vista style folder view looks pretty much the same as the Windows 7 view, but gets rid of the horrible jumping.<br />
6) Tweak any other settings you want.</p>
<p>After this, you can turn the toolbar and menus back off in Explorer if you wish. Windows Explorer looks largely the same, but folders no longer jump around.&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/WindowsServerFeedback/feedback/details/621426/bug-when-expanding-folders-in-explorer-server-2008-r2-and-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Vote
 for Microsoft to fix this bug.</a> </strong></p>
<p>Now, if only MS could code properly so that we don't have to mess with third party apps to get Windows to actually work properly...</p>

    <title>Taskbar up top, top of windows hide under taskbar when opened - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> corazon912  say:</h3>
<h2>            Taskbar up top, top of windows hide under taskbar when opened</h2>
                    I've had this problem with every version of windows that I remember since I have been putting the taskbar up at the top of the screen.&nbsp; Why Windows has never been designed to properly use this setup is beyond me.&nbsp; In fact it is by far more productive way
 to have things with the taskbar up top.<br />
Anyhow I have fixed this "error" every time but I cannot recall how it was done before.<br />
<br />
Typically to fix it temporarily I move the taskbar, move the window in question down and move the taskbar back. This isn't very productive.&nbsp; Most programs should remember their position when closed, but apparently aren't remembering.&nbsp; There should be a way
 to force windows to open on top of the taskbar.&nbsp; I know I could auto-hide the taskbar but I don't wish to do that.<br />
<br />
I am using Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
btw I did a search but did not find anything like this, but perhaps it is worded in a very strange way lol.

            <p>Hi Ishaam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are many reason behind this concern. before we do a more in-depth troubleshooting, can you try the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Press the show your password button.</p>
<p>- Type your password</p>
<p>- Check if the numbers are appearing,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are cases where the numeric pad is not working after the update. this is true to some USB keyboard.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Note: Above article also applies to Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A codec is software that is used to compress or decompress a digital media file, such as a song or video. Windows Media Player and other programs use codecs to play and create digital media files.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A codec can consist of two components: an encoder and a decoder. The encoder performs the compression (encoding) function and the decoder performs the decompression (decoding) function. Some codecs
 include both of these components and some codecs only include one of them. </span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For example, when you rip a song from an audio CD to your computer, the Player uses the Windows Media Audio codec by default to compress the song into a compact WMA file. When you play that WMA file
 (or any WMA file that might be streamed from a website), the Player uses the Windows Media Audio codec to decompress the file so the music can be played through your speakers.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Use your favorite search engine to download and install the codec which is compatible with the Operating system.</span></p>

            This is very vague and not very helpful at all. I am very frustrated with IT's "Support" it always tells you about stuff but never gives a solution. does microsoft not have the ability to make a codec pack? how simple would it be to just make codec packs,
 and when someone is looking for one, have microsoft link you to a Microsoft certified, safe codec pack. that's all, is that so hard? friggen ridiculous the rigamorale you have to go through with you guys to get any kind of real help. this my friends is why
 Apple is winning. sigh....

<h2>            Microsoft Family add child issues&#33; Fed up with Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>I am absolutely fed up with Windows 10. I dont know if it is possible to switch back to 7 but if so someone please tell me how. I cant stand this new OS. W10 is a joke and it it werent for a mistake that my son made when it was set up on my previously W7
 OS when it was offered a free upgrade to 10, I would have NEVER switched in the first place. I debated for months and now totally regret it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Over Christmas break, I tried to set up a separate user account on my laptop for my kids (11 and 6) so that they can have their own area and not interfere with my stuff, but I soon found out that it was not as easy as it used to be. You can't just add an
 account and modify the settings, you have to create a family account online through MS. So I gave in, made an email address for my daughter(who is 11, who can use to email and message her friends- though that is all she is allowed to do, as i feel she is too
 young for any type of social media or cell phone/apps) and tried to add it to "my family" after changing my account settings (took forever to realize that it was my email password or a pin used to open the account instead of my original computer password).
 After getting the email on her account and clicking "Accept Invite" the new window popped up and after taking forever to load, said "Give us a little while to fix this. Something went wrong on our end. For now, you may want to try searching for something else."
 So I waited, and waited. Tried the same link over the course of like 2 weeks and finally got it to work tonight. Once it loaded it wanted me to sign on using her account. I didn't remember setting up a microsoft account for her email, so I couldn't remember
 the password. I clickd on forgot password, and followed the steps to reset the password. as soon as I completed that it took me to a page that said that her account had been temporarily suspended, someone may have used the account to send out a lot of junk
 messages or done something else that violates the Microsoft Services Agreement, and I needed to enter the code that it sent to the phone registered to her account. Only problem is, as i said before, i dont remember setting up a MS account for her, so how would
 i remember the number used. the only phone i would have used is my own and i have yet to receive any text or emails to my phone or email accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I thought maybe if I used a MS email that i already had set up of my own (separate one I have, not the one registered to my computer) I tried that and it gave me the same original error message after clicking the "accept invite" link. (Give us a little
 while to fix this...) So I tried to use that one for an adult one instead. I removed the email addr from family, added it as another adult, and it gave me the same darn error message again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I contacted customer support via live chat, thinking that maybe someone can either unsuspend my daughters account or tell me what I did wrong. It got me nowhere. the agent was absolutely no help whatsoever! they did not even touch on the issue that i
 was trying to solve. i could not understand anything this person was trying to say. it was either a bot on the other end or a person who does not understand simple english! Kept asking me things unrelated to my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I ended the chat session more frustrated than ever, I simply do not understand why i must set up a virtual account for my children so that they can have a separate account on my computer. I seriously wish i could switch back to W7. And now, after waiting
 like 2wks for the link to work, my daughters MS account is suspended until I can enter a code sent to a phone I apparently dont have access to.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS really needs to make the OS's more user friendly, where you should be able to choose whether to set up accounts locally or virtually (meaning whether you choose to set up just an account on the home computer so the kids only have access to that computer,
 or setting up an account for them virtually online with options like the MS family offers.) I should have a choice on if i want to set up an email account for my child(ren), not be forced to set an email up so that they can access my computer because that
 is the only way to set up an account on W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can help me figure out how to get this set up (or can help me get back to my old tried and true W7- some may not agree and frankly i dont care what all W10 has to offer. I hate it! end of story, there is no changing my mind!) Also some idea as
 to how to unsuspend the account in question would be nice too!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for listening to my rant. sorry for the novel&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 microphone playback issue</h2>
                    Okay, so I updated to windows 10 the other day, and my first time on skype wasn't bad, however the whole time I could hear myself talk, thought it was a bug or feed back at first. Then I closed skype and could still hear myself, I then went into the microphone
 settings and checked if voice playback was disabled and it was, I then spent about 30 minutes on google and bing to find a solution, and I couldn't find one that actually stopped it. Do you have any idea on what could be causing it?&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be glad to help you with the issue you have with the computer. I understand the frustration when things don't work the way it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the make and model of your computer?</p>
<p>What is the anti virus program on the computer?</p>
<p>Does the issue happen only with Skype?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the below troubleshooting to fix the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div>Let’s try running the <strong>hardware troubleshooter </strong>and check if that helps. Follow these steps to run the troubleshooter.<br />
<br />
<br />
a) <strong>Press </strong>the ‘<strong>Windows + C’ </strong>to activate the charms menu or move the mouse pointer to
<strong>bottom right corner </strong>of the screen and you will get the <strong>charms menu</strong>.<br />

</strong>If the issue persists let’s visit the manufacturer’s website &amp; download the sound card drivers. Try installing the drivers in compatibility mode to check if that works:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To install the driver in compatibility mode follow the steps below.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong>&nbsp;a) <strong>Right-click </strong>on the driver <strong>executable/installer

    <title>Registered Owner is Windows User - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> im2l844  say:</h3>
<h2>            Registered Owner is Windows User</h2>
                    <p>I built my computer from the ground up and purchased a full version of Windows 8 Pro from Staples Office Supply. After installation everything worked as advertised.&nbsp;Here's the problem:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I like to completely wipe my SSD clean from time to time and do a fresh install of the OS and all my applications. However, when I do that, I always have problems with my activation key not being accepted as valid. Consequently, I have to call MS, &nbsp;jump
 through hoops and generally suffer unnecessary unpleasantness to get my machine back in working order and nobody I've talked with at Microsoft seems to be able to provide me with a way to mitigate this seemingly simple issue. My question is why doesn't the
 registration/verification process integrate a solution for this? It couldn't be all that difficult. BTW, when I perform a WMIC query for "computersystem", I get the correct username I entered for my system, but the "PrimaryOwnerName" is just listed as "Windows
 User". Now, it seems to me that it should be simple enough to correct this and have an online database cross-reference between my activation key and a Primary Owner Name (could require matching several pieces&nbsp;data with a PIN&nbsp;to insure uniqueness) entered during
 the registration/verification process that could easily eliminate my recurring issue.&nbsp;Where is the flaw in my reasoning?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Your name / registered owner / etc is never sent to Microsoft as part of the activation process, ever.&nbsp; Nothing that can ever be used to personally identify you is sent.&nbsp; It's a 100% completely anonymous process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, under normal circumstances, Windows should activate just fine multiple times unless there have been significant hardware changes.&nbsp; But if it doesn't activate, you would have to call them.&nbsp; That's because if there was a way for
<em>you</em> to bypass it, then counterfeiters could do the same thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;To fight that piracy, we all lose a little bit.&nbsp; Unless of course, you're willing to use another OS entirely.&nbsp; Unbuntu has come a long way.</p>

<h2>            How to play a video recording in a Lync Meeting &#63;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attend a weekly meeting via lync from my desktop with several participants from around the Globe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Often times, we have a video file to share.&nbsp; When playing the video from my desktop, I can share my desktop and everyone can see the video.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, not everyone can hear the video.&nbsp; Only I can hear the video.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bottom line, when I am in a Lync meeting and sharing my desktop, how can I play a video so that the meeting participants can both see the video and hear the audio of the video?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks &amp; Cheers!</p>

                    <p>So then I'm trying to upgrade to Windows 10, but it says I need to uninstall WinZip 6.3 - 8.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://i.imgur.com/3kCTFYL.png (Screenshot of Windows Update)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is, I don't even have it installed on my computer. It's not on the Uninstall/Change a Program list. It is not on my program files or program files x86. It does not exist on my registry. I've also made sure I show all hidden files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And as far as I can remember, I've never installed WinZip on my computer. I'm pretty much at a dead end. No Googled solution has been any help to me so far. Help please?</p>

            <p>I have the blue screen which states "What needs your attention".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are 3 instances stating I need to:&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>uninstall WinZip 6.3 - 8.0 because it isn't compatible with W 10.&nbsp; Each has another note to the side saying "Manually uninstall".</p>
<p>Like the first complainant, this program does not appear in my programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I assume it's hidden within my Windows 7 MS package where I can not access it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The screen has only a button stating "Refresh" but it just returns the same info.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see you recommend disabling anti-virus, but WHY?&nbsp; I have Norton 360 running.&nbsp; I don't want to do the reboot you also suggest as it took all night to get to this point.&nbsp; I find it hard to believe we are the only two people&nbsp; running into this problem.</p>

<p>JeffreySoong and KBuckles,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps as it worked for me. As dumb as this is, it appears the installer is merely looking for ANY presence of WinZip and by any presence I do not mean it needed to have ever been installed. In my case, I had backed up a c: drive from a friend's
 computer on my computer and the Program Files had a folder in it from Winzip. The way I found this may be a bit of overkill but it should help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.) I just typed Winzip in my search bar by the Start button (Windows logo).</p>
<p>2.) Even though I had never installed WinZip it found a "Desktop Application."</p>
<p>3.) I clicked that got the WinZip installer so I canceled that and searched again, this time right-clicking to go to the Properties.</p>
<p>4.) The Properties window told me where the file was so I went there and deleted the whole folder.</p>
<p>5.) I clicked "Refresh" on the installer and it moved ahead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully this works out as well for you but if not, just let me know and I'll see if I can offer anything else. Thank you.<br />

            As dumb as this solution is I confirm it solves the problem.&nbsp; I had a old WinZip32.exe file in an archive folder from a project 2001.&nbsp; Deleting it allowed the installer to move forward.

<p>Also solves the 'DVD-RAM Driver Software / BD Driver Software' issue.</p>
<p>If this helps anyone else, if you have any of these installers on other drives - you can take the drives offline (Using Disk Manager) before clicking 'Refresh' - then once the update is finished you simply 'Online' them again. Doesn't help if you have everything
 on one drive though - sorry.</p>

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've just ran into this same issue.</p>
<p>I could not find a complete fix, although this is what I did to resolve:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the invisible folder: C:\$WINDOWS.~BT\Sources\Panther</p>
<p>In here, sort by date, and the file named along the lines of &lt;RandomSymbols&gt;_APPRAISER_HumanReadable.xml with the latest date/time will be a log file created for the upgrade.</p>
<p>Right click, and edit to read. Do a search in here (ctrl+f) for: &lt;Property Name="DT_ANY_FMC_BlockingApplication" Value="TRUE".</p>
<p>If you cannot find that exact string, cycle through the search results for&nbsp;DT_ANY_FMC_BlockingApplication until you find one with the Value of "TRUE". This should be in the property list "Decision Maker".</p>
<p>When you've found the TRUE value, just under this property list should be another section called "Property-List Type Inventory". In here should contain the file blocking your upgrade. In this case it should contain multiple references to WINZIP32.exe. Included
 in this inventory list should be a program path (In my case it was linked to a shared drive location, within which I could not remove winzip).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is located in a place you can remove, then great, track it down and delete it. If not, which occurred for me, I employed a little workaround.</p>
<p>I created a new local administrator user for the client machine, then shut it down, unplugged the network cable, logged in using the local admin, and ran the upgrade.</p>
<p>This cut off the link to the shared drive for obvious reasons, and Windows 10 upgraded fine with no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps, please let me know if any of this doesn't make sense.</p>
        </p>

<p>My Xbox profile is shared on another Xbox not even 100m away from my personal one, however it never gets signed in since its simply there for sharing games with family members.</p>
<p>I have deleted my profile and re-downloaded it before and the first time it only fixed my controller its vibration to function properly again, few attempts later it just keeps signing my profile out at random times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I've got Xbox Live and am using a internet cable to be able to play online, however from time to time it randomly claims I've got no internet connection and few seconds later (10 or so) it reconnects; causing if its a online game the connection to drop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As aforementioned I've got both Xbox Live and my account on another Xbox console and I'm sure nobody else has access to it or is logging into it, else the message would state that someone else logged into my profile from another console.</p>
<p>Does anybody have a fix for it?</p>

            One thing that comes to mind is if there is a second controller being turned on and auto-sign on is turned on with that controller it can cause it to be signed out, has it ever happened while a second controller is being turned on?

<p>No, only one controller is connected to my personal Xbox and that is my own.</p>
<p>I never do split-screen type of gameplay neither so only my own controller has the auto sign-in function to my own Xbox one.</p>

<p>Try and do the following steps. Much like your previous attempt but with an added step.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Delete your profile from your Xbox. (Only delete the profile do not delete profile and items)</p>
<p>Clear your system cache.</p>
<p>Hard Restart your console (hold the power button down until it turns off).</p>
<p>Turn the console on and re-download your profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The extra step you may not have done was clear the system cache, if this is not done it leaves a linger of the profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These steps should solve the issue for you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>As suggested by our Ambassador team&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            This application has requested the Runetime to terminate in an unusual way.</h2>
                    <p>I randomly get this error message "This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way. Please contact the application's support."&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Here's a picture of it.&nbsp;http://i48.tinypic.com/35hradh.jpg &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It doesn't tell me what application or process is responsible. :/</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It pops up randomly when I wait long enough. It will pop up even if I don't have anything open and I just leave my computer to idle. When I close it or click okay, windows explorer gui will crash and restart. I can still use the computer after this without
 restarting but again if I wait long enough it will occur again. I've look around and tried many solutions but nothing has worked.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I've tried a full virus scan, and malware scan with no luck. Tried the registry cleaner from CCleaner and doesn't fix it. I've ran it in safe mode and the error didn't seem to occur or maybe I didn't wait long enough (30-40 minutes). &nbsp;I've tried a SFC scan
 and nothing comes up as wrong. I've done a cleanboot several times with no help. I can't do a system restore since the latest restore point is on the same day that I got the error unfortunately.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>When the error occurs the pop up window is from Microsoft Visual C++. I've tried uninstalling and reinstalling Microsoft Visual C++ for my 2010 versions but with no luck. I've uninstalled the recent programs that I installed and no help either.</p>
<p><br />
</p>

            <p><span>Hi DennisLy,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for choosing Microsoft Community!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>From your issue description I understand that, you are receiving error message "This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way. Please contact the application's support." I appreciate the efforts and time you have invested
 to resolve this issue. Don’t worry; we will certainly help you.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let’s follow these methods and check if it fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: Check the functionality in another user account.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
</span></b></p>
<p><span>If it works in another user account, then the user account may be corrupted.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the method 1 did not help, I suggest you to perform in-place upgrade (repair installation). SFC scan should replace the corrupted DLL files; unfortunately it failed to replace them, which will be replaced by in-place upgrade. Refer to the method
 2.</span></p>

            Hi Babu,
<div><br />
<div>I tried the first method of creating another account. Unfortunately, I still get the error in that account.</div>
<div>I'm gonna try the second method sometime this week once I find time to. One thing I did notice is that in the event log, it says the version of explorer.exe is 6.1.7600.16768 and msvcrt.dll is 7.0.7600.16930... could this be causing some sort of conflict?
 Oh and for the second method what's the difference between selecting upgrade and inplace?</div>

<p><b><span>I understand that, same issue is occurring in different user account. Please perform In-place upgrade.
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>What is an upgrade installation?</span></b></p>
<p><span>An upgrade installation replaces your current version of Windows with Windows 7 and your files, settings, and programs are kept in place on your PC. You can perform an upgrade installation using either the upgrade or full version
 of Windows 7.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>What is a custom (clean) installation?</span></b></p>
<p><span>A custom installation replaces your current version of Windows with Windows 7 but doesn't preserve your files, settings, and programs (it's often referred to as a clean installation for this reason). For installation instructions, see Upgrading from
 Windows Vista to Windows 7 (custom installation). You can perform a custom installation using either the upgrade or full version of Windows 7.</span></p>

            Hi Babu,
<div><br />
<div>Well I just did the Upgrade installation and unfortunately I still get the error... I don't understand how that is even possible. I would assume all the system files were replaced during the upgrade so I would assume the error shouldn't pop up...</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any other ideas? :/</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks.</div>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for the reply.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As the issue is occurs even after repairing all the operating system components, there might be a virus that is causing issues. I suggest you
 to perform clean installation that will fix the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to select
<b>Custom</b> during the installation. </span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Clean Install warning:
</span></b><span>Back up your files before you begin reinstalling Windows, even if you're reinstalling Windows on a hard disk partition. A clean installation replaces the current version of Windows
 and all personal files.</span></p>

            <p>when these WIN issues occur or should i say,seem to be occurring on a regular basis why doesn't windows offer a link in to fix, similar to a HP printer problem?</p>
<p>...AND THE ISSUES ALWAYS SEEM TO BE RELATED TO A .DLL FILE. WHY DOESN'T WINDOWS OFFER A FREE, YES I SAID FREE .DLL REPAIR APP?</p>

            Other than manually changing the video bounds settings on your TV, most games will allow you to change screen bounds as well. On start up of most games for the first time and somewhere in the video/graphics setting of whatever game or app you may be on
 you can change the settings to better fit your TV. The first thing a user should always do is mess with their audio and video settings in order to find out what settings they like. You should take note that not all games and app actually support changing the
 screen bounds for some reason...

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Were there any changes made to your computer before the issue occurred?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Were you able to successfully burn the discs earlier?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What type of compilation are you trying to burn to the disc using Windows Media Player?</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the exact error message or error code that you get when you try to use Windows Media Player?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the troubleshooting steps and check if that helps you in fixing the issue
 on your computer.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Try reducing the burning speed and then try to burn.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p>
<p><strong>To reduce burning speed</strong></p>
<p>It is not usually necessary to adjust the burn speed unless you are having problems burning; in that case reducing the burn speed might correct the problem. This setting applies to all burners
 that you use with your computer.</p>
<p>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Open Windows Media Player.</p>
<p>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click on Tools and then on Options.</p>
<p>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Switch to Burn tab.</p>
<p>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Speed, set it to medium.</p>
<p>e.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click on Apply and then on OK to save changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now try burning the CD and check if you’re able to burn successfully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Your CD or DVD drive can't read or write media</strong></p>

<h2>            Dell Latitude E5520 - after latest Windows 10 major update &#40;Q4 2017&#41;, install of IDT Audio Codec causes laptop to fail to boot</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell Latitude E5520 laptop</p>
<p>Windows 10, 64 bit, Feature update to Windows 10, version 1709</p>
<p>
</p><p>After upgrading from Windows 7 to Windows 10, and after every major Windows 10 update, I have noticed that my internal microphone 'disappears' - it is not disabled, it is simply not there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The solution (which I have had to do twice now), is to install the IDT Audio driver. This link to the Dell community forum has more detail, as this is something that seems to affect quite a few Dell laptops:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.dell.com/community/General/E5420-Windows-10-does-not-detect-microphone-is-there-a-solution/m-p/4684233</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, after the latest major update (1709), the microphone again disappeared, but this time, after installing the IDT driver, the laptop will not boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to boot into safe mode and uninstall the audio driver, then the laptop can boot again normally (though, of course, the internal microphone does not work).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions for where to investigate further?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1709, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Fall Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />
<br />If you can't rollback...
<br />
<br />I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:

<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install

<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and older hardware. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release significantly flawed. Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade loses functionality.

            Hi Hans.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Are there older versions of the driver you can try?  Check in Device Manager on Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let me Pick.  Try each previously installed driver to see if one works.  
<br />
<br />Try uninstalling the present Driver and Software, from Device Manager and Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features.  Then check for Updates to see what driver Windows wants.   It may work better.  
<br />
<br /> Set a System Restore point first so you can roll back. I'd also make the bootable media or Recovery drive so you have another bootable method into the Advanced Startup options:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else works you may need to Go back to old Version at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Recovery, then immediately check for and hide the Version Update using the Hide Updates tool here: <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>

<p>Hi, Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply! Some notes:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot<br />
&gt; Scroll down, select Playing audio<br />
&gt; Click Run the troubleshooter <br />
<br />
I run it, but it only offers to troubleshoot the speakers it finds. One is Speakers - High Definition Audio Device, and the other is Speakers - High Definition Audio Device (Current Default Device). I run it for the 'current default.'<br />
<br />
It then offers to update audio enhancements? I am not quite sure if this is what I need. I went ahead with that and it was unable to detect anything.f<br />
<br />
While I was at it, I also ran the troubleshooter for 'Recording Audio' - as it is the microphone I have having trouble with, but that only seems to offer me to troubleshoot 'Microphone - High Definition Audio Device' (The connector for this device is located
 on the right side of the computer), so it seems to want to try to troubleshoot an external microphone? Since proceeding further it says the device is not plugged in. As noted, it does NOT recognize the laptop's built in internal microphone.<br />
<br />
&gt; When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.<br />
<br />
No change, unfortunately. The internal microphone is still not visible.<br />
<br />
<br />
&gt; Press Windows key + X - Click Device Manager - Expand Sound, video and game controllers<br />
&gt; Right click your audio adapter - Click Properties - Click the Driver tab<br />
&gt;<br />
&gt; Is there an option rollback?<br />
<br />
No such option. Details: 'High Definition Audio Device', driver provider Microsoft, Driver Date 2017.09.28, Driver version 10.0.16299.15<br />
</p>
<p>I will look at the downgrade when I have a bit more time.</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi, Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; Are there older versions of the driver you can try? Check in Device Manager on Driver tab,
<br />
&gt; then Update Driver, then Browse, then Let me Pick. Try each previously installed driver
<br />
&gt; to see if one works. <br />
<br />
So if I select my 'High Definition Audio Device', it then prompts saying 'Installing this device driver is not recommended because Windows cannot verity that it is compatible with your hardware' - should I still go ahead with this?<br />
<br />
But should I see a list of drivers? I only see the one.</p>

            Did you choose Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick?  Is there only the one driver there?  Try it.
<br />
<br />If that fails, uninstall it in Device Manager and Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features.
<br />
<br />Then Check for Updates at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update, expedite all until it pushed a Sound driver.  
<br />
<br />If none, then try the last few drivers for that Sound device on the PC model's Support Downloads webpage.  
<br />
<br />If that fails try the last few drivers on the Sound Device Support Downloads webpage.  To determine the exact make/model sound device, in Device Manager choose the Details tab, drop down menu to Hardware ID, choose the short string ID, right click to Copy and paste back here and into Google to find the exact model device.

<p>Hi, Greg,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt; Did you choose Update Driver, then Browse, then Let Me Pick? Is there only the one driver there? Try it.<br />
<br />
Yes, it installed, but no change, details are still:<br />
<br />
Details: 'High Definition Audio Device', driver provider Microsoft, Driver Date 2017.09.28, Driver version 10.0.16299.15<br />
<br />
&gt; If that fails, uninstall it in Device Manager and Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features. <br />
<br />
ok, I then uninstalled 'High Definition Audio Device'<br />
<br />
&gt; Then Check for Updates at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update, <br />
&gt; expedite all until it pushed a Sound driver. <br />
<br />
check for updates tells me my PC is up to date, it doesn't indicate that I need to install a new driver.<br />
<br />
&gt; If none, then try the last few drivers for that Sound device on the <br />
&gt; PC model's Support Downloads webpage.<br />
<br />
Not sure what you mean, as mentioned before, it was the IDT Audio driver that I installed from the Dell website that caused my PC to fail to boot. I cannot install that one.<br />
<br />
Anyway, after scanning for hardware changes, Windows 10 installed the same High Definition Audio Device as previously. It is still missing the internal microphone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So unfortunately these suggestions have not really changed anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to investigate further why my laptop will not boot after the ITD Audio driver is installed? Perhaps that should be the course we take with this one, identify why that install causes Windows 10 to fail to boot? Where could I look?</p>

<p>If you are still having problems try one of the latest drivers on the Microsoft Update Catalog:</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=tempo%206.10.6504.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be certain that you select version "6.10.6504.0"&nbsp; that was updated on "5/8/2015" with a file size of "13.1MB".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Update will sometimes automatically change the audio driver on my E5520 to one from Microsoft.&nbsp; My computer will then have various audio problems.&nbsp; The latest problem is no audio input.&nbsp; Using the Microsoft supplied driver(s), the microphone disappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed the Tempo/IDT provided driver (as noted above) in order to restore complete audio functionality.&nbsp; The microphones are now available again.&nbsp; Plus, the speaker and microphone auto switches between on-board and headset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you install, it will complain that this is the wrong driver for your hardware.&nbsp; Just acknowledge and proceed.&nbsp; The driver was written for another PC vendor but it is compatible with the Dell E5520.</p>

<p>

<p>Very sorry, I figured it out. It is installed via Device Manager /&nbsp;Sound, video and game controllers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, after reboot it stops working. I need to uninstall the driver, scan for changes (the regular high definition audio driver reappears), then I need to install again. So I guess I need to do this every time I reboot the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>some notes for myself, as I am certain this will continue to happen after every major Windows 10 update</p>
<p>
</p><p>select high definition audio device, update driver<br />
- browser computer<br />
- select 'let me pick'<br />
- select 'have disk'<br />
- browser to folder where archive was extracted<br />
- indeed, it pops up a warning that it is not compatible, but it works anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But thank you very, very much! I had given up on getting this to work, but thanks to your suggestion, it works again (even though I have to install it again after after every reboot, at least I know now how to get it to work). Truly very much appreciated!</p>

<p>Glad it works for you.&nbsp; I don't have any problems with rebooting.&nbsp; This driver works every time I reboot without any need to reinstall.&nbsp; You probably should uninstall and remove all audio drivers and then try reinstalling just the current Tempo/IDT driver
 again.&nbsp; Another possibility might be an auto-update happening when you reboot.&nbsp; This Tempo/IDT driver is several years old so it is possible that your computer is trying to use another more recent driver after the reboot.&nbsp; Also, check to make sure that your
 security (anti-virus) software is not quarantining or blocking parts of the driver when you reboot.&nbsp;</p>
