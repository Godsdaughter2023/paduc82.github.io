    <title>WININET.dll missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> heatherzav  say:</h3>
<h2>            WININET.dll missing</h2>
                    I don't know how it happened but one day all these windows started popping up saying that things couldn't open because WININET.dll was missing. Along with that I noticed that my shockwave plugin went missing too &amp; I can't download any files on chrome (the
 only browser that works). It'll download until the very end then say "download failed-blocked". Internet explorer completely disappeared &amp; firefox opens then immediately closes. I can't open anything on my computer except my files but you know things like
 games &amp; stuff won't open. I can click on them, the wheel will spin, then it'll stop.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can't open my antivirus scanner either.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is this a virus or something? I do know that a long time ago somehow something called funmoods was installed on my computer &amp; made itself my home page for all my internet browsers &amp; I deleted it through control panel but it never went away &amp; for some dumb
 reason I just left it. Could it be affecting my computer this long later?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Oh also my computer tried to install updates but again when it got to the last update it said it failed because of error c0000135. I think that was the error, pretty sure.</div>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/aa3688ca-6ea3-46d4-9fdf-3d2e29cfd2fa" title="Mahmoud Abuhassira">Mahmoud Abuhassira</a><span> ,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for raising this concern to us. For us to further assist you, we would like to know more about this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>1. Is this working before without any issue?</span></p>
<p><span>2. When did this issue occur?</span></p>
<p><span>3. What windows version and OS build number that is currently installed on your Surface?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here are the few things we suggest:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Install and run <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4037239/surface-fix-common-surface-problems-using-surface-diagnostic-toolkit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Surface Diagnostic Toolkit</a></strong>. This toolkit resolves the most common Surface issues. Please follow on-screen instructions posted. Tip! Restart the Surface after this step.</li><li><strong>Check the power mode slider</strong>. For improved performance, the slider should be set to Better or Best performance. Just a heads up,
<span>s<span>etting the Power mode higher than Recommended will impact battery life, so you should connect to a PSU if possible or remember to lower the slider when they no longer need the CPU performance boost when on battery.</span></span></li><li><span><strong>Check Task Manager</strong>. From search bar, type <em>
Task</em> and select <em>Task Manager</em>. Disable unnecessary programs and then
<em>Restart.&nbsp;</em>After the restart, from the <em>Process</em> tab in <em>Task Manager</em>, view any items with abnormally high CPU usage. Click the
<em>CPU column</em> heading to sort by it.</span></li><li><span><strong>Scan for virus, spyware, or other malware</strong>. Use
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17464/windows-10-help-protect-my-device-with-windows-security" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Defender</a> to update definitions and scan</span></li><li><span><strong>Free up space</strong>. Remove unnecessary temporary and system files from the computer. From
<em>Settings</em> &gt; <em>System </em>&gt; <em>Storage </em>and select <em>Free up space now</em>.</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>Looking forward for your response and please keep us posted of the outcome.</span></p>

<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>Thank you for the response. Our next option is <em>Reset</em>. There are three types of Reset.
<strong>(1)</strong> <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4026602/windows-10-give-your-pc-a-fresh-start" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Fresh Start</a></strong>&nbsp;<span>is the least intrusive form of reset.
 You will not lose any files or personal information but will need to reinstall desktop programs.
<strong>(2)</strong> <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023533/surface-restore-or-reset-surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Reset within Windows</a></strong>.
</span><span>This option uses the devices Hard Drive Partition to reimage the device. It
</span><span>can delete personal data (You can choose Keep my files or Remove everything). You will need to reinstall desktop apps and run updates upon completion.
<strong>(3)</strong> <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023512/surface-creating-and-using-a-usb-recovery-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">USB Recovery</a></strong><span>is the most complete form
 of reset</span><strong><em>.&nbsp;</em></strong>Same as reset within windows, this option
<span>reimages the entire device, including the partition on the hard drive. You will need to back up all you personal data, will need to reinstall desktop apps and will need to run updates after completion.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>If the issue occurs after a reset, then the root cause is very likely hardware related.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>

    <title>How to calm down Windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to calm down Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a software developer and I use my laptop everyday for work. I've migrated from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 a year ago. And the more updates I get, the more my laptop uses resources. And it uses them not for my VS, WebStorm or SQL Server, it uses them for
 some telemetry's stuff, antivirus' stuff, biometric's stuff, search's stuff and stuff, stuff, stuff, stuff...</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first I tried to disable a search's service, Cortana's services, antivirus' service, biometric's service, stuff's service, another stuff's service and another stuff's service, and guess what, another stuff's service...</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that I've got a dummy laptop that is unprotected and searches files badly. So I enabled everything back...</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I can't suffer anymore from the worst laptop's experience in my life. I want my performance back! I want to work smoothly like on Windows 8.1. Without listening cooler that became crazy just because Windows wants to check all my files after I switched
 my laptop on. Also I want a Windows 10 laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to calm down Windows 10, so everything will be just like in Windows 8.1, but with features of Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tech specs:</p>
<p>x64 Windows 10 Pro, ENG</p>
<p>Core i5-3317U 1.7GHz</p>
<p>6GB RAM</p>
<p>250GB ROM, SSD Samsung EVO 850</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 is a failure</h2>
                    <p>After three and a half months of struggling with Windows 10, ending with constant total "hangs" and two failed attempts to back up my laptop ending with a hung "grey screen", I have finally seen sense and reverted to Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whoever the Microsoft executive is, who authorised the release of this appalling operating system on world-wide users, should resign immediately.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Vista and Windows 7 never ever gave me this kind of problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will not install Windows 10 for several years now, even if eventually I have to pay for it. The pain, waste of my time, and frustration is just not worth it.

            The preview&nbsp; version worked great this full version is horrible it constantly freezes with just a circling cursor and the only way out is a hard shut down. Free is not good enough Microsoft should be paying use to use this. The last time my PC was this
 unstable I was using Windows 98 I have no choice but to go back to Windows 7

            <p>I had Windows 8.1 and updated (as I cannot say upgraded) to Windows 10.&nbsp; I had frozen screens and I can not begin to tell you how many BSOD blue screens of death error messages after about a week of having it.&nbsp; I finally reformatted my hard drive and reinstalled
 Windows 8.1.&nbsp; I have a problem with my whole system since I installed Windows 10.&nbsp; I put 8.1 back on and it worked like a champ then a day later it started having the same issues that I had just gotten rid of when I got rid of Windows 10.&nbsp; I get various error
 messages that say things like IRQL_LESS_OR_NOT_EQUAL, then there is the other that says IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL.&nbsp; There are those that say MEMORY_MANAGEMENT, and a few other messages.&nbsp; I got to the little file folder on the icon bar, open it and then open the
 control panel and click on find and fix problems and then go and click on fix problems with Windows updates.&nbsp; Then I have to run it in administrator mode and it will " stop bits service" then "stop crypts svr service" then it will "start crypts svr service"
 and eventually "start bits service".&nbsp; A screen will open with check marks that show that it fixed the problems with windows updates.&nbsp; I will go back to work and then about an hour later it gives me a blue screen error of one or another and takes me back to
 login page.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I don't know what problems windows is causing to some many people's computers but I am not the only one who started getting the blue screen errors of death shortly after installing windows 10.&nbsp; It is like it is a virus. Or a Trogan Horse.&nbsp; It seems like
 it carries something in it that destroys peoples computers and they start having BSOD every hour or so.&nbsp; It is better and not as severe since I am back with Windows 8.1 but still not fixed.&nbsp; What have you at Windows done to all of us faithful windows lovers?&nbsp;
 You did the world of computers a terrible injustice when you did away with Windows XP updates as far as I am concerned.&nbsp; I had no problem with it what so ever.&nbsp; I only bought 8.1 because you stopped updating XP.&nbsp; I only tried Windows 10 because I liked 8.1
 also.&nbsp; Not I am not a happy camper at all since I put 10 on my system and it seems to have eaten holes into my computer as well as many other peoples computers that started having the same issues when they put Windows 10 on their systems.&nbsp; Thanks for a virus
 I cannot seem to get rid of.&nbsp; Tempted to toss the whole computer that worked like a champ till Windows 10 bit it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>I had windows XP Pro for years and I hated to change from it but when Microsoft stopped updating and supporting it I finally had to change.&nbsp; I talked to several people about Windows 7 VS 8.1 and I was told by everyone that they thought 8.1 was the better
 operating system of the two.&nbsp; I like it and don't have any problems with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not familiar with Windows 7 so I really can't say anything bad about 7 but I had heard a lot of bad opinions about 7.&nbsp; I am glad that I went with 8.1 and I can only hope that Windows will continue to make updates to it, and also support it.&nbsp; I would
 think that they will support it longer than they will Windows 7 anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't heard any positive feedback on Windows 10 yet so I can only go by what I have heard here and from others that have installed 10 on their computers,&nbsp; I am content with 8.1.&nbsp; I hope that I can keep it for several years or at least until they have
 all of the bugs worked out of 10.&nbsp; I do not like the fact that 10 almost requires you to use their Microsoft edge program.&nbsp; I use Mozilla Firefox and have for years.&nbsp; I don't really like Internet explorer or google or google Chrome.&nbsp; I like my Mozilla Firefox.&nbsp;
 I always seem to be able to get what I want out of it. and have not had any problems with it.&nbsp; I prefer to keep my computer the way I want it to be and not the way that Microsoft wants it to be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess we all just have to pick and choose what works best for us.&nbsp; I don't know if I will be in any hurry to go back to Windows 10.</p>

            <p>Quite a few computer manufactures are not supporting windows 10 on older machines</p>
<p>These older machines could be 2-3 years old and some manufactures are not or have not yet made drivers available</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best thing to do is check with yours to see if it is supported for the upgrade or not first
</p>
<p>M$ upgrade sensor is misleading to say the least in offering upgrades to everyone.</p>
<p>It's more about eating prior versions than anything with the win-10 push through the windows update system.</p>

 From everyone elses report their computers are opening windows media player. I have checked that WMP is set to open WMV files but I still can't open the file. I am using Windows 10.

<h2>            These files can&#8217;t be opened. Your Internet security settings prevented one or more files from being opened.</h2>
                    <div>
<div><span>Hi, I've tried just about all of other tech support forums but they did't seem like they were giving a real live answer to this problem, which I swear there has to be something small that is driving me insane. Whenever I try to open a software or
 exe file, I get the following message:</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>These files can’t be opened. Your Internet security settings prevented one or more files from being opened.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I've tried everything across the board but a problem will always pop up.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>1. Turning off firewall, turning off anti-virus softwares, setting internet security at the lowest, and enabling unsafe application launches.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Does not work.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>2. System Restore and Last known configuration.</span></div>
<div><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Not applicable- it has been going on for months. It wasn't something sudden.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>3. I also checked with windows features by enabling and disable and restart all the times.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>I did below mentioned steps also but still issue existing.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>If that does not work try this please</span></div>
<div><span>1. Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</span></div>
<div><span>User Account Control permission.</span></div>
<div><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>password, Or click Continue.</span></div>
<div><span>2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.</span></div>
<div><span>3. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup items check box.</span></div>
<div><span>4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.</span></div>
<div><span>5. Click OK.</span></div>
<div><span>6. When you are prompted, click Restart.</span></div>
<div><span>7. After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>ALSO check to ensure your anti-virus program is active in the clean boot.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>If that does not work to return to normal boot do this</span></div>
<div><span>Reset the computer to start as usual&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>9. After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:</span></div>
<div><span>Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>10. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue. On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>11. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>So What do you think? It has to do something with administrator rights? If so, how do I elevate it? Because I think all routes to the resolution will be blocked by some kind of privilege messages.</span></div>
<div><span>Please help. Thanks in advance.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Please syggest solution and steps apart from above given.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Also something's weird...when I clicked on change language keyboard input, this popped up as well, which doesnt make sense since it is Windows.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>Sincerely,</span></div>
<div><span>ALOk</span></div>

            <p><span>Hi Alok,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for reaching out to the Microsoft Community!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Based on the description, it appears that you are getting an error message “Your Internet security settings prevented one or more files from being opened” when you try to open a software or exe files on the computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I can understand the inconvenience caused to you. I will certainly help you out with this issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let’s try these methods and update us with the results.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: Run Online Scan.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>A fast way to check for viruses is to use an online scanner, such as the Microsoft Safety Scanner. The scanner is a free online service that helps you identify and remove viruses, clean up your hard disk, and generally improve your computer's performance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>To run the Microsoft Safety Scanner:</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a. Go to the Microsoft Safety Scanner webpage to download the scanner.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>b. Click <strong>Download Now</strong>, and then follow the instructions on the screen.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.<br />
<br />
<b>Important:</b> While performing scan on the hard drive, if any bad sectors are found on the hard drive when scanning tries to repair that sector if any data available on that might be lost.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span> <b>Perform a System File Checker (SFC) scan.</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Perform a System File Checker (SFC) scan on your computer. SFC tool scans system files and replaces incorrect versions of the system files by using the correct versions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Refer the following article for more information on using SFC tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7</span></b></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3: </span></b><b><span>Try to create a new user account and check. If the issue is fixed, then fix a corrupted user profile.</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>New User account: </span></b><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Create-a-user-account</a></span></p>

                    <p><strong>Every time Windows 10 seems to update on my laptop McAfee stops working, I get a problem with Real Time Scanning not activated, the first time I had to uninstall Mcafee then re-install,. Now I have the same issue again,&nbsp;with windows 10 why does this
 happen, never happened in previous version of windows?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot begin to describe how disappointed I am with windows 10, every update seems to cause issues, graphic drivers not updating automatically, Mcafee not working, games now crashing. Windows 10 not actually displaying any notification it is updating,
 it's making my laptop virtually unusable.</p>

            I can only tell you what I have done. I removed McAfee at least until all Windows 10 builds are completed which should be by in &nbsp;Spring. I am using Defender firewall and anti-virus. I added Malwarebytes Anti-exploit Free for a little added browser protection.
 So far so good and resolved any update issues I had before removing McAfee.

            Update= I removed Free Anti-exploit also as it was not to my liking. Edge working well now for the most part. I like that it has no browser extensions yet one can open same page with Internet Explorer (as an Edge feature)&nbsp;which does allow.

            I have McAfee but when I want to uninstall It wont let me....The box opens and there is a Yes or NO&nbsp; the Yes is always gray and ask me to put in a Password but there is no option for me to do so. So I have to click no...then it says was cancelled by USER.
 I never had a problem since window 10 and no one can get it working. I can NOT uninstall or update. I just don't understand why Microsoft can't get that fixed I have always been the only Administrator but now I am not???&nbsp; It has been so frustrating I am surprised
 I can get on my laptop but how much longer? been trying for months now.&nbsp;

            Sure.&nbsp; Just go to the SharePoint page you care about, drag the address bar icon (the left side of the URL address) to your favorites.&nbsp; now you have an instant shortcut to that page.

            <p>Thanks for clarifying. &nbsp;You have several options at this point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, you can't directly put a website shortcut in the File Explorer favorites section. That section can only have shortcuts to file folders and file locations, not webpages. &nbsp;So dragging the icon from the browser won't do it. &nbsp;But you can open SharePoint
 document libraries as if they were regular folders, and then put a shortcut to that in your File Explorer.</p>
<p>

Physxloader.dll Error Messages
<p>There are several different ways that physxloader.dll errors can show up on your computer. Here are some of the more common ways that you might see physxloader.dll errors:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>"Physxloader.dll Not Found"</strong><br />
</li><li><strong>"This application failed to start because physxloader.dll was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem."</strong><br />
</li><li><strong>"Cannot find [PATH]\physxloader.dll"</strong><br />
</li><li><strong>"The file physxloader.dll is missing."</strong><br />
</li><li><strong>"Cannot start [APPLICATION]. A required component is missing: physxloader.dll. Please install [APPLICATION] again."</strong>
</li></ul>
<p>Physxloader.dll error messages might appear while using or installing certain programs, when Windows starts or shuts down, or maybe even during a Windows installation.</p>
<p>The context of the physxloader.dll error is an important piece of information that will be helpful while solving the problem.</p>
Cause of Physxloader.dll Errors
<p>Physxloader.dll errors are caused by situations that lead to the removal or corruption of the physxloader
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/termsd/g/dll_file.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>DLL file</span></a>.</p>
<p>In some cases, physxloader.dll errors could indicate a 
<span>registry</span> problem, a virus or 
<span>malware</span> issue or even a 
<span>hardware</span> failure.</p>
How to Fix Physxloader.dll Errors
<strong>Important:</strong> Do not download physxloader.dll from a "DLL download" website. There are many reasons why
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/findtheproblem/qt/dll-download.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>downloading a DLL file is a bad idea</span></a>. If you need a copy of physxloader.dll, it's best to obtain it from its original, legitimate source.
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <span>Start Windows in Safe Mode</span> to complete any of the following steps if you're unable to access Windows normally due to the physxloader.dll error.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Restore physxloader.dll from the Recycle Bin</span>. The easiest possible cause of a "missing" physxloader.dll
<span>file</span> is that you've mistakenly deleted it.</p>
<p>If you suspect that you've accidentally deleted physxloader.dll but you've already emptied the Recycle Bin, you may be able to
<span>recover physxloader.dll with a free file recovery program</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Recovering a deleted copy of physxloader.dll with a file recovery program is a smart idea only if you're confident you've deleted the file yourself and that it was working properly before you did that.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Run a virus/malware scan of your entire system</span>. Some physxloader.dll errors could be related to a virus or other malware infection on your computer that has
 damaged the DLL file. It's even possible that the physxloader.dll error you're seeing is related to a hostile program that's masquerading as the file.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Use System Restore to undo recent system changes</span>. If you suspect that the physxloader.dll error was caused by a change made to an important file or configuration,
 a System Restore could solve the problem.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Reinstall the program that uses the physxloader.dll file</span>. If the physxloader.dll DLL error occurs when you use a particular program, reinstalling
 the program should replace the file.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Try your best to complete this step. Reinstalling the program that provides the physxloader.dll file, if possible, is a likely solution to this DLL error.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Update the drivers for hardware devices</span> that might be related to physxloader.dll. If, for example, you're receiving a "The file physxloader.dll is missing" error when
 you play a 3D video game, try updating the 
<span>drivers</span> for your 
<span>video card</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The physxloader.dll file may or may not be related to video cards - this was just an example. The key here is to pay very close attention to the context of the error and troubleshoot accordingly.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Roll back a driver to a previously installed version</span> if physxloader.dll errors began after updating a particular hardware device's driver.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Run the sfc /scannow System File Checker command</span> to replace a missing or corrupt copy of the physxloader.dll file. If this DLL file is provided my Microsoft, the
<span>System File Checker</span> tool should restore it.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Install any available Windows updates</span>. Many
<span>service packs</span> and other
<span>patches</span> replace or update some of the hundreds of Microsoft distributed DLL files on your computer. The physxloader.dll file could be included in one of those updates.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Test your memory</span> and then
<span>test your hard drive</span>. I've left the majority of hardware troubleshooting to the last step, but your computer's
<span>memory</span> and
<span>hard drive</span> are easy to test and are the most likely components that might cause physxloader.dll errors as they fail.</p>
<p>If the hardware fails any of your tests, 
<span>replace the memory</span> or 
<span>replace the hard drive</span> as soon as possible.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Repair your installation of Windows</span>. If the individual physxloader.dll file troubleshooting advice above is unsuccessful, performing a startup repair
 or repair installation should restore all Windows DLL files to their working versions.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Use a free registry cleaner</span> to repair physxloader.dll related issues in the registry. A free registry cleaner program may be able to help by removing
 invalid physxloader.dll <span>registry entries</span> that might be causing the DLL error.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> I rarely recommend the use of registry cleaners. I've included the option here as a "last resort" attempt before the destructive step coming up next.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Perform a clean installation of Windows</span>. A clean install of Windows will erase everything from the
<span>hard drive</span> and install a fresh copy of Windows. If none of the steps above correct the physxloader.dll error, this should be your next course of action.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> All the information on your hard drive will be erased during a clean install. Make sure you've made the best attempt possible to fix the physxloader.dll error using a troubleshooting step prior to this one.</p>
</li><li>
<p><span>Troubleshoot for a hardware problem</span> if any physxloader.dll errors persist. After a clean install of Windows, your DLL problem can only be hardware related.</p>
</li></ol>
Applies To
<p>The physxloader.dll error message could apply to any program or system that might utilize the file on any of Microsoft's
<span>operating systems</span> including Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows XP, and Windows 2000.</p>

<h2>            So is piracy still an excuse for keeping games off the PC given GoW&#58; Judgement is already leaked&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Perhaps the biggest excuse for games not reaching the PC publishers use is "it'd just be pirated."<br />
<br />
However with a PC game it quite often isn't available as a pirated version until after the release date and even if it is, the game is often 'locked' in &nbsp;away which means you can't use it.<br />
<br />
Yet the situation is quite different with the consoles. Just today for example Gears of War: Judgement is available for pirates to download and play, a month before release. All too often console games are hitting the torrent sites weeks before the release
 date.<br />
<br />
So can piracy really be used as the excuse any more?&nbsp;</p>

<p>I know that games are always being leaked but as I said in the opening post, piracy is perhaps the most used excuse for games not coming out on the PC.<br />
<br />
Yet it is near impossible to find a pre-release pirated copy of a PC game but it almost always possible with a console game.<br />
<br />
PC gamers missed out of Gears of War 2,3 and now Judgement because of piracy fears. Yet here we are a month before release and console pirates are playing the latest Gears title. In fact all of the series have leaked for the 360 weeks before release.&nbsp;</p>

<p>to pirate a game on pc, you basically just download the .iso file, mount it, then download and replace a file or 2 to crack it.
</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>typing out the exact 360 piracy process will get the post deleted, but it's much more complicated, you have to</p>
<p>first off, 360 disks are now larger than 8.5gb very few dvd burners will let you pirate a game now because it can't put the game on the disk.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>the 360 is very anti piracy, it checks multiple times a playthrough if the disk is a copy or the original.
</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>to pirate on the 360 you need a modded console ( which in and of itself is detectable) it's a pain to do so and you actually need techincal knowhow, unlike PC which you again, just download some files.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>MS will almost always catch modded xbox's and ban your console, which is a loss of over $100 depending on model.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>the piracy excuse is stupid, but it's just that, an excuse, piracy numbers are always bloated, if 5million people pirated skyrim for PC of those people how many only wanted to see if the game ran? downloaded it than never played it? wanted to play it before
 release but till bought it? couldn't get it in their region? wanted the US version of the game? it just doesn't add up.</p>

<p>Pirating an Xbox game runs a very high risk of console ban. &nbsp;Pirating PC games has virtually no risk at all. &nbsp;PC games get pirated to extraordinary levels, it's obvious why it puts off developers and publishers releasing their game on the PC.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure if piracy is the most used excuse though, their are plenty of other reasons why games don't come to PC. &nbsp;Although some of them may change given that the next-gen consoles are supposed to be even closer to PC architecture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>the problem is, though more than console, pc piracy isn't as bad as developers think/claim it to be. it's funny when games are so disproportional, skyrim was the PERFECT game to pirate on PC, it was leaked early, and no multiplayer, but many many games were
 "pirated" more than skyrim number 1 that year was crysis 2. &nbsp;the sales lost to "piracy" are few and far between and pretty much every dev that knows anything understands this, I think they just hide behind the piracy shield to avoid working on a PC version
 of games.</p>

<p>SNIP</p>
<p>[/quote]Pirating PC games carries risks as well. Pirating a game then letting it connect to official servers could see your EA account, for example, being banned. Meaning you lose access to all your official purchased titles. You'd be genuinely surprised
 at how often this happens.<br />
<br />
The level if risk is about the same. Even if you are console banned you can still play over things like xlink Kai.<br />
<br />
As to the piracy levels. Crytek blamed piracy for the original Crysis only selling 3 million copies. Yet the sequel sold a similar amount across all platforms. Games are pirated more on the PC because there are more people with a PC and, especially in the case
 of the original Crysis, people will download the game to see if they can actually run it before spending the money on it.</p>

<p>I guess they don't want our money? I mean look at some games that are multi-platform. PC versions makes around 30% of their sales while consoles have 70% or something like that. I think it was comparing Call of Duty PC sales to consoles in an article I read,
 a while back.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>But yeah, there's ways around getting your Modded Xbox banned, play offline. It's the same as playing online with a cracked version of the game on PC, if you get caught. Which is why most people just play offline anyways.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all honesty, them saying it's because of piracy is rubbish. No matter, what they may think. Those pirates are not customers and for the most part never intended on buying the game. The only people they are denying, are people who actually want to buy
 their products. The same thing goes with intrusive DRM. <br />
<br />
But that game though... It's Microsoft and they stopped caring about PC market a long time ago. They are even pushing people to use Steam now with their games.</p>

<p>Make it where you must be connected to the internet to play a single player game.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10- mouse won&#39;t move after loging in on homescreen</h2>
                    <p>So I finished updating to windows 10, had the issue with the black screen w/ moving curser. After an hour of waiting I said whatever and restarted my laptop. Finally I was able to log in and reach my desktop BUT now the curser is not moving at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried ctrl+alt+det but nothing is working. My start up apps pop up, everything seems to work except for the curser!!! With that said, I can't access anything. Can't use the Internet (chrome) cause I can't click on anything, can't edit or look at any settings
 because I can't click or move the curser! This is all super frustrating so Any help would be great!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Marimo,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for using Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern and would suggest you to check with&nbsp;a different mouse and see if it works.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also suggest you to follow the steps and check the behavior of mouse:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Press &amp; hold the power button down until the laptop or PC clicks off. Leave for 1 minute and start up again using the power button.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the updated status and we'll be glad to help.</p>

            <p>Same here the laptop curser won't work. I had to grab a mouse with cord so I could check how this new windows 10 works. Don't want to be complaining without external mouse I wouldn't be able click for help. I'll try turning off the power button like you
 said. Be nice that it worked. Key word here my computer is a laptop not a desk top that comes with a cored mouse.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also noticed it was slower then before. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Id like to be able erase every thing on my computer to bring back original settings to start over. I have nothing on here that I need to save.</p>

                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a HP laptop currently running Windows 10 AU....I have a partition on my HDD called RECOVERY. I assume this is the OEM recovery partition with windows 7 on it. Should I remove this partition and create a new partition with WINDOWS 10 recovery on it?
</p>
<p>There is also a partition with HP Tools . should I get rid of this too?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Rob</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will wait a little to see how stable WINDOWS 10 AU is on my system before I attempt the change.</p>

            <p>You must leave HP_TOOLS partition intact as it contains files for BIOS recovery in case your BIOS gets corrupted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may delete Recovery partition if you will never return to Windows 7. And for this computer you can re-install Windows 10 as many times as you wish without ever needing Windows 7.</p>

            <div>Hi Elmer,</div>
<div><br />
Thanks for choosing Windows 8 and for providing us an opportunity to assist you.<br />
<div>You have mentioned that you are unable to upload any files to VBulletin forum in Windows 8. This could be due to a browser incompatibility issue or some designing issue with the forum. Don’t worry; we will help you with this issue.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To find what is causing this issue, I would suggest you to try the following steps and check if it resolves the issue.<br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: Compatibility mode</strong></div>
<div><strong><br />
</strong>To check if the issue is caused due to a browser incompatibility, I would suggest you to run Internet explorer in the previous version modes and check. To change Internet explorer to previous version mode, press function key 12 (F12) in Internet explorer.
 In the developer tools bar, click on Browser mode and select Internet explorer 10 compatibility view. If that didn’t help, also try the previous versions like Internet explorer 9.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2: Troubleshooter</strong></div>
<strong>
<div><br />
</strong>
<div>Windows 8 has a built-in troubleshooter that can check for performance related issue in internet explorer. I would suggest you to run this as described below:<br />
<div>a) Press Windows key +X, select Control panel<br />
b) Change the view by option on the top right to Large icons<br />
c) Click on troubleshooting and click on the view all option on the left panel<br />
d) Run the Internet explorer performance troubleshooter <br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3:</strong></div>
<strong>
<div><br />
</strong>
<div>Refer these links and try the steps mentioned by Steve in the second link:<br />

            The issue turned out to be a Mod_sec issue between windows 8 and vBulletin 4.X<br />
<br />
<br />
Here's what was done to correct the issue.<br />
<br />
<p>This is the error log message from the mod_sec file:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>.[Sat Dec 15 11:35:44 2012] [error] [client XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX] ModSecurity:</p>

</span>SecRuleRemoveById $ID&lt;/LocationMatch&gt;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Most of that is Greek to me and I hope it makes sense to the more talented users on here.<br />

If you run the System File Checker utility from the Vista DVD, it will pull the files it needs off the&nbsp;DVD to replace the corrupted ones.&nbsp; If this does not work you will need to do a repair of your Vista installation.<br />
<br />
Here is an article to help you with the repair process.&nbsp; Please let us know if you need further assistance.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting the question on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the description provided, it looks like&nbsp;Windows updates will display the message as reverting changes when it tries to configure updates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, we need some more information about the issue to assist you better:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please answer these questions for me:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Are any Windows updates failed?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;If yes, is the issue specific to a particular update?</p>
<p>3. What is the exact error of the update?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a couple of steps that I believe should assist you with this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Run the fixit from this <strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/windows_update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Important this section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection,
 back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Unable to install updates in Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 and Windows Server 2008 R2</strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Important:</span></b><span> While performing chkdsk on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found, chkdsk tries to repair that sector. Any data available on that might be lost.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still face the issue, try the methods mentioned in <strong>method 3</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Visit this <strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/949358" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> and refer
<strong>"How to avoid this problem"</strong> section.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that fails to resolve the issue try the steps mentioned in the same article
<strong>KB 949358.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> </span><span>System Restore does not affect personal files, such as e-mail, documents, or photos, so it cannot help you restore a deleted file. If you have backups of your files, you can restore the files from a backup.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Note:</strong> It is strongly recommended you back up all of your personal files. For information on how to back up your files, visit:
