<h2>            Receiving Error Code 8007139f...</h2>
                    
<p>I'm trying to watch play Legend of Korra Season 2, Episode 12 through online streaming, and I keep getting error code 8007139f which references DOWNLOADED content. &nbsp;I did the error code search and followed troubleshooting steps online; it did not change.
 &nbsp;I spoke with a tech support rep (Ref. #: &nbsp;<strong>[MOD REMOVED - SR#]</strong>) and went through further troubleshooting.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;Copy,<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear about streaming troubles. Let's see what we can do. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Looking into your account, it does appear your have purchased a season of Legend of Korra.
<strong>Was this season 2 you purchased? </strong>If so, that may be the problem, as it is looking for the previously downloaded version.<br />
<br />
Let us know, and we can work from there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, I purchased Legend of Korra Season 2… purchased the Season pass in September. &nbsp;But the only episode that won't play is Season 2, Episode 12 (titled: &nbsp;Harmonic Convergence). &nbsp;I never downloaded the video files, I only streamed them digitally.</p>

<p>I am Iranian and we are using Jalali calendar which is totally different from Georgian or Hijri calendar.</p>
<p>I was looking in Windows Control Panel today and I saw there are many calendar types but not the Jalali.</p>
<p>Is there any supplementary package available for this matter?If there isn't I'm willing to help, what should I do?</p>

<span>Hi EmadHosseini<span>&nbsp;</span>,</span></p>
<p>
<span>Jalali (Shamsi) Calendar is not available in Windows 7,<span>&nbsp;</span>and Windows 7 uses the built-in calenders and as of now Microsoft does not have any Add-ons for Jalali (Shamsi)
 Calendar.</span></p>
<p>
<span>However, you may download and install Jalali (Shamsi) Calendar from the Internet using your favorite search engine and try to install it.</span></p>

    <title>Disconnected from Xbox Live every single time a game is started. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> applejezus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disconnected from Xbox Live every single time a game is started.</h2>
                    
<p><span><strong>Okay so basically here is what has happened ever since the new system update:</strong> I sign into my Xbox Live account on the dashboard, it works just fine except for little things such as changing my gamer picture.
 So I start up Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, it disconnects me from Xbox Live. So I figure you know, it's just a connection issue, so I test my connection, surprisingly it says my connection is fine. So I sign back in then start up Skyrim again, once again the same
 thing happens. This time I try clearing my cache and resetting my network connection, then I even try restoring it to factory settings.
<strong><em>Nothing</em></strong>&nbsp;works. It was fine before the update and ever since it happened, I can NOT connect to Xbox Live. I am using a standard Xbox 360, not the slim model but I shouldn't have to pay for a new console just because Micro<strong>$</strong>oft
 wants more money so they release an update that won't work on standard consoles.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>ANY HELP WILL BE APPRECIATED!!</span></strong></p>

<p>I've been having the same problem since ysterday evening and I've tried the suggested resolution without success. At first, I received an error message indicating that profiles can't be downloaded now, so I went into Storage Settings and deleted all of the
 profiles and I was then able to Download mine.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, when I tried again to play Battlefield 3 it disconnects me from Live while the game is starting. I have another console in the basement, I'll go down and try that in a little while. I'm very frustrated though at the difficulty I've had getting
 this resolved. What happened to cause this???</p>

<h2>            Any Way To Work Around Two Bugs In Creators Update &#40;Which Were Also In Anniversary Update&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two annoyings bugs were introduced in the Anniversary edition of Windows 10 and are
<strong>still </strong>there in the Creators Update. I have reported both via Windows Feedback but apparently they've both been ignored, so I'm asking for work arounds here before I revert my laptop back to version 1511, build 10586.873.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the <strong>bugs </strong>(not features or design changes!):</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>(1)</strong> Windows Explorer is wrongly left-aligning text on folder/filenames where it should be centre-aligning them in specific folder views (i.e., small icons zoomed in 9x; medium icons; large icons; extra-large icons) except on the desktop
 where it is correctly centre-aligning them.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>(2)</strong> Windows Libraries (Documents; Music; Pictures; Videos) are ignoring any custom folder views you have set up for any of the "optimise this folder for" templates. Instead of sticking to the view you have defined, each folder and subfolder
 defaults to the "Details" view.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The below picture shows issue (1). In this folder view (small icons zoomed in 9x), the folder names should be centre-aligned, but they are wrongly left-aligned.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b31e3dc2-fa80-476d-844b-0624ffa6af17" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b31e3dc2-fa80-476d-844b-0624ffa6af17" /></a><br />
</p>
<p><br />
The below pictures demonstrate issue (2). Despite customising what the "Music" template should be showing (by setting a non-library folder to "Music" template and telling Windows to show all "Music" folders as my custom view), Windows is ignoring this and setting
 the view to details and turning on grouping!<br />
<br />

<p>I can see what you mean regarding the alignment of icon text. No resolution I'm afraid and never tried as it doesn't bother me.</p>
<p>I wonder how you have set Libraries in File Explorer as I only seem to be able to set Quick access in Windows 10 Home and that works as I would expect as my MP3 folder is set Customised for Music (on a NAS drive) and sub folders show the Music setting.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading the post through and for the reply :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had hoped Microsoft had officially acknowledged the alignment bug from the Feedback Hub given that it's been reported since the Anniversary Update. I'm not really sure how to get Microsoft to look into this, as it's such a silly little bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to access Libraries, I can view them from Windows Explorer or click on them directly from my start bar, as I have Classic Explorer installed. On either, I am able to right click, go to Properties and change the template to "Optimise this library
 for" (General items; Documents; Music; Pictures; Videos).</p>
<p>
</p><p>By changing each back to default before changing the settings, it looks like Windows Explorer will then acknowledge the settings I've changed it to. However, Windows Explorer is refusing to acknowledge any custom changes I've made to the templates, which
 was fully possible before the Anniversary/Creators Updates.<br />
<br />
If I could just change the built-in templates, I could at least work around this particular issue whilst I looked for a solution to the wrongly-left-aligning issue.<br />
<br />
Any thoughts on changing the built-in templates (registry; editing files somewhere) or reporting these issues somewhere other than the Feedback Hub?<br />
<br />
Thanks!</p>

            I don't know if this is relevant as I've never tried it, if it isn't ignore it as I just thought I'd have a quick search for folder templates.

<p>
</p><p>Sadly it's not, but thank you for looking.<br />
<br />
The method in the article shows the way that works with versions of Windows 10 prior to the Anniversary and Creators Updates. Since then, Windows 10 basically completely ignores it for Libraries.<br />
<br />
I think there are low-level settings built-in somewhere for the default settings for each of the views. If I can just somehow edit these (which will likely require editing some hidden files or amending the registry), I could work around this bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively Microsoft could fix the bug, but that's just crazy talk lol!</p>

            Nothing more from me I'm afraid. It's not something I've even considered looking at until I saw your post. Does your feedback in the Feedback Hub get upvoted by anyone else. Perhaps you could link to it here and if others have the problem they will upvote.

</p><p>Hmmm. Not sure would would cause that as they're working for me. I'm guessing it's an issue with the Feedback Hub itself, as those are the links it gave me. Sigh. Doesn't surprise me that Feedback Hub has issues though!<br />

You can find them on the Feedback Hub by typing in part of the bold headings though.</p>

    <title>I need an PID &#40;not product key&#41; that is unique to my machine - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> s.o.f.t  say:</h3>
<h2>            I need an PID &#40;not product key&#41; that is unique to my machine only for Windows 8.1 Blue 9600 &#61; &#40;Please read.&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Please change my PID to whatever number is given me and write down the fact it was given to me (not&nbsp;confirmed by another person)&nbsp;so I can use it over and over again without having someone steal it. = thanks. (Yes I am asking for a legal machine and a contract
 agreement but not a plan for high cost.)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Somehow this edition got to my Windows and I just happened to notice that they have no legal activation for it yet. -_- (or stupidity strikes.)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>This Windows version was used to replace my Windows but I did not realize until after I had installed it that it was an 8.1 Blue cause some of us cannot read or it&nbsp;was&nbsp;my eyesight.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hello... To those of the windows 8.1 &amp; 8&nbsp;or those of the Microsoft company... I need to not state that those trying to upgrade to Windows 8 cannot because the hackers took all the keys or an issue within crisis&nbsp;and Microsoft did not put out the new ones
 for the Windows 8.1 Blue and so people are running low with lack of support due to the Windows 8 crisis.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>May I remind the hacker rings that some people like me actually got our machine versions legally and a lot more later than when the actual was put out? That is called random and not good as specific dates are read that the product came out at the same time
 or earlier.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Anyway my question is this... I have a Core edition 8.1 and I did get my Windows 8 legally through an offer a long time ago, the product was&nbsp;unfinished,&nbsp;and lost it and found this to replace my operating system because of a messed up registry with Pro though
 I had lost it and yes sadly one had to get the same copy over and over again and they all could not be activated. My original Pro key was also blocked and I could no longer use it as if people stole the key.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Others like me&nbsp;had downloaded it or had to through retail besides where I found this I will not say due to violations or Company issues (rather rings) but I take no responsibility for the distributors choice besides my own.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I had a Pro but cannot upgrade to WMC from the Pro and the media center well you can just forget me getting a full product in which my mother had to download from the&nbsp;company of retail and the legit sadness of big business in retail. But that is a side story
 needed not to be stated as to say we were not told ahead of time. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The latest version is Windows Blue Edition 8.1 9600. And there is no product&nbsp;key that has not been taken by hacker rings and I think Microsoft should be aware of this. But it is more stable, but&nbsp;if so&nbsp;you rely on a hacker or situation like that... they refuse
 to give out the licensee key&nbsp;which is what is paid for (activation) for the Windows 8 or the 8.1 and lower operating&nbsp;or the other versions for that matter which is activated in manners that are not legal and in violation of Windows.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In fact Microsoft or business people state they had not upgraded to the system of 8 yet which some find it shocking this matter as if security or cyber-security was a joke as stupid people decide we will scam the public with double downloads and surveys
 (unless otherwise allowed)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The key support stopped I guess for those trying to upgrade or came to a halt&nbsp;because they had all been taken by common idiocy and not put out in the market yet until sometime later this year and who is the&nbsp; responsible party&nbsp;they ask us as we the public
 do not know which is a lie that we must take liability for our own products that we own or were not informed of until it was late.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am using an HP Pavilion a6542p PC Desktop&nbsp;(an old machine yet still runs really well);&nbsp;yet the keys are or should be generic to the machine but sadly are not due to screw ups and the stunts pulled by patches of Microsoft and or the false Windows 8 to that
 of losing a system and not due to my cause.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Though this be true the machine information or HP manufacture alone cannot solve really due to the&nbsp;theft of different systems.&nbsp;That is one thing people and developers trying to forge&nbsp;do not think about when they take Windows from the company or a download
 site though I had to get mine as a download both legal. Knowing this... it is easy to identify who got it legally or not so. And if you found it without stealing from a company = congratulations.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Those who put all the keys out like a mad rush had them all blocked and thanks to the admin trying to help people who actually were not updated due to much of what some developers did along with also yourselves a few opposing parties. And I want an ID (not
 a product key)&nbsp;unique to my machine only and that is sadly so.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Product key...&nbsp; I will put here, but if it works for you = congrats cause it is a install but&nbsp;blocked and that was the default install key used here as an install and it will say non-activated due to the fact it is used. (334NH-RXG76-64THK-C7CKG-D3YPT) And
 this is the default and cannot be activated key&nbsp;for what I got though others seem to have taken it or it was spread by the stupidity of those who worked for the companies to a manner and not the main developer or those would know.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I hope Microsoft is not taking advantage of a consumer or more&nbsp;but I want people to know this as well.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As Microsoft crunches down on development issues with a few legal matters of suggestion,&nbsp;I do not want a license or rather do not trust it because of worldwide corporation issues and get into issues with Microsoft. I only wanted my system identification
 number changed which is the PID&nbsp;here.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am asking for an email to an ID or to change it to my system... Not a license key. This is a crunch down on those theft of people with the company and why we cannot activate the Windows without relying on hackers or people who play the part of charging
 people money for a rip off of the machine information, and being not updated on windows really makes people unsure about the trust between consumer and employee relations.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Though this may hurt in the long run due to the manufacturing of forged Windows as to say much with privacy which I could care less because they each decided lets track people and be stupid some people towards who did not deserve the mess, perhaps&nbsp;it will
 be possible then to hopefully fix the mess as the free distribution of&nbsp;minimal and not all&nbsp;killed the markets and so did the lack of real products besides retail and overpriced business matters of greed.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have nothing to hide here. email me for a discussion or question on this as I hope to change my address after this or having to sign up with purchase that should not be charged based on the current situations and lack of information notice and some of
 us try to get a life or rather had one besides taking the keys, but if you are a distributor and a hacker you might be aware of this as some worked in the administration like your tech gurus.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am not the World or NATO playing police here&nbsp;&nbsp;or take no responsibility for joint&nbsp;or merged corporations. I only ask this as a request and a Microsoft User that actually owned his own machine versions. Yeah... people had all of them or I did to a point
 until a power surge or some weird case happens. I wish Microsoft well with understanding here.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Who knew much really, rather society seems not to care but then again I am sure a lot of people need updated on the news lately in real time.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you have 8 or below = congrats you know how to activate it, make your own,&nbsp;and it is no longer legal activation because there is ways to activate besides this and using our own keys. As far as those before me who got 8.1, quit stealing from the company
 or Microsoft has to verify these things as I am not the corporate developer or the one in charge of the efforts and what other people had done. As far as myself... I have nothing to hide&nbsp;because personally, I tested every machine besides the servers which
 I cannot maintain or are not compatible with hardware.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Yes Windows 8.1 is compatible with my hardware and so is each machine...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Now I understand some other matters resulting to this and hopefully people understand why I say what I say besides the fact of well, we can all describe what I had been through.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The copyright act with DMCA&nbsp;had ought to be revised to the consumer rights&nbsp;agreement&nbsp;unless one or more actually acknowledged the credit and trademark permissions of a person's work not taking it as their own unless one problem... They actually owned it
 or had through the rights to the file but they did not give it to the user for what information they submit or what is downloaded to a machine.
</p>
<p>As a software tester there was a development of theories that I had though by the time of much or before me people would have the explanations to know what actually is or is not cyber security recommendations. And that is up to the public to define and not
 business alone but in agreement each side.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I do not respond to&nbsp;rules and false emails with advertisements (spam)&nbsp;that are agreed to (not really) or&nbsp;changed over time because a consumer is never notified before they go through an issue or it is too much to read based on the certain conditions of each
 location or product known with as a TOS if the admin do not follow it as well. And I am sick of the download scams.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Here is the rule I am making here... You may have the&nbsp;same or OEM&nbsp;manufacture but you have not the&nbsp;same machine. (a note to hackers and scams of business for greed.) They fail at cyber-security as I saw it as a joke based on the population or statistics
 I had seen. Though advice help and advice for many this is sadly a double-edge sword but it would give people more access to the rights of use and not hopefully to be monitored as we the public do the following to those who do this....</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>They had traced our information and sold it to others and other admin were not certified or given permission to do so some cases, or posted our information from social sites onto networks from the past being stupid and us not knowing and&nbsp;I question people
 though I am glad we want just your name and nothing about you (lie due to circumstances).... hopefully not to purposely hurt people or their access to anything with valid reasons.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Toward every site... there is hopefully besides a corporation = a valid TOS Bylaw or credit acknowledged for those who put effort into it.</p>

<p>I am entering the Product key right, it just keeps saying wrong key entered. What am I supposed to do with a win 8 disc that wont work 64 bit and 32 bit. My system is 64 bit. All I can do is sell it or give it away.</p>

            <p>Then what use is that response. Microsoft is becoming rubbish. But very smart at stealing peoples money. I paid for a disc it came in a blue cardboard cover, contents one 64bit and one 32 bit windows</p>
<p>8. My computer is 64 bit. Since I did not download it, then obviously I loaded it from disc. I have a good mind to place the whole key here that I was given, when after my computer crashed I had to reload win 8 64 bit. contacted Microsoft shop, they gave
 me a key&nbsp;which does not work.</p>

            <p>I understand. The windows 8 product keys as stated by for... that people get legally no longer work due to the fact of the lack in key management service&nbsp;or the over generation of keys due to such things as explained on&nbsp;Youtube or rather not explained&nbsp;clearly
 from administration and development which such is your separation of groups good and bad of developers and top administration.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Microsoft currently is trying to merge with the phone company surely Nokia I think or some other but well, it is an assumption on reputation or trying to get hold for more ideas on product design.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But you are right as a question to whether what I had heard from the department store in the US... however calling the departments I had and still had&nbsp;to ask legal questions and that is not good knowing the retail scandal that Microsoft never heard of the
 Windows 8 Blue Version 9600 going out though I have it. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The key sadly should be generic to the CD or download if used as a replacement because I had lost my system and found it to be more stable&nbsp;yet anyone of using downloads from school retail or such like that cannot activate the copies they owned or own that
 are legit. Others activated their products with a Windows 8 CD using those keys as the verification for the 8.1 which will not work with those who had activated it before the scandal.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>With the research or the operations of hackers or testers with researchers&nbsp;in terms of legality&nbsp;getting the machine before the actual comes out or as to say the retail department does not put out the editions all as one complete instead&nbsp;of a part edition.
 That is not the point I am trying to make though it is still wrong.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The fact is those of us who got it legally had our computer messed up with registry as well as many people could not reactivate their own product that they already own or our keys will not work. A key works for one computer is what I was told by the technical
 department but they each work for a default install.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Still I did get mine through a school offer by the instructor yet they did not keep us updated on stuff when it came out at the exact same time. Difference is the Windows version 9600 blue I have called Microsoft asking them if they even knew about it and
 they had no clue.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I said to the developer virtual agent Arthur and one technical expert Adrian I think. Anyway... now I am calling a research department? = huh...? And I am a Microsoft Evaluator of products really to the point I try to understand a lot.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The circumstance is those who have legally had a version or so had been well... taken advantage of to a point they cannot activate their machines without the help of hackers or that of the piracy acts of them cheating or doing something higher up who teaches
 the company. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The situation is this copy I had discovered as a replacement, well.... My mother told me it was from Microsoft main company headquarters&nbsp;in&nbsp;California or that is where Microsoft for the US is and though this is an English&nbsp;copy... The copy I have states Microsoft
 from Seattle in Washington.&nbsp; So we know there is a legal problem here as Microsoft or someone who actually owns the company or is in one of the departments leaked it out.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I was told to go to the research department or call it which is Microsoft Leal Tech Research. (MLTR). And the situation here is what in the world is going on. With the situations as we cannot activate our own machine which is why I asked for not only a brand
 (manufacturer name) but also one specifically for the computer type... because then they cannot generate those keys.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Whoever activates the copy regardless with an offline install basically it is not legal without the validation. It is like saying this = the people do not count or there is no trust among company with consumer and agreeing to licenses that bind them to a
 contract under faulty product activation.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In terms of this I am defending Microsoft in one place but though the preview is the only thing online the fact is this... The company will have major issues unless everyone is up to date (if possible) or if it be that because it is a worldwide company there
 are many references and merges to TechNet and MSDN. But I have not contacted the head of Microsoft and that is a no on the scale.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I sort of feel bad because my CD would not work and or my mother had to download from retail like Dreamspark when it was managed by someone from the schools or an instructor of Microsoft which I do not know at the time what in the world happened around the
 last year or two when it first came out.</p>
<p>As you may notice online there is a problem within the time ranges and when the actual models or builds will be out.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Well, the build 9600 is a complete build version. I am hoping that I do not get in trouble after the junk I had been through. Or rather associated to the common issues of fraud. It is good people who get stuck in the middle of this junk as people find ways
 to activate evaluations. Well, I had a feeling that developers and admin had this issue of piracy due to a lack of distrust and people losing what they originally had, which is load when this happens.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>One person buys a license which is the key... installs the product, uses the key which should work for one computer only but also sad that same CD works as an install default even if it does not activate which is a problem.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The coders reverse the system or come up with a way to bypass validation and such is so wrong to me when we have to rely on this because they many people stole all the credit or ripped off a lot of people in the public. The fact the public cannot keep up
 with business or corporation takes advantage of the public is such that a fall barrier.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Us downloaders (legal hopefully not illegal in retrospect) get stuck in the middle of this when we cannot find our products or descriptions of such stuff needing to work in an environmental atmosphere go missing with our individual rights and payment with
 how much work and effort when it also of much is taken for no valid reason or we have to verify who we are and people advertise the information to others.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I trust Microsoft for a reason because I know it could do a lot better than what it is doing and the support sadly really there is no information known by the department I called in my own state. How is it the legal department even has these issues. = flag?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The school would not let the students get the version that they wanted so we had to stick to something as Pro when it was unfinished or they had just added onto it. It is using people as a test which is strictly wrong in a circumstance but is correct if
 so testing bugs out of a product.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I got Core when I found out there was a new addition unmentioned a long time ago as one before this incident or statement even occurred had to be within a year or two range. So I question whether it is legit people are even getting their system back in the
 first place after they lost it or are hackers in administration using this as big business and claiming to be Microsoft Partners?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Too many forgeries or methods to get windows but this helps the consumer to avoid company fraud or to not be bound to license because they had owned their machine for longer than the warranty keeps which is the settlement to fix a machine. But actually some
 of us are lucky to have what we have. Others not so besides those with a valid explanation. It is like saying we expect greater quality with less payment knowing the length of time it takes and the resources be better within reasons mentionable.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The fact is this... Would one develop Windows or would it be used as a valid OS. I had asked for a valid identification and not a key for the reason that such one would say I cannot activate my windows due to the fact of what patch messed up the Windows
 or machine to begin with and all the issues that occur.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Whoever worked in the department of Microsoft there would be many background checks (at least as a security measure in my mind). But then there would be no public domains and or situations would occur among the trust of individuals against big business.
 So, what to do though if people are concerned about privacy and own a machine they can forget it unless they actually owned rights to the machine to begin with and that goes for any version of the Windows. Not for those who had stolen, but for those who waited
 like me and got it legally.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So: All I ask is a change of my system&nbsp;PID, not key,&nbsp;or a verifier so that they cannot forge it. But brand specific would have to do from the manufacture but they expect us to buy the machine new. It does not matter what machine operating system comes with
 the machine. Anyone could have stuck in a disc and forged it or better in my terms to say just download it like some of the multi-million dollar people who get their stuff free for acting and that of game shows.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So, in perspective, the management went down hill big time as people or consumers give the corporate side more advantage to the faults of advertising which people should be aware unless they go along with scam with due exception that it is actually real
 (the object or goal with capability to work for an effort or life).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>So disregarding how advanced one is on a subject matter, people expect to be caught up hopefully in real time. And others perhaps not so due to the background or the consequences involved with peoples' character (including mine in that retrospect).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>And seriously some of hacker families or so have a generation of descendants or kids who are taught this mess. And talk about education and child safety. They could not come up with ethics resolution or certainty of it though it is stated.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am not smarter than many people but I have to sound intelligent just to be heard. -_- And that is sad to a world that understands its own manner and situation but does wrong anyway as I sometimes do (speaking generally).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>As a downloader, I do not still from the company. If something is there that hopefully is liked... I am sure most people have done this, some overcharging and some giving at low cost or practically to none. But&nbsp;people need to have a lot better than what
 they get at fair cost in also relation to those people not being taken advantage of which support the employee.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Because how hackers had changed the world which brought censorship and hidden laws of policy from the people... perhaps it is time to turn around and start actually caring for once who was actually right and that person or many said we all told you so and
 the law or people ignored it. (A&nbsp;scenario but real example.)</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Pro and Con here...</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>CON: Hacker takes your machine, kills it. If it is the operating system, keep a CD, steal from company.</p>
<p>PRO:&nbsp; Hacker helps people for a cause rightly if so that person were a good character of people.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In a discussion separate from this question I will be glad to post some images of 8.1 and the fact I was right. Unless not allowed here. And this is no preview.)
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please let me remind people that I actually had a real Windows and tested it with risk chance. Note: On my machine only and yes before this mess a man was legal and owning of his Windows.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>People do not know the fake pages of Microsoft compared to the real and the others have been kept from seeing it or being up to date. I am lucky to even find the real pages compared also to scattered development pages and forums. -_- = sad.</p>

<p>Sorry about the promotion code. I do not know what is located in the Preview as I do not test those besides the fact the preview might have something to do with this mess. If updating from the Preview will fix&nbsp;my machine it might be good before moving onto
 a new Windows.&nbsp;= ^_^ = SOLUTION.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also... the developer pages can be found... So of course that could have to do with the files and have the keys to the versions in the future of the operating system. That is a thought I did not think of until I actually went straight to the 8.1 9600.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I did not think of that until just now but it is a theory. If it works that is good I think and bad for others. -_- Knowing it is those versions that usually have the product key stored somewhere in the system or a specific file. But that will make it everyone
 activate windows and it is not legal but if one does it that gives ownership right if so the key be valid and proven. POSSIBLE ANSWER.</p>

<h2>            PaperPort 14 installed on 64 bit computer uses WIA for scan.  Before Windows 10, it used Twain.</h2>
                    HP scanner control much superior to Paper Port scanner control.&nbsp; However, after Windows 10 installed, Paper Port uses WIA only and the Paper Port scanner control, where in Windows 8.1 it used Twain and the HP scanner control.&nbsp; An hour on the phone with
 Nuance produced nothing.&nbsp; I can find nothing on HP site that seems to help, nor Google.&nbsp; Interesting is the fact the same software running on a 32 bit machine continues the Twain driver even after Windows 10 upgrade.&nbsp; It must be the architecture of the 64
 bit computer, but I cannot find a workaround.&nbsp; Can someone help me?&nbsp;

<h2>            Why do old deleted Libraries still appear&#63;</h2>
                    I have deleted a library called 'Every Teardrop is a waterfall' (Used for a music project) But when I go into pictures, music or videos it still appears, but with the message - 'This folder is unavailable'. There is also a folder called Webcam, which I
 never recall making. How can I fully remove both these files so they will never appear again. Thanks!

<div>P.S, can someone tell me why/how to remove the Pictures and public pictures folders from my Music Library... I want music, not Pictures. I guess it is something to with album covers.</div>

<h2>            my chat is not working properly how can i fix it so i can chat with my friends right now it seems that there is something wrong when i get a few  on the same chat page</h2>
                    <p>last night at the bottom of the list of who is on chat said Chat Disconnected.&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked a friend to help and she could not do so as her comp was different than mine.&nbsp; I turned my comp on this morning thinking it would be corrected but no still the same
 but i got a message for another person on the chat she just popped up as well as a couple of others on the same small chat.&nbsp;&nbsp; So therefore someting is definately wrong.&nbsp;&nbsp; I want the chat back as it is so nice to have. Did i touch something there in order to
 go bonkers on me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please tell me how toget back on the chat.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also one friend last nite we were chating and her message was not coming through to me.so i typed no message yet so she tried again and again but on the chat list to the left beside her name
 there was no green dot.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for attaching a screenshot in your response and for keeping us posted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you are still facing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you are unable to start the msiserver, I suggest you to first start the service by typing the command below in the command prompt(admin):</p>
<p><strong>net start msiserver</strong></p>
<p>If the service starts successfully, type <strong>net stop msiserver </strong>and press enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once that is done, proceed with the command to rename the software distribution folder and catroot folder.

<h3> fembot xbox  say:</h3>
<h2>            Duke Nukem</h2>
                    
<p>What are people's opinions?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was never a big Duke fan, but I bought it, expecting to like it. I hated the crap out of it, so it went back to EB.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I reckon people who enjoy the other Duke games would at least get some nostalgia value out of it. I just didn't think it was technically up to scratch.</p>

<p>Yeah I had to kind of 'cheat' to get the 1mill for pinball. The trick is, get the 4x multiplyer, then get the ball up to the top left bumper, and hold it up there. Then just flick the bumper, so that the ball knocks the three buttons up there, then catch
 it again. Rinse and repeat until you get your score <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-1.gif" /> Use the tilt to your advantage to keep the ball in that area, and you should be sweet</p>

    <title>Dual boot Windows Vista on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> corysmithzn  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dual boot Windows Vista on Windows 10</h2>
                    Hello I have a bit of a problem here. I have Windows 10 installed on my laptop right now and I have a Windows Vista installation disk. I created a partition on my laptop and ran the setup from my file explorer. Like usual the setup screen appears but when
 I click on the install now button I keep getting the error saying that I don't have enough memory on my hard drive for the temporary files when I have 200 GB free! After that I booted into the BIOS and started from the disk. I got to the part of the installation
 where it asked me for the product key and it gave me another error saying that "With this product key you need to boot the installer in the previous version of Windows." Any ideas on how to fix this?

            Still not having any luck here. I have installed Vista in VMware but for some reason when I right click on computer and then properties it tells me that I have Windows Vista Business when I actually have Home Premium. It gave me the option to do easy install
 when I was starting the installation in VMware and it asked me if I wanted to type in the product key before I started and I said no. During the installation however it did not ask me for a product key and instead just completely installed. Since this was
 technically a clean install how come I'm having problems installing it on a partition? &nbsp;
