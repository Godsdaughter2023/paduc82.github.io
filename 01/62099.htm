    <title>Restart loop after failed update attempt - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Restart loop after failed update attempt</h2>
                    <p>Hi I have a Packard Bell Onetwo M 13871. For the last few months I've been trying to install the latest Windows 10 updates, but each time it hasn't been successful and the machine has restored the previous version. However, the last time this happened the
 PC was unplugged and started going into a loop. I've made a USB recovery but it hasn't made any difference- the BIOS doesn't seem to have an option for booting via USB port. The memory stick is recognised as an optical drive and putting it first in boot up
 priority doesn't make any difference. I could try from a DVD but I have a feeling it might mot work either because I had problems accessing the drive when the computer was ok. Please help!</p>

<p>Thanks for the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'd like to ask when did you create the recovery file? Is it prior you experiencing the issue or after? If it's after, the recovery drive that you're using is not capable to boot the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you did create the recovery drive prior to this issue, you also have the option to choose Reset this PC
<span>and then choose to keep or remove your files aside from System Restore.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If none of these are available, please perform a clean install and this will be the last option that we have. You may refer to this

<h2>            WIndows 7 updates stalls</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying to update Windows 7 Home Premium x64 but after several hours it remains 'Checking for updates...'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled all virus protection software</p>
<p>I have tried turning automatic updates off, rebooting then back on.</p>
<p>I have tried disabling non Microsoft services and startups</p>
<p>I stopped the appropriate services, deleted the cache, re registered the DLLs</p>
<p>I did an inplace update of Windows</p>
<p>I restored the image I took a couple of days ago then asked the already downloaded update to install - that too stalled.</p>
<p>Most recently I have downloaded a fresh copy of the .ISO and burnt it to a USB stick, then replaced the disk drive and did a fresh installation to that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked in the event log and see that "Failed extract of third-party root list from auto update cab at: &lt;http://www.download.windowsupdate.com/msdownload/update/v3/static/trustedr/en/authrootstl.cab&gt; with error: A required certificate is not within its
 validity period when verifying against the current system clock or the timestamp in the signed file."</p>
<p>I see that my system clock is set correctly. &nbsp;I have deleted all the url cache entries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can reach any website I try, and other (admittedly not Windows 7) PCs will update fine through the same router.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The idea bin is now dry and suggestions would be appreciated.</p>

            Hi , I am Dexter, an Independent Advisor, here to help you.
<br />
<br />All you need is a wireless router that allows your printer and computers to connect to the same network.
<br />
<br />If the computers don't have wireless network adapters, then you could add a USB wireless adapter for each of them to connect the router via WIFI or purchase a switcher to connect those computers by cable.
<br />
<br />Normally, the wireless router will bring at least 2-4 LAN port for your computers to connect to, so if you have less than 4 computers, you could choose a wireless router with 4 LAN ports, so you don't need to purchase the switcher.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let me know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi, 
<br />I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />As you want to print using Eprint, refer here about Eprint which requires email id of printer: 
<br /><a href="https://support.hp.com/in-en/document/c03721293" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.hp.com/in-en/document/c03721293</a> 
<br />
<br />To set up a local wifi network to utilize the printer as a network printer,
<br />
<br />1. Connect the print server to a wireless router or access point. 
<br />
<br />2. For sharing a printer, create one via the HomeGroup option on Control Panel, ensure the Printers setting is enabled (for sharing), and join other PCs to the group appropriately. The feature works only among those Windows PCs joined into a homegroup enabled for printer sharing.
<br />
<br />Your multiple devices on the same network can utilize the network printer with wifi.
<br />
<br />For reference:

<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Windows 7 Issues - Windows failed to start. A recent hardware or software change might be the cause.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Windows 7 Issues</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a new external hard drive that I plugged into my computer, and the computer started acting up. I&nbsp;have windows 7. I now receive a windows error recovery. Windows failed to start. A recent hardware or software change might be the cause. I have two options,
 to launch startup repair or to start windows normally. Choosing either one of these options just brings me back to the same screen. It's on a loop. I have tried restarting and&nbsp;tapping F8 to get to the windows boot manager. If I hit enter on the windows 7 option,
 I get sent back to the original windows error recovery loop. The only tool listed is the windows memory diagnostic and choosing that option runs the test and then goes back to the original windows error recovery loop. There is an option for an advanced option
 by pressing F8, but, I have tried clicking F8 and pressed and held F8, and I go nowhere. Is there a trick or any other ideas of how to get my computer running again?

<h3> greggroberts  say:</h3>
<h2>            Migrating to new Skype - saved numbers don&#39;t show up</h2>
                    <p>With help from tech support, after following the insistent prompts about the old Skype version being retired, a couple of months ago I reverted back to Skype version 7.41.0.101 (on Windows 7) because none of my saved phone numbers showed up, even the ones
 that I had renamed. I have a Skype Pro subscription and I use it many times a day to make and receive phone calls to people who don't have Skype.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The prompt keeps bugging me and I assume they are actually going to pull the plug on the old version fairly soon. So I need to get all my numbers -- and preferably all my chat history as well -- backed up somewhere so that I can import it into the new version.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I back up everything before giving in to the coerced "upgrade"? I see how to export Contacts, but it does not export numbers that are not Contacts, even the ones I have renamed. And I see how to add individual phone numbers to Contacts. But there
 must be several hundred phone numbers that are not Contacts. Is there no way to get them all added as Contacts without me having to do them one at a time? There must be some place on my hard drive where they are stored. Please don't tell me they are encrypted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Sub-topic option list below is awfully short and it doesn't match this sub-topic.

            Hello <br /><br />I am a fellow Community member here to help. I am very sorry to hear that you are experiencing this difficulty. I know that it is extremely frustrating to say the least.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the new version of Skype is still under development and as such is lacking many of the features and functions of classic Skype and contains many bugs.<br /><br />While there is not yet an ETA, it is expected in the very near future that Microsoft will begin rapidly releasing updates for the new Skype in order to add features and functionality and correct known bugs.<br /><br />In the meantime, Microsoft has listened to user feedback and has decided to continue supporting classic Skype into the foreseeable future. If you are interested in returning to classic Skype for the time being it can be gotten here<br /><br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a><br /><br /><br />if you should choose to return t

<p>Thank you so much, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/0fb18338-0ae2-4f4b-b7ec-b52f33cb50d1" title="Dadof 5">
Dadof 5</a>! Good answer. </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the thread that you referred me to for "providing feedback to the Skype development team or reporting any bugs," is locked. Evidently I can "join the
<a href="https://www.skype.com/en/insider/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Skype Insider Program</strong></a> so you can help build the next-generation Skype," but that sure sounds like a lot of work. ;-)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My biggest complaint about Classic Skype is that if someone calls me while I am on a call and I take the incoming call, then when the person I was talking to before hangs up, it kills the call that I switched over to.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another bug is that I can search for text in Renamed numbers, but the search sometimes fails even though the search string is to be found in my Renamed numbers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A quibble is that when I search for a number or name and it is found, clicking or double-clicking the Renamed number that was found makes it disappear, instead of making Skype call that number. I always have to remind myself to right-click on the found number,
 and then click "Call," instead of double-clicking, although the latter seems so intuitive. I looked in Tools &gt; Options &gt; Advanced but found no way to change this.

<h2>            Selecting text with mouse not working.</h2>
                    I have noticed that on certain areas like address bars / microsoft office (all) and some other places after typing text I cannot select text via holding the mouse click and dragging. I can double click to select a word or the whole paragraph. The only
 workaround I have found is to go to Start/Metro and then back again. When I do this I can select anything but right after typing again the same issue hits. I have tried searching around and trying some stuff on my own but no good. Any Ideas?

            <p><span>Hi Darchitect,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>As I understand that you unable to select the text with mouse is not working.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the make and the model of the computer?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you receive any error message?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does this occur only with the particular applications?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Are you speaking about resizing the app window or the desktop window?</span></strong></p>
<p>If you are unable to select and highlight text, then there could be some issues with the mouse or driver. I would suggest you to follow the below steps to see if
 it resolves the issue.</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Troubleshooter</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) Press Windows key + X, select control panel<br />
b) Change the ‘view by’ option to smaller or larger icons in the top right corner<br />
c) Select the troubleshooting option<br />
d) Select view all in the left panel and run ‘hardware and devices’ troubleshooter.</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Update drivers</span></strong></p>
<p>a) Press Windows key + X, and select device manager in the popup menu<br />
b) Locate your mouse in the menu and right click, select properties<br />
c) Click on the drivers tab, note down the current driver version and then click on ‘update driver’<br />
d) Once the update is complete restart the system to see if the mouse is working fine.</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3: Windows 7 compatibility mode</span></strong></p>
<p>If you couldn’t find any new drivers that support Windows 8, I would suggest you to check if it works in Windows 7 compatibility mode. Refer the link below:</p>

<div>1. My laptop is Asus K52Je</div>
<div>2. I receive no error message at all</div>
<div>3. This issue is affecting most of the desktop&nbsp;software. Microsoft Office (all products). In Browsers address bar is the same issue, but not on the pages itself.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The issue is only with highlighting text by holding left mouse click. This gets fixed after i double tap the Windows sign on my keyboard, but again goes bad the moment i type text.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have tried all of your methods and no success.</div>
<div><br />
<div>P.S. there are three Base system drivers missing which Windows cannot detect!</div>

            I am having a similar problem with regards to selecting and placing.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I first started to have the problem in Windows 7, and Windows 8 inherited it.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>It can happen in any app, and some associated behaviour I've noticed with 'selecting' is not just with text. For example, if I want to select a number of files in Explorer by using the ctrl or shift keys, some of the files will constantly lose their selected
 state as well. Cursor placement is also problematic, if I want to place the cursor in the middle of a word for example, it may do that, or it might just decide to select the whole word. The most common problem is keeping a line of text highlighted so I can
 delete it, or copy and paste it. Usually I have to keep the text highlighted by holding my mouse button down, and then with my other hand, hit ctrl C and ctrl P, or the delete key.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>After updating and changing drivers where possible, I have tried different hardware items such as keyboard, mouse and plugging them into different USB ports to no avail as well. I have tried a wired mouse, and three brands of wireless mouse, and 3 brands
 of keyboard. The fact that I inherited this problem from Windows 7 does not leave me hopeful of finding a solution, but it's worth chiming in the event others are also experiencing it.</div>

            <p>I found the answer to my problem for Win 8 mouse problem of not being able to highlight.&nbsp; Someone suggested to disable the add-on XML HTTP 3.0 and when I did, it fixed my mouse problem.&nbsp; Here's how I did it:</p>
<p>1. Open IE</p>
<p>2. Click on Tools</p>
<p>3. Click on Manage add-ons</p>
<p>4. When Manage add-ons window comes up, click on Currently loaded add-ons.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;Click on all add-ons.</p>
<p>6. Scroll down and under Microsoft Corporation find XML 3.0 and disable it.</p>
<p>7. I also disabled XML 4.0 at the top of scroll page but I don't know if that's necessary.</p>
<p>8. If you do this be sure and copy all the steps and put in a document for further reference in case you ever need to reverse these steps.&nbsp; So far I haven't had a need for either of these add-ons.</p>

<p>Just go into mouse under Control Panel you'll find it under the buttons tab and uncheck it.</p>

<h2>            Window 10 update can&#39;t log in</h2>
                    I updated to Windows 10 last night. Everything was working great until I did a restart to update my AVG antivirus. Now my computer won't let me log on. I keep getting a message that my password is incorrect. If I go to my husbands's computer I am able
 to log into my Microsoft account using my password fine. I have reset the password twice as instructed and the new password gets me in here but still won't open my laptop.

            Hi,
<br />Try updating to Windows 10 October update version 1809, manually.
<br />The fastest way to get the upgrade is through Media creation tool or ISO file.
<br />
<br />Please download Media Creation Tool from the link below and select Upgrade this PC at the first screen.

            Hi Pete
<br />
<br />I would move to the newer Windows 10 1809 release since that is now available:
<br />
<br />First, try upgrading using the Windows Update Assistant:
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work, upgrade offline using the ISO file, it is more reliable.
<br />
<br />Please be advised some users are reporting issues with the Windows 10 1809 update. Make sure you backup before attempting to upgrade:

<br />Please read the following: Fix Windows 10 Media Creation Tool from Defaulting to Home Instead of Pro
<br />
<br />Downloading the ISO file
<br />
<br />An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 10, a blank Dual Layer DVD or an empty USB thumb drive. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO then burn it using the built in Disc Image utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero. 
<br />
<br />Creating a .ISO file
<br />
<br />For the purposes of this exercise, we are gonna use the .ISO option. 
<br />
<br />Select ISO file, then click Save, Select your location then click Save. 
<br />
<br />Wait while the .ISO image is created. 
<br />
<br />Performing the upgrade:

<h2>            Administrator account on new Windows 8 PC was not set up using a Microsoft account</h2>
                    OK, I now know this was a stupid mistake, but I really need some help correcting it.&nbsp; When my kids opened the new laptop for Christmas, my younger son set it up using his Hotmail account, with himself as administrator.&nbsp; Of course, as the mom, I thought
 I should be the administrator.&nbsp; So added user for myself.&nbsp; However, it was NOT immediately clear that this HAD to be a Microsoft account - "use whatever email you normally use" or some such thing.&nbsp; So...I used my Yahoo account to create the user.&nbsp; It did NOT
 validate that this was&nbsp;a Microsoft account (obviously), and it did not&nbsp;prompt me for a password, or tell me it had to be a local account.&nbsp; Now...I cannot log in as administrator, as my Yahoo email password does not work.&nbsp; I cannot change my son's user back
 to administrator without my [Yahoo] administrator password.&nbsp; I cannot active the 'hidden administrator' account without my non-existent password.&nbsp; I cannot to a PC recovery

<p>[MY QUOTE - FROM PAST EXPERIENCES WITH THIS USELESS PROBLEM]<br />
</p>
<p><br />
Hi to "all" first.. Merry Christmas .. yeah right - fat lot of good that will be - with NO administrator rights.?<br />
<br />
So -- why did EVERYONE with this "problem" get here <br />
WHEN THE COMPUTER WILL NEVER ALLOW THE LAST ACCOUNT TO BE ANYTHING "BUT" AN ADMINISTRATOR ACCOUNT..<br />
IRRESPECTIVE OF HOW MANY "UNSIGNED LOCAL ACCOUNT USERS THERE ARE?<br />
<br />
"Because the PC MUST ALWAYS HAVE AT LEAST ONE ADMINISTRATOR ACCOUNT (that local &amp; guest users can NOT actually access - whether that be by accident OR by desire)..?<br />
<br />
Easy -&nbsp;actually.<br />
<br />
At some "point" after the PC was first fired into LIFE..?<br />
The uodfates from Microsoft INCLUDED A NASTY PIECE OF SOFTWARE.<br />
<br />
There was an update that"installed" a COMPUTER IS ADMINISTRATOR ACCOUNT HOLDER (for itself) ..<br />
This was stupidly "done" by some wacko MS technician as a "silly work-around" - to ensure that IF USERS DELIBERATELY DELETED ALL ADMINISTRATORS..<br />
There would STILL BE ONE LEFT..<br />
The actual PC itself (as it's own administrator..?)<br />
<br />
Now - on the surface that TYPE OF reasoning seems perfectly logical (to a really dumbR'sed MS techie)<br />
<br />
However..<br />
THAT MEANT - that it "then became extremely possible, for an ACCIDENTAL deletion - of the LAST USER ADMINISTRATOR ACCOUNT..<br />
ie: the LAST HUMAN USER.<br />
<br />
Thus:<br />
Now that HUMANS cannot access the PC's administrator section (leaving just the PC logged in as the SOLE administrator, allowing the PC - to allow MS updates to automatically install themselves, whenever they arrive, without "requiring ONE HUMAN, to actively
 log-in, to install those updates..<br />
<br />
FALSELY leaves the pc totally exposed to accidental removal of the ONLY METHOD, of "inputting any password, for "special administrator actions..<br />
<br />
Thus:<br />
As the PC "remains logged in" - AS IT CANNOT SELECT LOG_OUT ITSELF? <br />
(until the PC loses power&nbsp; .. OMG in an electrical power-supply failure for example).?<br />
<br />
Then -- no HUMAN on a local account or another user type acc (family or guest) , will EVER be able to "revert" their accs BACK to an administrator function..<br />
<br />
So .. after say a power failure or any "other" power outage.<br />
AFTER the pc itself has been forced OUT.?<br />
<br />
NOTHING&nbsp;- can then "enter" the PC's hidden password that was "automatically set, by that ignorant stupid techie's update.!!!<br />
<br />
NOTHING..<br />
As lets face it. "WHERE AND HOW, is the PC, going to be able to enter a hidden password by physically typing this .. into a keyboard's entry system? (from INSIDE&nbsp; a .txt file from a "long time ago update" - that is ONLY somewhere inside that long lost update,
 in the windows filing system)&nbsp; <br />
<br />
THE PC ITSELF CAN NEVER EVER THEN RE-ENTER THOSE PASSWORD DETAILS !!!<br />
AS IT DOES NOT HAVE THE CAPACITY TO TYPE ANYTHING ON A KEYBOARD.<br />
<br />
HUH? hello YOU USELESS M/S TECHIES.. as THAT&nbsp;- is not possible.<br />
<br />
So - the PC cannot re-log-in (itself), and as all humans have been "removed" as administrators 9accidentally or deliberately by removing their user accounts)<br />
<br />
NOW NO HUMAN can ever now do that option either - as no "human" (still) holds administrator privileges.!!!..<br />
<br />
THAT ONE UPDATE MADE FOR THE MOST STUPID MISTAKE Utterly useless.. all because of ONE stupid MS dumb techie nit-twit's assumption .. that "his silly method" will allow the pc to recover itself, should THE HUMANS accidentally delete the "last" administrator
 acc.<br />
<br />
SOMETHING THAT WAS NEVER POSSIBLE TO DO (delete the last administrator),&nbsp;when the original creators of Windows, ensured that the&nbsp;PC "itself" NEVER had any ability to be self-holding ... it's "own" (senior)&nbsp;administrator functions.!!!<br />
<br />
!!!!!!!<br />
Meaning..?<br />
SORRY FOLKS.<br />
YOUR PC IS NOW BRICKED.<br />
<br />
Toss it away.</p>

<h2>            Font size changes unexpectedly</h2>
                    A few days ago on my HP Laptop, (Win-10) I started seeing the tiny text in my desktop toolbars. The toolbars are links and desktop. I have been using 10 for several months and the tiny font issue just started. It isn't always too small. It switches between
 that and it's normal readable size. The same thing is happening in web pages. Sometimes the address bar is tiny and the context menu is almost too small to read. I checked all the relevant settings and changed them to see if it made any difference. it did
 not. This issue is a problem, maybe a virus or adware. It is not a settings issue. My display, dpi, and other settings are the same as before the problem started.&nbsp; I ran Malwarebytes last night and it found 250 objects from Frontier Arcade. I removed them
 and when I restarted the fonts were normal size. Today they are switching back and forth, again. I ran Malwarebytes again, but this time it found nothing. If the only answer you can give is a simplistic one, don't bother. Those

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Try to run a System File Checker (SFC) scan to check for any file corruption. <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

<li><span>Press <strong><em>Windows key + X</em></strong>, click <strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In the Command Prompt, type the following command, and then press ENTER:
<br />
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong></span></li></ol>
<span>
<p>If the issue still exists, try the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>You may check the same issue with the new user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try these steps to create a new user account and check if it fixes the issue. Refer to the steps below to create a new User Account:</span>

    <title>Windows 7&#58; Online chat - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 7&#58;  Online chat</h2>
                    <p>Recently I've noticed that a few online merchants use online chat to help you directly with any queries you may have, with the popup called, something like, "Need some help?", usually located in the taskbar area. I quite like this new innovation. However,
 it concerns me a bit security-wise, especially when it is also used within my WordPress website whenever I'm there doing admin. tasks. This has happened using both IE and Firefox, the two browsers I use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, I do not have any messenger-type software installed on my PC.</p>
<p>Secondly, in Services, I have disabled Remote Desktop.</p>
<p>Thirdly, in Services, I can't identify anything therein that might help these merchants/WordPress to connect with me via the browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What has been others' recent experiences using this chat service?</p>
<p>Any problems on your PC thereafter?</p>
<p>Should I be concerned? Or should I just enjoy this new technology that is making our lives easier?</p>
<p>
</p><p>With WordPress, I've also noticed since using the chat that I am unable to go through the Two-step Verification process to completion to make my site more secure. The SMSes just aren't reaching me (I don't have any of the other verification apps. listed).
 When I asked about this, via the chat, after I pressed Enter, the popup just disappeared and never replied!!</p>

    <title>How to enable Start screen in Windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to enable Start screen in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Getting to apps/ programs</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I installed Windows 10, I can't get to the Start Screen to open Word, Excel, etc. that I had added when I had Windows 8.1.&nbsp; The only way I can get to those and other apps is through File Explorer and open a file that I had used before and then choose
 "New."</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I right-click on the Windows icon in the lower left of the screen, all I see are links to the system or to logout.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone said I was in Tablet mode, which might be the reason, but I have a desktop computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've read lots of Q &amp; A on settings and how to enable the Start Screen, but none of them work for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the solution?&nbsp; Thanks.</p>

            <p>Dear Likitha V,</p>
<p>Thank you for&nbsp; your reply. </p>
<p>I can get to the desktop, which shows an image I posted and some links that I added, such as Adobe Reader, IFANview, Skype, Google Chrome, etc.&nbsp; But several other programs (or applications), such as Word, Excel, and Goodsearch, I have to open File Explorer,
 as I said.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe I am NOT in Tablet mode, as I can get to File Explorer (although I do not know anything about Tablet mode).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not see an Action Center icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot swipe from the right side to get to settings, and I cannot get to them when I place the cursor in the top right-side of the screen.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I remember seeing a screen for Tablet mode, but cannot find it now.&nbsp; I did select OFF for the features, but with no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to create another account, as I think it will be more confusing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll just have to go through File Explorer to get to the programs I want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mr-Cee</p>

            <p>Wonder of wonders!&nbsp; All of a sudden, the other day, I could left-click on the Windows icon and see the programs I had posted when I upgraded to W. 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This happened despite many attempts over several days, as I had just upgraded in December.&nbsp;
