                    <p>Hi there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My touch mouse on the Surface book keeps playing up. I will be typing an email and it will click all over the screen. Sometimes I don't even have my hands on the key board it clicks as if I have done a right side mouse click where it brings up options like
 undo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I resolve this?&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>What does that look like exactly?&nbsp; Usually this describes spurious Touch events--so round visual feedback events instead of mouse pointer events.&nbsp; In that case you could try disabling Multi-touch and hopefully still have Pen support for its tapping and writing
 functionality.</p>

<h2>            windows 10 Install - media creation tool crashing straight after i click &#34;upgrade&#34; &#40;Surface Pro 2 windows 8.1&#41;</h2>
                    installing crashes after hitting "upgrade my PC" sometimes displaying "something happened" or just crashing with no message.. failing to install have not tried via boot and USB yet..... the first time i tried it did get to the "activate this product with
 an activation key"... but its an OEM Surface pro 2 and the product key in system information cant be entered (as it wouldnt let me enter certain digits... "0" or "letters") so after rebooting it would not go at all...<br />
have attempted deletion of old files to restart the process of installation but that has not been successful... maybe i missed some files?<br />
have succesfully installed on another laptop...&nbsp;

<h2>            I have uninstalled &#39;MICROSTAFF WINASPI&#39; in error and can no longer burn to DVD.</h2>
                    
<p>'MICROSTAFF WINASPI' was listed in my 'Programs' list and I incorrectly thought that it was of no importance and uninstalled it. Now I am unable to burn to DVD. Surprisingly there seems to be very little information anywhere on the internet regarding 'M.W.'
 and I hope someone can tell me where I can get this piece of software from&nbsp;so I can&nbsp;reinstall it.<br />
<br />
This is for my ACER ASPIRE Laptop, running Vista Home Premium 32-bit. An OPTIARC DVD RW AD - 7560A ATA drive is the hardware. Previous to the uninstallation I would always simply drag and drop within windows and click burn when ready and all would be written
 to the DVD with no problems.<br />
<br />
I feel a bit of an idiot for making this mistake and would really appreciate anyone who can point me in the right direction for a solution.</p>

<p><span><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Answers.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I have few steps which might help you.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>It seems to be that the software is obsolete now so there is no download link available
 for </span></span><span>'MICROSTAFF WINASPI’.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to burn CD or DVD by using Windows Media player or CD/DVD burning software wizard.</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>It might take several minutes for the disc to be formatted in the default Live File System format. When the formatting is complete, an empty disc folder opens.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open the folder that contains the files you want to burn, and then drag the files into the empty disc folder.</span>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span><span>T<span>o burn a disc usi<span>ng the

<p>
<span><span>3. In the

<p>
<span><span>4. Click

<br />
</span></span><span><span>5. An empty disc folder opens.</span></span></p>

            Thank you for your help and assistance.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
When attempting the steps described in Method 1 above, I get an error message in a 'Format Disc' dialogue box - Windows was unable to complete the format. When using 'Mastered' file system to burn, at the end of the burn process the large dialogue box has a
 green progress bar which gets to the end and the box says 'Finished', however the box then enters a state of 'Not Responding', which hangs until I eject the DVD which incidentally still remains blank.<br />
<br />
Using Windows Media Player to burn appears to be successful, although when the disc is re-inserted after a 'successful' burn session, it is not immediately recognised and takes a few eject / re-insertions before the system acknowledges the presence of the disk,
 which is still blank and the file system prompt for Live or Mastered appears again when the disc is selected in Windows Explorer.<br />
<br />
Although vastly outdated, my qualifications in computing 12 years ago have always stood me in good stead to solve any issues I've had but this time I am stumped. I'm computer literate and have tried everything you suggested and more, and my conclusion is that
 I am missing vital ASPI files that were part of the Microstaff Winaspi package that was pre-installed. I have attempted insertion of alternative ASPI files procured from the internet and inserted them in to the relevant directories i.e. Windows/System and
 / or Windows/System32, namely - WNASPI32.DLL, WINASPI.DLL, ASPI32.SYS, WOWPOST.EXE, but the problem remains. I believe this may be as the files I have attempted to 'patch things up' with may be quite old therefore possibly useless, although the running of
 an Adaptec verification utility indicates "ASPI is properly installed and is fully operational"<br />
<br />
I know you said that Microstaff Winaspi is now obsolete, and that is disappointing as I bought the system new a little over 18months ago, but is there no way at all that I can get it replaced? Or do you have any other suggestions or advice? Complexity is not
 an issue for me so feel free to be direct with any instructional advice you may have.<br />
<br />
All help with this is very very much appreciated - thank you so much for your time.

            Microsoft ! you need to properly address the ASPI Issue as you have not done so and you remain leaving Alex__B hanging without a proper answer. I have 40 years computer experience starting with the beginning of the digital era. YOU HAVE NOT ANSWERED THIS
 PERSONS QUESTION ! The Winaspi issue remains too much of a mystery and the internet resources have only outdated solutions available. Get with your own program Microsoft ! No .... suggesting a person "do it a different way" is NOT an answer or an acceptable
 remedy. Address the code issue and offer a real solution ! I even see Windows XP sp3 with this issue as well.<br />
<br />
I am so sick of Windows "problems" I am about ready to go exclusive MacIntosh or install Red Hat on my PC.
<br />
What do you people do with all that money you charge for the OS ?<br />
<br />
<br />
I just spent my entire evening helping someone with Optical Drive problems related to this issue with only a partial success.<br />

<p>Personally, I use the software IMGBurn. It is very fast, even on older systems. I very very quickly tire of using windows to drag and drop files, and go through an endless wizard to get a written disc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alex, WINAspi is a software layer that is an interface between windows, and your writer. &nbsp;Windows uses an identical interface called SPTI. It functions identically. That is why the tech suggest you start using the windows live software, which should default
 to using SPTI. Acer probably installed the WINASPI software in order for NERO, or some other proprietary burning package to work. It could have been installed by any program that has burning abilities. I suggest downloading, and installing IMGburn in order
 to burn data onto CDs and DVDs. It is not reliant on WINASPI or any other software. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows could be confused at the moment. After you uninstalled WINASPI, it did not default back to another working way of addressing the burner through explorer. In my experience, at this point, I would just start looking for a way around the non-working
 program.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Rahul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that there is no display on secondary monitor after changing the resolution to 1024 x 768 60 Hz and I will be happy to assist you fix the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This seems to be a display driver incompatibility. We can try the following steps. Do not unplug the monitor.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 1: </span></strong>Uninstall the driver and check for hardware changes</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click start, type <strong>devmgmt.msc
</strong>in the start search box and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Expand <strong>“Monitors”</strong>. You will see two monitors displayed.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right click the second monitor driver and select
<strong>“Uninstall”</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click on the “<strong>scan for hardware changes</strong>” icon at the top on the window.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If it still shows as generic PnP, uninstall the driver and&nbsp;try step 2.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2: </span></strong><span>V</span><span>isit the computer manufacturer's support website and install the latest graphics and&nbsp; chipset drivers.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Step 3:&nbsp;</strong></span>Next try this:<br />
<br />
a. Turn off the computer and monitor<br />
b. <strong>UNPLUG</strong> the power for few minutes so that all the capacitors drain in the circuitry of the monitor. You may want to unplug the video cable as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>c. After few minutes, re-plug cable and power cord, turn on monitor and reboot computer.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 4:</strong> You can also try obtaining the drivers through Windows Update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click <strong>Start</strong> &gt; <strong>All Programs</strong> &gt; <strong>Windows Update</strong> &gt;<strong>Turn on Windows Update</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>A list of available updates will then be downloaded, you will have the option to view them, do so and check off the appropriate drivers or software patches you need and click Install.</p>

<h3> jupp broadshield  say:</h3>
<h2>            LOW DPI UNDER 100&#37; SCALING NEEDED in WIN 10</h2>
                    <p>My laptop with win 7 was set with a custom DPI of 76 and all windows were scaled down.</p>
<p>I did not care reading was difficult, my problem was and IS now AGAIN that my little laptop with
</p>
<p>poor resolution (budget laptop) can't scroll and close many windows opened by apps and installers.</p>
<p>1360x768 is not enough. 1200x600 is a nightmare.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please, It's been two years with win 10, but I want to downgrade!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>Just to be able to scale AGAIN my laptop under 100%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please either unlock the SEGOE UI or make a reversed lens that we can apply to our desktops!!!</p>
<p>Give us a way to put the windows desktop bar away, pop up with win key, DO SOMETHING!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hate that a 20th of my already little screen is occupied by the start button ALWAYS.</p>
<p>GIVE US AN OPTION FOR A CLEANER UI!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Buy Apple unix virtual desktop codex, speak to Bill and help us get at least two inches of screen back!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, I forgot to say my model is a Lenovo e130 with Intel 4500HD. But that should not make any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for understanding and taking the time to read. Help me get more attention to this cause. Make it yours as a call for NECESSARY improvement (actually it's a retrospective improvement).</p>

<h2>            error 0xC004C003 after upgrading and then clean install</h2>
                    <p>I had a legit windows 7 ultimate. I did an upgrade and it said my windows 10 was activated. Then I did a clean install of windows 10 from the same usb thumb drive files and I am getting error code&nbsp;0xC004C003. I can't get activated. Nothing about my system
 changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried signing into my microsoft account. I tried restarting many times. I tried "slmgr .vbs /ato" in elevated cmd.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>what am I missing? I am NOT reinstalling windows 7, and then going through the upgrade, and then going through another clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dear Microsoft,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why would you advertise free windows 10 upgrade and then release an application (mediacreationtool) where you have two options (upgrade or clean install) but then you HAD to do one first in order for it to work. As if the entirety of your end user population
 would intuitively understand you had to upgrade first in order to link your windows 10 to your hardware and NOT to go straight for a clean install because that just doesn't make sense. And now it is up to all your end users who went about it wrong to sort
 it out for themselves otherwise they're stuck with an illegitimate installation of windows 10. So then the "free upgrade" turns into "you messed up the free upgrade because you chose the wrong install option so too bad you're going to have to just buy a new
 product key for $100."</p>
<p>
</p><p>How is that okay? How is that a responsible business model? I am happy with windows 10. I am happy for the free upgrade. now just please #*!^%ing activate me.&nbsp;</p>

            I had the same issue several days ago and was told to wait 24 hours.&nbsp; Still wasn't working after 24 hours so I called back and was told to wait 24 to 48 hours.&nbsp; It's been several days since then and still not activated.&nbsp; Should I continue waiting, and
 if so, for how long?&nbsp;

            I just chatted with a MS Answer Tech and she recommended that I reinstall Win 7 and go through the upgrade process rather than the clean install via USB.&nbsp; I had originally tried the upgrade but it failed 3 times after going through the entire installation
 process, and it reverted back to Win 7 each time.&nbsp; That's why I did the USB boot install -- I found online some people had suggested that.&nbsp; It would have been nice if the instructions were clearer - i.e. "You cannot use&nbsp;the "custom installation" option&nbsp;to
 perform the free upgrade."&nbsp; Maybe it was in there somewhere, but it must not have jumped out at me.

    <title>Windows 10 won&#39;t install - could not configure windows to run on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bigbill  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 won&#39;t install - could not configure windows to run on hardware</h2>
                    <p>I have a computer with an existing install of Windows 7. I wanted to install Windows 10 to a new hard drive that I bought, but didn't want to upgrade my Windows 7 - in other words I wanted a dual boot system with Windows 7 and Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I looked it up and found it shouldn't be a problem. Simply install a new installation of Windows 10 on the new hard drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I first wanted to check my computer could run Windows 10, so I ran the upgrade tool with the intention of just doing the compatibility check and then cancelling after that. The computer was found to be compatible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I went to the Windows 10 ISO page, downloaded the media creation tool and then made a bootable USB with Windows 10 on it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rebooted the computer, install program loaded. Everything was installing just fine, as seen in the image below:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1199f68d-8683-415d-9cfb-b28f76b57769" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1199f68d-8683-415d-9cfb-b28f76b57769" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer needed a restart after the installation. So the computer restarted, loaded for a little while and then I got a popup message saying "Windows setup could not configure Windows to run on this computer's hardware". For proof (which will make sense
 later) I will show you the screenshot:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/490e94a2-2df3-4004-8e21-f099aff3f800" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/490e94a2-2df3-4004-8e21-f099aff3f800" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>All I could do was press the "OK" button. After this the computer restarts and comes up with a message that says the installation was not successful and needs to be installed again. This just kept happening over and over at that point, rendering my computer
 useless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I tried a little trick. I pressed Shift+F10, which loaded the command window. I then went to c:\windows\system32\oobe and ran msoobe.exe. This was good, it appeared the installation would continue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ah, but alas weary traveler, my journey was not yet over. At the next screen it asked me whether I wanted to use custom settings or express settings (I just hit next) and then it came to a screen saying "Just a moment..." with the circling circles waity
 thing. </p>
<p>
</p><p>And that's where the installation stops. It just hangs there. I left it on for 12 hours and nothing has happened. Initially there is a bit of hard drive activity (for around 3 minutes) but then that just stops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have talked to 7 (yes, s-e-v-e-n) Microsoft support techs about this problem. That was about as useless as talking to a dead fish. I even got elevated to a tier 2 support worker twice. The first one told me about msoobe.exe, which I thought would fix the
 problem. But the next guy probably got his job because he played an Xbox once. He told me I couldn't do a dual boot install on Windows 10! When I told him that's a lie and there are plenty of videos and how-to-guides on the internet how to do it he said his
 supervisor told him it couldn't be done. When I told him his supervisor didn't know what he was talking about he said that couldn't be, because his supervisor had been installing Windows 10 successfully for (and I swear to the powers that be this is the truth)
 8 years!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I wanted to waste 12 hours of my life I would have watched a season of Call the Midwife.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here I am at my absolute last resort. Contacting Microsoft help directly is useless. I'm hoping this will be better, because otherwise I have blown $160 and also the time I would normally have used providing an income for myself.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>no sound when starting windows 10 version 1809 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bryantharris  say:</h3>
<h2>            no sound when starting windows 10 version 1809</h2>
                    <p>Sometimes when I start my system, I will have no sound.&nbsp; I then restart my system and the sound then works.&nbsp; Here are my sound drivers:</p>

<p>I searched Windows update, and the web, as well as the sound device mfg sites, and as far as I can tell these are the latest drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all the remedies from the Microsoft site to fix the issue, uninstalling and reinstalling the drivers, searching for updated drivers, stoping the sound services and restarting them to no avail.</p>

<br />If AMD High Definition Audio Device and Realtek High Definition Audio working fine, try uninstalling generic audio driver in Device Manager and see if this resolves the issue.

<p>Kapil,</p>
<p>Started my system this morning, no sound.</p>
<p>Ran the audio troubleshooter, test sound, no sound heard.</p>
<p>Checked Device manager, the two drivers I uninstalled are not listed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At the end of the audio troubleshooter, it said to restart my computer.</p>
<p>After restarting my system, I again had audio.</p>

            I have already tried that also I have ran network adapter troubleshooter and nothing is wrong. For me it seems that the latest driver for RTL8723BE 802.11 b/g/n is the only one causing it the one in 2014 work fine. This issue also happened before I did
 a factory reset I did it again few weeks back and this issue still happens. Also the latest driver comes from windows update and from my manufacturer is a different &nbsp;one ( I am using the manufacturer one 2014 since the latest one is causing the BSOD's) But
 is there any way I can fix the latest one?

            Uninstall the network driver driver then download from manufacturer go to windows update and stop that driver from installing it is known to cause issues (hide the update) even after doing this the BSOD does not occur but my network card still has issues
 intermedittly, it stops working have to do network diagnostics or reset it to fix it. Tried factory reset. But it is probably hardware issue, MAN NOT BOTHERED TO TAKE IT TO REATILER !<br />

            <p>No this was not the correct solution. This is a wrong advice. The opposite was useful.</p>
<p>Finally I solved the problem by&nbsp; uninstalling the newest driver available, and reverting back to the realtek 2023.15.701.2015, july 2015. It was a bit painstaking to check all the options, but eventually I found that this driver worked and then no BSOD has
 occurred in a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>So it seems that for any hardware &amp; system configuration one has to look &amp; check for the right drivers, as in the good old days. Nice.</p>

    <title>targeted read test and smart short shelf test fail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> billthebus  say:</h3>
<h2>            targeted read test and smart short shelf test fail</h2>
                    <p>Had problems with my Lenovo ideapad 305 over the weekend that stopped my opening. All i could get was a blank screen with the whirling dots and after about a minute they stopped and left me with a black screen that i could move the curser on but would not
 open. I tried all the usual reset, repair etc but nothing would help me continue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After talking to John Lewis we eventually found the Onekey reset and carried out the required reatart. Everything worked fine until i updated windows(10) and then had the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I applied the Onekey reset again and carried out the hardware check and it shows up with the&nbsp;targeted read test and smart short shelf test fail before i updated or installed anything and gave me a code but i cannot find where to send it. Also now when i
 open it says repaired drive D 100% every time i open up?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now going to apply the updates again but hoping someone can help with the fails or where to send the fail code or even why the laptop failed over the weekend.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in anticipation</p>

<p>Hi,<br />

If needed :</p>
<p><strong>References to Vista apply to Windows 7.<br />
</strong><br />
What antivirus/antispyware/security products do you have on your machine? Include all you ever<br />
had including those you uninstalled. (These can leave remnants which can cause strange issues.)<br />
<br />
Do a search for all .cpl files most will be in "C:\Windows\System32" however you can have others.<br />
Click on each one at a time and see if one does not start - if so Right Click on it and rename it using<br />
cpZ as the extension so it is east to find. Retry Control Panel - if no joy keep trying all your .cpl files.<br />
(Note the others found under other Folders under C:\Windows should not be tried as they are not<br />
active.)<br />
<br />
<br />
A few of these are appwiz.cpl, firewall.cpl, desk.cpl, powercfg.cpl, inetcpl.cpl, timedate.cpl and<br />
others.<br />
<br />
Try these in case general corruption has a role :<br />
<br />
Start - type this in Search Box -&gt;&nbsp; COMMAND&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top and RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; -&nbsp; RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
Enter this at the prompt - sfc /scannow<br />

There have been reports an updated driver has blocked it as well, so have you updated drivers<br />
lately? Also check for driver updates in Windows Updates.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

Hi,<br />
<br />
Windows Explorer crashes are mostly caused by an incompatible Shell Extension.<br />
<br />
please download this reg file from my SkyDrive:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://cid-128fc518635be2dc.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/.Public/MS%20Foren/Registry/WER%5E_Explorer.reg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://cid-128fc518635be2dc.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/.Public/MS%20Foren/Registry/WER%5E_Explorer.reg</a><br />
<br />
and make a double click on the file to import it. If you can't do this, run regedit.exe and import the registry file there!<br />
<br />
When the Windows Explorer crashes, Windows Error Reporting Service [1] creates a dmp file under C:\Localdumps. Please upload the file to your public Skydrive [2] folder and post the link here. I take a look at the dump with the Debugger, maybe I can see which
 Shell extension is the cause.<br />
<br />

This product is listed as being for Windows XP and Vista. Does it / can it also work for Windows 7? Is it possible, for example, to download compatibility software or is this model simply too old for the new operating system?<br />

<p><span>Unfortunately we do not have the information about the compatibility of ‘Hama webcam camera’</span></p>

                    My Windows 10 Photo app has assigned dates to many of my photos that are incorrect. It looks like the app assigned dates based on their entry into the app rather than the date photo was taken.&nbsp; I'm bringing all my photos into this app and wrong dates are
 a problem.&nbsp; I can't find a way to change those dates.&nbsp; I saw a similar question raised in 2015 in this forum but couldn't find an answer.&nbsp; I'd appreciate finding an solution.&nbsp; thanks in advance.

<p>back on my same issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a quarterly paid subscription to Peru landlines.&nbsp; It is showing that I only have 42 mins left and expries 3/3/19...it also shows i only have used 56 minutes. This subscription reloads 100 minutes every month but, today is the 3rd and i dont show 100
 minutes.... why is it not reloading it monthly but quarterly?</p>
<p>Please can you check and I complained about this before and they gave me the run-arounds answers. Before I woud get reloaded the minutes at the end of each month like 29-31st day....I dont know what is happening. I am not satisfied with this unresolved issue.
 It still seem I am not getting my 100/month but only 100/3 months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            error code 43 0000002B with External Hard Drive</h2>
                    i dont know why but all of a sudden every time i plug in my external hard drive&nbsp; i get a message saying "USB device not recognized". When i look at the device properties it says "Error 43" "Problem code 0000002B". I have tried uninstalling the driver and
 reinstalling it, unplug it, turning off the power, reseting the computer, I have tried it on 2 Windows 7s and 2 Windows XPs with no solution. Is there anything I can do or am I doomed to just write off all my data.

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the make and model of the external hard drive? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue can be caused if any of the following situations exist:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>The currently loaded USB driver has become unstable or corrupt</li><li>Your PC requires an update for issues that may conflict with a USB external hard drive and Windows</li><li>Windows may be missing other important updates hardware or software issues </li><li>Your USB controllers may have become unstable or corrupt</li><li>Your external drive may be entering selective suspend</li><li>Your PC motherboard may need updated drivers</li></ul>
<p>Since the hard drive failed to detect on another Windows operating systems, the hard drive could be corrupted. However, I would suggest you to refer this article and perform the steps provided.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>We suggest that you boot your device in Safe Mode and see if the issue persists in Safe Mode. If the problem does not occur when your PC is in Safe Mode, it's unlikely that the basic settings, files, and drivers in Windows are the cause of the problem. Try
 starting all of the apps on your desktop that you commonly use one by one (including the apps in your Startup folder) to see if a specific app might be causing the problem. If one of the apps is causing the problem, uninstall it or contact the software publisher.
 If the problem appears while in Safe Mode, you may attempt to refresh or reset your PC. For more info, see
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17085/windows-8-restore-refresh-reset-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
How to refresh, reset, or restore your PC</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may follow these instructions to get to the Windows Recovery Environment and boot in to Safe Mode:</p>
<ol>
<li>Do one of the following, depending on whether you have installations media (such as a DVD or USB flash drive):
<ul>
<li>If you have installation media for Windows 8.1, start your computer from the installation media. Insert the DVD or USB flash drive and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to Press any key to boot from DVD, do so. If you don't see the
 message, you might need to change the boot order in your computer's BIOS settings so that it starts from the DVD or USB. When you see the<strong> Install Windows</strong> page, click
<strong>Repair your computer</strong> to start the Windows Recovery Environment.</li><li>If you don't have installation media, use the power button to restart your computer three times. This will start the Windows Recovery Environment.</li></ul>
</li><li>In the Windows Recovery Environment, on the <strong>Choose an option screen</strong>, click
<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Startup Settings</strong>. If you don't see<strong> Startup Settings</strong>, click
<strong>Advanced options</strong>, and then click <strong>Startup Settings</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Restart</strong>, and then wait while your computer restarts.</li><li>On the <strong>Startup Settings</strong> screen, choose <strong>Safe Mode</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>Safe Mode starts Windows with a minimal set drivers and services to help troubleshoot issues. If a problem doesn't reappear when you start your PC in Safe Mode, you may eliminate the default settings and basic device drivers and services as possible causes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are looking forward to an update from you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>So what do you guys think about Bethesda's new game that's just been announced? Well since some of the other people that worked on the first Deus Ex games and Half-Life 2 were part of this project I'm pretty sure that I'll be interested with high expectations
 since I loved the Half-Life 2 series... :)</p>

<p>Premise sounds good ATM.</p>
<p>[quote]Bethesda’s next game is a first-person stealth/action adventure, and we’ve got the first look at it in our upcoming August issue. There are dozens of reasons why you should care about this weird-looking game you've never heard of. A few of the most
 important ones are after the jump.</p>
<p>Arkane Studios and founder Raf Colantonio have made memorable games in the past (Arx Fatalis, Dark Messiah of Might &amp; Magic) that ultimately suffered from a lack of publisher support. Bethesda Softworks believes in their vision and is giving them all the
 time, money, and development help (regular meetings with guys like The Elder Scrolls' Todd Howard don't make your game worse) they need. Harvey Smith, one of the main minds behind the first two Deus Ex games and a legendary veteran of game development, shares
 the vision and is on board as Dishonored's co-creative director along with Colantonio. Viktor Antonov designed Half-Life 2's iconic City 17 and is lending his talents to Dishonored's world. This is a perfect storm for creating a game that shatters the mold
 that first-person action games have built for themselves in the mainstream.</p>
<p>We've seen the game running, and now we share Colantonio and Smith's vision too. Dishonored is the antithesis of a edge-of-your-seat roller-coaster ride. It's a game about assassination where you don't have to kill anyone. It's a game about infiltration
 where you can set up traps and slaughter the entire garrison of an aristocrat's mansion rather than sneak in. It's a game about brutal violence where you can slip in and out of a fortified barracks with nobody ever knowing you were there. It's a game about
 morality and player choice where the world you create is based on your actions, not navigating conversation trees.[/quote]</p>

[quote]<span style="color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 1)">Arkane Studios and founder Raf Colantonio have made memorable games in the past (Arx Fatalis, Dark Messiah of Might &amp; Magic) that ultimately suffered from a lack of publisher support. Bethesda Softworks believes in their vision
 and is giving them all the time, money, and development help (regular meetings with guys like The Elder Scrolls' Todd Howard don't make your game worse) they need. Harvey Smith, one of the main minds behind the first two Deus Ex games and a legendary veteran
 of game development, shares the vision and is on board as Dishonored's co-creative director along with Colantonio. Viktor Antonov designed Half-Life 2's iconic City 17 and is lending his talents to Dishonored's world. This is a perfect storm for creating a
 game that shatters the mold that first-person action games have built for themselves in the mainstream.</span>[/quote]</p>

<h3> amhwisconsin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows can&#39;t find driver software to install my Maxtor back up drive. Any ideas&#63;</h2>
                    During installation of my Maxtor One Touch back up drive I receive the following error message, "Windows couldn't find driver software for your device." When I selece "Check for a solution" I get the response "Windows was unable to install your unknown
 device." The hard drive does not come with a CD and there is no download for it. I have made sure the drive isn't asleep and have checked all cords to make sure they are working. I am using Vista 64-bit. Any ideas? (I used this drive on my old PC and am trying
 to install it on my laptop). Thank you.

            Hi,<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Surely they had some ideas to send you, this is a known issue and they definitely have info to email you.<br />
<br />
I would be more comfortable recommending this method if the driver ever worked on this system. Have
<br />
you tried the drive on other systems to be sure it does work?<br />
<br />
Control Panel&nbsp;- Device Manager - USB Serial Controllers - USB Mass Storage Devices (you may have<br />
more than one - if so check all) - double click and on Driver Tab - Click Driver Details - the defaut is<br />
C:\Windows\System32\drivers\USBSTOR.SYS&nbsp; (the C:\Windows is where you have windows installed<br />
if not C:\Windows\) You may not have one for your drive if it not being recognised - when it is recognized<br />
and if not working properly come back to this step.<br />
<br />
Check this again as you proceed through these.<br />
<br />
2nd check these :<br />

-------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
If no joy :<br />
<p>Make a Restore Point</p>
<p>Control Panel - Device Manager - click in the blank area - then VIEW - Show Hidden Devices</p>
<p>now look everywhere EXCEPT USB Controllers for your device (may not find ANY) and if you find<br />
it RIGHT CLICK and UNINSTALL them all. The Device is your drive(s) or similar.</p>
<p>now go to USB Controllers and UNINSTALL EVERYTHING in the category but the category itself.</p>
<p>APPLY/OK</p>
<p>REBOOT</p>
<p>This will refresh the USB stack and hopefully allow the device to install. (You may need a powered hub)</p>
<p>Here is the similar procedure in XP, Vista's is the same except we need to clear the specific device if present.<br />

<p>Here is a utility to help but do the above 1st.</p>
<p>USBDeview is a small utility that lists all USB devices that currently connected to your computer, as well as all
<br />
USB devices that you previously used. Run it Options and check the 1st three choices to see if any are there.<br />
Try removing all instances and rebooting then plug in the drive.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/usb_devices_view.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/usb_devices_view.html</span></a></p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
Check this :<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows Disk - find Windows Disk Management on list at top -<br />
Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN&nbsp;&nbsp; look to see if there is a driver letter assigned or a conflict or the<br />
drive letter assigned is not the one you are used to seeing. This of course may not show the
<br />
drive&nbsp;at all, this is just a check.<br />
<br />
