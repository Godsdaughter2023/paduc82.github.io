<p>IMO it's hardware but it also suggests a deficiency in the software.&nbsp; E.g. is the calibration tool supposed to let us help the software become aware of such hardware defects and adapt for them or not?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Also, instead of disabling Touch completely, just disable the Multi-touch driver.&nbsp; Then you may at least have pen support to use.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Upgrade Infinite Restart Loop cannot login - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dinesh ch  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade Infinite Restart Loop cannot login</h2>
                    <p>I have upgraded my Sony Vaio Laptop from Windows 7 to Windows 10. The Laptop had many issues after upgrade but most of them resolved. One issue remain that it use to automatically restart. My entire family was cursing me, I was hoping that some fix will
 fix it and went past 30 days time. Now when the issue did not fixed I tried to uninstall it and found reset option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After running the reset option the Laptop is just in a loop of restart. It just keeps restarting. I read a lot on forums as such, there were some suggestion on how to fix but most of them were after the login. I cannot even login.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then thought can I get into safe mode and login. I tried pressing F8 at the time of boot but that did not work either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help on this will be greatly appreciated. Right now I am very frustrated with this Laptop. Also shocked that Microsoft seems to be not testing their product well, what kind of person will design an upgrade to install automatically and do not think of
 failed scenario. It is not even expected from a college going developer.</p>

                    <p>I have experienced a large number of problems with my laptop since installing the Windows 10 major a couple of months ago. Programs run slowly, erratically and suddenly lock up or even shut down unprompted. I have tried everything that I have read suggested

            Hi Horace.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Many thanks for your reply, Greg, and sorry for the delay in responding, but my computer has become even worse and is now even more sluggish and unresponsive. I got as far as Step 7 in paragraph 3 of your advice - i.e. installed malwarebytes and scanned
 with no significant results (58 PUPs which I assumed were mainly related to previously installed bloatware). Since then, though, I've had a 'Stop Code Critical Process Died', lots of hang-ups, Task Manager refusing to show any characters and lots of restarts.
 I am already running Mcafee Livesafe, but would you still advise to install and run the other anti-malware program?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other advice? Could these problems be memory related? 4GB RAM i3 3110M 2.4GHz&nbsp; CPU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>I'm afraid I'm not sure what 'Windows 10 major' is, but I do know that the best way to install an operating system is with a clean install. If instead you upgraded to Windows 10, you'll be a whole lot happier if you do a clean install now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you upgrade an operating system -&nbsp;<em>any</em> operating system - all the problems, mistakes and inefficiencies of the previous operating system(s) get migrated to the new operating system. By contrast, a clean install is a fresh start. Your computer
 begins with a squeaky clean copy of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you think about doing a clean install, you need to find out if your computer's hardware is supported on Windows 10. If the hardware is supported, you know that the manufacturers have tested the hardware and updated the drivers to be sure that the
 hardware performs at its best on Windows 10. If the hardware is not supported, it may still work fine on Windows 10, but there are no guarantees.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a fact of computing life: A clean install correctly performed on supported hardware always succeeds. So if you want your computer to perform at its best, that's what you need to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And if you're thinking "that sounds like a lot of work," it is. But your reward is a computer that works great. And don't think you have to be a geek to pull this off. I did it, and I'm a freak, not a geek. (Ask anyone here.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you've got your clean install on your supported hardware, the next step going forward is to only install supported software, i.e., software that is supported on Windows 10. Now you're about as bullet-proof as you can get and your computer will work
 as well as it can.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In concert with the above, you must learn how to use your computer correctly and&nbsp;<em>wisely</em>. There's little that's intuitive about using a computer - any computer - so don't make any moves until you've done the research so you know you're doing the
 right thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally ... backup ... backup every day. It's so easy to do and it's the ultimate defense against computer trouble.</p>

            Horace, No expert in Forums where we see the most cases (by the thousands) recommends Avast, AVG. Norton or McAfee, but we do solve problems by having them uninstalled.
<br />
<br />I would uninstall any 3rd party antivirus and try running only built-in Defender which gives adequate protection, least issues, and is from Microsoft who knows how to protect their OS best.
<br />
<br />If you want the best on-demand scanners install and run Malwarebytes and AdwCleaner free scanners.

<br /><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcleaner/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/download/adwcle...</a>
<br />
<br />Then if you cannot proceed with the Checklist I gave, even in Safe Mode with Networking, or Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>, I would run a Repair Install next.

<p>Hi Greg</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still working through your suggestions - I have deleted Mcafee (hope I'm still safe) and run both of the scans that you suggested with nothing of any significance picked up, but I'm still experiencing some very strange problems. Sometimes Windows won't start
 properly (program names, icons or even whole programs missing), sometimes just really slow or unresponsive, sometimes just locks up. I've also had an unusual experience where Windows reinstalled the latest major update of its' own accord when logging in my
 Microsoft account, and then showed a totally different list of programs (missing several) when compared to my usual profile - now my email client doesn't connect in my MS account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate that these problems can be diverse and convoluted, but in my naiivity I wonder if there can be a link to memory issues, as when I get problems everything seems to slow right down and I have even had a couple of instances of my laptop locking
 up and the clock display freezing - something I have never seen before. I have read that Windows 10 can be very memory hungry, and that problems with Canon Pixma printer problems such as those that I have experienced are common.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hate to be negative, but given the widespread nature of problems with Windows 10, is this just another example of Microsoft getting its' consumers to do its' program testing, rather than carrying out extensive software verification? Should I be looking
 at Linux, or should we all go back to Machine Code 🤨?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>
<p>

                    I have been trying to use Windows Easy transfer for a week now, it has been running for three days straight and to no success. I am trying to transfer 198.1 GB to my portable hard drive with 300GB free. It says that it has 1 minute left for the transfer
 time and it is saving 198.1 GB altogether, but it keeps on popping up with: Windows Easy Transfer Encountered some errors

<div>The transfer cannot continue until you have fixed the errors listed below</div>

<div>I have done this about 200 times now and each time it comes up with a different file. It didn't do this at the beginning but it does it every few minutes at the end.It is really annoying and I am pissed off at it. Please help me fix it.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Have tried the steps provided in your previous post?</p>

"Program Files" would not be transferred by Windows Easy Transfer.&nbsp; Only *your* documents and settings - not installed applications.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
The error is only what you have quoted?<br />

Yes, that is the only error I get. you can transfer program files because it gives an option to customize what you want to transfer and I watched a friend do it.

While it is true you can transfer practically any file/folder you want, you probably won't be able to RUN everything if your thought process is that you are were transferring actual installed applications.&nbsp; While there are some applications that could be moved
 with a copy (and in most ways, that is all WET is) there are many more that have registry entries, shared DLLs and the likes that moving their installation folder would do little for.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Just fair warning there.&nbsp; :-)<br />
&nbsp; <br />
As for the error - it almost looks like it is having problems parsing some directory or something.&nbsp; You are running as an administrative user<u> and
</u>you started WET with "RUN as Administrator"?<br />
&nbsp; <br />
In your 200 times - did you try just letting WET select the defaults and not customizing - does it still give you the error?<br />

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#40;For Microsoft Employee&#41; Apology For Not Genuine Windows 7 Ultimate</h2>
                    <p>I have a laptop with Windows 7 Home Basic pre-installed it, it was genuine 100%. At that time I was 12 years old, I don't know what Windows Anytime Upgrade is (I don't know about genuine software, pirate, crack, serial, product k key, etc. because I was
 12 years old) . I entered it, and there was a lot of feature of new Windows 7 (Home Premium, Professional, Ultimate). I searched the product key for Windows 7 Ultimate upgrade (just trying, you know on that time that was my first laptop...), I found it on
 a website, not a keygen, crack, or hack, it's only the serial. I try to enter the&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;7 Ultimate upgrade key&nbsp;to Windows Anytime Upgrade. First,&nbsp;the upgrade to Windows 7 Ultimate cancelled because the serial wasn't valid.&nbsp;So, I canceled it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suddenly, when I restart my pc, it's&nbsp;automatically upgrade to Windows 7 Ultimate! That's odd! I waited it and my PC became Windows 7 Ultimate... I used the Windows update, and it's perfectly works like a charm! I didn't know why the non-genuine Windows 7
 Ultimate couldn't detected as not genuine, I used it for almost 2 years like a really genuine Windows, no pop-up, no non-genuine alert, it's like the real genuine Windows.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I was 15 years, I newly know that the non-genuine (cracked, stealing the serial) is an action that against the law, 'hurt' the Microsoft Corporation and the real owner that serial I entered it... I feel guilty...
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"I apology (very apology)&nbsp;to Microsoft Corporation and ALL Microsoft employee especially on Windows, because I use the non-genuine Windows 7 Ultimate (upgrade from Windows 7 Home Basic). I don't know anything at that time because I was still 12 years old."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I back to my WIndows 7 Home basic with the product key below the laptop.. But, the problem is, I get the Windows 7 Home Basic, from the Windows 7 Ultimate non-genuine, I've downloaded it at third-party site, it was 100% clean official setup for Windows
 (not cracked, hacked, or anymore). I created it to the USB-bootable, and installed it on the laptop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question... Is my Windows 7 Home Basic (now has been upgraded to Windows 10 Home with digital entitlement) become non-genuine (in the religion : illegal, forbidden, illicit) because I DON't have money to buy the real Windows 7 Ultimate key upgrade.. I'm

            <p>Hello Ritch,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience caused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let us know the make and model of your PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Un mountable Boot Volume" error may be caused by a change of the SATA disk controller's mode in BIOS setting or firmware. In this situation, you can simply go to BIOS settings and change it. Depending on different manufacturers, the exact operation may
 be different. Attempt to switch between all three modes until a combination that results a successful boot.</p>
<p><strong>BIOS Disclaimer:</strong><br />
Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings
 can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.&nbsp; </p>

    <title>Side by Side errors causing downloaded program files to not open - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Side by Side errors  causing downloaded program files  to not open Microsoft.VC90.MFC  &#42;SOLVED</h2>
                    <p>I wanted to share how I fixed this problem on my pc running Win 10 home 64 bit since after dealing with it for some time I never found this as an option. Originally I had this error on half my programs and fixed it. I&nbsp; had trouble running DISM (probably
 cause it's an exe) . Unfortunately I'm not sure how I got it to go but it repaired the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">DOWNLOADING ALL THE C++ AND NETFX'S DID NOTHING.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">A couple weeks later I downloaded a utility program (from the website) that I liked on my Win 8 pro&nbsp; laptop .</p>
<div>
<p class="contentHeader2">When I tried to open it I got the popup saying the side by side configuration was wrong. I went to control panel, Administrative tools, event viewer which opens to the overview &amp; summary page. In the top box "summary of admin events"
 I opened/expanded "error" Then scrolled down to #35 side by side. Double click on that and there will be the cause of your problem.It may be different than mine. Not sure why they don't allow you to cut n paste that info but if you look to the right you'll
 see a "copy" link , inside a "save as text". (I will post my error results at the end of this)</p>
<p class="contentHeader2">SAVE yourself a lot of time,go check the error log first! If it's not running/working go to services and turn it on. Then try to open the program again. This will put the error in the "new" log.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p></div>
<p class="contentStandard">Basically&nbsp; for me the&nbsp;<span>Microsoft.VC90.MFC.MANIFEST version in the program was different from the one my system was requesting (9.2 instead of 9.3)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>To fix it I simply opened the program file, opened the MFC manifest in notepad and changed it to the&nbsp;correct version number. Of course it wouldn't allow me to put it back in so I saved it to the desktop,deleted
 the original MFC manifest (still in the prog file) then drag n dropped the modified one in which it then allowed. It does say it required admin rights or something like that but I hit ok and it completed the move. If you have tighter restrictions it could
 be an issue. I'd suggest opening the prog file as an Admin and retrying</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>Anyway, I clicked on the desktop link and the program opened right up. One thing to note; there were two VC90 manifests in the program one was the MFC the other&nbsp; CRT&nbsp;so make sure you pick the correct one.
 I'm certainly no expert at this so anyone that is feel free to add,correct or clarify.</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>Hope this is of some help!</span></p>
<p class="contentStandard"><span>Rob Hack&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="contentHeader2"><span>Oregon</span></p>
<div><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span>BTW The program files were about 50/50 dated 2017 &amp; 2019. I deleted the program, ran ccleaner, re installed a fresh downloaded copy, restarted it again so I tend to think the error was in the program as opposed to old files still
 in my PC.</span></div>

            Hi Annmarie.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Are you referring to Disk Space?   If so see these tutorials to complete all steps: 
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10/how-to-free-up-disk-space-in-windows/2458cc31-bd19-482f-ace5-7e3bd9da8098">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>

<br />Run Disk Cleanup to include System Files:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/disk-cleanup-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/d...</a>
<br />
<br />There are often a lot of files in Downloads folder that aren't needed any longer, some large.  I'd go through there and all other folders to clean out files you don't need.  Also go through the installed apps in Settings&gt;Apps to uninstall those you don't use.  If you have any questions about them just ask back.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>friends list and party chat not working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> diamondcutr  say:</h3>
<h2>            friends list and party chat not working</h2>
                    
<p>Party chat and my friends list have been not working randomly.&nbsp; The friends list says everyone is offline but I know this isn't true because my friend invited me to a party while it says he was offline.&nbsp; I talked to him and confirmed it was happening to
 him as well.&nbsp; I think it may be another DDoS attack because it happens after 20 to 30 minutes and then comes back again.&nbsp; This is exactly what happened Christmas&nbsp;eve when the DDoS attack started except now it is the friends list and party chat.&nbsp; I got kicked
 out of live randomly then signed back in and played for a while then I&nbsp;got kicked off of live again.&nbsp; Eventually I could not sign in at all for a day and a half.&nbsp; If this is another DDoS attack on Xbox we have a right to know.&nbsp; You should do the right thing
 and increase your security so DDoS isn't even possible.&nbsp; Any info is appreciated, thank you.</p>

<p>Same issue here. Intermittent issues with my friends list. One minute everything is fine, the next everyone is "offline." Currently everything seems to be working except parties. I can join them, but I can't hear anyone. The green circle isn't even lighting
 up when I know my headset works. </p>

<h2>            Rise of Nation-Extended Edition Crashes on Start-up windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently just purchased rise of nation on steam to play on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is a windows 10 home x64 with i7-4720 2.60 GHz, 16 GB RAM, with NVIDIA GTX 960M + Intel HD Graphics 4600 8GB.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
However, everytime when I try to start the game, the game crashes (nothing loads, it just straight up stops responding).<br />
<br />
I have tried verifying game content, as well as installing the DXSETUP.exe in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Rise of Nations\_CommonRedist\DirectX\Jun2010 and both vcredist_x64.exe and vcredist_x86.exe in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Rise
 of Nations\_CommonRedist\vcredist\2012. However, nothing has worked so far. I have also tried re-installing and still does not fix the problem.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
In addition, I have tried changing the compatibility mode to both windows 8 and windows 7 but it didn't work as well.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
My directX is version 12 and it should be able to handle version directX v10 requirements.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have also tried modifying game starting graphics control (like setting resolution, etc) with window-mode on. But it did not fix the problem either.<br />
<br />
I could really appreciate some help since after googling around, I see that a lot of players experience problems like this. Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi Kerishima,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize the inconvenience you are experiencing with <span>Rise of Nation-Extended Edition
</span><span>on Windows 10. I will certainly </span></p>
<p><span>help you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>To assist you better, please reply to the following question:</p>
<p><strong>1. </strong>Did you make any changes to your computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>Do you get any error message while <span>Rise of Nation crashes on Windows 10?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue might occur if the drivers are corrupted or incompatible or due to hardware problems. Downloading and installing the latest driver for your display adapter can resolve these types of problems. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Driver updates </strong>for Windows 10 and many devices (such as monitors, printers, and video cards) are automatically downloaded and installed through Windows Update. While it's likely you already have the most recent driver, if you're having trouble
 with a device, you can try fixing it by updating the driver or reinstalling it. Here's how:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Select the <strong>Start</strong> button, type <strong>Device Manager,</strong> and select it from the list of results.
</p>
<p><strong>2. </strong>Expand one of the categories to find the name of your device, then right-click (or tap and hold) it, and select
</p>
<strong>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Update Driver Software.</p>
</strong>
<p><strong>3. </strong>Select <strong>Search automatically for updated driver software.
</strong></p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> If Windows doesn't find a new driver, you can try looking for one on the device manufacturer's website and follow
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; their instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If these steps don't work, try reinstalling the driver: Open <strong>Device Manager,</strong> right-click (or tap and hold) the name of the device, and select
<strong>Uninstall.</strong> Restart your PC and Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please post back with the status of issue and we will be glad to assist you further.</p>

<p>
</p><p>To answer your question first,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>1.&nbsp;</em></strong><em>Did you make any changes to your computer prior to this issue?</em></p>
<p>I did not make any changes to my laptop prior to this issue</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong>Do you get any error message while&nbsp;</em><span><em>Rise of Nation crashes on Windows 10?</em></span></p>
<p>

 0x08E12FFC)."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just tried the driver update and reinstall solution that you mentioned and it did not fix the issue with the program crashing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help again, I really appreciate it.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi  zl1234
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />What you want to setup is a local account like on the old Windows 7 machine.

<h2>            After upgrade to windows 10 lost Microsoft Word</h2>
                    Hi, after upgrading from windows 7 to windows 10 on my laptop I cannot type any letters or documents as I appear to have lost Microsoft Word which was on my laptop, I do not wish to purchase Office as I only&nbsp; occasionally have to type the odd letter and
 Microsoft Word was already on my laptop. What can I do now?

</p><p>I suspect you had the 'MS Office Starter Edition' if it came pre-installed. &nbsp;That was an OEM product, which was distributed by some PC Suppliers with Windows 7 PCs. It isn't compatible with Windows 10 and was never available as a user installable product,
 which is why it will have not been carried forward to your windows 10 Upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As Gordon B-P advised, if your only written work is relatively simple then Wordpad should be fine. &nbsp;If you need something more complex, there is a number of freeware and 'free to use' OpenSource alternatives to try.</p>

<h2>            Six years and I&#39;m done with Xbox 360</h2>
                    
<p>Let me start off by saying I loved Xbox but I just can't do it anymore. This is my 3rd console that has the RRoD completely out of the blue and now only boots for 40 seconds before completely locking up. Called support and they told me to send it in for
 repair for $120. I told them I'm sorry but I'm not paying $120 to have a 3rd console fixed. They then said they could repair it for $99. I again told them that paying to have a 3rd console repaired is unacceptable at any cost. My PS3 is just as old as this
 latest Xbox and has about as many hours on it and it's still functioning. Heck, my original Xbox still works! Here's where it gets almost funny. Support tells me they're sorry for my experience with Xbox and this isn't what they want for their customers but
 if I'd buy the new Elite system it's built with much more robust hardware and doesn't have the "quirks and failure rate" of the old white-shelled consoles. I politely replied with "I hope that's the case but I'm not willing to spend another $300 to be part
 of an experiment and then potentially be having this conversation a 4th time." So the representative basically just told me the white consoles are known to have problems but my best recourse would be to buy a brand new system and try it again. Umm, no. I just
 got off the phone canceling my XBL subscription completely.</p>

<p><em>Hey OP, sorry to hear you are having problems with your console. I can sympathise as I am on number 4 myself.<br />
<br />
Just wanted to mention something in case you are not aware of it. The RROD is covered by the extended 3 year warranty so if you have had your console under that time limit a repair would be free.<br />
Did support check the warranty status of your console?, if not you can do that yourself on the website just to be sure.</em></p>

<p>Yes, my console is outside of the 3 year warranty. I understand the warranty period is up but it's very frustrating that my 4 year old PS3 is still going and my 10 year old Xbox still plays games like a champ. I would also be more understanding if this was
 my first failure but it's the 3rd. I'm simply not going to put any more money into this product only to get questionable reliability at best. Life goes on without it...

<p><i><span>While the console has been known for its hardware failures we also need to keep in mind that the environment it is exposed to also determines if it gets RRoD.
</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span>-If you smoke and/or have pets you should be dusting the console several times a week. If your console is near a window and gets direct sunlight that would add heat to it. -If your console is
 near a heat vent and/or another device that outputs alot of heat that will add heat to it.</span></i></p>
<p><i><span>-If your console is enclosed in an entertainment unit or other enclosure that will add heat to it.
</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span>And I don't believe you when you say the Xbox and the PS3 get the same play time equally. Not with the PSN being down for over a month.
</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span>Either way gaming is a choice. If you feel that a product/service does not meet your expectations then you are free to choose another that does.

<p>I'm not a smoker and I'm a bit of a clean freak so dust isn't the issue. It's on an open shelf on a wall that doesn't get sunlight as I don't like it on shining on my television. That's fine you don't believe me when I tell you that my PS3 has about the
 same play time on but I'm telling you it does. My PS3 doubles as my movie player in the bedroom and I have a Blockbuster mail subscription (like Netflix). I watch approximately 15 - 20 hours just in Blurays a week on it plus gaming. Again, if it's an environmental
 issue (heat, dust, sunlight, etc.) than why are my original Xbox, PS3 and HD DVR still functioning? They're all on open shelves approximately 2 feet from each other.</p>
<p>I do prefer the Xbox and by far prefer the XBL service versus the PSN. However, I'm simply not willing to buy another Xbox console and be sitting in this predicament again with a $300 boat anchor. I'm not asking for this thing to function like a Panasonic
 Toughbook but I would expect it to be able to at least match the hardware reliability of the original Xbox.</p>

<p>[quote user="GHull3"]I watch approximately 15 - 20 hours just in Blurays a week on it plus gaming.[/quote]PS3 doesn't spin DVDs at 12x for hours on end. The rotational speed for a 2x Blu-ray drive is significantly lower than a 12x DVD drive.[quote]I would
 expect it to be able to at least match the hardware reliability of the original Xbox.[/quote]There exists no other consumer electronics device that attempts to spin a DVD at 12x for literally HOURS on end. Between the heat and vibration, it's no wonder the
 older XBOX consoles were unreliable.</p>
<p>With install to disc and the component reduction, the 360 S should be the most reliable 360 model to date. Up to you if letting your 360 game collection go by the wayside is worth it.</p>
