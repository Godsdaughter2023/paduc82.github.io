    <title>550 Rate Limit Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sgriffin.esp  say:</h3>
<h2>            550 Rate Limit Error</h2>
                    <p>Our business keeps getting the following error when sending batch emails to our staff;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(128, 128, 128, 1)">SMTP1 #550 RATE LIMIT: Too many messages sent in the last 1h</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Certain messages still go through and I can't find a trend. Our ISP (TalkTalk) has said it is not an issue at their end but a Microsoft SMTP issue.</p>
<p>We use a catchall (POP3 email) and distribute to our network via Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 which is running on Microsoft Small Business Server 2011.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have check this morning and neither our IP or company domain are blacklisted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help/advice would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>I don't believe them.&nbsp; Most likely you were talking to a first-level tech support script-reader.&nbsp; If a situation isn't included in the prepared list of problems, the default response from most ISP tech support is to blame the operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See <a href="http://www.emailaddressmanager.com/tips/email-rate-limit.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.emailaddressmanager.com/tips/email-rate-limit.html</a> for a general discussion.&nbsp; Here's what Talk Talk says -- 3500 recipients/hour or only 250 if you're relaying --&gt;<a href="https://ttb.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/662/~/what-are-the-restrictions-on-the-talktalk-business-smtp-outgoing-mail-servers%3F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
 https://ttb.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/662/~/what-are-the-restrictions-on-the-talktalk-business-smtp-outgoing-mail-servers%3F</a> These limits may vary according to the level of service you're paying for -- or they may have changed since that page
 was written.&nbsp; This site, for example, says Talk Talk is limited to 500 recipients per hour or 6. 1500 e-mails per 24 hour period --&gt;<a href="https://helpdesk.experisys-it.co.uk/index.php?pg=kb.page&amp;id=85" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://helpdesk.experisys-it.co.uk/index.php?pg=kb.page&amp;id=85</a>.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How many messages are typically in one of your batches?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How complex/large are the messages in terms of content (e.g., many pictures or attachments)?&nbsp; I have a relatively slow upload connection and when I send a large batch of messages, I usually have no problems if the messages are large -- because the upload
 speed limits the number of messages the server sees per unit of time -- but if it's just a one or two line email, I frequently get disconnected in the middle of the batch.&nbsp; I've always attributed this to running into one of my ISP's send limits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Call back and ask to have your issue escalated to a more knowledgeable level of tech support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are not convinced, and still think it's a Microsoft issue, ask here --&gt;

<p>Yes, I believe you can....&nbsp; those initial install prompts are part of the initial "pre boot" environment, so the full operating system is not yet running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I think it'd be safe to just power down the laptop without any issues of a corrupted disk. &nbsp; Afterwards, when they first turn on the laptop it will start over at the beginning of the pre boot environment.</p>

                    <p>Lately, I've been having issues with my "File explorer". Sometimes, when I try to save or open a file, while in an application (Microsoft Word, Mendeley Desktop, Google Chrome, etc.), the application gets an error and closes itself. Mendeley and Google Chrome
 just close without any notification, but Office gives the following explanation: "The exception unknown software exception (0xe0000002) occured in the application at location 0x000000007686DAE8".&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have had contact with microsoft, but they couldn't find an issue. And the issue was not occuring during the contact.</p>

            <p>Hi Alex,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting&nbsp;your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you boot your Windows 7 you might be seeing the following message <br />
<br />
Windows failed to start.&nbsp; A recent hardware or software change might be the cause.&nbsp; To fix the problem:<br />
<br />
1. Insert your Windows installation disc and restart your computer.<br />
2. Choose your language settings, and then click “Next”.<br />
3. Click “Repair your computer.”<br />
<br />
The file is ntoskrnl.exe, and it's a core operating system file. If it's<br />
corrupt or missing you have a major problem. Quite often though, this error<br />
is a symptom of a different problem. You stated that you made no recent<br />
changes to hardware/software, but have you accounted for driver updates and<br />
updates to programs like your antivirus software? There is also the<br />
possibility that you may be experiencing a hardware failure, this is not<br />
uncommon in a new system. If such is the case, the system should still be<br />
under warranty and Sony should be contacted.<br />
<br />
Have you tried accessing the boot menu by hitting F8 at startup? If so, have<br />
you tried loading Safe mode?<br />
<br />
First try booting and safe mode and see what happens <br />
<br />
<strong>To boot into safe mode, follow the below steps:</strong> <br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer.<br />
<br />
Click the Start button, click the arrow next to the Lock button, and then click Restart.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong> Do one of the following:</strong> <br />
<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you will need to try again by waiting until the Windows logon
 prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer.<br />
<br />
•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to start in safe mode, and then press F8.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys to highlight the safe mode option you want, and then press ENTER. For more information about options, see Advanced startup options (including safe mode).<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Log on to your computer with a user account that has administrator rights.<br />
<br />
When your computer is in safe mode, you'll see the words Safe Mode in the corners of the display. To exit safe mode, restart your computer and let Windows start normally.<br />
<br />
Refer the below link for more details:<br />
<br />
Start your computer in safe mode<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></a>
<br />
<br />
If Safe Mode does lilttle help, there are 2 workarounds that may fix the issue.<br />
<br />
<strong>Workaround 1 :</strong> <br />
<br />
You’ll need to manually restore some files again to the version that came with your Windows installation DVD. Use the Windows DVD to boot into repair mode and restore these files using the command prompt:<br />
<br />
In your “\Windows\System32\” folder, restore just these files:<br />
<br />
hal.dll<br />
<br />
ntoskrnl.exe (You shouldn’t need to replace it because it’s not really corrupted.)<br />
<br />
ntkrnlpa.exe (Same as ntoskrnl.exe. Try booting without replacing them first)<br />
<br />
And in your “\Windows\System32\Drivers” folder, restore these:<br />
<br />
acpi.sys<br />
<br />
msisadrv.sys<br />
<br />
pci.sys<br />
<br />
volmgr.sys<br />
<br />
volsnap.sys<br />
<br />
disk.sys<br />
<br />
Make sure to rename or backup the files you’re going to replace (just in case you do something wrong). All the original files you’ll need to replace your “corrupted” files with should be found inside the virtually mounted drive (X:\), so they should be in “X:\Windows\System32″\
 and “X:\Windows\System32\Drivers\” (you don’t need to “expand” any files like the old XP days, you’ll just need to use basic “copy” and “rename” commands).<br />
<br />
HINT: If you’re not too comfortable using the command prompt, you can use the notepad’s file browser to copy and paste files from inside the repair DVD. Just type “notepad.exe” in the command prompt and set the file type to ALL inorder to see non-txt files.(WARNING:
 It doesn’t prompt you when overwriting files and It doesn’t show hidden or system files, but you shouldn’t need it to anyways)<br />
<br />
You should’nt need to restore any other files for you Windows to boot. Don’t just replace all the files inside your “System32\Drivers\” folder like what that article said, that will probably do more harm than good. I used the debug boot log file from inside
 my Windows folder (ntbtlog.txt) to determine which files Windows is using while attempting to boot, and then I checked their file version from inside the repair DVD (right click&gt;properties&gt;details or just leave the mouse pointer on the file for a second);
 If it was 6.0.6001.18000 (SP1 release version), I replaced it with the old version from my boot DVD.<br />
<br />
hal.dll did actually give me some trouble because it wasn’t in the X: drive. And unfortunatly it’s the VERY FIRST file the Windows Loader tries to load at boot so you’ll have to get it somehow. You can use the Automatic Repair Method as follows<br />
<br />
If you look inside your “C:\Windows\System32″ folder, You will see three files: hal.dll, halacpi.dll, and halmacpi.dll. You will likely see that hal.dll is the same size as one of them. That’s because it’s exactly the same file just copied and renamed. Basicly
 if you have a multi-core PC you’ll need to use halmacpi.dll and rename it to hal.dll, If you’re running a single core PC you need to use halacpi.dll instead. The “winsxs” folder only has these two files and not hal.dll straight up because it kinda depends
 on the type of processor you’re using. So look inside your “winsxs” folder for folders that start with “x86_hal.inf_XXXXXX_6.0.6000.20500_none_XXXXXXX” and you’ll find these two files inside along with a “hal.inf” which you won’t need to replace (it’s inside
 the “inf” folder in your Windows directory), and then copy whichever one you should use -depending on your processor- to your “C:\Windows\System32\” folder. Now that I think about it, It’s probably better if you replace both halacpi.dll and halmacpi.dll inside
 your System32 folder too (Just to be on the safe side).<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE:</strong> You’ll probably find two or more folders that start with “x86_hal.inf” in your “winsxs” folder, but make sure:<br />
<br />
1)The folder starts with just “x86_hal.inf” not “x86_hal.inf.resources”<br />
<br />
or you can look for it in your Windows folder inside your “winsxs” (ex C:\Windows\Winsxs\) folder (a folder that Windows 7/Vista uses to basicly backup every version of every file ever made for Windows 7/Vista) But it’s kinda of tricky because:<br />
<br />
1)The file is deep inside “winsxs” which has TONS of folders and files<br />
<br />
2)The file itself is kinda of tricky to back up because the exact file isn’t actually there.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Workaround 2 :</strong> <br />
<br />
1) Close all applications running and temporarily shut down if you have any Anti Virus program<br />
<br />
2) Disconnect all usb (EXCEPT MOUSE)<br />
<br />
3) Now boot with the Windows 7 Operating System CD and do a repair using the following procedure<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Insert your Windows 7/Vista DVD and then restart your computer.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Press any key or the appropriate function key (depends on your computer) to boot to the DVD.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * When your computer has booted to the DVD select your language and then press Next.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Click Repair your computer on the next screen.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Select the operating system your want to repair. There is usually only one here unless you’re dual booting.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Click Startup Repair on the next screen.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * The Startup Repair tool will attempt to fix your computer and get it booting up again.<br />
<br />
You don’t have to do anything from here on. Your computer might reboot a few times and it might be a few minutes before it finishes.<br />
<br />
It goes thru the following<br />
<br />
Long time to load (green bar)<br />
Installing Stage 1 of 3<br />
Installing Stage 2 of 3<br />
RESTARTS<br />
Installing Stage 3 of 3<br />
CONFIGURING UPDATES<br />
THEN AGAIN:<br />
Installing Stage 1 of 3<br />
Installing Stage 2 of 3<br />
RESTARTS<br />
Installing Stage 3 of 3<br />
RESTARTS<br />
CONFIGURING UPDATES<br />
<br />
6) Finally it starts up with the Windows 7/vista Screen Saver – hit any key and logon.<br />
<br />
7) Now re-connect all USB and re-start any programs.<br />

<p>The Fax Service depends on the Print Spooler Service.</p>
<p>The Print Spooler Service depends on the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) Service.</p>
<p>The RPC Service doesn't depend on anything, but a lot of things depend on it, so it is usually running all the time.</p>
<p>"Depend" means, it won't run or start without the other one(s) already running first.</p>
<p>Your fax Service is probably set to start Automatically and can't start because the things it depends on are not started either.&nbsp; If you don't disable it, it will keep trying to start because it thinks it is supposed to be running.</p>
<p>So, check if your RPC service is running, if not start it.&nbsp; Then your Print Spooler Service should start, then your Fax Service should start.</p>
<p>The only one of those three that you usually must have running is RPC since so many things depend on it.&nbsp; If it is not running or won't start, you may have some other issue.</p>
<p>If you never use fax, disable the service and it won't try to start (that is how mine is).&nbsp; If you never print, disable the Spooler Service (that is how mine is).&nbsp; I don't like the extra junk running or even starting when I am not going to use it.&nbsp; I would
 rather my CPU do things I want it to do - and faxing is nothing I do and I print rarely.&nbsp; If you don't want to Disable the service completely, set it to Manual and it will start if it needs to start.</p>
<p>You can look at your Services by clicking Start, Settings, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Services.&nbsp; Manipulate the Services by right clicking them and look at their Properties and the Stop/Start buttons on the screen.&nbsp; You can see who depends on what
 there too.</p>
<p>A shortcut to the Services applet is to click Start, Run and in the box enter:</p>
<p>services.msc</p>
<p>Click OK.</p>

<p>That should make the errors goes away.</p>
<p>No event in the Event Log should defy&nbsp;explanation. &nbsp;Some are "normal" when you restart as the "depends on" things get started, but you should not see errors too often unless there is an issue - or you can explain the errors, maybe while testing something
 new.</p>
<p>If you don't plan on using the built in XP fax stuff, I would just disable it. &nbsp;If something comes along later and needs it for some reason, that something should&nbsp;complain about it not being enabled and remind you it is not enabled.</p>
<p>The Fax Service should usually still start though, if all the "depends on" things are running. &nbsp;You can try to start it manually from the Services applet and when you do, you will see an event like this in the Event Log:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Event Type:<span> </span>Information</p>
<p>Event Source:<span> </span>Service Control Manager</p>
<p>Event Category:<span> </span>None</p>
<p>Event ID:<span> </span>7036</p>
<p>Description:</p>
<p>The Fax service entered the running state.</p>
<p>Then say "ah-ha" when you know it works and Stop it and Disable it.</p>
<p>From your other posted threads here, I think you have some other issues going on, so I would suggest you get them squared away first, then work on performance.</p>
<p>I like to actually measure things like boot time down to the tenths of a second, the make&nbsp;adjustments&nbsp;and measure again. &nbsp;That way, there is no "it seems faster, it might be faster, it could be faster - oh, it is a lot faster!" stuff going on. &nbsp;Sometimes
 the effects are&nbsp;psychological. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You also don't want to be "trying" things that might work maybe. &nbsp;No... could be, should be, might be either. &nbsp;You want to be able to measure it. &nbsp;You need to actually get some numbers on a piece of paper (78.30 seconds or something like that) and then you
 can work on getting it as short as possible - maybe to 43.20 seconds. &nbsp;Then when you get good at it, charge your friends $1 for every second you reduce their system boot time (and have the numbers to properly invoice them). &nbsp;Not bad for a few minutes of "work".
 &nbsp;No charge if their boot time gets worse.</p>
<p>You can also look at hibernating your system instead of shutting down. &nbsp;I have turned into a chronic hibernator because I need just about everything in&nbsp;the&nbsp;world to be instantaneous. &nbsp;Shutting down and restarting is required and a good idea sometimes, but
 it is not required all the time. &nbsp;You can be "ready" after a power up in seconds instead of minutes. &nbsp;If it takes you minutes now, that is probably too long though.</p>
<p>Here is a short article (Or use Google) about hibernating:</p>

 no choice with this forced reboot.&nbsp; Do you know how to stop the forced reboot?</p>

<p>I don't know why your system is hanging, so I will think about that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>XP has a mechanism built in to help you figure out what is going on when your system freezes completely (that is why they put it in).&nbsp; Most people would just push the power or reset button but you can figure out why.&nbsp; There may not be anything you can do
 about it if it is something like a Java or Firefox issue since you are not the code developer, but maybe you can work around it if you can't control it or make a plan to deal with it more gracefully.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe Microsoft products are not well suited for what you are doing.&nbsp; What are your other chess players using on their systems and do they have problems like yours?</p>
<p>If you resort to using the power button, one of these times you may be posting with a new topic along the lines of:</p>
<p>"My Computer Will Not Boot"</p>
<p>so... try not to use the power button.&nbsp; It is generally fixable if that happens, but scary sometimes.&nbsp; Use the reset button if you must.&nbsp; Power interruptions are sometimes bad news.</p>
<p>You can control how XP handles your Automatic Updates by clicking Start, Settings, Control Panel, Automatic Updates.</p>
<p>You can read about how AU works and how to control it in this article:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306525" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/306525</a></p>
<p>I would not disable AU completely, but just let XP tell you when there are updates and you can pick a convenient time to look at them and install them if you want/need them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft likes to put out a "batch" the second Tuesday of every month (Patch Tuesday).&nbsp; This is followed by Exploit Wednesday - also known as Black Wednesday since some systems in the world will attribute their sudden batch of new problems to the recent
 batch of updates (it is almost always some preexisting condition brought to light with the updates though).</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I went to control panel&gt;automatic updates&gt;and switched from automatic to download and let me choose when to install.&nbsp; I had not been there in a long time and had forgotten about this option.</p>
<p>For the hangs I&nbsp;just got this:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Warning:&nbsp; unresponsive script</p>
<p>A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding.&nbsp; You can stop the script now, or you can continue to see if the script will complete.&nbsp; Script:<a href="http://www.cboe.com/js/scripts/jquery-1.3.2.min.js:12" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.cboe.com/js/scripts/jquery-1.3.2.min.js:12</a></p>
<p>and in addition many of my open web pages have "The adobe flash plug in has crashed.&nbsp; No report available.&nbsp; Reload the page to try again.</p>
<p>Isnt there a way for everyone to consume their ram and have their system hang.&nbsp; For example I have 2 gig ram.&nbsp; If I were to reduce that to 500 wouldnt I be able to open just a few programs or windows as the same time without having the system hang, crash
 or stop responding?&nbsp; Sometimes conntrol alt delete does nothing and I have to press the power button.&nbsp; Are their any other options.&nbsp; I was considering purchasing more ram.&nbsp; Alternatively I was thinking of putting that towards a new system at some point in
 the future.&nbsp; Any thoughts about the hangs?</p>

<p>That could be a problem with your installed version of Java Runtime Environment (JRE), a programming oversight in Java or a programming oversight in the WWW page Javascript (the .js file)&nbsp;you are viewing.</p>
<p>Look in Start, Settings, Control Panel, Add/Remove programs and check your Java version.</p>
<p>The latest is Java(TM) 6 Update 21.</p>
<p>If that is not what you have, you will have the best possibility for a smooth transition is to just uninstall all your Java versions, reboot, check to be sure they are really gone, and reinstall Java from scratch. &nbsp;If you have more than one listed in Add/Remove
 programs, I would still uninstall them all, reboot and install the latest&nbsp;version&nbsp;anyway so there is no question about what version you are running.</p>
<p>Java downloads/updates/check your version is here:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp</a></p>
<p>Test/update your Shockwave and Flash player versions here.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/welcome/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/welcome/</a></p>
<p>Does your chess page have a help/support forum? &nbsp;Maybe somebody there has already figured all this stuff out. &nbsp;You may not have an XP problem at all.</p>
<p>I would leave the RAM alone for the moment and not be changing too many things at once. &nbsp;Do a little testing in between changes if you are able to see if your symptoms are better, worse, no change.</p>
<p>We will have to save your system hanging/freezing Ctrl-Alt-Del does not work debugging for another time, or somebody else can jump in here.</p>

<p>The adobe flash crash happened with mozilla and they have&nbsp;a web site to check for updates:&nbsp; It's a plug in check:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/plugincheck/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/plugincheck/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When i viewed contorl pane&gt;add remove programs there was only one java entry:&nbsp; Java(TM) 6 update 20&nbsp; 91.02MB&nbsp; rarely used.&nbsp; Rarely used makes no sense to me since I use java everyday.&nbsp; About&nbsp;3 months ago I deliberately uninstalled all entries for java in
 my add remove programs list.&nbsp; Somehow the mozilla program is finding a Java toolkit which I do not see listed in the add remove programs.</p>
<p>Somehow it did not indicate that my update 20 needed to be updated to 21??</p>

 to 21 and see what happens.&nbsp; If there is only one in the add remove programs I'll leve it.&nbsp; If there is a Java 20 and a 21 I'll uninstall both and do a fresh download and reinstall.</p>

<h2>            Preparing automatic repair then black screen with cursor</h2>
                    <p>I have an asos notebook model q502LAt came with windows 8 but updated to 8.1 or rt 8.1 not sure. I did opt in for the windows 10 preview. &nbsp;Maybe itsbbecause of that but when i start up my notebook it displays the asos logo and under neath it will say prepairing
 automatic repair. It takes a good few minutesnfor it to move from there butnonce it does it just a black screen with the cursor. I have tried pressing buttons tap restarting and nothing works. I cant do anything from the black screen. And i cant gobinto safe
 mode by pressing f8 when the logo fomes up. Im jot sure what to do. And my notbook didnt come with any disks i bought it from bestbuy in februrary 2015
</p>
<p>Update &nbsp;i left it alone for a while and itwent to auto fix couldnt fix the issure or somthing like that i tried refreshing and it wouldnt work it said windows driver is locked i tried renamining the system hive (if i did it correctly ) and refreshed it once
 more and it said the same thing. So then From there i clicked continue tonwindows 8 &nbsp;and it rebooted with preparing autofix &nbsp;i think its going into a loop</p>

</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Answers and providing us with the detailed description about the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>As per the description, I understand that you are experiencing issue with black screen with cursor while preparing for automatic repair in the computer.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Firstly, I would advise to remove all external devices except mouse and keyboard (if any) and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Normally, if you are unable to boot the Windows 8.1 to its Start Screen, the Automatic Repair will check for the errors which is preventing Windows from booting up and will
 fix it. If this does not happen, then when you may need to run the Automatic Repair by booting the computer to Windows 8.1 installation/recovery disc and then it will fix the issue if the issue with any startup files required for Windows 8.1 to boot up.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>If you do not have Windows 8.1 installation DVD, you may have to create one, boot the computer from it and then perform an Automatic Repair of Windows 8.1. To create installation
 media, you may refer to the article given below:</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>After creating the disc, boot the computer from the disc and then try the following method to perform an Automatic Repair of Windows 8.1.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Contact the computer manufacturer to know on how to change the boot order of the computer. You will have to change the boot device to CD/DVD drive and then boot from the Windows 8.1 installation disk.</span></li><li>

<span>Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the Automatic Repair.</span></li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>You might also require to change the boot priority in BIOS in order to allow the computer to boot from CD/DVD.</span></span></p>

            <p>Is setting the boot priority cd/dvd the same if i am going to be using a usb flash drive ? &nbsp;And will i need a product key when i run the repair or reinstallation? Because i dont have one. My notebook came pre installed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Update i was able t to do as your instructions said but i had to choose startuo repair instead of automatic repair since that option wasn't listed in the menu i had to go to and it restarted and hs been on the same screen for a bit over an hour. "Asus
 &nbsp;with the loading sign and diagnosing your pc " &nbsp;should it be taking this long ?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I said startup repair couldnt fix &nbsp;your computer. It says shut down or advanced options now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Im really not sure what to do.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Stuck in a loop&#58;&#40;</h2>
                    
<p>my xbox live account is still bound to an email that i cant access anymore....since friday i have been struggling to reset the password that i have forgotten.</p>
<p>Have done the account recovery process 4 times.....and spoken to live chat people from xbox 3 times.</p>
<p>Each time ive been told to do the same thing....go to account recovery.....once i was told to go to microsoft community, but for some reason im unable to sign in there.</p>
<p>And once ive actualy had a ticket open on their support page.....where i was given a step by step way of fixing my problem....guess what...it didnt work.</p>
<p>All it did was send me back to the password reset page where eventually u have to click on email me a lnk again and then they send the link to old email....again.</p>
<p>Or i could just do the recovery again.</p>
<p>Ive looked on microsoft community and most people there have similar problem except they dont give enough information apparently and fail recovery.</p>
<p>Just to make sure u guys understand....i do get the recovery done...enough information given....i just cant seem to get them to send it to new email address.</p>
<p>Enough of that.....hope some1 can help....[mod removed] tired of this now</p>
<p>Strange how they still deduct money every month for xbox live.....but i cant even buy ms points....and i cant change nothing.:(*</p>

<p><span>Hello,</span><br />
<br />
<span>If you've forgotten the information to recover the gamertag you will need to fill out the&nbsp;</span><strong><a href="http://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Account Recovery form</a></strong><span>. There is absolutely nothing more we can do for you as this
 is a Microsoft Account issue. If you are unable to fill out the form to their liking then they will not be able to give you access to the account. It's a security concern and they will not be able to comply with just giving anyone's account back with little
 to no information.</span><br />
<br />
<span>Since this is a Microsoft Account issue, you will need to&nbsp;</span><strong><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/profile">contact the Microsoft Account team which can be found here</a></strong><span>.<br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
If you are unable to recover the account and you are still being charged for Xbox LIVE, you can
<strong><a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us/#0:0:7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">turn off automatic renewal by contacting phone support</a></strong>.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>He did fill out the Microsoft Account Form and after he passes the test it send him in a loop back to the beginning. The same EXACT thing is happening to me now. &nbsp;Its incredibly annoying because all roads lead back to the beginning.</p>

            Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Run Built-in &amp; Guided Walk through Windows Update troubleshooter
<br />Built-in : Windows Key+X &gt; Click Settings &gt; Click Update &amp; security &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Click Windows Update &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter

<br />
<br />2. I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

    <title>Windows 10 Disabling Mouse - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kalitenee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Disabling Mouse</h2>
                    Though I know how to disable the internal mouse so that I can use my physical mouse...I'm peeved that it doesn't "stick". Every time I restart the PC, I have to go and do it all over again. Shouldn't it just 'sense' that the other mouse is plugged in and
 disable itself automatically? Before Windows 10, it did. Help!

                    <p>Old title: Windows 10 Maps crashing......</p>
<p>When I open my Maps app in Windows 10 it sits for a few seconds with a black screen then immediately crashes to desktop.....</p>
<p>If I go into settings and click to check my Offline Maps, it says there is a problem and that my maps need to be deleted. I click to delete but NOTHING happens.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reset and tried numerous times but with the same outcome. I cannot get into Maps. I cannot delete the old maps, and I cannot download any new ones.....</p>

            <p>I've just found a way to resolve this!</p>
<p>Find a pc with a working Maps, make sure that it saves the maps in C:.</p>
<p>After that open Regedit and go to HKLM, system, maps.</p>
<p>Right click on the map folder and select export and save the reg file on a USB stick.</p>
<p>Go on the computer with the "broken" maps, open the reg file you've just exported, restart the computer. Now in System -&gt; offline maps you should see C: as the selected drive, and the possibility to download the maps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps!</p>

<p>I'm not sure what else to do, except to keep pulling each screen down.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi
<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>bigspud,</span></span></p>
<p><br />
<span>Thank you for choosing from Microsoft Windows Vista forums.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Video Graphics Array, or VGA for short, is video interface technology which is commonly used to connect desktop computers to monitors. A standard VGA connection
 displays in 640í--480 resolutions. This is the standard definition in a 4:3 aspect ratio. Many laptop computers have VGA ports, primarily for hooking up additional monitors, but the VGA port can also be used to connect a laptop and a TV.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>How to Connect a Laptop to a TV Using a VGA Cable</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 1</strong> Plug one end of the VGA cable into the laptop's VGA port.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 2</strong> Connect the other end of the VGA cable to the TV's VGA port. If the TV does not have a VGA port, plug the other
 end of the VGA cable into a composite adapter and then plug the composite cables into the TV. Older televisions often do not have VGA ports and require an adapter, while newer models often have VGA ports.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 3</strong> Turn on the computer and TV.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 4</strong> Change the TV to the correct video channel for the incoming connection from the computer. Most TVs have several
 video channels, such as S-video, component, and HDMI. The correct channel will likely be a blue screen instead of static. Your TV screen might display your computer's desktop at this point. If not, go on to step 5.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 5</strong> Open your computer's video control panel and setup screen sharing. Depending on your graphics card, your video
 control panel will be different, but you should be able to access it by right clicking the desktop and selecting it from the "drop down" list. Once you open the display control panel, look for an option to set up multiple displays or enable screen sharing.
 Select the clone setting to have the TV display the computer's desktop, or dual view to create an extension of your computer's screen.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: If you set a TV to your primary display device, make sure to set the laptop screen as the primary display device before unhooking the TV. If you have
 the option, HDMI and DVI connections to a TV will produce higher quality video signals than VGA</span></p>
<span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><br />
Hope this helps<br />
<br />

<p>Hi Cheerio,<br />
<br />
76ms latency is not bad at all. That is less than one tenth of a second of latency. Also, a download speed of 47 mbps is great. The recommended download speed for Xbox Live is 3mbps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A question for Mister Ohnaka.</p>
<p>Is the latency accurate for normal xbox servers.</p>
<p>Apparently when testing connection it pings servers in Seattle, Washington no matter where you are in the world.</p>
<p>So if you are on the other side of the atlantic ocean like in the UK you get high pings of over 150ms.</p>
<p>Does this mean the UK always gets a sub-standard connection or are we actually connected to servers in the UK?</p>

<h2>            skype cuts off when connected through o2</h2>
                    <p>Has anybody come across this issue</p>
<p>when i try to skype someone with a o2 data only sim in a myfi hot spot using any kind of device, it will connect but about every 7 seconds will go to a black screen, but only for 1 second then reconnect as normal.</p>
<p>If you do it in reverse (eg) connect with a device through a router to my device on o2 it works perfectly.</p>
<p>Have spoken to the gurus at o2 and they are at a loss to explain it.<br />

</p><p>What you experience is&nbsp;a usual behavior when using Skype and only connected to a mobile data connection. For best results, we strongly suggest that you use a Wi-Fi connection or any wired connection. But if you really wish to use your mobile data connection,
 make sure there is no other device that is connected to your Hot Spot.</p>

<h2>            Xbox 360 Slim HDD able to be an external hardrive&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>My dad and I are wondering about being able to use the Xbox 360 Transfer Cable as a cable to connect the new Xbox Slim HDD to the old Xbox 360 as an external hardrive.</p>
<p>Is this possible?</p>
<p>&nbsp;I don't want the new xbox. I just want to purchase a Slim HDD with 250GB and use that as an external hardrive for my old Xbox 360. I am just wondering what the cable would be if there is one. I don't want to move data, just add space for data without having
 to purchase an Xbox Slim.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>When connected via a Transfer Cable, the HDD shows up in System Settings, Memory, as a Transfer Cable storage device. You can Copy or Move files to and from the Transfer Cable device, but it cannot be used by games for storage, nor can it be used to install
 games or run DLC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There is a 250GB HDD for the original 360. A local GameStop, Micro Center, or Best Buy may have one used. If you buy a used HDD, test it to be sure an original XBOX title works with it. That's the best way to ensure it's fully functional.</p>

            <p>Hello Daver59,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows remembers the credentials for your wireless networks it means the network profile has been stored by the WLAN auto configuration service. You can delete the stored profile if you wish by following the next steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc947813(v=ws.10).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Start a Command Prompt as an Administrator</a>&nbsp;and execute the following commands</p>
<p>netsh wlan show profile</p>
<p>
</p><p>netsh wlan delete profile &lt;Profile Name&nbsp;of the network you wish to delete as shown by the previous command&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively you can delete all profiles by executing:</p>
<p>netsh wlan delete profile *</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have done this, if you wish for windows to ask for the password everytime on your device then uncheck the "Connect Automatically" option when connecting through the network through the graphical user interface.
</p>

<h3> lucvdv  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 powers off at logon screen while backup is running</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>The problem below is not specific to my situation, I have seen the exact same complaint in forum questions regarding waking up to run Windows Backup and then going to sleep again because of inactivity while backup is still running.</p>
<p>What I haven't found&nbsp;anywhere is a satisfactory answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to back up machines in a mixed OS environment, including Windows, using a single third-party backup tool (see bottom of message).</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC's are normally powered off at night, so I use Wake-on-LAN to power them up. After backup completes, the backup application triggers a script (cmd) file that suspends the PC again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This works fine on a pilot test Windows 10 Enterprise box, but only if the system is attended. If nobody logs in during the first few minutes after powering up, it will shut down (go to sleep) again, interrupting the backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have used powercfg.exe to set and verify that hibernation and standby are disabled in ALL available power profiles, yet it still goes into standby at the startup screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In days gone by (OS that MS doesn't want to know anymore), you would find power management settings on a per-user basis in the HKCU\Control Panel\PowerCfg registry key, with all settings applying to the logon screen in the ...\users\.Default branch. The
 key still exists, but there are no power management settings under control panel in the .Default branch, they only seem to exist in real user keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In HKCU\Control Panel\PowerCfg, I also see that there are <strong>six</strong> different power schemes, where the Windows 10 control panel and powercfg.exe only show three. It looks like number 3 (Always On) is the one I need, but how do you enable it under
 Windows 10, and more specifically, how do you enable it <em>for the logon screen</em>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Ref above: it's Bacula that I'm using. Yes, I'm old, but no, I'm not masochistic, I just prefer solutions that have proven their reliability for a few decades over newfangled shiny and easy to use "don't bother with complex configurations, we don't need
 that crap" stuff. Sorry, I don't trust those.</p>

            <p>Thanks, Raman, but that is the first thing I did, even before I started using powercfg.exe to examine the same settings at the command line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "put the computer to sleep" options <strong>are </strong>alle set to "never", but the login screen seems to have its own mind about that.</p>
<p>With "login screen" I mean the screen that appears at boot, where you still have to hit a key before the actual logon prompt appears.<br />
</p>
<p>Also, it puts the system to sleep after just a few minutes (the backup server logs failure 3 minutes after it sent the WakeOnLAN packet).</p>
<p>None of the settings was originally set that short.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'm now running these commands in a startup job (cmd file) when the backup starts.</p>
<p>It is executed under local system before any user logs in. Any output, including error messages, would be logged after the commands, so it appears to succeed, but the system still goes back to sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock">19-Oct 01:05 endymion3-fd JobId 54: shell command: run ClientBeforeJob ""C:/Program Files/bacula/scripts/pre-backup.cmd""</p>
</p>
</p>
</p>
</p>
</p>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a standard PC, not a laptop, so the -dc settings shouldn't be necessary, I just included them to be sure.</p>

            <p>Sorry to have to follow up to myself, but I just noticed there is a difference (and this result makes it even less comprehensible).</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I only had this in the before-job script:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The system would still go to sleep after only 3 minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After adding the next three lines, that seems to have changed to <strong>20</strong> minutes, at least for one run (it's only been tested once yet, but it
<em>still</em> failed in the middle of a backup).<br />
&nbsp;</p>
powercfg -x hibernate-timeout-dc 0<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hibernation had been disabled through "powercfg /h off" all along, but I added those last two lines in case it was still using the timeouts and falling back from hibernation to standby when they were reached.</p>

            <p>I found this, that seems to go in the right direction, but it explicitly states that it only works for the lock screen, and NOT for the power up screen:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Before I found that thread I had also done a test: set monitor timeout and standby timeout both to "never" &nbsp;in all profiles I could reach through control panel, put the machine to sleep, waited a bit, pushed the power button so it would come out of standby,
 and started a stopwatch on my phone at the same moment. The monitor was powered off after exactly 1 minute. Assuming that if one didnt work, the other would neither, I didnt wait to see if it would go back to sleep.</p>

            <p>Based on the link in my previous comment, I started searching the registry in that vicinity, and I found this.</p>
<p>Key:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Power\PowerSettings\238C9FA8-0AAD-41ED-83F4-97BE242C8F20\7bc4a2f9-d8fc-4469-b07b-33eb785aaca0<br />
[Edited: wrong key in the original version, had copied a neigboring key path by mistake]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Attributes value: 1 (apparently means "do not show in UI", 2 = "show", see eightforums link).</p>
<p>Description:&nbsp;Idle timeout before the system returns to a low power sleep state after waking unattended.</p>
<p>ValueUnits: seconds</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are values for 3 power profiles in 3 subkeys, all default to 120 seconds.</p>
<p>This is on a new Windows 10 setup I just installed. I'm not at the test machine right now, which is actually a Win7 upgraded to 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed the Attributes value to 2, and got this as a result:</p>

<p>Should I now mark my own reply as the right answer? &nbsp;;)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just two more comments:</p>
<p>1- DO NOT set the timeout value in the registry key I provided, that's just the default (for the the "restore plan defaults" button). Do set Attributes = 2 there, so the setting becomes visible in advanced power options, then change the value there.</p>
<p>2- It looks like a timeout value of 0 does not mean "Never" in this case, at least in the UI. I set it to 24 hours (1440 minutes) instead.</p>

    <title>How to change user account controls for a specific program&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jason name was taken  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to change user account controls for a specific program&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Everyone, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Briefly, I have searched through google looking for my answers and come across several possible solutions, but none seem to work. Any information on the below is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Situation:</p>
<p>We are a small business in process of switching computer systems and trying to install one of the primary desktops to run the database software. The software will be run and primarily used on this machine. The machine is a windows 8 generic desktop, so nothing
 fancy. The intention is to have 2 windows accounts on here: 1) the local admin and 2) the standard user for every day use. The standard user is the person using the database software. The catch is that this person is overly curious about pressing buttons and
 changing setting so we want them to use the standard (non-admin) account for their daily tasks. Following this, the problem we are encountering is that the specific program they would need to run for 90% of their job requires admin rights to start-up. This
 is what causes the user account control dialogue to pop up and ask for an admin password - which we don't want to provide this person.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is what I have tried so far. Please keep in mind that I know my way around computers fairly well but I'm not a wizard by any means.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) change UAC settings from admin account: </p>
<p>I changed the settings down to "never" but this doesn't take effect on the standard account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) change UAC settings from standard account: </p>
<p>I can only change this down 1 notch without "logging in as an admin" and that setting still asks for the password. I have learned that "logging in as an admin" actually means the standard user must be an admin themselves which can't be the final solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) change UAC and admin-level settings: </p>
<p>I changed the standard user to admin and then changed UAC from that account directly, and then changed the account back to standard. This doesn't work because when going back to standard, Windows resets UAC back to a higher notch above "never".
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) create admin-level scheduled task: </p>
<p>I can create a task to run as admin that has no triggers that will run the 1 application. The problem here is that the task for some reason is inconsistent. Sometimes it just doesn't run the application even if I am clicking "run" from the task scheduler
 directly. Assuming this worked, the easy next step would have been a shortcut to the task that the standard user could click on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5) compatibility changes:</p>
<p>I have tried changing the compatibility on the application file directly by rt-click, compatibility tab, run this program as administrator. Doing so adds the UAC shield symbol to the icon, as it should, but clicking on it still asks for the admin password.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6) link compatibility changes:</p>
<p>Keeping the "run as admin" from #5 I also gave the application desktop link full access rights, just to see if that changed anything. No change though.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am at a loss at this point for options. It seems as if the settings I'm provided in Windows simply fail to work properly. Any insight is highly appreciated. Please also note that this standard user cannot have admin rights. The database they need to work
 with has highly sensitive data (ssn, payment options, addresses, etc.).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I apologize at the length if this is a long post - I have never asked a question to a forum before.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Summary question:</p>
<p>I have a program that needs admin rights to run. The program needs to be run from a standard user that will never have admin rights on the desktop. The above 6 items are the solutions I found searching the internet but did not work.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Jason</p>

            <p>Hi Vijin V,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will look in the TechNet forum as well, as you suggest. The computer is isolated entirely while I install the software. At present the computer is connected only to a wifi router, just like a home network setup, with no other network connections. The accounts
 on the computer (admin and standard) are local accounts. </p>

<h3> john and melissamontgomery  say:</h3>
<h2>            icloudphotos.exe using up so much data&#63;</h2>
                    Last month our home data usage jumped from 600gb to 3500GB! After sorting thru our wifi connected devices, it was determined that my HP desktop was the one consuming all the data. So when I looked up the usage details icloudphotos app had over 3000.&nbsp; Why
 is icloudphotos.exe using up SO much data? ive tried to remove the app and had no success.&nbsp; So to temporarily disable the data consumption, I either power off my desktop or place it in Airplane mode.&nbsp; But even if i'm on it for a little while, its still on
 data consumption overload.
