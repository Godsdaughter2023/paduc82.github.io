            <p><span>Hi Ardian,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you so much for posting your query on this forum. You have reached the right place. Let us work together to find the root cause of this issue and try resolving it.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To assist you better, I would like to have some information regarding this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1) If this issue has started recently, then what are the recent changes that you have made to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>2) Do you have any third party security program installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>3) Did you try any troubleshooting methods for this issue on the computer? If yes, what are they?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to first check if the computer meets all the prerequisites for the Windows 8.1 apps to work properly on the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You need at least
<strong><em>1024 X 768</em></strong> screen resolution for Metro apps to work. The Windows apps will not work in screen resolution less than 1024 X 768. To snap apps, you need a screen resolution of at least
<strong><em>1366 x 768</em></strong>.<span>&nbsp; </span>Make sure that the screen resolution meets these requirements. You can check this by:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a) Right-click the mouse from the desktop interface and select “<strong><em>Screen Resolution</em></strong>” from the menu.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b) Check the screen resolution shown there. It should be at least
<strong><em>1024 X 768</em></strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also, make sure the User Account Control (UAC) is enabled in the computer.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To enable the User Account Control on the computer follow these steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a) Press “<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>” + “W”, type “<strong><em>Account Control</em></strong>” in the search bar and press “<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>”.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b) In the “<strong><em>User Account Control Settings</em></strong>” window, move the slider to the default settings and click “<strong><em>OK</em></strong>”.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If all these conditions are met, then try the following troubleshooting methods and let us know the result.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong><em><span>Method 1:
</span></em></strong><strong><em><span>Run the Apps Troubleshooter</span></em></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let us run the Apps Troubleshooter and check if that helps. The Apps Troubleshooter is an automated tool which we have developed to address a number of known issues that can prevent the Apps
 from running properly. This troubleshooter automatically fixes some issues, including suboptimal screen resolution, incorrect security or account settings etc. You can click on this link to download and run the Apps troubleshooter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/apps.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><em><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)"><span>Download the App Troubleshooter</span></span></em></strong></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Check the troubleshooting report and share the details with us. You may also try the suggestions given by the troubleshooter and check if that resolves the issue. If that doesn’t help, then try
 the next method.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><em><span><span>Method 2:<span>&nbsp;
</span>Clear the Store cache</span></span></em></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may try these steps to clear the Store cache and check if that helps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a) Press the “<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>” + “<strong><em>R</em></strong>” keys on the keyboard.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b) Type “<strong><em>wsreset.exe</em></strong>” and press “<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>”.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c) Reboot the computer and then check if you are able to open the Store App.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue persists, then check if this is caused by any system file corruption on the computer. Let us run an SFC Scan to check this.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><em><span><span>Method 3: Run an SFC Scan</span></span></em></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>The “<strong><em>sfc /scannow</em></strong>” command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>a) Press “<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>” + “<strong><em>X</em></strong>” keys on the keyboard and select “<strong><em>Command Prompt (Admin)</em></strong>” from that menu.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b) On the command prompt window, type the following command, and then press “<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>”</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><em><span><span>sfc /scannow</span></span></em></strong></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c) Follow the on-screen instructions and complete the scan.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>For more information, you may refer to the article given below:</span></p>

<span>Hope this resolves the issue. Please get back to us with the troubleshooting results.</span>

<h2>            Regarding an old account</h2>
                    
<span>Hello,</span>
<span>Hello,</span>
<p><span>I'd like to request some information regarding my old gamertag
<strong>Stumbling Spoon </strong></span></p>
<p><span>I created the aforementioned account two years ago on this very site, I was soon to be getting a xbox 360 and me, being young, couldn't wait. So that night I created my GT.</span></p>
<p><span>The next day, once I had hurried home and set up the console I logged into the account. My friends had told me that I would get a free one-month trial of gold. But I looked endlessly
 and could not find the option. At this point in time I didn't have a job, therefore I needed the trial in order to enjoy LIVE.</span></p>
<p><span>I ended up creating this gamertag, and I didn't intend to stay with it at first, but its grown on me, long story short this is now my permanent gamertag which I've had for almost
 three years.</span></p>
<p><span>Onto my question;</span></p>
<p><span>The "Stumbling Spoon" account was created on my WLID that I use everyday, but in order for my current 'tag to work I had to make a new WLID which I only use for xbox live. I was wondering
 how I would go about getting the account <strong>Stumbling Spoon </strong>disabled so I can switch this 'tag over to the WLID the aforementioned one had.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope that makes sense.</span></p>
<p><span>A year or two ago, I managed to direct all e-mails for THIS account to the Stumbling Spoon e-mail, the e-mail I use everyday. I still get them but I cannot register this account with
 that WLID because it's already taken by S.S</span></p>
<p><span>How do I disable the account "Stumbling Spoon" so that I can transfer this gamertag over to the e-mail that S.S once had?</span></p>
<p><span>If I can't perform such a task, I'll happily stick with the system I have now.</span></p>
<p><span>Cheers,</span></p>
<p><span>- Muffin</span></p>

<p>Change the name of the Stumbling Spoon account to something else. Then change the name of your current account from Harmonic Muffin to Stumbling Spoon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It'll cost you 1600msp though, 800msp per change.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t install .NET Framework 3.5 &#40;Windows 10, BootCamp&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hey everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run Windows 10 Pro 1709 on a 2015 Macbook Pro with BootCamp (external HDD). I cannot install .NET Framework 3.5.</p>
<p>When I tried to run a program that requires it, I got this:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8a87dcf2-c4e6-4300-804c-5cbbef7d9457?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8a87dcf2-c4e6-4300-804c-5cbbef7d9457?upload=true" /></a>I
 clicked "Install this feature", it downloaded stuff and then it prompted me to restart. After restarting, I run the program again, but I got the same pop up. Clicking "Install this feature" just prompts me to restart again. I also tried downloading it myself,
 but when I launch the installer, I get the exact same pop up; skipping installation requests me to turn windows features on/off. When I go to controll panel, I see this:<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5d31bcda-dab3-4331-a917-b737dabee52b?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5d31bcda-dab3-4331-a917-b737dabee52b?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>So the feature doesn't seem to be installed. Manually ticking it and restarting has no effect. What should I do?</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Edge Not opening in the center of the screen.</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have noticed that when you open a window, like Edge, the window keeps opening off to one side of the desktop. In Windows 7 they always opened centered on the desktop. Its not a big deal, just a little annoying. I'm used to the windows opening right
 in the center of the desktop. My iTunes always does. so do other apps. It seems to only happen with Edge. Is there a setting that can remedy this?</p>

<h2>            Pin not working</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to get into my computer (this is being typed from my tablet). It is telling me my pin is incorrect, which is a load of rubbish as its not, however I cant reset the pin. It is saying 'pin reset is in progress' and it has been telling me this for
 some time now. I also had problems trying to type in a new pin, it would now add any letters to the box until I ticked the 'add character and numbers box'. I need advice on what to do from my computer, not my tablet. Its no good telling me go to accounts if
 I cant actually get my pc to open up. What the hell do I do now?</p>

            Hi HelenClarence
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>
<br />
<br />How to Boot from a USB Flash Drive in Windows 10 - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>
<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

I did not clarify all of my problem. First I did install Windows 8 Pro update on a brand new hard drive. To no avail when I went to search in windows 8 and typed in snipping tool, it show that the snipping tool is not there, so I have no idea how to get the
 tool to show up anywhere?

    <title>EA Sucks Rant - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> irritatedflea8  say:</h3>
<h2>            EA Sucks Rant</h2>
                    
<p>S*rew&nbsp;EA and their Origin account with their crappy dedicated servers that last a year or two until they’re shutdown. S*rew every game with EA in the lower right hand corner of the box.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>EA pick fights with every company they consider a competitor and instead of doing their own thing; only make themselves out to be a joke. They bash Activision for yearly releases and how CoD sucks (which I might agree), but here they are a year after Battlefield
 3’s release with a new Medal of Honor: Warfighter. S*rew EA, their employees, and everything they touch. &nbsp;/rant</p>

<p>I’m for the most part pissed off at what happened to the Mass Effect series and all of the extra crap there is to buy, but I am also ticked that Battlefield 3 no longer has destruction like before and Medal of Honor: Warfighter is about to come out and make
 it obsolete. That’s two games that were supposed to be huge that I now hate, hate, hate them for. All of their other crap such as online passes, Origin account, and dropped servers on older games just adds flame to the fire. I’m just done with this company
 finally and will never buy another product with EA in the bottom right hand corner.</p>

<p>Personally, I'm talking about the actual games. ME1 was good. Since EA got involved, they have steadily &amp; sharply gone down the toilet. The same goes for DAO to DA2 (which may have been an even bigger flush down the crapper). Even once great series' that
 EA themselves started have gone southward. They just keep making the same couple of games over &amp; over, only dumbing them down with each instalment... Or they take over other developer's games and dumb them down.</p>

<p>I don't know if I'd say they pick fights with other developers, but they definitely try to make things difficult for them, rather than simply trying to make their own games better. The first thing that comes to my mind was how they gobbled up all rights
 to NFL properties... Team names, colors, etc, etc. This mean they are effectively the only developer that can create an NFL game. Madden sucks, and has pretty much always played second fiddle to it's competition (at least gameplay-wise). The NFL 2K series
 was much better, as was Gameday, and even way back in the day, Joe Montana Sportstalk Football. But rather than up their own game, EA decided it would simply be easier to&nbsp;kick their opponents out of the game. EA has become big not by being good, but by playing
 dirty.Honestly, I might not mind a little dirty play (just a little)&nbsp;if they themselves were any good. They're not.</p>

<h2>            League of Legends for consoles... a possibility, or just stupid&#63; </h2>
                    
<p>SO over the past couple of days i tried league of legends out after watching a review for it, and i do say i am hooked on it. The same is simple enough but a lot of strategy is involved. It seems to me that the game itself would be easy to port of to Consoles,
 gameplay wise at least. And honestly PC is fine how it is, but what do others think?&nbsp; Do you think&nbsp; L.o.L. could translate well onto consoles? And if so, would you maybe like to see L.o.L. on consoles, this gen or next gen?</p>

<p>Or if you think i am stupid for discussing this topic, go ahead, it wont hurt my feelings at all .

<p>I don't think you're stupid...I'm hooked on it too. But It wouldn't work because there's to many keys. Plus, it's a FREE game...so if it went to consoles it'd end up being $20 or more. &nbsp;Also, it's like 16GB and the updates every week are like 100-200MB,
 eventually our console would run out of memory. They'd have to make the game on a disc in order to save space for our consoles.</p>

<p>Dont see why it could not come to xbox. it maybe free to play but i already spend a 100 bucks on it (runepages skins) so there is a lot of mony to be made and to many keys? just hold trigger and asign new commands to your buttons you can do this 2 times
 so that should cover it.having said that it is never going to happen though.</p>

<p>Yes memory would be an issue, and prety much only those with 250 gig HD's would even begin to think of getting it. But, with the Free to PLay, if it were made into a digital download, you pay say 5 bucks for it, and that gives you a starter pack as well
 (Just got one from walmart about 30 mins ago)</p>
<p>And the number of buttons can be a trivia issues, IF it was done properly. Heck, right now i am not using all that many commands on the PC, maybe as i get better i will be using more. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Honestly, i just want some Xbox Live achievements and Xbox Live chat, and party system for LoL. AND I KNOW about vent, and all that. But it isnt the same really.</p>

<p>^^</p>
<p>Leagues is all about chat. But the chat only evolves around game related. It's supposed to be game related chat anyways.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Also, speaking of starter packs, people would have to pay money and stuff to buy the characters they want. Because I know Microsoft won't publish it if they can't make some sort of money off of it, and IP points can just be accumulated to buy characters
 instead of paying actual money.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Basically, it's going to be hard for this game to be actually "free." Kind of sad. It would be a great game for console, but I just don't think it'd work out.</p>

<p>Two things:</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure the creators said it will never come to console or something like that( Need to dig up my Gameinformer to double check.)</p>
<p>The free to play model that hte game adopts wouldn't work on Xbox because you need Gold to play games online.</p>

    <title>How do I name my Wordpad document&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I name my Wordpad document&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I just copied and pasted a story from Notepad to Wordpad and I want to know how to name it? Or is it named the same thing it was in Notepad? Which is fine with me btw. I had tried to access it through Adobe Reader because it said it was that kind of document,
 but Adobe said it had been damaged or corrupted by sending it in an email without decoding it. That's just great because it was a story I entered into a contest three years ago-no wonder I never heard anything back from them!! Anyway I found it in Notepad,
 and copied and pasted it to Wordpad and I need to know how to name it so I can find it again. Thank you.</p>

            Hi Kelly.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year WIndows MVP here to help you.
<br />
<br />When you go to Save the file on the File tab, the File Name box should be highlighted ready for you to type in the name.    Then select the location where you want it saved in the File Explorer bar at upper left, and click on Save.  Then you can always find the file in that location even if you change word processing apps later.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community. Your interest in Windows 10 is much appreciated.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you have any antivirus program installed?</li></ul>
<p>I suggest you to try to manually reset the Windows Updates Components and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Please follow the below steps to reset the Windows Updates Components:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1.Press Windows Key + X on the keyboard and then select “Command Prompt (Admin)” from the menu.</p>
<p>2.Stop the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the<span>&nbsp; </span>Windows Update Services. To do this, type the following commands at a command prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>net stop wuauserv</strong></li><li><strong>net stop cryptSvc</strong></li><li><strong>net stop bits</strong></li><li><strong>net stop msiserver</strong></li></ul>
<p>3. Now rename the SoftwareDistribution and<span>&nbsp; </span>Catroot2 folder. You can do this by typing the following commands in the Command Prompt. Press the “ENTER” key after you type each command.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old</strong></p>
<p><strong>ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Now, let’s restart the BITS, Cryptographic, MSI Installer and the Windows Update Services. Type the following commands in the Command Prompt for this. Press the ENTER key after you type each command.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>net start wuauserv</strong></li><li><strong>net start cryptSvc</strong></li><li><strong>net start bits </strong></li><li><strong>net start msiserver</strong></li></ul>
<p>5. Type Exit in the Command Prompt to close it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now you may try running the Windows Updates and check if the above steps resolve the issue.</p>
<p>For further reference, you can refer to the link:</p>

            <p>These instruction do about the same as the Control panel troubleshoot problems with update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem seems to be the drivers in this update are from 2009 and almost anybody with windows 8 or higher would have already a newer version installed causing the failure to install the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why this problem was not already fix I don't know but it was in the insider preview also about version 10152 I think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would just ignore it unless you are having trouble with the printer. Sooner or later MS will notice the error reports and fix the issue.</p>

            <p>Can't help you with the purchases issue, but I have resolved my repeated Windows Update failure.</p>
<p>Right click on the start button and select "Device Manager".</p>
<p>Open the folder called "Printers".&nbsp; At the bottom of the list of my&nbsp;printers there was an&nbsp;"Unknown Printer".</p>
<p>I uninstalled the "Unknown Printer" and the problem was solved.</p>
<p>I've tested my "all-in-one" printers and they&nbsp;both still work as before (i.e. they print, copy and scan).</p>
<p>Hope your configuration is similar to mine and you find this useful.</p>
<p>Good Luck with the "Purchases" issue. </p>

            l found that when l downloaded the Java link and version that was on the ISC website, the program started to work properly. l also updated the Java program to the most recent release as well so there are two versions on my computer. There never was a issue
 with downloading the program itself. only getting it to run from the Icon on my desktop. lt would open a window as normal, flash after a second and then disappear totally. lf l launched the program from the end of the install exe run, it would start and run
 like normal.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps future windows 7 users.

<h2>            cnext.exe cannot find MSVCP120.dll after Windows 8.1 Update</h2>
                    <p>I recently updated my computer with Windows Update, as well as updated my AMD drivers, and now whenever I start windows and go to the desktop I get a pop-up that says cnext.exe cannot start because it cannot find MSVCP120.dll.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far, I have not had any other issues, (other then it possibly being a bit slower and clunkier then usual, but this computer has never been especially fast) though I have been intentionally trying to avoid using any unnecessary applications until I figure
 out why this is happening, and whether or not it's a serious issue.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The msvcp120.dll is one of the dynamic link libraries from Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable and is necessary for many modern games and programs to run.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffixpcnyc.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2fmsvcp120-dll-file-properties.png" height="516" width="419" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>The file is usually located in Windows’ <em>System32</em> and/or <em>SysWOW64</em> folders. The right and working way to download msvcp120.dll is to visit Microsoft’s website, get Visual С++ 2013 Redistributable from
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40784" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffixpcnyc.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2fdownload-msvcp120-dll-microsoft.png" height="189" width="571" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Right after installation, the file will be copied to the right folders on your computer and registered within the operating system. So, you don’t have to search standalone downloads of this file for Windows 8 or 7 to fix msvcp120.dll is missing error.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ffixpcnyc.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2fmsvcp120-dll-windows-8.png" height="264" width="792" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>In some cases the game or program that don’t run may need the msvcp120.dll in its root o “bin” folder, so if the error isn’t fixed, try to copy (not move) the file from your Windows\System32 there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

 I'm not able to connect with windows 10 creator's update. I was connected a few times before I updated to creators update, but I'm not sure this update was the borderline or not.</p>

<p>There's username and password too.</p>

</p><p>If I add the network from the old Network and sharing place, it's work, but if I add from the new place, 'Settings' app, it won't work. It seems it doesn't set anything. Also I can't find where can I edit the known networks. And the biggest problem, everywhere
 it opens this new useless app.</p>

<h2>            Skype Name During Setup - WE NEED OPTIONS</h2>
                    <p>We need some options during setup. Skype created some weird amalgamation with part of my name and part of my e-mail. My name is available so I don't know why I wasn't given the option of choosing something more appropriate since this will be on my business
 card.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Possible Options:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>my personal name as my Skype Name</p>
<p>my nickname</p>
<p>my email address</p>
<p>some random collection of letters and numbers that I choose</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Due to the migration of Skype and Microsoft last October 2016, customizing Skype name is no longer available. You only have two options to create an account, via email address or mobile number and you'll be given a system generated Skype name.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have any further questions or clarifications.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 Update Freezing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> chicgeek02  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Update Freezing</h2>
                    I used to have the Windows 7 beta. While using it, it constantly gave pointer errors and blue screened after 2-3 min of use.
<br />
So as soon as it was released, naturally I re-installed it on the laptop. After I installed it, it keeps freezing after about 5-10 min of use for about 15-30 seconds each. While I find this completely annoying it is bearable.
<br />
Yesterday there was an updated needed to be installed. It kept freezing so a shut-down was impossible. But after awhile I was about to shut down so that the installation of the update could be installed.<br />
<br />
My problem is that this was around 8:00 PM last night. I woke up this morning, it was still installing 1 of 2 updates. Now, being 11:15, it is still at 1 of 2 updates with no progress being made it looks like.<br />
<br />
I'm afraid to force shut it down in this process and loosing my data on the computer. Is there anything that can be done, or corrected for this problem?

<p>Hey ChicGeek02,</p>
<p>In this scenario, since Windows is not getting past the screen “Installing 1 of 2 updates..”, there’s no point in waiting for it to complete. Instead, restart the computer and get into Windows Recovery Options so that we can use the various tools available
 to troubleshoot.</p>
<p>To open the System Recovery Options menu on your computer</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Remove all floppy disks, CDs, and DVDs from your computer, and then restart your computer using the computer's power button.
<br />
2.&nbsp;Do one of the following:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o If your computer has a single operating system installed, press and hold the F8 key as your computer restarts. You need to press F8 before the Windows logo appears. If the Windows logo appears, you need to try again by waiting until the Windows logon
 prompt appears, and then shutting down and restarting your computer.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; o If your computer has more than one operating system, use the arrow keys to highlight the operating system you want to repair, and then press and hold F8.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;On the Advanced Boot Options screen, use the arrow keys to highlight Repair your computer, and then press Enter. (If Repair your computer isn't listed as an option, then your computer doesn't include preinstalled recovery options, or your network administrator
 has turned them off).<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;Select a keyboard layout, and then click Next.<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp;On the System Recovery Options menu, click on System Restore to open it. This restores your computer's system files to an earlier point in time without affecting your files, such as e mail, documents, or photos.</p>
<p>Note: If you use System Restore from the System Recovery Options menu, you cannot undo the restore operation. However, you can run System Restore again and choose a different restore point, if one exists.</p>
<p>For other ways of accessing System Recovery Options and for more information on the tools available, check this article.</p>
<p><strong>What are the system recovery options in Windows 7?<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7</strong></a></p>
<p>Now when you install the updates, please turn off Automatic Updates. Instead, install one update at a time. This will help in figuring out which updating caused this.<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;Open Windows Update by clicking the Start button. In the search box, type Update, and then, in the list of results, click Windows Update.
<br />
2.&nbsp;In the left pane, click Change settings.<br />
3.&nbsp;Select “Check for updates but let me choose whether to download and install them”.<br />
4.&nbsp;Click OK.<br />
Now from the list of updates, check one update at a time to download and install. Note down the KB article number so that we know for sure which update is causing your PC to crash.<br />

<p>Coming to the computer freeze issue, it could be attributed to various factors, one of which bad drivers. Getting correct drivers generally fixes this issue. Please check if you have any conflicting drivers installed. This can be done from device manager.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Open Device Manager by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, and then clicking Device Manager. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;See if there’s any warning or error message associated with your device.<br />

<p>I was looking at a game that said 4.99, for sale, on the xbox 360 (dark souls.)</p>
<p>When I went to buy it, it said 19.99 suddenly. This puzzled me, so I went here.</p>
<p>Upon going here, when logging in on this site it brings me to</p>

<p>Xbox gold membership, annual, 59.99</p>

<p>So I assumed mine had ran out, then clicked it. However, I look in past transactions</p>
<p>and I paid 59.99 in MAY, of 2013. It said that would run out in JUNE, of 2014. Yet I had</p>
<p>to pay 59.99 NOW?</p>

<p>Why Was I charged 59.99 again?</p>
<p>How do I get a refund?</p>

<p>Yesterday would have been the last day for the sale on that game. So you may have caught the site at a time when it was just changing prices.
</p>
<p>If you were charged for another 12 months, you would need to contact support and speak to billnig. 1-800-4my-xbox</p>
