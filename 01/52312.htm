            Hi hassanyunus
<br />
<br />Most manufacturers have a utility installed on the PC that controls whether the function keys are in Media mode or normal Mode
<br />
<br />What is the Make and exact Model No. of your PC - that will be printed on a sticker on the bottom casing . . .

<h2>            Why does my computer need a password to log on&#63; Was not needed before.</h2>
                    My monitor would not come on after hitting the space bar. The PC was in sleep mode, so when I move the mouse or hit any key the monitor and PC will come out of sleep. But not this time. I rebooted my PC and a new (different, never seen it before) opening
 page appeared. To the left was instruction to click on my user name. To the right was HP_ Administrator. I clicked on that and a password window opened. I have never set up a password so I just hit enter. I was prompted for a password again. Message was "Forgot
 your password?", type your password again. &nbsp;I typed admin, but that didn't work. I tried several passwords I use for web access and forums, etc. but got no where at all. Several reboots, still the same new opening page and request for a password. Prior to
 this, my PC would just open to my desk top, now I get this new blue sheet needing a password.

<h2>            Banned for Harassment while already on a communication suspension</h2>
                    <p>So yesterday i was given a communication suspension for 14 days, fine. I was not able to message anyone, couldn't talk in game chat or in party chat on my mic. Fine. 1 day goes by. Today i try signing into my account and it says i have a permanent ban. I went online to see what the issue was, and apparently i was given a permanent ban for "harassment and abuse". How can i abuse or harass anyone while i'm on a communication ban ?&nbsp;There's literally no way for me to even talk to anyone, this makes no sense and is absolutely ridiculous. It's literally not even possible for me to harass anyone at this point, please microsoft do something about this.</p><p><br /></p><p>The worst part isn't even the ban. All my games were downloaded digitally and i've spent over a thousand dollars on my library. I have lost access to all of them now. Anytime i try and load a game up it says "the person who purchased this needs to sign in" but since that account was randomly banned i can't even load up my

            My recommendation would be to speak to your credit card company and report the fraud to them. They can prevent further purchases from going through as well as have the charges credited back to you. They have procedures in place for this happening. They
 will probably have new cards issued to you to prevent further charges.

<p>Sorry to hear you having these problems with your roblox account.</p>
<p>Before you do anything, please contact your card provider and report the suspicious activity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*Please note if your card provider cancels the payments made to the service or requests the money back on your behalf, you may be banned from the service since it may be against the services policy*</p>
<p>
</p><p>Change all your account details as you may of had your details stolen.</p>
<p>You can see your accounts activity at: &nbsp;<a href="https://account.microsoft.com/devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://account.microsoft.com/devices/</a></p>
<p>The devices listed will be all the devices your account is logged in on. If you see any suspicious devices please remove them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since most digital content has a 14 day refund policy, I don't think you will get very far but I wish you luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope you get this sorted.</p>
<p>Good luck with getting your money back.</p>

<p>Hey there Brianne!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this issue and have had charges made to your account.
</p>
<p>Since you suspect that some has hacked your account to make these purchases, I think it's best for you to go ahead and secure your account first off by following the steps that we have outlined in our support article entitled "<a href="https://support.xbox.com/my-account/security/compromised-account-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">I
 think my account has been hacked</a>" so that you can try and stop that. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Because customer support cannot make any refunds any longer (refund requests now are processed by separate and internally trained team) I would say it's best to go ahead and make refund requests for this incident at
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/billing/xbox-subscriptions/digital-goods-subscriptions-refund" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Request an Xbox digital product or subscription refund</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Although as I explained, customer service cannot help you with any refunds directly, you can always contact them if you'd like for further&nbsp;assistance&nbsp;by following these steps at
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/contact-us</a></p>

<h2>            how long does it take for windows 10 to downgrade to 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Yesterday I began the downgrade from windows 10 to 8.1, and it's been doing all of yesterday and last night. I woke up this morning, and its still downgrading.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really can't see my laptop screen, because it's cracked so my laptop is plugged up to my tv, but usually once an update is done, it pops up on my tv so I can see what I have to do, but during the process of upgrading / downgrading, I can't see the
</p>
<p>screen.&nbsp;&nbsp;(also my laptop turned on twice because it died) so idk if it restart or anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to know if there is possibly something that is have to click during the downgrade that I can't see, or if it just takes a long time. Please answer it fast, I have homework that I need to get done, but I can't see my screen. Thank you.</p>

<p>Hey there GalorePort53806.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have run your code through the code-database and it has come back with the following below. My advice would be to act upon this as soon as possible and follow each solution carefully!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Error code and message
<div>
<p>Error code 8015D02E contains the following message:</p>
<blockquote><b>This profile cannot be downloaded right now.</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Status code: 8015D02E</b></blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<div>
Problem
<div>
<p>If you get this message and error code, it may mean that your Microsoft account is blocked or has been compromised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<div>
Solutions
<div>
<p>To resolve this problem, try the following solutions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Solution 1: Confirm that your Xbox LIVE account has not been compromised</b></p>
<p>To confirm that your Xbox LIVE account hasn’t been compromised, see <a href="http://www.xbox.com/Live/Account-Security/What-To-Do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
What to do if your Xbox LIVE account has been stolen</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Solution 2: Make sure you’re using the right Microsoft account</b></p>
<p>If you have more than one Microsoft account, make sure that you use the right one — the one that was used to create your Xbox LIVE account. If you have forgotten it, see
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/manage-microsoft-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Manage your Microsoft account</a>.</p>
<p><b>Note</b> If the Xbox LIVE account is a child account, make sure that you enter the child's Microsoft account.</p>
<p>If you still experience the problem, try the next solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Solution 3: Check your Microsoft account on Xbox.com</b></p>
<p>To make sure that the Microsoft account you’re using is the right one, try signing in to Xbox.com by using the same Microsoft account that you’re trying to use on your console. If there’s a problem with that Microsoft account, you’ll be prompted to correct
 it.</p>
<p>If you’re signed in with the wrong gamertag or if you’re prompted to create a new Microsoft account, you’re likely to be using the wrong Microsoft account.</p>
<p>If you still experience the problem, try the next solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Solution 4: For a child’s account, use the Microsoft account</b></p>
<p>If the Xbox LIVE account is a child's account, make sure you enter your child's Microsoft account. You must use the Microsoft account that was used to create the account.</p>
<p>If your child's Microsoft account was automatically created as part of a Family Account setup and you try to reset the password, an email is sent to the parent’s Microsoft account (the Xbox LIVE family primary account). Follow the instructions in that email
 to reset the child's account's password.</p>
<p>If you only want to download the account profile, use the Download Profile feature when you’re signed in with the Xbox LIVE family primary account.</p>
<p>If you still experience the problem, try the next solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Solution 5: Reset your Microsoft account password</b></p>
<p>If you can’t remember your Microsoft account password, see <a href="https://account.live.com/ResetPassword.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Reset your password</a>.</p>
<p>If you still experience the problem, try the next solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Solution 6: Go to Windows support</b></p>
<p>If you still experience the problem after trying the previous solutions, go to
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Support</a>.</p>
<p>(Xbox Support can’t help with this issue.)</p>

<p>Are you sure you're typing all the letters correctly? Look closely at B and 8, G and 6, etc.&nbsp; Product keys do not contain 1, I, O, or 0.<br />
<br />
Are you using the correct Windows 7 key? A key for XP or Vista will not work with Windows 7 - if there is a XP/Vista key on your computer it will not work with Windows 7. A Home Premium key will not work with Ultimate, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Can't Activate Office With Windows Key:</strong> <br />
Are you using the Windows 7 key that's on your computer/DVD case to activate Office? That will not work to activate Office - only an Office key will activate Office. Many new computers come with a trial of Office, but after X days or X uses it goes to reduced
 functionality mode unless you buy it. To continue using it beyond the trial period, you'll need to purchase a Microsoft Office license. Or if you're trying to activate a trial version of Office you'll need the correct trial key. If you need to buy a key for
 Office:<br />

<p><strong>Try Calling Microsoft Using Manual Phone Activation</strong> <br />
If you have trouble activating Windows 7 you can call Microsoft to activate by doing the following:<br />
1. With Windows running click Start, then in the Search box type:&nbsp; slui.exe 4<br />
2. Press Enter on your Keyboard <br />
3. Select your Country. <br />
4. Select the Phone Activation option, then call the number given and hold for a real person.<br />

<p>Note: if you are still installing Windows and at the Enter Your Product Key page, do not enter your key and uncheck "Automatically Activate When Online" then click OK/Next to finish the installation.<br />

<p>Hi Kenneth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The said error code has something to do with the latest update in the game. It's possible that you haven't installed it yet on your computer. If you install the game from Microsoft Store, I recommend that you open the Microsoft Store app and check the "Get
 Updates" section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also refer to the solution provided by&nbsp;<strong>Larry Meilack</strong> on this

<p>You tried every password you could think of?&nbsp; Do you recall changing your password recently?&nbsp; If so, that is the password!&nbsp; If not, you do understand that the password is CASE SENSITIVE, correct?&nbsp; Are you really entering the correct password?</p>

<p>You have just learnt the hard way why you should NOT run Windows 7 with only ONE user.</p>
<p>As your netbook doesn't have an optical disk drive then your only real easy way (assuming you don't have access to a USB optical disk drive) would&nbsp; be to re-install Windows. Which also begs the question - How did your vendor provide for you to re-install
 Windows? A recovery DVD perhaps? Look in the documentation - you <em>may</em> be lucky in that it's a hidden partition.</p>
<p>If it's a Recovery disk then I suggest you IMMEDIATELY buy an external USB DVD/RW drive. They aren't expensive.</p>
<p>When you've re-installed Windows, <strong>READ THIS:</strong></p>
In Windows 7, the built-in Administrator account is disabled by default and although it is possible to enable it, that process may be beyond what you feel comfortable with.<br />
WHEN, and not IF,you have problems accessing your ONE user account, you will have tremendous difficulty if you only have ONE use account, as you have discovered.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You need to forget anything to do with XP, and create a User Account with Administrator privileges, (call it Admin or similar) and give it a password. Keep this account for emergency access and for elevation purposes. Then change your User account to a Standard
 User account.(There is absolutely no need to run as an administrator on a daily basis in Windows 7 - Windows 7 has the "right-click-run as administrator" function for when you need admin privileges). You will be much safer and better protected doing this.

<p>1- Is your thai language installed in your PC ? you can find out by clicking at the language icon of the toolbar.</p>
<p>- If not, right click the language icon and click settings, click add , in the input language locate thai , select it and click Ok.</p>
<p>You may be asked to insert your Windows CD in your drive. Insert the CD and wait to download the necessary files.</p>
<p>Good Luck</p>

            Hi Folks,
<div><br />
<div>I have exactly the same problem, but no CD. Most PCs do not come with cds these days - as Windows is preinstalled. I have done all the Windows Genuine Advantage stuff and MSN is happy. Surely these files are available on line from one of the MSN support
 sites?? Thanks in advance.</div>

Hi,<br />
Considering the age of the thread and to avoid confusion, if the troubleshooting steps in this thread did not resolve your issue I would recommend creating a new thread so that the community can focus on that thread. Refer to the following link prior to posting
 a question so that you may provide all the relevant information, for us to help you:</p>

            Incredibly unhelpful! All the information necessary is already in this thread. and it is clearly a common problem. All I need is the Thai software that normally resides on the CD which the microsoft system demands exactly as per the thread. Does microsoft
 not believe in "Cloud Technology?" or are we all still limited to CDs?&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Ernie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>We&nbsp;realize the inconvenience you are experiencing with not able to delete files from mp3 player using Windows Media player.&nbsp;We will certainly help you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This issue might occur when the Mp3 file is broken or when it is not compatible with the Windows Media Player or other media players.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Firstly, I would suggest you to&nbsp;open Media player and try to refresh the device and try deleting the songs.
</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> Run Windows Media Player Troubleshooter.</p>
<p>I suggest you to run Windows Media Player Troubleshooter. Follow the below steps to run Windows Media Player:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press&nbsp;<strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>X</strong>&nbsp;and select&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel</strong>.</li><li>In the search box, type&nbsp;<strong>troubleshooter</strong>,&nbsp;and then click&nbsp;<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</li><li>Click&nbsp;<strong>View all</strong>,&nbsp;and then click&nbsp;<strong>Windows Media Player Settings</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>If the issue persists then follow the below method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>For information about how to reset your device, see the documentation that came with your device.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2:</strong> If the&nbsp;above steps do not help,&nbsp;you may try to delete music files directly from the mp3 player, follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>To delete music files using the computer, follow these steps:<br />
1. Connect your mp3 player to the computer.<br />
2. Select Open device to view files using Windows Explorer on initial connection.<br />
3. Locate the folder where your music files are stored.<br />
4. Right click and select delete the music files or folder.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results. We will be happy to assist you further.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>In your last email you told me to reinstall Windows media player. You said:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Follow the below steps:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>Press <strong>Windows</strong> + <strong>R</strong> keys. </li><li>In the Run dialogue box, type <strong>appwiz.cpl </strong>and click <strong>OK</strong>.
</li><li>On the left pane click<strong> Turn Windows&nbsp;features on or off.</strong> </li><li>Locate<strong> Windows media player</strong>, and&nbsp;uncheck the box. </li><li>Click on<strong> OK</strong> and<strong> restart </strong>the&nbsp;computer<strong>.</strong></li></ul>
<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: Turning <strong>Off Windows Media Player</strong> might
<strong>affect </strong>other Windows features and programs installed on the computer, including default settings."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm afraid if I do this I will no longer be able to play my music on the computer. &nbsp;Please clarify, how will disconnecting the windows media player get reinstalled by the instructions given above. &nbsp;It looks to me like I will simply be disabling windows media
 player, period. Do you then want me to go online and reinstall it from the microsoft download?</p>

            <p>Hello Ernie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my last response i have provided two steps that is to run the&nbsp;troubleshooter and to delete to directly delete the music folder. I haven't provide any reinstallation of Windows Media Player.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon further checking i see that you have created two similar issues and thus you are receiving multi responses from our side with different troubleshooting steps. We kindly request you not to create multiple duplicate threads as it may create confusion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your response. Getting others involved has more to do with my unfamiliarity with MS Community than multiple entries.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did what you requested via the trouble shooter and tried deleting files but not all files would be deleted. &nbsp;Also the problem with my library is not the music in it as I can remove and add music files and that works alright. &nbsp;The problem appears to be
 the podcasts in my playlist. &nbsp;I seem to have multiple copies of the same podcasts. &nbsp;I am in the process of clearing these out. &nbsp;That might have prevented me from downloading podcasts that were already in the mp3 player. &nbsp;In any case I was able to do a work
 around for now and will continue to monitor the situation with future downloads and to continue clearing out podcasts programs before I download podcasts from the same program in future.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your help for now. I may get back down the road if I run into further roadblocks.</p>

<p>Hello Michel Rodriguez aguilar,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers Forum.</p>
<p>You might want to be sure you have the most current software from Sandisk for Windows 7.</p>
<p>Click <a href="http://kb.sandisk.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/3682/kw/U3 windows 7/r_id/101834" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here for a link</a> to the download from Sandisk. The latest U3 Launchpad is version 1.6.3.9. This should help to get the software installed. If not, I recommend you to contact Sandisk for further support. Click

<h3> disgruntledwindows7user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 on Windows 7 without SP1&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've tried for months to upgrade my Windows 7 installation to SP1, but it just won't seem to work! It installs successfully in Windows Update and tells me that I need to restart for the changes to take effect, but when I do the update says it failed with
 the error(80242016). I've given up all hope, is there a way to get Windows 10 without SP1?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a ton.</p>

            <p>If you have a software program called Driver Booster installed, that might be the culprit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press Windows key + X</p>
<p>Click Programs and Features</p>
<p>Look for Driver Booster through the list, select it, then click Uninstall on the Command Bar</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, press Windows key + X</p>
<p>Click Task Manager</p>
<p>Click the Startup tab then look for any entries for Driver Booster, select it then click Disable.</p>

            <p>Andre;</p>
<p>Thank you for the Driver Booster info.</p>
<p>Although I did not find any listing of Driver Booster, I did find DriverSetuputility was installed.</p>
<p>I used Revo to uninstall it and all connecting files. ( C:\Program Files\DriverSetuputility )</p>

            <p>I have used a Program called DriverUpdate for a few years, Vista thru Windows 7 and started in Windows 10 using it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never noticed anything like Windows 10 console windows though.</p>
