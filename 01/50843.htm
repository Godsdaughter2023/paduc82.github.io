<h2>            Endless Scrolling Problems with Arc Bluetooth Mouse in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I am having endless problems with the scroll function on my Arc Bluetooth mouse (no problems with the Surface Bluetooth keyboard, BTW). I've looked at all of the solutions and none seems to be permanent.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best offered seems to be shutting off Bluetooth support in the operating system and then turning it back on. But that, of course, entails having a USB or hardwired mouse handy to turn Bluetooth back on (ugh!!!). Alternately, I can reboot the PC, but
 that's really a poor solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There has got to be a better solution. I have been using Microsoft mice and keyboards for decades and this is the single most confounding device I've ever used. And, the pat Microsoft responses to this issue (which others have encountered quite a bit) are
 simply not acceptable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When is this problem going to be addressed directly by Microsoft?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm very close to the point of returning the mouse for a refund (though I like it's functionality when it is working). This is an expensive mouse (as mice go).
</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To troubleshoot you concern, we recommend that you check this article: <strong>
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/support/troubleshooting/mouse/wireless-bluetooth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Troubleshooting: Mice</a></strong> and refer to
<strong>Add a program to the scrolling assistance list section</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We'd also want to verify if you have tried to update the drivers for your device. To check for the latest drivers, click
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/d/arc-mouse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it went.</p>

            <p>And, there it is ... the "pat" Microsoft response I was expecting, addressing absolutely ZERO in my post. Have I turned Bluetooth off and on? Yes; see above. Is my computer compatible with an Arc Mouse? Yes; see above. Ad nauseum... The best "solution" to
 this issue, for those who may be experiencing it, is simply to flatten the mouse and restart it. That works for a while anyway, and is of minimal fuss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just what is the point of this forum if the Moderators are paid only to direct people to previously published material, however irrelevant it may be to the issue at hand? How do I get a job at Microsoft? Sounds like a great place to be a "support" specialist
 if all you do is redirect customers to useless information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, and by the way, another issue with this mouse is that it simply will not wake the computer from sleep, regardless of what I do. And, yes, I've read all of Microsoft's generic posts on that too.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, again I ask, when is Microsoft going to issue proper drivers so that their Bluetooth devices work correctly in Windows 10?</p>

<h2>            Touch pad and fingerprint scanner do not respond, even though they should be both on.</h2>
                    Touch pad and fingerprint scanner suddenly stopped working, even though in the settings they are both on and shouldn't have any problems. The pointer is still on the display, but invisible (I can only see its position when I press ctrl) and doesn't respond
 to any touch or click. I've tried restarting the computer many times, but nothing changed. The only way to make the pointer work is by connecting another mouse via USB, but even though it responds to the external device it still doesn't react to the touch
 pad. Does anyone have any idea how to solve this problem?

            What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Human Interface Device
<br />Right click HID Compliant touch pad
<br />
<br />Click uninstall then restart your computer.
<br />
<br />As for the finger print reader.
<br />
<br />Give these a try:
<br />
<br />1. Reset Facial Recognition and/or Fingerprint Options
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + I to open Settings.
<br />Click Accounts and select Sign-In options.
<br />Locate Fingerprint or Facial Recognition options and click Remove under them.
<br />After that, click Get Started and follow the on-screen instructions to reset Fingerprint and Facial Recognition.
<br />Reboot your PC if needed.
<br />
<br />2. Modify Group Policy Settings
<br />
<br />Creators Update might have modified some of the crucial settings of Group Policy. Therefore, we would recommend to launch the Group Policy Editor and check/edit the settings related to Windows Hello functionality.
<br />
<br />Pres Windows key, type gpedit, and press Enter.
<br />Click on Computer Configuration and open Administrative Templates.
<br />Select Windows Components and open Biometrics.
<br />Click on Facial Features and right-click on Configure enhanced anti-spoofing option.
<br />Select Edit and disable the Configure enhanced anti-spoofing feature.
<br />Reboot your PC.
<br />
<br />3. Update drivers
<br />
<br />If some of the system drivers, most probably webcam and fingerprint reader drivers, were corrupted during the upgrade process, Windows Hello may fail to perform. To fix that, try to update the corresponding drivers:
<br />
<br />Right-click on Windows key and select Device Manager.
<br />Locate the Hello, webcam, and fingerprint drivers individually and right-click on each of them.
<br />Select Remove driver software and wait for the removal to be finished.
<br />Repeat the removal with all Windows Hello related drivers and then reboot your PC.
<br />Once done, open Device Manager, click Action -&gt; Scan for hardware changes.
<br />The system should automatically detect and reinstall the drivers.

            Hi Ella.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Right click Start to open Device Manager, choose Mice and other Pointing Devices, then the touchpad, right click to Uninstall.  Use your external mouse to restart PC to reinstall the driver.  
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help or the touchpad is not named in Dev Mgr, go to the PC's Support Downloads webpage to download and install the touchpad driver.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi again Ella.   
<br />
<br />Does you model PC have a touchpad switch?  You can ask google for that specific model.  
<br />
<br />If not then  What I would do if you haven't yet is manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by installing Media Creation Tool and choosing to Upgrade Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  
<br />
<br />This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have - like with buggy Windows Updates which are the last place I'd get the new version from.    
<br />
<br />You can use the same tool to download the ISO or create bootable media so you only need to do it once, and have the bootable media for repairs or possible Clean Install.   
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during the Upgrade see these steps to optimize the install as this is evidence it's corrupted: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />You can also go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that a factory or Upgrade install are inferior installs that most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  Most prefer to do the gold standard Clean install from this link which has had no reported issues:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

<p>
</p><p>I am wondering whether I can safely delete "SurfacePro4 Update 17_018_01 (64 bit)" that occupies 1.56 GB of my disk space. It was installed on May 2017. My Surface Pro4 has been already updated to Windows 10 Pro 1809 last month. Or should I still keep that
 update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your help!</p>

<p>As the title indicates, I'm wondering if it's possible to use an old Xbox 360 hard drive as an external hard drive for the Xbox 360 Slim. And, if so, where can I find a cable to do this? I don't think the transfer cable can do this from everything I've read.
 Any help is greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>So as Hydro has mentioned, you cannot use an original Xbox 360 HDD as an external drive for the 360S without violating the Terms of Service - I would not advise it!</p>
<p>The transfer cable Hydro mentioned will transfer your data from old hard drive to new, but I'd also offer the solution of using a USB drive to transfer your existing data. 16GB is normally enough to transfer your saved games, and if you do some ferrying
 back and forth you could probably transfer DLC and what have you.</p>
<p>Of course, you'd then have the potential issue of DRM - which shouldn't affect you, but if you have multiple gamertags, it'll cause you problems. I'd consider going through this:
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/downloadable-content/download-content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>I have done it once before, but i never got an approval, instead I am still being asked to Upload my Identification.</p>
<p>I do not understand why this is happening?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My hotmail account is different than original Skype account; when I log into that it gives me a different skype account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows 7, windows update wont find any updates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rick te kronnie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7, windows update wont find any updates</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of our users came to me with his HP Probook 4720s. He hasn't used it for nearly 2 years (latest installed update is 27-9-2014). I was asked to bring it up to date for him.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First off it was really slow so I ran CCleaner, Combofix and uninstalled Google Chrome and a bunch of pointless HP software. Used to have lots of HDD activity for no reason which made it really slow. Runs fine now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I started bringing it up to date, which was a problem. I constantly got a 80243004 error when trying to install one single update (cant remember the KB). Apparently it had something to do with the Windows Update icon in the notification bar, after trying
 lots of the suggested solutions without succes, I went ahead and uninstalled Avast Pro Antivirus (paid for), since we encountered problems with Avast before, which made the icon appear and it started downloading updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next problem, it wouldn't download the update (same KB as before). The update was 983KB in size, but the download remained stuck at 0KB total, 0% completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since our WiFi is pretty **** at times I disabled the WiFi and just plugged it in with a cable, which had no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After some Googling, I disabled the 'Application Experience' and 'Windows Update' service in the services.msc screen and emptied all of the contents in C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution. I made a backup of the files on the desktop just in case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This deleted the Windows Update cach. I set both services back to 'automatic start' and restarted the laptop. All went fine and it started searching for updates. But it is now stuck at "Searching for updates" and wont go on. Its been running for over an
 hour now. This seems to me as the same problem as before deleting the cach.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop is running its original Windows 7 Professional x64 install, language is Dutch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rick</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>It is always sensible in this situation to run a check for malware</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I recommend that you run Disk CleanUp or cCleaner to remove temporary files as this will reduce scanning times by security software. cCleaner comes with a Registry tool. Do not use this
 tool as like any registry cleaner it can lead to the creation of very difficult to resolve system errors</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please download and install Malwarebytes (freeware version for home users only -not the Trial version –watch the checked boxes whilst installing), update definitions and run in normal
 mode. Disable other security software whilst you are doing scans.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please download and run ADWCleaner and upload a copy of the report produced to your OneDrive. Remove all that it finds.

<p><span><span>Before running ADW Cleaner close all open programmes. When ADW Cleaner is run four options are offered. Click
<strong>Scan.</strong> You can review the results by clicking <strong>Log File</strong> or each or any of the Results tabs. To remove all items, click

            <p>Thanks for your reply, allthough I think its a copy paste reply. If you've actually read my post, you'd see that I've allready tried CCleaner.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, I initiated the download and installation of that single update yesterday before going home and left it running the entire night. Just made it back into the office and it has now installed. I then let it search for new updates, which it found. And
 it now downloads and instals them all fine.</p>

</p><p><strong><em>If you've actually read my post, you'd see that I've already tried CCleaner.
</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Running cCleaner was a tiny part of the overall operation of removing malware / parasites, which an assessment of the files provided by you might be the cause of your problem. Canned responses combined with added text are a more effective way of providing
 help than concocting&nbsp;uniques messages to every person one seeks to help.&nbsp;They help to eliminate errors and omissions thereby providing a more efficient service..</p>

            <p>Still had a bit of trouble with the Windows 10 install. It would get stuck at 75%, then restart and stick with a black screen for forever. Press and hold the button to shut it down and boot it again and it would roll back to Windows 7. Got a tip somewhere
 of the internet to instead try the upgrade from DVD (got the image a while ago with the media creation tool) and that worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So installed Windows 10 without any further problems, updates ran fine. Notebook is already back with its user.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the support Gerry!</p>

<h2>            Xbox One X Supposed to be fully Backwards Compatible False advertising. How About Kinect&#63;</h2>
                    <p>As most of you Xbox One X owners are aware, Microsoft are advertising the Xbox One X as is everything being compatible with Xbox One. So what about the Kinect. Unless you don't have an adapter, the Kinect is not compatible with Xbox One X. Microsoft is no longer producing the adapters or producing/supporting the Kinect&nbsp; plus there is no direct connection on the Xbox One X for the Kinect. So is Microsoft not false advertising. and is there no legal law suit the owners can bring against Microsoft regarding the false advertising.</p><p><br /></p><p>The very Least Microsoft should do is start producing the adapter for say two more years give those people who have an Xbox One X, a chance to purchase them if they want one, at a reasonable price, as supposed to be.

            <p>If you can buy an adapter then it`s compatible. Most probably states somewhere in the small print that an adapter is required.</p><p> If they licensed production to a 3rd party that would solve the issue.

            <p>It was announced last October that Kinect was being discontinued, no surprise they have stopped manufacturing the adapter. Scalpers grabbed the chance to make a quick buck, probably expecting desperate parents to drop the cash on them. I just hope they get stuck with the stock.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>The games just weren't there, developers weren't overly interested. So the kinect became a streaming camera and a remote, for most. Now with third party camera support, the kinects demises was inevitable.</p><p><br /></p>

<h2>            Microsoft Office Num Lock Issues</h2>
                    I am operating on Windows 7, but with Microsoft office 2013. &nbsp;My Num Lock key pad sporadically stops working when in Microsoft Word, Excel or Outlook, as if it shuts off but it is not off. &nbsp;The Num Lock light always on and I if click into another program
 and use the Num Lock key pad it will work and clear the issue so I can go back into my office program and continue working. I have tried replacing my keyboard but the problem continues intermittently. I also cannot recreate the issue on my own, I happen to
 be typing when I notice it randomly shuts off although I did not hit the Num Lock button. &nbsp;Very annoying.&nbsp;

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This could be due to third party application conflicts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>NOTE:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or
 an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may
 temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the
 computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.
</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform a
<strong>SFC Scan</strong> and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer to the following link given below.<br />
</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note:</strong> While performing SFC Scan I would recommend you to make sure that there are no applications or programs running on the back ground.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.</span></p>

                    I've tried running the troubleshooter, but it can't find any problems. I'm running McAfee virus protection on both my laptop and the desktop I'm trying to connect to, with the same McAfee account. Both machines run Windows 10. The desktop can create a
 homegroup, but the laptop can't join it or create one of its own.

            <p>Hello Ashley,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community and we regret for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to follow the below suggested methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to check whether the network discovery is turned to on all the devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the below steps.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Type <strong>network</strong> in the search box and choose
<strong>Network and Sharing Center</strong> in the list to open it.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Select <strong>Change advanced sharing settings</strong> to move on.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Choose <strong>Turn on network discovery</strong> or <strong>
Turn off network discovery</strong> in the settings, and tap <strong>Save changes</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
There might be chances where firewall blocking the access and visibility of the PC. Try with the below mentioned command and see if it makes any difference.
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Press <strong>Windows Key + X</strong> and select <strong>Command Prompt(Admin)</strong> from the context menu</li><li>Type or copy paste the below command into command prompt and hit enter key.<br />
<span><strong>netsh advfirewall reset</strong></span></li><li>Exit the command prompt. Reboot your PC and see if the problem still appears.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Additionally, temporarily disable any firewall/antivirus software installed in your computer to check if it is blocking any incoming/outgoing connections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as
 you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also refer to the below link and check if it helps.</p>

<p>I was about to post this on the other thread, but I guess this is as good a thread as any other.</p>
<p>Everything, that has been recommended by ZigZag3143 to this point, is the right approach, but i just want to add a couple of things that might provide an insight into why you are experiencing these problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, i do not see your computer on the list of systems recommend by ASUS, for upgrade to the Windows 8.1 OS.That being said, it does not mean that the system is incapable of running it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can view the list here: <a href="http://event.asus.com/2013/osupgrade/upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://event.asus.com/2013/osupgrade/upgrade/</a> </p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, i took a look at your crash dump, and noticed that a bunch of<strong> USB Related drivers
</strong>were being unloaded......</p>

            Hi Mike
<br />
<br />This is a known bug in the Windows 10 Home to Pro upgrade process, where instead of ending up with the Pro version your system thinks you have the Enterprise version and will not activate
<br />
<br />The only way to resolve this is to contact Microsoft Support and ask them to help you set your Windows 10 to the activated Pro version
<br />

    <title>Ad hoc connection on surface pro 4 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ng2016  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ad hoc connection on surface pro 4</h2>
                    <p>Hi, after many many hours of total frustration trying to make an ad hoc connection (nikon WT-4 wireless transmitter to my surface -something that was a10minute job in win7) it has defeated me.</p>
<p>I have found out that the marvel network adapter does not support ad hoc (this is incredible/unacceptable on a professional device!)</p>
<p>I have purchased a tlink wireless adapter which does support ad hoc (nice one ms -now I have no usb port!)</p>
<p>However using the instructions here</p>
<p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-networking-winpc/how-do-i-set-up-an-ad-hoc-wifi-network-in-windows/0caa92d8-e02f-4e7f-aa5c-0abf10ed2039</p>
<p>it still wont connect</p>
<p>Questions:If i create profile and manage to connect and use, can I revert back to marvel for normal wifi?</p>
<p>When i try to connect it disables the second profile +messes up the ip addresses on the marvel. Surely I can get the surface to remember 2 network profiles?</p>
<p>PLEASE provide clear instructions to set up an ad hoc on my surface pro 4 with marvel network adapter</p>
<p>I do not need to get internet access through it - I need to transfer jpeg files from a transmitter.</p>
<p>(and please fire the person who thought it would be a good idea to remove the option -it is used widely)</p>

<p>Thanks for that Barb. </p>
<p>I have already contacted and am awaiting (patiently!) a reply from connectify as to the suitability of the software to link my transmitter to my surface. I dont like the idea of introducing another software variable into what SHOULD be a simple connection
 and my instinct is that it is probably not designed for the transport of large image files being literally fired at it .......but we shall see!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ms .....have you any instructions/help please!!</p>
<p>(Specific to surface pro 4 as lots of win 10 info on web does not work for surface pro)</p>
<p>
</p><p>My view is that a professional (also read expensive) product like the surface should have basic connectivity built in (as win7 had). As my dad would say "if it aint broke, dont fix it!"

<p><strong><em>tlink wireless adapter </em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a link to its spec's?&nbsp; E.g. perhaps you could you&nbsp;do Bluetooth file transfer instead?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW&nbsp;if you have "no USB port" that could mean you need to get a USB hub too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, note that reference you found would pre-date related functionality that is now available in W10 called Mobile Hotspot.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ah.&nbsp; "Both devices must have Bluetooth"&nbsp; What does that mean?&nbsp; BTPAN?&nbsp; Looks like it could involve creating an ICS substitute too
 (which you said you don't need.)&nbsp; Still who knows maybe it would give you the connectivity you need (via your "tlink").</p>

<p>Ok....Still no luck. After many hours of frustration and help from a network tech we tried the t link, and purchased connectify which was supposed to work but gave up.He thinks it is a security block issue. Nikon support says basically "not our problem....it
 is a microsoft problem. your tx is working in win 7 - microsoft have it blocked in win 10. They changed the system- contact them" (i paraphrase!) Had to use old win 7 laptop to use wireless tx for job over christmas. This is not funny. I have a flagship microsoft
 machine which cant do basic network connections! Why would you remove a basic feature like this? Who on earth thought it was a good idea? MS -&nbsp; IT IS JUST NOT ACCEPTABLE!</p>

<p>Also the simple networking issue -nothing to do with ad hoc. Why cant I get my surface to remember two network profiles? surely I should be able to set up the marvel for home use wi fi. AND the t link for a work profile with static ip and the Surface to
 remember both and be able to switch between profiles/adapters? This simple networking has defeated us too (see my first post above) I feel there is a security issue block.</p>
<p>I feel if I could get this to work then I might get a workaround through connectify</p>
<p>Is there anybody who could help with instructions please. </p>
<p>Surface pro. I want to create 2 seperate network profiles:</p>
<p>1 Marvel ad with dhcp</p>
<p>2 tlink&nbsp; ad with static ip for work</p>
<p>Simple so far you would think......BUT</p>
<p>when I set up the static on the marvel it screws up the marvel setting, i get win error and the only way to fix is run troubleshooter which sets back to default marvel/dhcp!</p>
<p>Simple got complicated !</p>

    <title>Activate Windows 10 copy - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> haximz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Activate Windows 10 copy</h2>
                    <p>ok so i bought a alienware x51 r2 just under 2 years ago, on christmas i will be upgrading my pc, removing a few components to move to my new pc. one of them is my hard drive. i know that generally companies such as alienware put oem versions of windows
 onto pre built rigs such as mine. i have upgraded to windows 10 since ive had this pc. i have no idea f i did or did not have an oem version before upgrading. i have read that upgrading from oem will still make windows 10 unable to be used with a new computer
 because thats how oem works. so how do i find out if i previously had oem version, if i still have oem version and if i can or cannot use this copy of windows on a new pc, also if i can use this copy will it be as simple as plugging this hard drive into my
 new computer? or will i have to call Microsoft and get my key? or call and tell them i'm activating it on a computer. please help</p>

            <p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM license </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the Windows 10&nbsp;end user license agreement:</em></p>
<span>
<p><strong>b. Stand-alone software.</strong> If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also
 transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came
 on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</p>

            Hi Jesus.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can change sounds for any System functions in the Sound control panel.  Type Sound in Start search. Choose Sounds tab.  Adjust as desired.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            I would need to go through the same list you are and you're the one who knows what sound you want or don't want.  Choose one you like.   You might find more if you change the Sound Scheme in dropdown.

<h3> saviormoney  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do so many guys think that XBL is a dating service&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>My wife and I play a lot of games together, right now its mostly Diablo 3. I have noticed that when we play with other people, whether its in a party or game chat, she gets hit on about 10 minutes in. Now, in all fairness, she does have the cutest accent.
 She grew up in the Philippines but lived and worked in Dubai for about 5 years so her accent is very unique and adorable. It suits her very well because she is gorgeous. However, the constant flirting and questions about her physical appearance and marital
 status has made her stay off of the headset all together. I do immediately set them straight but why can we not just play? Why do 90% of the guys that we encounter on XBL think that she is looking for a date? This isnt eHarmony. She didnt create a dating profile.
 She isnt trying to hook up with some creep that thinks she has a sexy voice. Judging by the amount of pick up attempts that she has had to deal with, I think her situation is similar to many of the female gamers on XBL. Fellas, please stop thinking with your
 reproductive organs and let these girls enjoy their experience as you would also like to do. Unsolicited flirtation is a HUGE turn off, whether she is looking for a man or not</p>

<p>Sorry too hear about your issues . I can only speak for myself .i know quite a few female gamers from the various communities I part of and u right there is this issue . But of the women i know tend too play with the same group of friends and i think this
 is a good rule of thumb for most if us these days . I not saying that how it should be just what seems too work. But again this is only my view i sure others will have they own .

<p>^^ This is good advice for those women and young ladies that are on alone. My wife is seldom on XBL without me and we pretty much play the same way that I would if I were playing alone. She gets everything from in game flirtation to friend requests accompanied
 by dash PM's with phone numbers and dating inquiries. I have even had to deal with guys that want to fight me over her, without ever seeing me OR her. Would YOU want a woman that would leave her husband over someone she met playing a video game, sight unseen?
 Apparently, they do and that stinks of desperation. I have come to the conclusion that many of these guys are total losers that will take whatever they can get, no matter how desperate they may seem while trying to obtain it. Some others have probably lost
 a girl over their obsession with gaming and just want a girl that shares that interest. Regardless, there is a time and a place and just because your parts fit together, that doesnt mean that she is on here to find a man. Chances are, she is content or she
 would be somewhere that allows her to see what she would be getting</p>

<p>No big surprise. I remember when I was in the military a friend of mine hit on every single girl he would meet, funniest is he made a date with a phone operator while trying to get a number. That didn't turn out good for him.</p>
<p>I remember a guy asked me if he could dance with my girlfriend I laughed and said "you can asks her anything she's gona say no."</p>

<p>I honestly have no idea why people attempt to use this system as a dating service. I guess it's the fact there are as many females who play games as males which is why they all freak out when a girl is present.

<p>I'm sorry to hear about your issue I don't honestly know why guys would do that unless they think it's funny to hit on girls/women like that. The female gamers I've added or played with I respect their lifestyles,etc. and don't expect anyone to give them
 crap, but you can't control what others do unfortunately therefore I try to give them a friendly experience while we play and hope that no one harasses them while in a online game.</p>

<p>panama400- it bothers me because it bothers her. I never gave it much thought until she pointed out the fact that she gets hit on every single time she plays while wearing a headset. I definitely know what you mean when you talk about guys asking to dance
 with your girlfriend. My wife prefers me to be the one to handle situations like that because I can handle it in a way that wont turn into a shouting match. She will chastise them for being disrespectful of her marriage and saying things like "no wonder you
 are single", which then causes them to say some VERY disrespectful things and I end up in jail for standing up for my wife who is never shy about speaking her mind. Im actually kinda curious as to what happened with your friend and the phone operator. Im guessing
 she had a great voice but in person, she was a BEAST.</p>
<p>ColourTheory-I have noticed that guys act totally different when there is a girl in the party or game chat. In Diablo 3, they ALWAYS let the girl get all of the Legendary gear and some will actually sacrifice themselves to protect the girl, little perks
 that my wife is all too happy to accept. In those situations, I feel that she brings it on to herself because these guys expect something in return for their generosity. Most guys are like this. Very few guys are nice just for the sake of being nice. Nearly
 all of us have our own agenda when doing something nice for a woman. Im no different. She should know better.</p>
<p>SnakeEyez1981-I seriously believe that many of them do it out of desperation. Personally, I wouldnt want anything to do with a woman if I dont know what she looks like. I remember when I was a kid and 1-900 numbers were popular. The running joke was that
 the girls on the other end were whales and men were paying a fortune to talk to these women based on how they sounded and what they SAID they looked like. I think that the majority of them just want a gf that is into gaming and meeting her on XBL is the only
 sure fire way to get a gamer gf</p>

<p>I got too say yours is a extreme case and is it you both have this problem whilst playing this one game . Maybe time too change your game. Just a thought certain games get a certain crowd as it were . As i said most of the guys and girls i play with wouldn't
 dream of behaving as such . I do hope you find some kind of solution as xbox and gaming should be fun and hassle free for all

<p>Hello everyone &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>For me, its not&nbsp;that I'm looking to be mean / rude, but I just completely block everyone off who isn't on my friends list.&nbsp; Furthermore, I don't accept Random Friend Request at all (sorry).&nbsp; It is a lot easier for me this way because I'm really shy.</p>
<p>With that being said, I'm a 95% solo gamer &amp; 5% multiplayer gamer (cooperative modes only, I hate PvP modes). &nbsp;Whenever that 5% (a.k.a me playing cooperative multiplayer with randoms) scenario happends, I simply just play one or two sessions &amp; then just
 leave.</p>
<p>Have a nice day or afternoon or night everyone &nbsp;:)</p>

<p>Lei Fang- We didnt block everyone for the simple fact that we liked to give everyone the benefit of the doubt and needless to say, it bit us. I will say that what she has encountered on XBL is nearly as bad as it was when she played Diablo 3 on PC on her
 Twitch channel and everybody could see what she looks like. There were some VERY inappropriate and non-game related things being said there. Diablo is more fun with more people and it provides a challenge because the enemies are much stronger when you have
 more people. Our level 50+ characters have no problem when it is just the two of us, mowing down everything in our path. Not many of the people on our friends list play Diablo 3 so we kinda have to play with random people to get the type of game we enjoy.</p>
<p>MysticDarklight-Changing games is easier said than done, really. For me, its not an issue. I play about 30 different games. My wife is a Diablo junkie. She played the crap out of the first 2 on PC and the 3rd one on PC and Xbox. She loves that Medievel period,
 fantasy type stuff. Have you ever tried to get the needle away from a heroin addict? Well, I havent done THAT but I assume it would be similar to getting my wife to stop playing Diablo.</p>
<p>panama400-I figured as much. Its hard to go off of how someone sounds, without ever seeing them. He rolled the dice and crapped out</p>
