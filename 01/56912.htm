            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><span>When exactly do you receive the mentioned error message?</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you place the computer in clean boot and then check which program is associated with the file and giving the error message:</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span><b>Note</b>: After troubleshooting, make sure to put the computer to start as usual as mentioned in Step 7
 in the above KB article.</span></p>
<p><span>Once you find the program which is associated with opengl32.dll, I would suggest you reinstall the application and check if it helps.</span></p>

            Same answer as before :<br />
<br />
Re-do the disk. Check the methods in my reply above. If you do not have&nbsp;a Windows DVD<br />
try to borrow a friends to see if it will boot&nbsp; - try any XP, Vista, Win7 just to see if the drive<br />
will detect and boot from it. If Vista you can use it as a repair disk as they are not copy<br />
protected.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 March 2019 update takes many hours</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>i was wondering, is it ok for windows update to take hours upon hours?</p>
<p>i got the latest update just a few days ago and to my surprise, that took quite long, but it was done in a few hours and all was fine, then comes this one and says it will also take longer to update, it had already been hours, what should i do?</p>
<p>and now that i’m here, what’s with the watermark?</p>
<p>thank you very much&nbsp;</p>

            Hi  Pho2Totoo
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />You can wait for 1 or 2 hours to give the update time to finish. If it doesn't progress, you can reboot. 
<br />
<br />Also even if it finishes, you should execute points 1 and 2 so that future updates sail through.
<br />
<br />I recommend that you do a manual update for this KB. 
<br />
<br />1. Windows Key+X &gt; Windows Powershell (Admin)
<br />Type following (or copy and paste following) one by one and Enter
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old
<br />net start wuauserv
<br />net start cryptSvc
<br />net start bits
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />2. Type following in Windows Start Search box (Cortana) and hit Enter %systemroot%\Logs\CBS &gt; Rename CBS.Log to something else.
<br />If it doesn't allow you to rename - Type services in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Services &gt; Scroll down to find the Windows Modules Installer service and double-click on it &gt; Set its startup type to Manual &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Logs\CBS &gt; Rename CBS.Log &gt; Reboot your computer &gt; Then go back into the Services App and set Windows Modules Installer Service back to Automatic Startup (Note CBS log files contain information about windows update, SFC etc)
<br />

<br />
<br />3. You can download the updates from Microsoft Catalog and update manually. Search for relevant KB in the Catalog.

<br />
<br />You can reset the Windows Update components.
<br /> 
<br />Right click your start button and select Powershell(admin) or Command Prompt (admin) 
<br />Type the following hitting enter after each line. 
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
<br />net start wuauserv 
<br />net start cryptSvc 
<br />net start bits 
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />Reboot and try again.
<br />Check this link, I hope it helps.

<br />Yes it is normal to take hours as it depends on your device configuration together with the data. If the hard disk light is blinking you need not to worry. If that gets stuck let us know.

<p>you have provided the best relevent reply to my question, the hard disk light does blink every now and then, and i can see the beads rolling on my screen, but no sign of progress, it would have been wise to allow a kind of indicator to let people know where
 they are at.</p>

<p>sorry to say if your previously owned console is banned there is NO way to reverse said ban. &nbsp;this is why it is ALWAYS best not to buy used as you have NO idea of the past history of a used console. &nbsp;you will either A: have to take it up with the seller
 and hopefully get your money back, or B: buy another console.</p>

<p>Please don't bump old threads. It's not possible to appeal a suspension. Also, if he was suspended for 2 weeks then that usually means it's not the first time he's been suspended. If he gets suspended again it will more than likely be a permanent ban.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 screen resolution changes automatically on startup</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having problems with my Lenovo Edge 2 laptop. Every time that I restart my computer or launch a full-screen program (such as a game through Steam or a similar program), my screen resolution automatically changes from the highest/default resolution of
 1920 x 1080 to a resolution of 640 x 480. This has become extremely obnoxious and interfered with the usage of a lot of programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I fix this? My graphics drivers are up-to-date, and my specs are as follows:&nbsp;</p>
<p>OS: Windows 10 Home</p>
<p>Processor: Intel (R) Core (TM) i7-6500U CPU @ 2.50 GHz 2.59 GHz</p>
<p>RAM: 8.00 GB&nbsp;</p>
<p>System type: 64-bit Operating System, x64-based processor</p>
<p>Graphics: (Dedicated), Intel HD Graphics 520; NVIDIA GeForce 940M</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

<h3> waterloo9  say:</h3>
<h2>            Question about IP flooding</h2>
                    
<p>I play MW3 competitively on gamebattles, and little kids can't handle a loss so they IP flood. I have been trying to find a way to prevent this heard multiple things but most of it is for computers only and people don't understand that. VPNs seems like it
 would work, but what i'm worried about is XBL. Will i get ban from XBL for this? I don't want to do it and have XBL think i'm trying to hide my IP from it and get ban. I was on support and they said to post here. Thanks for your time.</p>

Other than that, most Routers have Filter Settings for Blocking Anonymous Request. You might want to look into some Settings on your Private/ Home Network. As far as using a Proxy, I would hesitate and say no, don't try anything of the like for your Services
 while over XBL. </span></p>

<p>I have been IP flooded before on xbox i called comcast and talked to someone they transfered me to someone who was supposed to be reporting it and they said "we don't really do anything about that" verizon however i know does. A router doesn't really do
 that because if it did you would have to allow everything that came through your router, like a firewall. And if you mean there is a option to block people, i don't know their IP and even it showed up, the way kids are doing this is they send a message to
 a bot basically that spends a signal to a ton of infected machines and they spam it, so it is very hard to trace. A VPN isn't actually a proxy, what it does is it masks my actual IP to protect it, though to XBL it may seem like a proxy which is why i asked
 tech support but they didn't know. Should i call instead of going on live chat?</p>

<p>Just like LostKauz said.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>If you believe you are being targeted by a DDOS attack contact your ISP. They should be able to assign you a new IP without much fuss and should monitor the old IP.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Problem with using any form of a firewall is that since you should have certain ports open for proper Xbox Live service those will most likely be the ports used by the attack. Even using an onion or proxy service isn't going to shield you unless the proxy
 servers have a pool of IP addresses they can switch you to when they notice abnormally high amount of traffic. Switching IPs will disconnect you off any game you are playing online and &nbsp;cause a loss of connection with Xbox Live so they would succeed in causing
 a disconnect anyways.</p>

<p>Solution is to play a game where dedicated servers are used instead of P2P hosting which can let someone figure out the IP of the player assigned as host fairly easily. If they are assigned as host then it's even easier. All they need to do is change their
 firewall to block the active connections to their 360. That is just the price you have to pay for games that use player hosting and have players desperate enough to employ these tactics. No way to hide and maintain an active connection.</p>

<p>I'm well aware it is not a XBL issue, what wanting to know is, if i take it into my own hands to prevent this will i get ban. Not to be rude, but what you guys are telling me is irrelevant and unrelated. A firewall will only work for my PC, a VPN is somewhat
 like that but it creates a network ON my pc and then i get my internet from my PC not my router. You guys i feel like don't understand what i'm talking about, you know what ip flooding is but your not understanding what i'm doing. Who would i talk to at xbox
 to find this out? Because they sent me here.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 128, 1)">I would suggest trying to post in here about your question. But something that no one else told you is that whatever you do with you networking set-up. As long as it does not
 alter how your console performs or gives an unfair advantage(aimbot or god-mode) in the game. You are more than welcome to do. Also, anything you set up on your computer for network protection will protect your 360 also. Since, all traffic comes from your
 modem to router(software on PC for router) and back to your 360. But anyway, if you feel you need a better answer than I would try in that forum or even if you have Twitter try Xbox Support on there.</span></p>

<p>You should not get a ban from Microsoft for taking things into your own hand, so long as you do not do anything through your 360 or xbox live service.&nbsp; People in here do know what you are talking about and have given you suggestions on what to do.&nbsp; If someone
 is doing a&nbsp; DOS on you aka ip flood (there's many DOS attacks out there) then you will want to talk to your ISP regarding it because they can stop the issue before it even comes to your modem.&nbsp; Not to mention, they can take it further and contact the abuse
 department of the ISP that the traffic is originating and get the traffic stopped on their end.&nbsp; Microsoft will tell you something similar.&nbsp; They'll say to contact your ISP and/or authorities.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Again the only way that you will get banned is if you break the Terms of Use or Code of Conduct.&nbsp; So long as those aren't being broken while you are "taking things into your own hands" then there is nothing that Microsoft will do to you.&nbsp; However if you
 feel that someone is using the xbox live service to mess with you in some way, then you need to block communications with said individual and lodge a complaint.&nbsp; The Policy Enforcement Team will take a look at the situation and will take appropriate action.&nbsp;
 If you attempt to take action against them on the xbox live service in some way, then Microsoft could possibly ban you as a result.&nbsp; Hope all of this makes sense.</p>

<p>The only thing i would be doing to the xbox is plugging it to my computer instead of router. Honestly, like i said their suggestions have NOTHING to do with the situation, the IP flooding programs that people are using are basically like viruses where they
 use infected computers to spam a IP address so &nbsp;blocking people and things like that not work. Like i said before i have contacted comcast they told me they do nothing, maybe i just talked to the wrong person, but as far as i know they way they are doing it
 now is VERY hard to trace because of the infected computers and i've also heard that some of them actually do it by sending a message over aim and it tells all of the infected computers to spam. Also, again i don't feel like you guys understand the situation.
 I play call of duty competitively, i don't play on the public leaderboards, i plan on a different website where i take proof when i beat a team in a private match and i report i win, they try and time me out so i don't have proof that i won. It isn't that
 i am making people mad, i'm beating them and they don't want to lose. If you suggestion is don't play there, don't post because not to be arrogant but i feel i'm a above average player and like to play against people as good as me or better. If you guys still
 don't understand check out www.gamebattles.com .</p>
<p>Don't make people mad but idiocy and they won't kick you,</p>
<p>Lol where to start, with ending a sentence about "idiocy" with a comma? Not reading anything said before? Saying but instead of by? Or just being a idiot?</p>

<h2>            Win XP Pro SP3,  file is missing or corrupt&#58; &#160;&#92;WINDOWS&#92;SYSTEM32&#92;CONFIG&#92;SYSTEM</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
I have a Toshiba Satellite Pro U400 laptop with XP Pro SP3 that has gotten the above error when I tried to boot. Some background:<br />
<br />
I recently had to buy a new power supply because mine died. I debated about buying one versus buying a new laptop. I researched laptops, created spreadsheets and OneNote notebooks with all the info I gathered and decided against buying a new laptop because
 the one I wanted was over $1500. <br />
<br />
Since I decided I would keep my laptop, I went ahead a bought a new battery (Toshiba, same P/N as orig) because my original one wasn't really any good anymore. And because my laptop was e x c&nbsp; r&nbsp; u&nbsp; c&nbsp; i&nbsp; a&nbsp; t&nbsp; i&nbsp; n&nbsp; g&nbsp; l&nbsp; y slow, I decided to add memory.&nbsp;
 I researched everything having to do with memory, understood the max this laptop would take was 4GB, and placed my order.<br />
<br />
So, I bought a new Toshiba power supply, a new Toshiba battery, and Crucial memory. I upgraded the memory from 1GB (removed this) to 4GB (2x2GB) (only realize about 3.4 though, as expected).&nbsp; All was wonderful with the world. The additional memory was awesome!<br />
<br />
But I noticed sometimes that it would switch to battery power when it was still plugged in. And, the laptop couldn't tell how much was remaining on the battery.&nbsp; When this happened, I checked to make sure I was still plugged into the wall and that everything
 was still plugged in nice and tight - it was.&nbsp; I unplugged and replugged until I got it to go back to the power supply.&nbsp; A couple of times when I wasn't actively using the computer, it would end up powering down due to (I guess) it switching to battery power
 and then the battery ran down. So I would boot back up and continue my work. I didn't get any prompts to start in Safe Mode or anything.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Well, one time this happened and when I powered back up, I got the dreaded "file is missing or corrupt:&nbsp; \WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\CONFIG\SYSTEM" message. I researched this online and with the help of many posts and answers from kind people like you, I created a boot
 CD. I booted from it, went into System Console and it says "Setup did not find any hard drives installed in your....... blah blah blah."&nbsp; And it gives the option to quit Setup (F3). When you exit, it actually tries to boot again so I have to manually power
 down.&nbsp; I also downloaded SeaTools for DOS and created a bootable CD with those tools.&nbsp; I ran both the short test and the long test and got no errors.&nbsp; It accurately showed that the HD was "ATA Device HitachiHTS......."&nbsp; So, it could "see" the drive but didn't
 find any errors to correct.<br />
<br />
If this thing is dead dead dead, there are only a handful of files I would like to recover from the hard drive. I will have to eat the cost of the new PS, battery and memory.&nbsp; Way back, I ran out of space on the HD so I made a backup to a WD portable drive
 and deleted all the music and photos and other files from the laptop HD. So I've been using the external drive when it came to any of those files.&nbsp; There are a handful of files on the desktop that I have been using A LOT lately, doing some research. I have
 never copied those to the external drive.... <br />
<br />
I am at a loss as to what to try next. I've not been able to find any info with respect to Recovery Console not finding the hard drive.&nbsp; I have found solutions to copy the data using a boot CD and external drive but they require that I have XP disk(s) and I
 do not. I also never made a recovery disk.<br />
<br />
Please please, do you have any suggestions?<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
small edit: I use Kaspersky for AV. And I've been running malwarebytes on occasion. Also, I know there are dodads that you can buy such that you remove the HD from the laptop and connect the dodad and then connect to the USB port of another computer in order
 to copy files. But I don't know what this dodad is called in order to buy one.&nbsp; Do you know?<br />

            <p>KKBTX,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To recover, you will need to restore your old registry from one of the backups that was kept with your System Restore points (let's hope you had it enabled).&nbsp; You will need to boot your machine from a CD.&nbsp; I highly recommend freeware "Hirens Boot CD" as
 it contains a "Registry Restore Wizard" tool that will automate the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, on another computer, download the Hirens' Disk Image.&nbsp; It will need to be burned using a "Burn Image" or "Burn ISO" feature of a CD Burning Program.&nbsp; Find the download and the&nbsp;burning instructions here:</p>
<p>&nbsp; Hirens Download:&nbsp; &lt; <a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#68217a">http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/</font></a>&nbsp;&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp; Hirens Burning:&nbsp; &lt; <a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/burning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#68217a">http://www.hirensbootcd.org/burning/</font></a>&nbsp;&gt;</p>
<p>Don't be fooled by fake download links...&nbsp; the correct download file is a ".zip" link in a light-green rectangle with a disk icon near the bottom of the page.&nbsp; One big advantage of Hirens is that it will detect ATA hard drives whereas many other boot disks
 won't.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After burning the CD, you may need to enter your BIOS on your problem computer to set the Booting order such that the CD drive comes before the hard drive. (Inspect first splash screen for a key to [quickly] hit at that moment).&nbsp; Some machines are already
 set this way.&nbsp; Once you boot from the CD, choose the "Mini Windows XP" option at the first Black/White screen and let it continue booting.&nbsp; Once booted, go to the Hirens Boot CD Menu (HBCDMenu) and select:</p>
<p>&nbsp; Programs -&gt; Registry -&gt; Registry Restore Wizard.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the prompts, choosing a restore date from before your registry clean operation, and reboot your machine (after removing the CD) and hopefully you will be back to normal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HTH,</p>
<p>&nbsp; JW</p>

    <title>Imminent Drive Failure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> electroencephalotography  say:</h3>
<h2>            Imminent Drive Failure</h2>
                    <p>For a few days now I have been getting that message at startup, Windows has detected an imminent hard drive failure, or whatever the exact verbiage is. &nbsp;It got to the point that sometimes pressing "F1" to boot into Windows anyway wouldn't work and it would
 just hang at that page with the Windows logo and the text "Windows Starting" beneath it. &nbsp;I figured okay, the drive is toast, everything is backed up in multiple places, so I took off the cover and removed the HDD that contained the OS. &nbsp;This is a pretty old
 HP business machine (2006 mfg date), it has a dock with two drive bays; &nbsp;I left the other there, which I installed a few years back, and replaced the drive that contained Windows, and was apparently faulty, with a SATA SSD (bought it accidentally, I needed
 mSATA, but is is a fresh drive). &nbsp;Ever since (I tried about four times) when I reboot it hangs at that "Windows Starting" screen. &nbsp;The first time I fired up the computer after changing out that drive I got the error message I should have, something like nonsystem
 or faulty disk. &nbsp;I put the Windows7 CD ROM into the drive and rebooted, thinking it would install Windows to the SSD, but now I can't get past that Windows logo/Windows Starting screen. &nbsp;When I reboot with the install CD in the drive, I do get the message
 "Windows is loading files" and the progress meter bar - I thought that was a good sign that it would go ahead and install, but no go.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any words of wisdom for me?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just something from the earlier days.</p>
<p>There used to be a problem with some older HP machines that when a non-HP Hard Drive or other parts&nbsp;were installed, you had to get a particular file from HP to allow the reinstall of Windows to continue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It never happened on all HP machines and I do not remember the Model Numbers it occurred in or what the file was.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But here is HP's information about installing Hard Drives. (Step 7)</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Also contact the SSD maker as their may be a firmware update or some known issue. Double<br />
check the cabling and connections.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

            Answered! Microsoft support helped me over the phone. Believe it or not the issue was the wireless mouse. Once I took out the dongle and restarted the laptop everything worked. Issue was mouse and laptop conflict during updates. Unbelievable it was that
 simple.

            Adobe Acrobat DC.&nbsp; One of the courts scans and save case records as Tif, which Adobe could view until this last Windows update.&nbsp; If I use a photo viewer, it only lets me see the first page of the document.&nbsp; Our other courts all use pdf's, so it is not
 an issue.&nbsp; Once I reverted back to a prior update of Windows, I was able to select Adobe as the default association.&nbsp; I have delayed the installation of the update that caused the problem.

            Hi there, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />Many users have reported the same issue with setting default programs in the latest Windows Update, so Microsoft have paused the update and it's no longer available for download until they've resolved the issue. The only solution for now is to do what you've already done - restore back to the previous update.
<br />
<br />Microsoft will release a fix shortly, but in the meantime here's a link to further information about the update:

<br />
<br />Please let me know if you need more support! Thanks!

Hi Vivien,

<div>The screen message is as follows:</div>

            Hello albow, <br />
<br />
Check the Windows 7 compatibility center to see if the camera is compatible with Windows 7.
<br />
You didn't state what operating system you or your Mom was using. <br />
<br />
Then check to see if you have the most current updated drivers for your camera. <br />
If not compatible, then try installing in compatibility mode for the operating system it is compatible with.
<br />
<p><span>If the program is not compatible, then you may try to install and run the program in compatibility mode.
</span></p>

<p>The family plan doesn't affect content licensing. When you purchase content it's tied to the gamertag that purchased it and the console it was purchased on. So she could use it on her account if she's playing on the same console as your account.
</p>
<p>You could sign in on her xbox and redownload the content and do a license transfer so she can have access to the content. But the license transfer will move the licenses for all of your content so you would have to be signed into Live at all times on your
 console in order to access it.</p>

<h2>            Getting Error F3-F200-002 when trying to boot up Windows 7 Home 64-bit</h2>
                    <p>I have a Toshiba Satellite Laptop C855-S5214....&nbsp;&nbsp; I had to restart the computer after an AVG update. It shut down and restarted and got stuck on the windows icon (icon was still moving/floating but it wouldn't keep loading)...&nbsp; It did this same thing a
 week or so ago.. we took out the battery and put it back in and it booted up fine... this time.. nothing...&nbsp;&nbsp; (don't ask me why we took out the battery... we (i.e. hubby) did it and told me afterwards...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first it would stop at the windows icon and just sit there forever...&nbsp; I then did F8 and started in safe mode.. that worked fine.....&nbsp; I tried doing the repair and it just said it couldn't be repaired and to shut it down....&nbsp;&nbsp; then I tried the boot from
 last known good configuration and&nbsp;that did nothing at all...&nbsp; literally....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; after some reading on the internet, I decided to use my 5 recovery disks from Toshiba that I made when I first got the computer and try to reformat saving my files....&nbsp;I went into&nbsp;setup
 and told it to boot from CD/DVD&nbsp;drive, as I couldn't get it to do that without forcing it to this way....&nbsp; &nbsp;it got through 3 disks and then on disk 4 I got the F3-F200-002 error and now I can't do ANYTHING without getting this error... can't get into F2 setup...&nbsp;
 I get the error before it gets there, so I can't even get back to change it to boot from hard drive instead of CD/DVD drive....&nbsp; I can get to F8 screen but whatever I choose, I get the error...&nbsp; I even tried putting back in disk 1, as that is supposed to be
 the "solution" to this error, but that doesn't work either...</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is a very vague error code about what is best to fix it.</p>
<p>And the closet&nbsp;I can find is 0002, not 002</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Solutions to it&nbsp;can point to it being a bad memory module, bad sectors on the Hard Drive, faulty Recovery disks or a failed Hard Drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I suggest that you read the information in these links:</p>

</p><p>To reinstall from the Toshiba Recovery partition, which you made the disks from,&nbsp;you press and hold the 0 (zero) key at Boot, then follow the installation instructions back to Factory Settings.</p>

<p>Hi, I am using the on screen keyboard as I have a disability and unable to use a regular keyboard. It performs normally for a short time and then without warning it freezes and freezes the entire system. The only way out is mains power off!</p>
<p>Any suggestions would be greatly &nbsp;appreciated.</p>

<p><span>To change the headings, right click on the header bar and click on More.&nbsp; There you will see a listing of options to include in the header and you can move
 them about to fit your desires.&nbsp; But they will not stick unless you amend the template for that type of folder.&nbsp; Procedures to do that follow.</span></p>
<p><span>Here's how to change the default template for a folder:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/70819-windows-explorer-folder-view-settings.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/70819-windows-explorer-folder-view-settings.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Default behaviour is to select the template based on the first type of file placed in the folder (it has to choose something).&nbsp; Vista sets the Explorer window view settings and
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/77444-windows-explorer-folder-type-templates.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>folder type template</span></strong></a><span>
 according to what folder types are in the window. This will show you how to reset the
<strong>Windows Explorer folder view settings (which is what I think you want)</strong>, turn off
<strong>Automatic Folder Type Discovery</strong>, and increase the <strong>folder view cache</strong> to have Vista remember the view settings, folder type template, size, or position of a specific window for when it was last closed at the specific path location.<br />
<br />
This does not work with the sub <strong>Save As</strong>, <strong>Open With</strong>,
<strong>Open in New Tab</strong> (Internet Explorer), etc.... type dialog windows through the
<strong>File</strong> </span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/92073-menu-bar.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>menu bar</span></strong></a><span> item though. These
 do not seem to be able to have their size or position remembered. For these, you can use the free program
</span><a href="http://autosizer.en.softonic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://autosizer.en.softonic.com/</span></a>
<span>to resize them.<br />
<br />
Here's another article on how to change the Windows Explorer columns and sort order in Vista:

<strong>add</strong>, <strong>remove</strong>, <strong>move</strong>, change the <strong>
width</strong>, and change the <strong>sort order</strong> of Windows Explorer columns to how you want them.<br />
<br />
Here's another article on how to change the default folder view in Vista (but it claims it isn't a perfect solution and may revert to prior behavior so it's not as good as the two prior links provided:

Good luck!</span></span></p>
