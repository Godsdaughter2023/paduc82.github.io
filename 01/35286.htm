<h2>            I&#39;ve been getting BSOD due to 4 errors I have no idea what they are</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys . I have been getting BSOD as well as some occasional complete system freezes that can last anytime from a second to 5 seconds (even sound freezes and creates that annoying freezing sound)</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b22140b4-b713-4e60-9170-31bc807485ea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b22140b4-b713-4e60-9170-31bc807485ea" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>These are the errors that are causing my BSOD according to bluescreen view . DMP File :<a href="http://www76.zippyshare.com/v/I1swNm2u/file.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> Here</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error syntp.sys I've gotten before , people said it can be fixed by updating the touchpad driver . Updated , did not work and I'm still getting the BSOD because of it and the others . please can anyone tell me what is causing these errors and how to
 possibly fix them ?</p>
<p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks for you reply . I did use the verifier and my system crashed on startup . I started the system in safe mode but could not find any minidumps related to the crashes , the only one I could find was MEMORY.DMP ,so I exited safe mode after disabling
 verifier and tried in normal mode , still no minidumps . &nbsp;so I uploaded MEMORY.DMP it to googledrive

            <p>Hi, there can you please specify your laptop/pc configurations? Is it a new PC or an old one? and also check if the manufacturer of the said device has windows 10 optimized drivers, I think this Is partially due to driver incompatibility but cant say much
 if I don't know what specifications your device has.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And a major&nbsp;question would be the hardware condition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it works out.</p>

            I have an HP&nbsp;17-e100sx &nbsp;laptop , running windows 10 . I transitioned into windows 10 from 10.1 and updated all my drivers , the problem started a couple weeks ago only , I uninstalled and reinstalled syntp.sys driver only but it didn't fix it . Hardware
 wise it is in excellent condition except maybe the screen cable needs to be replaced (screen flickers when in a specific incline angle) . thanks :)

<p>Just checked into your laptop specs and its more than capable of running windows 10, so no issues there. And it has windows 10 optimized drivers in the website and I also checked about those crash files in the screenshot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Igdkmd64.sys</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp; - "<em>Because of the importance of Igdkmd64.sys in the functionality of Windows 8 Pro and other Windows functions, any corruption or damage to this file can create critical system errors in the form of a "blue screen of death" (BSOD)"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>So, was the windows 10 transition completed without any interruptions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it had any interruptions or any corruption of the data, here is what I would suggest perform a clean install of windows 10 from a bootable&nbsp;pen drive.&nbsp;(Keep that as a last resort because it worked in my case).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The synaptic touchpad driver, isn't that crucial as I don't even use it on my system and it still works just fine. its the
<strong>Intel Graphics driver. </strong>Do try this uninstall your current graphics driver for Intel and use this link to get the&nbsp;driver directly from Intel&nbsp;<a href="http://www.intel.com/p/en_US/support/detect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://www.intel.com/p/en_US/support/detect</span></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>And also I highly recommend that you uninstall any third party programs that you don't require and do search for malware.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>if the laptop didn't get this error on windows 8.1 and is receiving it in windows 10 suggests that this might not be related to hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Suggestion is to either re-install <strong>Intel Graphics driver </strong>by using the link above or if all else fails perform a
<strong>Clean Install</strong> of Windows 10 that should work.(In my case this worked&nbsp;the clean install or fresh install).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it might be the graphics driver but if you still get the error I <strong>
Highly R</strong><strong>ecommend </strong>a fresh install but remember it wont work IF its related to defected&nbsp;hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here this link might be useful : http://support.hp.com/in-en/document/c04593971</p>

            After the last time I ran verifier things got a little better , (except for a small hiccup here and there and some occasional mouse pointer freeze) , but today it got worse so I decided to run it again , the hall thing was a nightmare . Upon startup it
 would immediately got to BSOD with the error (Driver verifier iomaneger violation , AVPCFILTER.SYS) and the verifier could not be disabled from the CMD in the advanced boot menu so I had to enter safe mood to do it again . Please any information on the nature
 of this error and whether or not it tells me something would be appreciated . Thanks

</p><p>Done , this is what I got . Apart from some game cracks that I've never used (obviously) . there seem to be no big malware files in the system files . However I was planning on repairing windows from a USB-media of windows 10 that I downloaded last night
 since it seems like I have some corrupt system files .&nbsp;</p>

<p>and the I typed: "net user"&nbsp; and then my username and&nbsp;my new&nbsp;password.</p>

</p><p>I just updated my Laptop from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 and I can't find my cursor. Also when I enable the cursor I can't click on anything. I had to manually do it using the tabs and the arrow key. Moreover most of my apps don't work like Google Chrome&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0bdce774-3a0e-4d72-8b2d-eadd134144f8" /></p>

<h2>            laptop to wireless printer connectivity</h2>
                    <p>I have an enclosed box truck in which I want to set up a wireless network between my laptop and a wireless printer. My laptop has internet connectivity via an aircard. Will a basic router solve my problem? There is no modem, only&nbsp;the laptop and the wireless
 printer, in which I want to connect to wirelessly. Any help appreciated.</p>

            The short answer is that if you need to use an Ethernet cable connection to the computer as part of the initial router setup, then yes, connect it from the computer's Ethernet port to one of the 4 blue Ethernet ports (not the yellow "Internet" port).<br />
<br />
The User Guide for the Linksys E1200 is here --&gt; <a href="http://downloads.linksys.com/downloads/userguide/E_Series_UG_E900Rev_3425-01486_Web.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://downloads.linksys.com/downloads/userguide/E_Series_UG_E900Rev_3425-01486_Web.pdf</a>
<br />
<br />
I haven't used the current version of the installation software (actually, I'd probably do it manually anyway), but all that the User Guide says is to put the CD in the computer, start the setup routine, and "follow the on-screen directions." Looking at the
 User Guide, it seems as if the router is designed to be set up using a wifi connection to the router (which is different from how things used to work) because there is no mention of connecting the computer to the router at all (only connecting the router to
 the modem).<br />
<br />
In the past, router configuration instructions recommended that you do the configuration while connected by Ethernet cable so that you could make changes to the wifi configuration settings (e.g., the SSID or network name and the encryption method and password)
 without getting disconnected in the middle of things.&nbsp; This is still how Linksys explains how to do tings manually --&gt;
<a href="http://kb.linksys.com/Linksys/ukp.aspx?pid=80&amp;vw=1&amp;articleid=3687" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">DSL</a> or
<a href="http://kb.linksys.com/Linksys/ukp.aspx?pid=80&amp;vw=1&amp;articleid=3686" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Cable</a><br />
If nothing seems to happen during setup when you're not connected to the router, then connect an Ethernet cable as you described.<br />
<br />
I couldn't find anything about a Canon Artisan 845, but remember that all wireless devices (computers and printers) on your wifi network need to use the same type of encryption: WPA2, WPA, or (undesirably) WEP.&nbsp;

            You don't need a router for that.<br />
<br />
Without a router, you can create a wireless ad-hoc network between the laptop and the printer.&nbsp; See, for example,
<a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?cc=us&amp;lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;docname=c00205926" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=xp+wireless+printer+ad+hoc&amp;oq=xp+wireless+printer+ad+hoc&amp;gs_l=hp.3...177354.178795.1.179323.8.8.0.0.0.3.160.931.4j4.8.0...0.0...1c.1.9.psy-ab.Zx8lfGYKtXY&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.45512109,d.dmg&amp;fp=4606f5cc3f66e665&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=1061" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Many
 more Google hits</a><br />
<br />
The security issue is that XP only supports WEP encryption (easily hacked) in wireless ad hoc mode. On the other hand, nobody is going to get very far attempting to log into your printer. Just make sure that you don't leave the laptop with the wireless ad hoc
 network active when you're not printing.<br />
<br />
If you get an inexpensive wireless router, you can connect the laptop to the router either by an Ethernet cable or wireless.&nbsp; In this configuration, you'll be able to use the most secure wireless security (WPA2 or WPA) that the weakest link (laptop or printer)
 supports.<br />
<br />
In either case, don't install (or disable) File and Printer Sharing for Microsoft Networks in the Properties of the laptop's network adapter.<br />
<br />
Of course, of the three devices, only the laptop is likely to be able to operate without 110vac available, so you'll have to buy some sort of power supply to convert the 12vdc from the truck.&nbsp; Make sure that you add up all of the power requirements of the devices
 you likely will use in order to get an inverter/converter of sufficient capacity.&nbsp; I don't have any specific recommendations, but I do suggest that you research this a bit and don't go for the cheapest product.<br />

<h2>            Does MS14-080 &#40;KB3008923&#41; supersede MS14-065 &#40;KB3003057&#41; for Windows 7 x64</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does KB 3008923 in MS14-080 actually supersede KB 3003057 in MS14-065? I am seeing mixed information from different sources.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The security bulletin for MS14-080 shows that the new KB, 3008923, replaces 3003057.</p>
<p><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms14-080.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms14-080.aspx</a></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If I check in WSUS for the supersede information, it shows that KB 3003057 is not superseded by any updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/426de343-a629-4b67-b160-0515bb8edcee" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Looking at MS14-080, it lists KB 3003057 as superseded.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/be07c7aa-2d35-4d1f-b5dd-44dfeecdcb64" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I do notice that in WSUS, KB 3003057 lists that it supersedes the same KB as it self, KB 3003057. I am assuming this is due to the re-release on December 9, 2014 as listed in the revision notes on the MS14-065 security bulletin.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Based on the revision note, it mentions that the re-release can be applied or apply 3008923. Since both updates list the original KB 3003057 as superseded,&nbsp;is the re-release 3003057 supposed to be superseded by 3008923 or are they the latest available currently
 and not superseded yet? Is this working as designed or could there be a bug in the supersede information?</p>

<h2>            Windows Vista the computer freezes when trying to enter the password.</h2>
                    After Booting up Windows Vista (Home Premium) the mouse works, etc. I can select a profile. But as soon as I start to type in the appropriate password everything freezes up leaving me no choice but to shut down, reboot and try again with the same result.<br />
<br />
It does not matter which profile I use - Administrator or a User. I tried the reset password disk but that too freezes up as soon as I am asked to enter a new password.<br />
<br />
One User profile does not have a password. I can get in with that account and the computer runs fine. Until I try to do something requiring Administrator permissions. As soon as I go to type the password - FREEZE.<br />
<br />
What are my options?<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Try StartUp Repair with a Vista disk, you can borrow a friends if needed, they are not copy protected.<br />
<br />
Good luck.

<br />Hit Enter
<br />Under the General tab, click in the Open File Explorer to then choose  "This PC". 
<br />
<br />Try WinKey + E now. If it opens fine, then the problem is with Quick access cache, which can be cleared by deleting *.automaticDestinations-ms from the following directory, using Command Prompt.

<br />Then navigate to that folder. 
<br />
<br />Could be an issue with your display driver.
<br />
<br />uninstall your display driver then restart

<h2>            Chrome won&#39;t launch in Windows 8 mode&#63;</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When I click the "Relaunch in Windows 8 mode" in Google Chrome nothing happens. Chrome in desktop closes/disappears and then nothing else happens. When I go to open from the desktop shortcut afterwards, Chrome opens and loads the tabs I had before i tried
 to launch into windows 8 mode. Chrome doesn't appear on my all apps page in the start screen, but I can type it in (only in full name of 'chrome') and find it but it still doesn't load in windows 8 mode. The programs is set as my default in all possible instances.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance,&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />

            This issue also happens with internet explorer. I can't open explorer in windows 8 mode unless i click on a link in an app and have made IE my default browser. I can't open it in Win 8 mode just by clicking the tile.

    <title>How do I import emails from Windows Live and different computer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mariatess  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I import emails from Windows Live and different computer</h2>
                    <p>First, I changed my old PC in Windows 7 for a new one in Windows 10. In Windows 7 I used Windows Live app for emails (my account is Non-outlook and I don't want to use outlook). I exported and saved my emails (archives most importantly) in USB storage before
 my old computer died. The files I want are in storage not saved online unless Windows Live saves it automatically somewhere somehow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I am opening Windows Mail app and there is no import function. How do I import my archives in? Did Microsoft completely discarded import email function so as to completely mess up people like me who have archives of emails not stored online nor use
 outlook email account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Couple of things: 1) I can't sync to my stored archives because they were not online anymore so no webmail.</p>
<p>2) I have no outlook account and I don't plan signing up and paying for Office 365 just to get outlook app working.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) I can't find download for Windows Live 2012 and I am not sure how to get Mail app to import emails from Windows Live.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I get my saved archived emails back into emails.</p>
<p>

<li>Copy the folders containing your mail archive to a new folder in your user profile (that's the folder called
<strong>C:\Users\</strong>{user}, where {user} is the name of your Windows user account).&nbsp;</li><li>Open the folder in File Explorer and select one of the folders containing messages. It looks a bit daunting, depending on your folder view settings. However, if you select
<em>Details</em> on the <em>View</em> tab, you can arrange to see the most important bits.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Right-click on a column heading and select <span style="font-style: italic">More</span>...&nbsp;<br />
Select at least <span style="font-style: italic">Subject</span>, <span style="font-style: italic">
From </span>and <span style="font-style: italic">Date</span>. <br />
Deselect <span style="font-style: italic">Date modified</span> and <span style="font-style: italic">
Type</span> and possibly <span style="font-style: italic">Size</span>. <br />
Click on column headings to sort, click and drag&nbsp;to rearrange the order of columns. You can't remove the unintelligible
<em>Name</em> column, but you can move it over to the right where it will normally be hidden.<br />
On the <em>View</em> tab, click <em>Preview pane</em> to enable/disable it. You should be able to read messages in the preview pane, but pictures may be disabled as a security measure.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You should now have a view of your mail messages that approximates to that in Windows Live Mail.
<br />
&nbsp;</li><li>If you do decide to go ahead and use the Mail app, note that you can <em>read</em> your archived messages in Mail. If you don't install any other mail client program that can read .eml files, double-clicking on an .eml file will open it in Mail. You can't
 do anything else with it, though (e.g. reply to it or forward it).</li></ol>

            Windows 7 does not like wireless USB network devices - especially if you're using older (Vista era) drivers.&nbsp; Here's my rant about these devices:<br />
I do not recommend using wireless USB devices.&nbsp; Especially in Win7 systems.&nbsp; <br />
These wireless USB devices have many issues with Win7 - and using Vista drivers with them is almost sure to cause a BSOD.&nbsp;
<br />
Should you want to keep using these devices, be sure to have Win7 drivers - <u><b>DO NOT use Vista drivers!!!</b></u><br />
An installable wireless PCI/PCIe card that's plugged into your motherboard is much more robust, reliable, and powerful.<br />
<br />
These devices are disabled:<br />
SonicWALL Virtual NIC&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ROOT\SWVNIC\0000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This device is disabled.<br />
<br />
Atheros AR8151 PCI-E Gigabit Ethernet Controller (NDIS 6.20)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PCI\VEN_1969&amp;DEV_1073&amp;SUBSYS_E0001458&amp;REV_C0\4&amp;354B1E15&amp;0&amp;00E2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This device is disabled.<br />
<br />
Bluetooth Device (Personal Area Network) #2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; BTH\MS_BTHPAN\6&amp;FA2531A&amp;0&amp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This device is disabled.<br />
<br />
Either remove the device and it's software from the system - or re-enable the device and update it's drivers (then disable them again if so desired).<br />
<br />
Please uninstall Gigabyte EasySaver and EasyTune6 software - as they are known to cause BSOD's in some Win7 systems.<br />
Please uninstall the GIGABYTE On/Off Charger as it is known to cause BSOD's on some Win7 systems.<br />
<br />
If this doesn't stop the BSOD's, please run Driver Verifier according to these directions:&nbsp;

    <title>Windows Spotlight - Erratic Behaviour - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> trevorfayers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Spotlight - Erratic Behaviour</h2>
                    <p>Rather than add to the very long discussion threads on the subject of Windows Spotlight, I'm starting another to ask others whether they are experiencing Spotlight behaving erratically of late.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following problems some time ago with Spotlight not downloading and showing new images on the lock screen, I ran the 'Reset_and_re-register_Windows_Spotlight.bat' (available through other links in the Community) and have re-run that a few times, since, when
 Spotlight didn't download or show new images for a number of days. That utility fixes Spotlight for me, at least for a number of weeks or months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>More recently, ever since shutting down my Surface every workday evening and weekend, Spotlight has invariably downloaded new images and shown a new image every weekday that I turn the Surface on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the last couple of weeks, however, I have noticed that the advert text and the 'I like it/Not a fan' text doesn't always appear every day on the lock screen. Shutting down and restarting or switching the Lock screen setting to picture and back to windows
 spotlight during the day when the text doesn't appear doesn't fix that, but a new image and text appears the next day (I've also very recently had this issue on another of my laptops). Then, this week, despite my daily shutdown routine, new images have not
 been downloaded every day, but every other day, and a new image doesn't appear every day on the lock screen. Have others experienced this of late, if so please let me know?</p>

            Hi Trevor
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Try resetting Spotlight manually through the registry to see if it corrects this problem:
<br />
<br />To reset Windows Spotlight in Windows 10, please follow the steps below:
<br />
<br />    Open the Run window by pressing Windows+R keys and then select a user.
<br />    Type in regedit and hit Enter to open the Registry Editor.
<br />    Once in, navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Lock Screen\Creative, then select the user.
<br />    In the right pane, look for CreativeJson key and double click it.
<br />    Normally, this key have a long string of parameters in the Value field. If the value field is blank, then the value has to be changed.
<br />    Click on the Value Data field. Tap Ctrl+A to select all the hidden elements in the Value Date field. Press Ctrl+C to copy and paste it in Notepad.
<br />    Look for feedbackprovided, probably in the fourth line and set the value to false.
<br />    Once done, press Ctrl+A to select the entire string, copy it, and then paste it back in the CreativeJson field.
<br />
<br />I would also make sure you are running the latest version of Windows 10:

<p>Many thanks for your response and that from Ganesh. Yes, my Windows 10 installation is right up-to-date including today's cumulative update. I will hold off resetting Spotlight for now, unless it really does start irritating me. Also, I have noticed that
 the half-year Windows updates appear to have the effect of resetting Spotlight, so I will probably hold off until after the 19H1 update.</p>

            <p>Hi Tony-holt,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The situation that you are describing can usually be fixed by performing a
<b>Power Cycle</b> on the laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perform the following.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Shut down the computer.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Unplug <b>everything</b> from the computer. This includes the AC Adapter, Modems and Routers, and external devices, such as printers, drives, USB devices, etc. Nothing should be left plugged into the
 computer.</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Remove the battery.</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Wait <b>30 Seconds</b>.
<b>Press and hold the Power Button</b> on the laptop for <b>15 seconds</b>. This will drain all of the excess electrical energy out of the laptop.</p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Plug <b>everything</b> back into the computer, including the AC Adapter and battery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span>Start the computer and check the results to see if the problem is resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know the results.</p>

    <title>Addressing Common Windows 10 Complaints - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Addressing Common Windows 10 Complaints</h2>
                    <p>It seems like every time I turn around, I'm seeing someone else on this board complain about something in Windows 10, and how awful it is because it doesn't work
<em>their</em> way.&nbsp; This is a friendly word of warning to anyone who feels the need to post something like that:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10, bluntly, is a product of market forces; yes, it's being shaped by feedback from the Windows Insider community and the broader Windows 10 userbase, but it's still a product for the modern OS market.&nbsp; It's come a long way since December 2014, when
 I first started using it, and I attribute many of those gains (and some bug fixes too) to feedback from Insiders like me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But folks, the Windows 10 paradigm is here to stay.&nbsp; It's remained fairly consistent the entire time I've used it, especially since the XAML Start menu was introduced, and it's not going to change based on the opinions of a small minority of you, no matter
 how shrill and annoying you want to be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't like the XAML Start menu?&nbsp; You have Start10 and many other third-party apps to change it.</p>
<p>Don't like the live tiles in the Start menu?&nbsp; It's the work of about 60 seconds to turn them all off.</p>
<p>Don't like the Metro/Universal apps?&nbsp; You can uninstall them.&nbsp; For built-in apps, there's a Powershell command you can use.</p>
<p>Don't like Cortana?&nbsp; You can turn her off.</p>
<p>Don't like the design aesthetic?&nbsp; There's an Aero Glass app out there that restores the full and complete Aero Glass experience.&nbsp; Yours for just a few dollars.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't like Windows 10?&nbsp; <strong>Nobody's forcing you to use it.&nbsp; Downgrade to 7 or 8, or whatever OS you prefer, and stop complaining.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The purpose of the Windows Insider Program is for tech-saavy users to try out advance builds, and provide feedback to help make the continuing development of Windows better.&nbsp; It is
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>not</strong></span> a platform for you to spew attacks against Microsoft because you dislike aspects of Windows 10.&nbsp;
<strong>Threads like "they're not giving me what I want, so it sucks" are highly inappropriate and have no place on this board.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, like any other smart business, is listening to all the feedback it gets from its users.&nbsp; (I assure you,
<em>all</em> our voices are being heard.)&nbsp; The suggestions that they implement are the ones that resonate with the greatest shares of the market, and which pass the "common sense" test.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why, after everything they've done to develop Cortana for the desktop platform, would they turn around and remove it?</p>
<p>Why, after restoring Aero to the GUI, would they turn around and remove it again?&nbsp; Or, the inverse, why would they restore the old version from Windows 7, which would slow the OS down and rob Windows 10 of one of its best attributes--being lightweight and
 fast?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some of you seem to think that just because they're not doing what <em>you</em> want, they don't care about what
<em>any</em> users want.&nbsp; <strong>It's complete and utter narcissism to take that worldview, and I'm sick and tired of seeing it.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>For the sake of argument, let's take four of the most common complaints that I've been seeing, and think about what might happen if the changes were made that the posters seem to want:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1)&nbsp; Remove Cortana.</strong>&nbsp; Forgetting the question of why MSFT would just reverse course and pull out this major function that's integrated across the OS, and that they spent countless dollars and man-hours perfecting for us, what would be the
 result?&nbsp; Microsoft will have removed a function that, by any objective measure, has seen heavy use (there's an article that lists the number of questions people have asked, if I can find it I'll link to it--the number is quite large), and make it harder to
 access for users that like it.<strong>&nbsp; No sane business will ever do a thing like that.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2)&nbsp; Remove the Store/Metro apps.</strong>&nbsp; Folks, this is never going to happen, plain and simple.&nbsp; Every other major software maker out there has an "app" store of some kind--Apple does, Google does.&nbsp; Microsoft was a bit late to the game, but now
 that they're in it, they're making it work for their platform, and I for one love the move.&nbsp; What sense would it make to now completely strip out the entire app system from Windows?&nbsp; None--because Metro apps work very well on every platform that runs Windows
 10, as they were meant to.&nbsp; Removing that would remove a major attractor for people with an entire Windows "family" of devices, and would signal a retreat from the mobile world altogether.&nbsp; This despite the fact that they're actively trying to capture a share
 of the mobile market with this exact function, and withdrawing from making it an active function would essentially cede that market share to Google and Apple.&nbsp;
<strong>No sane business will ever do a thing like that.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3)&nbsp; Bring back the Windows 7 Start menu.</strong>&nbsp; Actually, the Windows 10 Start menu is an improvement over the old one in every way--you still have folders where necessary, but by and large, your primary functions are immediately available.&nbsp; Add
 to that the fact that you can still search for things if you don't want to scroll.&nbsp; And it also strikes a great compromise between the classic Start menu and the Windows 8 Start screen, with touch-friendly live tiles parked next to your apps list.&nbsp; It's efficient,
 simple, and highly customizeable.&nbsp; Restoring the Windows 7 Start menu would give up what are (arguably) some of the best aspects of the XAML Start menu, and tick off what I assume to be many people like me that appreciate the modernized design.&nbsp; More than
 that, the cascading-menu design <em>is</em> a little dated--and I'm saying that as someone who uses Windows 7 on one computer and Windows 10 on seven others.&nbsp; It actually takes me less time to find the programs I want on my Windows 10 machines than it does
 on the Windows 7 one.&nbsp; Remove the new Start menu, and you not only throw away all that money and effort, but also make it less efficient.&nbsp;
<strong>No sane business will ever do a thing like that.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>4)&nbsp; Add options for everything.</strong>&nbsp; The chief complaint from people I label as trolls is that there aren't enough options during setup, not enough opportunities to set Windows up
<em>just</em> the way they want it.&nbsp; (See #1 and #2.)&nbsp; These statements are being made by people who clearly have no grasp of how software works.&nbsp; For one thing, Cortana is a complex program, integrated (fairly seamlessly I'd say) with many functions of Windows
 10, and I find it hard to imagine you could make something that elaborate an optional add-on, certainly not without complicating how certain other functions work.&nbsp; Second, for every option you build in, that's another step in the install process, which means
 a user has to make a selection--and for as many options as the people I deem trolls are demanding, it would make for a hopelessly complicated setup process.&nbsp; I, for one, love that the Windows 10 install process is as efficient as it is.&nbsp; Then let's talk about
 the programming piece--the installer would have to be configured with all these different options, and for every possible combination, a specific set of install instructions prepared.&nbsp;
<strong>Developers have better things to do with their time than all that.</strong>&nbsp; Microsoft is doing the smart thing by preparing an installer with a few efficient options, and then letting the user adjust the OS as they see fit.&nbsp; If I was a business owner,
 I wouldn't waste a ton of time making an installer with variables for every single aspect of the OS like some of you seem to want--if you dislike something,
<strong>either use the options within the OS to change it, or find a third-party app that will.&nbsp; The install process isn't tailored for your specific wants and never will be.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll sum it up in just a few words:&nbsp; if you hate Windows 10 as much as some of you claim to,
<strong>this is a warning that you need to check your attitudes at the door on these boards.</strong>&nbsp; It's perfectly fine to say that you don't like something--that's the entire purpose of the Feedback app, after all, and for these boards as a whole--but those
 of you who want to hurl insults and take these wild, unfounded positions in the face of hard facts that prove you wrong, this is a notice that you need to find other ways to occupy your time.&nbsp; If you dislike Windows 10,
<strong>don't use it.&nbsp; Feel free to revert back to Windows 8 or Windows 7 or jump to another platform altogether.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've posted time and time again about how to change the Windows 10 interface to make it work like you want it to work, and yet I see the same people posting the same things time and time again.&nbsp; Ranting and raving about things you have the power to change
 will get you classified as a troll <strong>and you will be banned.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now clean up the attitudes and let's remember why we're here.</p>

</p><blockquote>I still prefer Windows 8.1 but that just goes to show that not everyone has the same needs and requirements for an enjoyable computing operating system...</blockquote>
<p>You and I have had our disagreements, but this I agree with 100%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To everyone else, this is an example of exactly what I've been saying.&nbsp; If Windows 10 doesn't meet your requirements and/or satisfy your tastes, there
<em>are</em> alternatives out there.&nbsp; You should use what you like best, and I don't see any harm in someone saying that Windows 8.1 suits them better than Windows 10.&nbsp; Like the color socks you wear, it's just a matter of personal taste.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I--and many others on this board--have a problem with is someone saying that because a pair of socks isn't purple with green stripes, that pair is terribly designed.&nbsp; I don't know anyone who shops for clothing that way, and I don't see why anyone would
 adopt a different mindset with their OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>trbogt did exactly the right thing--to use the metaphor, admitting the purple-and-green motif wasn't for him, before finding socks that better fit his tastes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The latter part is something I see people seeming to gloss over...behaving as if there's only one brand and color of socks out there.&nbsp; You may not find one that perfectly fits what you want, but there may be another brand that can get you closer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's all I'm asking for from anyone else.&nbsp; Instead of simply saying "Croft &amp; Barrow is a terrible company because their socks don't have this unique pattern that I want," at least try and find something else from Croft &amp; Barrow that you
<em>do</em> like.&nbsp; Failing that, no reason not to give the folks at Cotton, Inc. or Hanes a try.&nbsp; No matter what, hurling insults at Croft &amp; Barrow won't get you anywhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Does Croft &amp; Barrow even <em>make</em> socks?)</p>

            <p>Just to be clear, there are any number of bones of contention that I have with Windows 10, and trust me when I say that I've been anything but shy in making those feelings known.&nbsp; But what I think some people fail to take into account is this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft is developing a product for us (and by "us" I mean consumers, enterprises, everyone).&nbsp; They want us to tell them what works and what doesn't, so they can make changes.&nbsp; Based on my experience using it these last 15 months, I can tell you with 100%
 certainty they're listening to us.&nbsp; Features we users have asked for have since materialized in the OS, after all--we have Aero back, and now people like me can have our 4th column of Start menu tiles if we want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, logically there's no way they can implement every suggestion they get.&nbsp; Even a company like MSFT has limited money and manpower available--so they have to prioritize based on a couple of different factors:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Is a suggested change practical to implement?</li><li>Does the requested change represent a significant enough portion of all requests for us to consider?&nbsp; (Put another way, would the cost of implementing it yield equal or greater benefits?)</li><li>Would implementing the change cause unintended secondary effects elsewhere in the OS, for which we'd have to test and correct?</li></ul>
<p>This is one reason why I get frustrated sometimes when people demand that all Metro apps be removed, or that Cortana be jettisoned.&nbsp; Not only are both of those (likely) impractical, I doubt whether there's enough demand for Microsoft to even consider it
 (not enough people are asking for it).&nbsp; Implementing those changes would almost certainly also wreak havoc on other parts of the OS, which would require their own testing and development efforts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They've only got so many resources they can put towards implementing user feedback.&nbsp; If I were a smart business owner, I'd prioritize the most critical fixes first (those things that cause crashes, or those blasted "video driver stopped responding and has
 recovered" errors), and mix in the most popular user-requested changes as I went.&nbsp; That's clearly what Microsoft is doing, and I think that's the right approach.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We should be grateful they're allowing us to continue to have input on the direction Windows 10 takes.&nbsp; When we provide rational, reasoned feedback, it helps improve the product--but when we start attacking Microsoft like some people are wont to do, saying
 things are awful and that they suck and so forth, they stop listening (and again, are right to do it).&nbsp; I know that if I were developing Windows, I'd strike inputs from any user who behaved the way some people around here have behaved; it's a matter of prioritizing
 inputs from people who want to make improvements, versus those who aren't going to be happy no matter what we do.</p>

            <p>I'll also add that I've been particularly harsh with several users on this board for, in my assessment, behaving like trolls.&nbsp; One of those users commented earlier today that no matter what they posted, they expected me to term their post as unconstructive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to set the record straight on that one...I don't expect everyone to link arms and sing Koombaya, nor do I expect that everyone's always going to agree with me.&nbsp; I think Windows 10 is great but with some room to improve.&nbsp; Some of you think differently,
 and that's fine--I don't ask that everyone agree with me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I've ever asked for is that we try to stay civil, towards each other certainly, but especially towards Microsoft.&nbsp; If you dislike something, please do say so--but tell why.&nbsp; If you dislike the Start menu, give your reasons and let's talk about
 it--don't just say "it sucks" like so many seem inclined to do.</p>

            <p>A lot of the requests are just that - requests. At least the ones that I've seen have been. Most of the time the requests, or those making the requests, are belittled because their requests are so last year or worse. Eventually things get out of hand and
 you wind up with a heated argument and some people losing their Insider IDs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think a lot of people see the lack of options as a big problem. They wonder why the options were taken away, and would like them put back in. They don't think it would be too hard a task because the settings are still available through registry edits,
 the settings in the interface has just been removed. After all, it took some effort to take them out, they wonder why they can't just be put back in?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other requests are things they would like to see added in the OS. For example, if I'm installing Windows 10 on a desktop computer, I don't need a phone app, so either give me the option to not install it, or uninstall it later. This is something that should
 be a simple fix and not require much time. It may not be the most requested, but it should be a simple fix. Some think it is something that should have been caught in development stages. Someone should have thought, "They might not want our app, so let's give
 them the option to either not install it, or uninstall it later like we did in previous versions of Windows".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, we can all learn to just live with Windows 10, or we can make suggestions for things that we think would make it better. That was the whole intent of the Insider Program - to make Windows 10 better. Everyone has different opinions about what would make
 Windows 10 better. Some want the Windows 8 start screen, some like the current Windows 10 start menu, and some would prefer a start menu like in previous versions with more options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some get pretty vocal in their criticism of both MS and the people making the suggestions. I agree, it should stop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 3.1 had an option to configure just about everything. With every version of Windows, options just keep disappearing. With Windows 10 there are very few options available, and I think people probably just want them put back in, but they would probably
 settle for an explanation. Something along the lines of "This is why we removed the options, and this is why", would probably suffice. I think that would go a long way towards getting rid of the friction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think what may be missing is some acknowledgement (could be I missed it) from the Insider Program about some of the suggestions, and why they won't be implemented, why they were taken out in the first place, or if they plan on implementing them in a future
 release. A scoreboard of most requested items, and the likelihood of implementation might also help. At least then people would know their suggestions were being considered.</p>

            <p>Don't want to sound contentious, but on the four points mentioned in the OP, here's my take:</p>
<p><strong>1)&nbsp; Remove Cortana.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>It isn't about MS reversing course. Some people just don't want Cortana. They'd just prefer to be able to uninstall it, but if they can't, they'd like to disable it. They aren't suggesting it be removed for everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2)&nbsp; Remove the Store/Metro apps.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Not everyone is in love with the Store/Metro apps. There should be an option for those people to be able to remove or disable whatever they don't want to use. Again, they're not suggesting the Store/Metro apps be removed for everyone. They just want the
 option to do it for themselves.</p>
<p>
&nbsp;
</p><p><strong>3)&nbsp; Bring back the Windows 7 Start menu.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually, I think all they want are options. I think they would be fine with an XAML start menu if it had the customization options that they had in previous versions. I know I would. Granted, for me anyway, it is a huge improvement over the Windows 8 start
 screen, but it doesn't go far enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cascading menus don't matter to me. I'd just like to be able to get rid of those letters of the alphabet, be able to drag and drop menu items, right-click and create a shortcut(menu item), and get to the properties of a menu item so I can change it if I
 need to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a side note, I must be on a different version of Windows 10 because I don't have a "highly customize-able" start menu. Mine has zero options for what I consider customization. Removing or re sizing for Metro Apps is not what I consider highly customize-able.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>4)&nbsp; Add options for everything.</strong></p>
<p>Why not? Windows had options before. Why not now? If there is a good explanation for it, I'd be willing to listen. Just saying that developers have better things to do with their time isn't a good explanation. They took the time to take
 it all out. They should be able to put it back for those that want it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, not trying to sound contentious. I'm just trying to play devil's advocate here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When someone puts a product on the market, they should make the product the way the consumer wants it. If they don't, the the product won't sell. In this case, the product is "free" for qualified users, so maybe that analogy isn't all that good.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The point is, if they want people to use the product, they have to make it where people want to use it - free or not. If people don't install it, it is the same as not selling the product.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This isn't a "one size fits all" product. People want to customize the OS. If they can't, they'll go elsewhere, which is something we should all be trying to avoid. No one should be telling anyone to go elsewhere if we don't like the OS.</p>

            <p>All the points made in the 1st post are valid, yes W10 has improved over time, and no doubt will continue to. When it first came out I was getting calls from customers several times a day asking should they upgrade to W10, at the time the answer was NO -
 its to unstable, and even today a lot of my&nbsp; daily work is fixing W10 failed installs, but it is getting better once all the updates to the latest public release are done. currently 10586</p>
<p>
</p><p>The pet Annoyance is Cortana - or more to the point the lack of not being able to use it. From Microsoft's Own site:</p>
<p>
</p><p>To use Cortana, your region and language&nbsp;settings have to be aligned.&nbsp;See the following&nbsp;list of regions where Cortana is available, and the corresponding language for each of those regions.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Cortana is available in these regions for these languages:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Australia: English</p>
</li><li>
<p>Canada: English</p>
</li><li>
<p>China: Chinese (Simplified)</p>

<p>United Kingdom: English</p>
</li><li>
<p>United States: English</p>
</li></ul>
</li><li>
<p>Note: If you change your region, you might not be able to shop at the Store, or use things that you’ve purchased such as memberships and subscriptions, games, films, TV and music.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
Having to basically trick Cortana into thinking you are in the USA or any of the other workable countries is a PITA. !! please see the last bullet point - what a pain.

<p>Like quite a few I have been an Insider since early days of Windows 8.0</p>
<p>I prefer Windows 10 over 7 or 8</p>
<p>Also I do hate seeing feedback containing comments like.&nbsp; " I hate it going back to Unix" or&nbsp;containing profanity</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I can say.&nbsp; If you hate it, then why the heck are you an Insider. If you want to use swear words then MS should remove your rights to be an Insider</p>
<p>

                    Thanks for your help in advance. I have a Toshiba Satellite and I have accident turned off the Wifi on the soft buttons above the keypad a few different times but I was able to figure it out and turn it back on and restore my internet, but this time its
 something different and I cant fix it. Every option I try turning my Wifi back on, the Hardware Radio Switch as they call it, it says its off and to turn it back on but it wont let me turn in on anywhere! I have tried right clicking the Icon button at the
 bottom to turn it back on but it wont give me that option, I have also tried the F8 key and it just says that THE WIRELESS COMMUNICATION IS DISABLED AND TO PLEASE TURN IT BACK ON but again, no where will it let me turn it back on. I was going to Restore my
 Computer to an Earlier date but It wont let me go back far enough to a point where I THINK it would fix this problem. It seems like all of this started happening after I downloaded the TRIAL VERSION of the AVG Virus protection, I dont know if this has anything
 to do with it but I have completely uninstalled it and its still not working. Anyone who knows what to do or has information in fixing this problem would be MUCH APPRICIATED!&nbsp;:) Thanks again for helping me in advance, I hope someone has had this problem and
 knows how to fix it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Take care,

Hi Tim,<br />
<br />
</span><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Communities.
<br />
<br />
I understand how frustrating it could be when things do not work as expected. Please do not worry I will try my best to resolve it.<br />
<br />
Before we start troubleshooting on the issue please provide us with the additional information by answering few questions mentioned below, this will help us to troubleshoot better.</span></p>
<p>
<span>What is the model number of the laptop?<br />
<br />
</span><span>Wired and wireless network problems</span></p>
<span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/network-connection-problem-help#network-problems=windows-7&amp;v1h=win8tab1&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/network-connection-problem-help#network-problems=windows-7&amp;v1h=win8tab1&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1</a><br />
<br />
if the issue is that you are not able to Turn On the Wireless Switch then you may have to contact the laptop manufacturer.</span>

<h2>            Windows 10 mail app - edit outbox message</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;is it possible to edit a message that is sitting in an outbox (e.g., the message is not sent because the device is still offline)? If I go into folders-&gt;Outbox, I can see all the messages but clicking on an individual message the Mail app treats it as a
 fully sent mail (i.e., apart feom deleting I can "archive", "flag", etc...) Unforunately there does not seem to be an option of editing the message (except for copy-pasting into a new one and deleting the original)</p>

<h2>            Internet doesnt work after last windows 10 update &#40;wifi&#38; cable&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked all over the internet but i can't find a solution.<br />
<br />
Since the last win10 update I cannot connect to the internet. It keeps on showing that yellow trianlge, and says 'no internet, secured'.<br />
At first i thought that it might be possible that my drivers are out-dated. So downloaded some new drivers from intel and installed them. During the installation I had some issues with a non-unicode not fitting to display language which is quiet strange as
 my pc is installed in English. (see pic) When i clicked on 'ok' and not changing any settings it still says installation succesfull. Then it still not worked. so the problem might be there?<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/24a28ce0-726c-4651-916b-2a24411e834e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/24a28ce0-726c-4651-916b-2a24411e834e?upload=true" /></a><br />
I also used the trouble shooter. it says that my firewall is blocking the connection. I think this is impossible (but i might be wrong?) as i've tried serveral connections (home work etc)</p>
<p>I simply do not know what to do now. I really need my internet for my work! so if some could help me out.. that would be just wonderfull! :)</p>
<p>Hope to hear from you.</p>
<p>Kind regards </p>

            First you should run Internet Connections Troubleshooter and then execute Microsoft recommended troubleshooting steps. Update me once done.
<br />
<br />Skip a step if you have already done that.
<br />
<br />A. Run Internet Connections Troubleshooter
<br />Windows Key+I &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Click Internet Connections &gt; Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />B. Head to following Microsoft Help Link and execute the steps there
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br />
<br />Following is the content of the Help which you should try
<br />
<br />Things to try first
<br />Run the Network troubleshooter followed by networking commands
<br />Update the network adapter driver
<br />Roll back the network adapter driver
<br />Temporarily turn off firewalls
<br />Temporarily turn off any antivirus or malware-prevention software
<br />Uninstall the network adapter driver and restart
<br />Use network reset to reinstall network devices

<p>Thank you for the quick reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Option A doesn't work. It says: Troubleshooting couldn't identify the problem. you can try other options that might be helpful. (but there are no other options in this screen)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Option B:<br />
i've tried all of them. didnt work..</p>
<p>when i tried the network commands i think i got some errors.. however im not sure what it was supposed to say, therefore a picture of my screen.

            I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

            <p>Hello Sean,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for using Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. What is the make and model of the computer?<br />
2. Have you made any changes to your computer recently?<br />
3. Is it CPU fan which is creating noise?<br />
4. Is it a desktop or laptop?<br />
5. Is this behaviour occuring everytime or does this happens only when you try to record audio?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may follow these steps and check:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>a. Clean your computer's outer casing by using a can of compressed air. <br />
b. Make sure your computer is off before doing this. </p>
<p>c. Use the compressed air to gently blow bursts of air through ventilation holes, screens and where the fans are located.
</p>
<p>Dust can accumulate in these areas due to the air flow and restrict the passage of cool air, which can act as an insulator and increase internal temperatures. The fans will spin faster to compensate, and combined with the dust, will sound much louder.</p>
<p>d. Move your computer tower to an area with better ventilation. You may not need to move it far, but you want to make sure that you don't keep the tower in an enclosed space. Keep it away from walls and out of desk cabinets. This will hold in hot air and
 make your fans work harder to try to keep cool air flowing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are not comfortable, you may get in touch with the local tech shop to do this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please also check whether the CPU usage is high in task manager.<br />

    <title>When I creat shortcut keys, it doesnt work after restart. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            When I creat shortcut keys, it doesnt work after restart.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm trying to creat Shortkeys for games and softwares.</p>
<p>So as the guide in F1 says: I right click on the game's shortcut &gt; Properties &gt; then on the Shortkey line I type the keys I want (example: CTRL+Shift+M)&gt;&gt; OK.</p>
<p>Then I test it on and it works great, but unfortunately if I restart my computer (normaly) it "forget" it, and when I press the keys it does anything,</p>
<p>But it doesn't clear the (CTRL+Shift+M) from the line, it is still there when I check, just doesn't work..</p>
<p>So if I want to fix it I need to clear the line and Retype it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thats the whole problem, hope you got a sollution for me.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Yarden</p>

<h2>            Windows failed to start. A recent hardware or software change might be the cause.__</h2>
                    
<p>When I start my computer, it immediately goes to this screen:</p>
<p><br />
If Window files have been damaged or configured incorrectly, startup repair can help diagnose and fix the problem. If power was interrupted during startup, choose start windows Normally.<br />
<br />
Launch start up repair<br />
<br />
Start window normally<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Well i did the two options... and nothing works.</p>
<p>It tries to do startup repair, after afterwards, takes me to a screen where I select my language (US English) and then asks me to logon as an admin to see repair options.</p>
<p>I hit enter and it takes me to a screen with a bunch of different repair options, but none seem to work. When I try to do a system restore, it says there is a corrupt file on the disk, and it needs to be scanned and fixed for errors. However, when I do that,
 it gets about halfway through the files and stops. It won't let me continue scanning any further, and it won't finish the restore.</p>
<p>If I just start it as normal, it just gets stuck on the loading thingy, where it says MICROSFOT WINDOWS and keeps loading.... i let it for over 2 hours to no avail... and it does not let me restore my comptuer...!<br />
<br />
PLEASE HELP :(</p>

<h2>            STOP CODE&#58; Inaccessable Boot Device</h2>
                    After latest Win update I was getting constant Virus/Security warnings so I went &amp; deleted a lot of files that were installed the same date as the Win update. Wound up reinstalling Winn 10 &amp; then had to use bootable thumb drive which now only runs Win
 Diagnostics &amp; cannot boot my pc. The only other reference that I cannot access is: c:/windows/systerm32/logfiles/srt/srttrail.txt. Any thoughts?

            Hi Susan.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Start over and follow these illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Remember that you must boot the media as a UEFI device if you have the modern UEFI BIOS, then delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space, to get it cleanest and avoid building up a disk junkyard of old unused partitions wasting space.
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Thanks very much but neither of these options work anymore. It responds that it can not fix the problem goes into the same loop unless i choose to shut it down.
