<h2>            No admin rights after Window refresh and access denied to everything&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys, I have a sony laptop. I just came back from holiday and I found the laptop wouldn't start properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to turn on all fine 2 days ago but today the laptop wouldn't go past the Sony start up screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried everything but no joy so I ended up refreshing it (as it says it won't delete the files)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop finally started up but when I logged into my user account (which was admin), I found most of the icons on Window 8 page has disappeared and all the programmes are gone. It's weird as I still have all the files but nothing else.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to download some programs like Google Chrome etc&nbsp;but it says error. I also tried to save some files but it wouldn't let me click on the save button either so something really isn't right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have looked up posts online regarding similar problems but no joy. I just don't seem to have the admin rights although i'm still an admin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also try to make my acc have the owner but it still says access denied so nothing that I try to get myself have admin won't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's no app left on here like the Xbox live apps or any programs, app I installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no more ideas what to do as I've tried everything. I have tried RUN too but anything I try it says Error probably because I don't have admin rights.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One other thing I tried was making another Local account and then made the admin but that account can't do any more than what my main one is doing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone help me out with this or experienced anything similar that I might be able to try out?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

 &amp; boot) needs to be enlarged from it's current size of 259 MB. However there is a MSR Reserved partition of 128 MB immediately following it so I can't easily enlarge it. The instructions I have from the Mini Tool Partition Wizard says I can delete the 128
 MB partition and then enlarge the EFI system partition. &nbsp; I have read elsewhere that this 128 MB file can be deleted on non-bootable disks but my disk is the bootable disk so can I or can I not delete it? &nbsp; If I can't delete it, how can I make my active&amp;boot
 file larger so I can do updates?&nbsp;</span></span></span>

            <p>Hello John, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>How did you set the partition? We can try to <strong>partition hard drive of Windows 10 with Disk management</strong>, here’s how to:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Open <strong>Disk Management</strong> on Windows 10. To do so, press <strong>
Windows button + R</strong>, then type <strong>Diskmgmt.msc</strong> in the Run dialog box to open Disk Management.
</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc0b313f-2472-406f-abea-32f318ef7a8f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc0b313f-2472-406f-abea-32f318ef7a8f" /></a></li><li><span>Look for <strong>hard disk partitions</strong> at the <strong>Start Menu</strong> or you can try searching using the
<strong>Search</strong> <strong>Tool</strong>. Right click the hard drive and select
<strong>Shrink Volume</strong>. </span></li><li><span>Right click on the unallocated space and select <strong>New Simple Volume</strong>. Enter
<strong>New Simple Volume Wizard</strong> interface by clicking <strong>Next</strong> and specify volume size.</span></li><li><strong><span>Assign Drive Letter or Path</span></strong><span>, then format the partition into default system NTFS. Click
<strong>Finish</strong> to complete creating a new partition in Windows 10. </span>
</li></ol>
<p><strong><span>Reminder</span></strong><span>: It's a bit of complex to try Disk Management in Windows 10 to partition hard drive. We highly recommend to backup important data in hard drive. Be careful while you are doing the above operations. Mistake operation
 may get all your data lost. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>Let us know how it goes. </span></p>

            <p>I think you are asking me to create a new partition using space from my hard drive (C:). &nbsp;But I thought that my active&amp;boot (EFI system partition) needed to be enlarged in order for the Windows 10 updates to begin working again. If I do what you are asking
 the new partition will not be continuous with the EFI system config. &nbsp; I am including 2 screen shots, one with my file system as seen by the Mini Tool Partition Wizard and the second as seen by disk management.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see, the 128 MB file shows as immediately following the EFI System Partition on the Mini Tool, but it does not show on Disk Management. &nbsp;In fact, it appears that my EFI System partition shows twice on the disk management tool. &nbsp;How can that be?
 &nbsp; I am afraid to do anything since the disk management tool and Mini Tool seem to disagree on my partitions. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But back to what you want me to do. &nbsp; If I create a new partition using space from my C: disk, how will that help Windows Updates to begin functioning again? &nbsp; I don't think you understand my problem.</p>

            <p>Here's a screenshot using Easeus. &nbsp;You can see that it shows yet another list of partitions on my disk. &nbsp; That &nbsp;makes 3 different disk partition programs with 3 different results. &nbsp; How in the world is someone supposed to make sense of this? &nbsp; I thought
 maybe I could move the 128 MB partition using this program, but no, resize/move is not an option when selecting the 128 MB partition. &nbsp;If I can't move the partition and I can't enlarge the EFI System reserved partition because of the immovable 128MB partition,
 then I think I will just give up and not do any more Windows 10 updates as trying to fix this problem may cause more headaches then not updating. &nbsp; Maybe I'll buy a new PC so I can get a new set of problems.</p>

            <p>Since I've received no response from MS support in about a week now, I assume they have no idea how to help me or truly don't understand what I need to do so I will try some things I read about elsewhere. &nbsp; Even though I have read several places that I can
 delete the 128 MB partition with no bad consequences, I think what I'll try is to unallocate about 1 GB of space from my C: drive and move my SYSTEM partition there. &nbsp;I have read in more than one place that it matters not where the System partition is on disk.
 &nbsp;I'll let anyone who's interested know what happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And thank you MS support for all of the NON help I've received. &nbsp;You've been of no help and I suspect that English is not your first language. &nbsp; &nbsp;If it is, then you must have flunked English in High School.</p>

            <p>I deleted the 128 MB reserved partition and extended the EFI system reserved partition to include the now unallocated 128 MB space using MiniTool. &nbsp;The total size of the EFI partition is now around 388 MB. Before applying both changes I cloned my SSD drive
 so that I could replace the boot drive in my laptop should it no longer be able to boot up. &nbsp; After applying the changes, I did a system reboot and everything was fine. &nbsp;I ran for a while and then I applied the latest Microsoft updates that I have heretofore
 been unable to apply. &nbsp; That took about 1/2 hour. &nbsp; The reboot caused by those updates also worked fine and I am now running with the latest Windows 10 updates. &nbsp;I checked the size of my EFI system reserved partition after applying the updates and the increase
 in size was small ( 200K ). &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can clone your hard drive as I did so that you have a backup boot disk then I would advise you to try deleting the 128 MB reserved partition.</p>

<h2>            How to delete System Error Dump Files completely</h2>
                    <p>No Matter how many times I run dick clean up, I can not delete "System Error Memory Dump Files" or 'System Error Memory Dump Files Per User' ...I am also having difficulty deleting all of &nbsp;my &nbsp;"Temporary Files". I can never get the number to "zero". I delete
 them, shut down and start back up and the number hasn't changed...and in some cases it goes up.</p>
<p>I never had this problem before I upgraded to windows 8.1 a few moths ago. I'm frustrated,&nbsp;so any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. </p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Several factors are responsible to get the dump and temporary internet files get created:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Page file must be on OS drive</span></li><li><span>Page file base allocation size must be &gt; than installed physical RAM</span></li><li><span>Windows Error Reporting (WER) system service should be set to MANUAL</span></li><li><span>Set page file to system managed on the </span><span>OS drive</span></li><li><span>Set system crash/recovery options to "kernel Memory Dump"</span></li><li><span>User account control must be running.</span></li><li><span>Sometimes SSD drives with older firmware do not create DMPS (update firmware)</span></li><li>Cleaner&nbsp;applications&nbsp;like Ccleaner delete DMP files so dont run them until you are fixed.</li></ul>
<p>Ideally, they can never be zeroed as any erroneous activity, big or small, gets reported and logged. However, if you delete the dump files on regular basis, this keeps your system performance optimized.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If, however, the size of the dump is too large, then you can try the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Go to the location: C:\windows\memory.dmp.</p>
<p>b) Try deleting it (or moving it to another location).</p>
<p>c) Now, run the <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/delete-files-disk-cleanup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Disk cleanup</a> and check what it reports.</p>

 bit defender). Isn't there some way to tell this to start as a "normal" app, and stay out of the background. I have already gone to "settings" and checked through that.</p>
<p>It got changed to run as a background process, it should be able to be changed back again one would think.</p>

</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>1) Right click on the Program

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>4) Select Run this program in compatibility mode (try different Operating systems) and select the operating system accordingly from the drop down list.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue still persists,</span><span> I suggest you to place the computer in a Clean boot state and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts. Follow the Microsoft KB article to perform clean boot on the computer:

    <title>Can&#39;t unlock sRGB color space profile file, Help&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sasha1977  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t unlock sRGB color space profile file, Help&#33;</h2>
                    I need to unlock the following file to install adobe cs4 on my windows vista system:<br />
<br />
C:\windows\system32\spool\drivers\color\sRGB Color Space Profile.icm<br />
<br />
I downloaded the 'unlocker 1.8.8' program but when I try to run in on the file, I get a message 'No locking handle found'. I tried to do 'install profile' as well, but nothing happens when I press this option. Also, when I go into the properties of the file
 &gt; security, it does not allow me to add 'full control' to either the 'system' or the 'administrators' account. I'm at a loss. Please help!<strong>

            Thank you for your reply! I was able to install adobe cs4 without unlocking the file after all. I followed solution 6 on the adobe forums page that you suggested above (adobe customer service suggested I do solution 1 and 6 and since I wasn't successful
 with solution 1, I did solution 6) and then quit all programs and restarted the computer. I then quit all the start up programs and tried installing again and it worked (the program was fully uninstalled before I did that). Thanks :-)

<h2>            Windows cannot find application. Steam Problem</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I'm struggling to launch the FSX app from either Steam or via the .exe. I think the problem has to do with windows rather than steam, as I have tried obvious solutions such as reinstall, clear apcache, verifying local files etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the only file I know of that has this problem.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Canceling Shopto Pre Paid Pre Order</h2>
                    
<p>Hi folks, just wondering if any of you had canceled a Shopto pre order that had already been paid in advance.</p>
<p>I cancelled F1 Race Stars on&nbsp;last&nbsp;Friday&nbsp;yet haven't received the money back into my Paypal yet, is this normal does it take a while? just thought they took it instantly as soon as I hit order&nbsp; surely they should repay it as soon as I cancel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Not sure about Paypal but if you use a card to pay for an order then cancel it, the money doesnt go back into your bank account but Shopto account as credit, you can ring them though and get it refunded to your bank account as i have done before.</p>

<h2>            Multiple Windows 10 Errors &#38; THEY JUST GET WORSE WITH EACH UPDATE&#33;</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span>Multiple Windows 10 Errors &amp; THEY JUST GET WORSE WITH EACH UPDATE!</span></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>First the Start Menu still goes out when ever Microsoft Edge or any other Stock Windows 10 App or Program stops responding and then crashes. Then these same programs don't work again until a restart of the computer; the same
 can be said with access to the Start Menu. I have noticed this thousands of times with Windows 10 since upgrading to Windows 10 Home from Windows 7 Home Premium on August 11th, 2015. Since then I have even had to deal with: "Critical Error: Start Menu and
 Cortana aren't working. We'll try fixing it for you the next time you log in." I finally never seen that error again after fixing it for the tenth time on November 1st, 2015. A few weeks later the Windows 10 Version 1511 Update/Upgrade was released and I thought
 all of these nightmare of problems with Windows 10 would finally be gone; boy was I wrong. It was still the exact same old Windows 10 problems minus the Critical Error: Start Menu and Cortana aren't working problem. Yet when ever Stock Windows 10 apps and
 programs would still crash the Start Menu would still go out with them and not respond to a left Mouse Click WHATSOEVER. When trying to reopen Microsoft Edge (the usual program I am using when the crashes occur since I don't use any of the other Stock Windows
 10 apps anymore and I NEVER even ever used Cortana for it SUCKS and I have Siri on my iPad if I really needed a personal assistance like Cortana I'd use Siri since it ACTUALLY WORKS!)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>The attached Screenshot shows EXACTLY what Microsoft Edge does after it crashes and stops responding when you attempt to reopen it. As you can see there is also a Task Manager Window open with it that even shows that Microsoft
 Edge "ISN'T" running even though it should be. The program doesn’t even show up under the "More Details" option either! Yet what does show up are stock Windows 10 Apps and Programs that aren't being used WHATSOEVER including Cortana and Microsoft OneDrive.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/979876be-16ac-4f92-aa64-e9ba7fcbcb85" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/979876be-16ac-4f92-aa64-e9ba7fcbcb85" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>I've constantly have run CMD Scannow and every other suggested CMD scan and have always gotten the same result: "No Integrity Violations Were Detected". I've even ran Windows PowerShell with it not doing a damn thing in regards
 to these either. And I am not the only person having all of these problems. I work for a Computer Repair shop and many of our customers using Windows 10 constantly report the exact same problems and since there is nothing that we can do with our own computers
 constantly getting the same problem as well as our customers the evidence clearly shows that the problem is 100% Windows 10 and Microsoft NEEDS to admit the Windows 10 Operating System is actually flawed and has failed miserably and ACTUALLY FIX IT so thousands
 of Windows 10 users around the world are not constantly plagued by these Windows 10 errors that Microsoft clearly doesn’t want to admit exist.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>In fact people are already blaming multiple third party software such as Dropbox, Avast, Norton, and so on and so forth for the "Critical Error: Start Menu and Cortana aren't working" because uninstalling just one of these
 programs seems to the fix the error. Yet the problem seems to be with the Windows 10 Windows Shell and Microsoft won't do any damn thing to fix it and it is pissing off thousands of Windows 10 users around the world and affecting all of these third party software
 manufacturers in a major negative way for they can't fix the problem since it isn't their software causing it, Microsoft won't admit there are any Windows 10 errors and are now forcing Windows 10 out onto those still using Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. What does
 Microsoft want everyone using a Windows OS computer to be using Windows 10 and constantly have problems with their computers? This is a very good way for Microsoft to lose business, but so be it if that is what they want; they will soon start losing many customers
 to other Computer OS manufactures such as Apple (MAC), Linux, Obuto, ect. for people want working computers and not ones Microsoft have made useless by forcing the Windows 10 Operating System on to them when it is clearly 100 flawed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>Well as stated, I have already tried EVERY fix suggested and possible to get Microsoft Edge to work right; so don't suggest any at all because I've tried them all. This post is really more to WARN unsuspecting Windows 10
 users about the flaws still within in Windows 10 that clearly haven't even been fixed yet and the Mainstream Public Release of Windows 10 was July 29th 2015; that was almost 7-8 months ago and yet you can't fix it? This is very extremely ridiculous Microsoft!</span></p>

            <p><strong>-YOU CAN DELETE THIS POST IF YOU WANT TO - JUST PLEASE TRY TO OFFER SOME HELP-</strong> There is one error where the system freezes up and then the time is wrong on the clock for over 10-15 minutes sometimes and then after the system responds again,
 it sometimes results in a Blue Screen Crash (ATTEMPTED_EXECUTE_OF_NOEXECUTE MEMORY (BRDvx64.sys))&nbsp;that I started a thread about here:
</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/windows-10-driverpowerstatefailure/fce19e7b-128d-4e7d-9a6a-d88252b2a490">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance/windows-10-driverpowerstatefailure/fce19e7b-128d-4e7d-9a6a-d88252b2a490</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried explaining this multiple times to the Microsoft-MVP that is replying but he isn't treating me right. He is accusing me of blaming Windows 10 when its an apparent&nbsp;Windows 10 error that precedes the Blue Screen Crash every time it happens. He is
 deleting my posts saying they aren't on topic for the error but they are. (And I am not blaming Windows 10, I am stating what I am seeing before the crash only.) Yet he is threatening to ban me from the forums for "not staying on topic" and "blaming Windows
 10".<br />
<br />
He keeps saying that the Blue Screen Crash is being caused by a third party driver or software program but he won't state the program even though he's had access to the Dump Files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I consider this really unhelpful on his part and his treatment of me and describing how the error is occurring and that a possible Windows 10 error (in this case a System Freeze up that usually results from Microsoft Edge crashing, or System &amp; Compressed
 Memory using all 6GB of my computer's RAM). Strangely, I can still play games like Star Trek Online for hours without having any system freezes or any blue screen crash as long as I haven't accessed or used Microsoft Edge prior to doing so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need help in finding the cause of this blue screen crash - ATTEMPTED_EXECUTE_OF_NOEXECUTE MEMORY (BRDvx64.sys). And really need to know what third party driver or app/program is causing it because everything installed on my computer I need either for work
 or for my duties at church when a computer is needed. Even though I work as a Computer Repair Technical this problem is sadly eluding me and my coworkers even though we've checked the Dump Files. I really don't want to be banned from this site just because
 a Microsoft-MVP wants to not see that I am telling only the truth in what I've observed leading up to this blue screen crash. I am also sorry if this post is against the Terms Of Use and the Microsoft Community Code of Conduct. I am just desperate in getting
 this Blue Screen crash solved/fixed and this Microsoft-MVP isn't being any help. I would privately message someone about this if I could but there doesn't seem to be a way to do so. I only have one Private Message open and I sent that a MVP a message about
 this issue and the blue screen problem Monday night. Please someone help!</p>

 Cortana aren't working. We'll try fixing it for you the next time you log in." I finally never seen that error again after fixing it for the tenth time on November 1st, 2015. A few weeks later the Windows 10 Version 1511 Update/Upgrade was released and I thought
 all of these nightmare of problems with Windows 10 would finally be gone; boy was I wrong. It was still the exact same old Windows 10 problems minus the Critical Error: Start Menu and Cortana aren't working problem. Yet when ever Stock Windows 10 apps and
 programs would still crash the Start Menu would still go out with them and not respond to a left Mouse Click WHATSOEVER. When trying to reopen Microsoft Edge (the usual program I am using when the crashes occur since I don't use any of the other Stock Windows
 10 apps anymore and I NEVER even ever used Cortana for it SUCKS and I have Siri on my iPad if I really needed a personal assistance like Cortana I'd use Siri since it ACTUALLY WORKS!)</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>The attached Screenshot shows EXACTLY what Microsoft Edge does after it crashes and stops responding when you attempt to reopen it. As you can see there is also a Task Manager Window open with it that even shows that Microsoft
 Edge "ISN'T" running even though it should be. The program doesn’t even show up under the "More Details" option either! Yet what does show up are stock Windows 10 Apps and Programs that aren't being used WHATSOEVER including Cortana and Microsoft OneDrive.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>I've constantly have run CMD Scannow and every other suggested CMD scan and have always gotten the same result: "No Integrity Violations Were Detected". I've even ran Windows PowerShell with it not doing a damn thing in regards
 to these either. And I am not the only person having all of these problems. I work for a Computer Repair shop and many of our customers using Windows 10 constantly report the exact same problems and since there is nothing that we can do with our own computers
 constantly getting the same problem as well as our customers the evidence clearly shows that the problem is 100% Windows 10 and Microsoft NEEDS to admit the Windows 10 Operating System is actually flawed and has failed miserably and ACTUALLY FIX IT so thousands
 of Windows 10 users around the world are not constantly plagued by these Windows 10 errors that Microsoft clearly doesn’t want to admit exist.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>In fact people are already blaming multiple third party software such as Dropbox, Avast, Norton, and so on and so forth for the "Critical Error: Start Menu and Cortana aren't working" because uninstalling just one of these
 programs seems to the fix the error. Yet the problem seems to be with the Windows 10 Windows Shell and Microsoft won't do any damn thing to fix it and it is pissing off thousands of Windows 10 users around the world and affecting all of these third party software
 manufacturers in a major negative way for they can't fix the problem since it isn't their software causing it, Microsoft won't admit there are any Windows 10 errors and are now forcing Windows 10 out onto those still using Windows 7 and Windows 8.1. What does
 Microsoft want everyone using a Windows OS computer to be using Windows 10 and constantly have problems with their computers? This is a very good way for Microsoft to lose business, but so be it if that is what they want; they will soon start losing many customers
 to other Computer OS manufactures such as Apple (MAC), Linux, Obuto, ect. for people want working computers and not ones Microsoft have made useless by forcing the Windows 10 Operating System on to them when it is clearly 100 flawed.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>Well as stated, I have already tried EVERY fix suggested and possible to get Microsoft Edge to work right; so don't suggest any at all because I've tried them all. This post is really more to WARN unsuspecting Windows 10
 users about the flaws still within in Windows 10 that clearly haven't even been fixed yet and the Mainstream Public Release of Windows 10 was July 29th 2015; that was almost 7-8 months ago and yet you can't fix it? This is very extremely ridiculous Microsoft!</span></p>

    <title>My Original Gamertag - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hiire  say:</h3>
<h2>            My Original Gamertag</h2>
                    
<p>When I first got my xbox 360, one of the first people to buy one in my location, I made a gamertag that was one of the only three letter gamertags still available:
<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>. At the time of it's creation the word/term had no meaning it was just a three letter gamertag that I made when I was around the age of 13. Unfortunately, about 3-4 years later I was forced to change my gamertag due to the term
 being turned into something it was not via the internet. Causing people to threaten to report my gamertag if I didn't do there bidding. Simply because I had a three letter gamertag and they knew they could report it enough time and get me banned from using
 the gamertag anymore. I feel the reporting system when referring to gamertags is unjust and unfair. As anyone can report your gamertag numerous times no matter what your gamertag is and get it removed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I feel it was unfair to force me to change my gamertag simply because a few people reported my gamertag for being "offensive" simply because I would kill them multiple times in halo 3 matchmaking. Numerous times I can recall when people would threaten to
 mass report my gamertag because I wouldn't let them get free kills on me? On top of this I've lost credit for many Halo 3 custom maps/game types I made. As the creator of the maps/game types still says
<strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>instead of saying my current gamertag.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have come to these forums in search of someone that could possibly guide me in the right direction of getting my original gamertag back. I feel this gamertag was in no way offensive to anyone and was simply banned because people reported it to "get back
 at me". I am willing to pay the fee of changing my gamertag back to my previous one.</p>
<p>Again I ask you, please let me have my original gamertag back. It honestly would mean the world to me if anyone could help me with this process or redirect me to someone who could. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks, <strong>[Mod Removed]</strong></p>

<p>Gamertags are not changed because you have been reported numerous times. It only takes one valid complaint. You can be reported a million time but your tag will only be changed if it violates the code of conduct, which yours did. You can sign into

<h2>            Do I have to wait till my subscription ends before i can redeem a new xbox live gold subscription&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have an Xbox live gold subscription expiring on the 4th of Feb. I bought another gift card for 3 months. When I try to redeem in, it says "Something went wrong" and it says either "Give it another try. If it doesn't work, go to [Xbox support site] for help (error code XBOS-5002)" or it says "Try again is a few minutes (ERROR CODE XBOS3008)". Do I have to wait till my current subscription expires? before I can redeem another Xbox live gold subscription?</p>

<p>In GENERAL, you can mix sizes of sticks in most motherboards, but results can/do vary. &nbsp;Install it and find out is your best shot at knowing for sure. &nbsp;You may put in the 8GB and 2GB and get nothing, get 10GB, get 8GB or get 2GB.</p>

                    When I sign in to my skype account, it opens to the account of my partner. He, on the other has to use my msn account and password to get to his skype account. How can we both sign in using our individual account so each of us get to our own skype accounts?
 Thanks

 with this update?&nbsp;Norton Internet Security would not load (every few days). Their tech support informed me that the problem is that this update is not installing. My internet connection is solid. If anyone has run into this issue, I would appreciate some guidance

            I also have the issue of the update not succeeding. I don't get an error message it just continues to run at 0% complete. I had this issue a month or so ago and finally managed to resolve it on my own as the Microsoft help wasn't much help at all. Unfortunately,
 I didn't record what I did to finally fix it. I didn't have to download anything and I didn't have a hard drive error. It was something simple that I needed to do but it took two days to figure out. If I manage to retrace my steps and fix this issue, then
 I'll report it here. <br />

            Thanks, if you do remember anything please let me know. One of the Microsoft Help guys ran a chkdsk already. My hard drive is 5 years old, so I'm thinking it's probably a good idea to replace it before it gives out permanently. Am working on that. After
 it's replaced, I'll run a chkdsk again but should be ok. Whether or not the updates are properly installed will remain to be seen. You're absolutely right about the Microsoft Help guys - not much help and many hours on the phone with them. Just trying to get
 to level 2 support is a nightmare. When I finally succeeded in having the ticket escalated, it took several more hours on the phone and in the end they (yes, they as I spoke with two separate techs!) didn't fix the issue, just hid the update.

    <title>Cannot activate windows 7 from upgrade key on clean install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> weizhengzr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot activate windows 7 from upgrade key on clean install</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am hoping someone can help me with this. &nbsp;After 10 transfers and various misrouted calls, I have not been able to resolve it.</div>
<div>Here's the story:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1) I bought a laptop which has Windows 7 Home Premium installed on it (I have the product key for that)</div>
<div>2) I decided to upgrade to Windows 7 Ultimate, so I bought a retail upgrade key from Amazon.com. &nbsp;(I have the key for that as well)</div>
<div>3) Everything was working fine until a few weeks ago where my computer is infected with a virus, so I had to wipe out my entire hard drive and try to reinstall windows.</div>
<div>4) So after reinstalling from scratch windows 7 ultimate, when I try to activate it with the upgrade key, I got hit with the infamous 0xC004F061 error where it tells me I cannot activate using an upgrade key on a fresh install.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>At this point I searched for internet resources, and found quite a few workarounds that supposed to work, but so far NOTHING has worked for me.</div>
<div>I have tried:</div>
<div>a) Changing the registry value of&nbsp;<span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Setup\OOBE\MediaBootInstall to 0 and rearm the license activation. &nbsp;That gave me same error when everyone else reports it should be working.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>b) I have tried to double install another windows 7 "upgrade" on top of the fresh install, that still didn't work and gave me the same error.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>c) I have tried pre-install and post install workarounds to make sure it thinks it's an upgrade, but none of those options worked for me, it still gave same error.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>d) I Have called into Microsoft activation center by phone, and gave product install ID, that only transfers me to 10 different people and eventually everyone gave me some run around or long
 hold times. &nbsp;So I still have no solution so far.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Any suggestions at this point would be welcomed. &nbsp;I am a legit windows license holder, I just need to get my windows activated after being forced into a fresh reinstall but only with an upgrade
 key and the original windows home premium key.</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>

            Hello TylerH111,
<br />
<br />In particular case, I would recommend making use of a utility in Windows called DiskPart. For the following instructions, any commands listed in quotation marks should be typed without the quotation marks.
<br />
<br />1. Press the Windows and R key at the same time. A Run prompt will appear, type in cmd and click OK. Command Prompt window will appear. 
<br />2. Type "diskpart" into the Command Prompt window to run DiskPart.
<br />3. Once DiskPart has loaded, type "list disk" to list all of the drives on the computer.
<br />4. Type "select disk X" (replace X with the number that represents your SD card, the easiest way to tell is by the size of the disk, which should closely match the size of your SD card)
<br />5. Type "clean" to run the clean utility, which will remove any data on the SD card.
<br />6. Type "create partition primary" to create a new partition on the SD card.
<br />7. Type "select partition 1" (it should be the newly created partition from Step 6)
<br />Step 8. Type "format fs=ntfs quick" to format the partition to the desired file system.
<br />9. Type "active" to mark the partition as active. Windows should now be able to read the SD card and assign a drive letter so you can access it.
<br />10. Type "exit" or click on the X in the top right corner to close DiskPart.
<br />
<br />At this point, you should now be able to open and access your SD card as well as transfer files to/from the SD card. I hope this helps. Let us know if you need further assistance. Thank you.

                    <p>Just installed the new version of Win 10 and my Logitech webcam is showing the "launcher_main.exe" error when I try to record video.&nbsp; All indications is that it's due to the update version of w10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Logitech site and Youtube has plenty of "fixes" but none are working for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a patch or driver, etc. that can solve this problem?</p>

            There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1709, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Fall Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />If you are unable to do it from the desktop
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />If the problem persists or you can’t rollback, I recommend downgrading to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and certain hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.

    <title>Greyed out copy recovery partition - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> linuts01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Greyed out copy recovery partition</h2>
                    <p>I have made a Recovery USB drive, but wish to copy the recovery partition as well, but it is greyed out, according to Disk Management i have a Healthy Active Recovery Partition (1.6GB).<br />
<br />
Is there a way to get a recovery drive with the partition on it...?. I also tried the Microsoft tutorial on making a Recovery Image (18.4GB) all worked well until i tried to install it on a 32GB USB drive using the recovery option in Windows 8.1 but again there
 was nothing on how to get the img onto the USB.<br />
<br />
I did the upgrade from Windows Store from Windows 8 Pro to Windows 8.1 Pro.<br />
<br />
cheers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
Recovery disk required 
<div>I have upgraded Window 8 Pro (purchased) to Windows 8.1 Pro Via the Windows Store, But cannot make a FULL recovery Disk as the option to copy the recovery partition is greyed out.<br />
I am slightly confused as to which operating System the recovery partition is, is it still Windows 8 Pro or is it Windows 8.1 Pro...?<br />
<br />
When i look in the Disk Management i see a Active and Healthy Recovery Partition, yet when i use the command prompt (as admin) REAGENTC.exe /Info<br />
It does not find the partition.<br />

<br />
I am even willing to purchase an Windows 8.1 pro recovery DVD if i could find a place to purchase from. I am very unhappy with Microsoft for not putting all the information out on what you can do and cannot do when you upgrade from the Store, What happens if
 i have a Hardware failure, i certainly do not want to have to reinstall Windows 8 and then again do the Upgrade. There are people like myself who only have very slow and limited bandwidth.<br />
<br />
I have made a basic recovery USB drive using the Create a Recovery Drive Feature, But as i have finally found out through reading the Forums on the Net, i will not be able to either Reset or Refresh.<br />
<br />
I find it Intolerable that Microsoft is making its users Jump thru Hoops if they have a problem with their PC and have to reinstall.<br />
Thank You<br />
John<br />

Hi Karthik Thank you for the reply.<br />
As i said in my post, i&nbsp; did the free upgrade from windows 8 to windows 8.1. and it is the Windows 8.1 Create a recovery Drive program thats the problem, i dont think its a Toshiba problem. As when i did the upgrade it would have upgraded the recovery partition
 as well.<br />
<br />
I can see the recovery partition in Disk Management, but the option to copy the partition is greyed out, i can create a "Normal Recovery USB" but wish to copy the recovery partition also to the USB drive.<br />
<br />
I even followed the tutorial link in your post and manually created an image of the partition, but when i ran the Create a recovery Drive program the copy option is STILL greyed out.<br />
<br />
cheers<br />

            <span>Hi John,<br />
<br />
What is the make and model of the computer?<br />
<br />
If the computer is OEM (</span><em><span>original equipment manufacturer)
</span></em><span>computer, then there will be a recovery partition on that computer. When you upgrade from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1, then the recovery partition will also get upgraded.
 If you want to but Windows 8.1, then I would suggest you to but from the following link:<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Windows-8.1-Pro/productID.288401500" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msusa/en_US/pdp/Windows-8.1-Pro/productID.288401500</a><br />
<br />
Hope this helps! Let us know if you have any other issues with Windows in future.</span>

            I and lots of others have the same problem - the manufacturer has decided it's not worth installing the recovery partition and the option given by MS doesn't work - it makes a directory instead of a partition and the recovery disk generation still has
 the above-described option greyed out (many people have this problem in Google). My supplier was Mesh in the UK - supposedly good, but only 1 person in technical support, who admits he knows little about Windows 8.1
