            <p>Hi William,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span>You may refer to the computer or device manufacturer website and try the latest update for the BIOS to see if it resolves the Windows installer from seeing the HDD for install.</span></p>
<p>
&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<b><span>NOTE:</span></b><span> Modifying BIOS/complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent
 your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</span></p>

    <title>Device census is using webcam&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Device census is using webcam&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I've&nbsp;been having this problem for a few weeks now. Every now and then when I close my computer for a while (without shutting it off), I get a notification that says ' device census is using webcam' like in the picture below.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9bd5095f-a6f5-4ebd-8b2c-641e03b3d655" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9bd5095f-a6f5-4ebd-8b2c-641e03b3d655" /></a></p>
<p>Now, I may be overreacting a bit, here but I have my camera covered up at the moment. &nbsp;Any unknown program using my webcam scares me so I don't want to take any risks.I've contacted Microsoft Support and even had them remotely access&nbsp;my computer to investigate,
 but no such luck.Can anyone help me out with this? Or at least have some information on what 'device census' is? I am very confused here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Which security software are you using on your computer?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This error might be caused by a program running on your computer that's preventing Windows Update Services (SVCHOST) from accessing the Internet. Programs that might do this include firewalls, antispyware software, web accelerators, Internet security
 or antivirus programs and proxy servers.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Follow below methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong> Run Windows update troubleshooter.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>If your issue still persist, proceed with method 3</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3: Set proxy settings to Automatic</span></strong></p>

<h2>            Unable to find NVIDIA drivers after system recovery&#47;factory reset&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I have recently did a factory reset on my PC due to some issue with too many files corrupting each other, on attempting to install NVIDIA drivers back I was unable and found out that I do not have NVIDIA GPU or it just couldn't detect it somehow. I had
 used NVIDIA drivers perfectly on my PC before the factory reset though, so I am really puzzled and frustrated. I only see the Intel Driver in the Device Manager under the Display Adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC's (or PREDATOR G3610)&nbsp;info: - Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Intel Core i7 processor 2600</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - NVIDIA Geforce GT545 3GB</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - 16GB DDR3 memory</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Multi-in-1 Media Card Reader</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Wireless LAN</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp; I thought I merely had my Intel Driver enabled while my NVIDIA Driver disabled in the BIOS, but I was wrong.. I don't see the NVIDIA chipset at all in the BIOS.</p>
<p>&nbsp; While trying to install a NVIDIA Driver, I had also came across an issue whereby I am unable to do so with a message displaying: "This graphics driver could not find compatiable graphics hardware.".</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; To my utmost appreciation to whomever is attempting to assist me in resolving my issue. Let me know if you still need any info about my&nbsp;PC.&nbsp;Have a great day everybody! :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers~</p>

<br />What is the Status and Edition listed at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation?.  Run the Troubleshooter there.
<br />
<br />Had you linked Activation to your MS Account?  Be sure to sign in with it.

            Also Enterprise version is only meant to be activated by Volume Licensing used by large organizations and business.  If you were part of one of those then but are now not connected to their domain then it will deactivate and requires reinstalling a retail  version of WIndows 10 activated by a retail Product Key.  Only buy retail keys from Microsoft or major retailers who back their sales or you will lose your money.

<p>Edition is Windows 10 Home.&nbsp; Status is not activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've always been activated ever since I upgraded from legitimate Windows 7 Home (<strong>NOT
</strong>Enterprise, that's my fault for misreading...the Windows 7 I upgraded from was standard Windows 7 Home Premium) that came installed on my computer purchased new, but after the latest series of updates it now wants me to activate Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried using MagicJellyBean to pull any Windows 10 product key on my PC, and it's the generic Windows 10 upgrade key.&nbsp; And if I try to enter it, it says it's not valid.</p>

 will deactivate and requires reinstalling a retail version of WIndows 10 activated by a retail Product Key. Only buy retail keys from Microsoft or major retailers who back their sales or you will lose your money.

<p>That's my fault.&nbsp; It's not Enterprise 7, it's just Windows 7 Home Premium that is factory loaded and what I upgraded from.&nbsp; I don't know where I got Enterprise from.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It found Windows 10 Home, Microsoft Office, and Internet Explorer, but found nothing for Bios or Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After searching Google, the Windows 10 Home key appears to be the same generic key that defaults to everyone who did Windows 10 upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither of the three keys do anything when trying to activate with them.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have the original Windows 7 Home Premium key for my original Windows 7 installation (from which Windows was upgraded to 10 from), but that key is also not working.</p>

            Glad to hear it.  
<br />
<br />I am sorry that I didn't get notification of your last post as after confirming whether you had the correct version installed, I would have suggested you  follow  the illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You might want to review the steps to compare and assist in setting up your new install.

</p>
<p><span>Do you have a floppy disk drive?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to try the following steps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>: Try to boot the computer in Safe mode and see if the issue still persist. Safe Mode is useful for troubleshooting problems with programs and drivers that might not start correctly or that might prevent Windows
 from starting correctly. Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span>&nbsp;To exit from safe mode, restart your computer and let the Windows start normally.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span> Perform a Clean boot. Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article
 mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note: </strong>After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting".

    <title>Surface Pro 4, Windows 10 Audio - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maestro.u  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4, Windows 10 Audio</h2>
                    <p>I have had Surface Pro 4 since it was launched.&nbsp; I only got wired ear buds to listen to audio to not bother my wife when I am doing Polish, German, Spanish, and Japanese Lessons.&nbsp; It is bad enough she has to listen to me practice sounding the words to myself.</p>
<p>So, I got a blue tooth wireless head set, that was highly rated - Plantronics. Back Beat Sense. &nbsp; All of the online lesson sites I have a problem with snapping noise and every few minutes the sound goes into a sustained vibration that can only be controlled
 by shutting off the headset and then turning it back on.&nbsp; I don't hear any of the noise or sound going into vibration on the regular Surface Pro 4 Speakers or on the wired ear buds.&nbsp; It is only when connected via Bluetooth!&nbsp; This is with any combination of
 volume low to high on Surface Pro 4 and corresponding high to low on Bluetooth headset.&nbsp; Seems like something in Bluetooth audio is over driven or has a tendency to self-oscillate like a very bad audio filter design.&nbsp; It is getting high frequency noise and
 self-oscillation set up.&nbsp; Has anyone run into this?&nbsp; I have seen a lot of traffic on problems with Surface Pro 4 audio.&nbsp; You would think that such a design issue would never happen, with even moderately good engineers. &nbsp; So what is with this? &nbsp; I was a USAF
 fighter aircraft electronics technician,&nbsp; a degreed electrical engineer (retired) and HS math teacher (retired). &nbsp; This is not rocket science.&nbsp; Quality should be designed in not inspected in.</p>
<p>Answers? &nbsp; I am not sure a software fix would ever solve this, unless in the setting of the D/A converter.&nbsp; Band, Phone, Surface...hmmm.</p>

<h2>            how to find tunnel.sys driver to reinstall</h2>
                    I was checking my drivers because my wireless PCI Express card Lan Adapter keeps disconnecting, and I found that the Microsoft ISATAP adapter #2 has a caution sign. I clicked on it, and the divice status says "this device is not working properly because
 Windows cannot load the drivers required for this device. (code 31). <br />
I clicked on check for solutions and I get NOTHING.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Network -&nbsp;Right Click on both - UNINSTALL&nbsp; - REBOOT<br />
<br />
Nothing else to do, Windows will do the rest. And you can ignore the errors altogether<br />
if you wish and on some computers it will always be there but cause no problems.<br />
<br />
On a Windows Vista-based computer or on a Windows Server 2008-based computer, <br />
the Microsoft ISATAP adapter appears with a yellow exclamation mark next to it in<br />
Device Manager, and you also receive an error message<br />

    <title>Problem with console when redeeming code. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> somebloke27  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with console when redeeming code. </h2>
                    
<p>On the 19th of September I purchased 3 months worth of Xbox Live Gold (I have a receipt to prove this). When I entered the code into my console, it completely froze whilst redeeming the code. As I will have to reset the console, I'm afraid that the code
 will become invalid or corrupted and so I will end up throwing 15 quid down the drain. Is there anything I can do to prevent this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I type this, my Xbox 360 is still frozen on that screen as I am afraid of resting it for the reason I just stated above. Until I find a solution, it will have to remain like that as money doesn't grow on trees :/</p>

<p>It has sometimes done this to me, yet for some reason a few minutes to an hour later I get a confirmation telling me that I have renewed with a 3-Month Membership and so on.</p>
<p>Have you receieved any e-mail ad all confirming of this redemption?</p>
<p>Also could you try two things for me please?</p>
<p>go to <a href="http://billing.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://billing.microsoft.com</a> &nbsp; verify with the security code it sends you and see if it has any trace of that membership you tried redeeming.</p>
<p>Alternatively go to your account section at:</p>
<p><a href="https://account.xbox.com/en-GB/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">account.xbox.com/en-GB</a></p>
<p>And it should show your expiration date, see if it all checks out that way, and usually the last membership you redeem should be the title of it, so check if it says Prepaid 3M Xbox LIVE Gold.</p>
<p>Other than that no one can unfortunately fix this issue for you on this fourm. You would have to contact them. The UK lines are shut right now but the support chat should be available at:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/contact-us</a></p>
<p>Maybe it was just a glitch that I got one time. I hope you get it sorted. If you cannot get it sorted through them then just simply give them a call in the morning. One way or another it will get fixed with the Xbox Customer Support: 0800 587 1102</p>

    <title>Time limits on parental controls not working&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smartysandy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Time limits on parental controls not working&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I created another account called "Homework" and want to have parental controls on. I go to Windows Family Safety and it is in there. I set up time limits (days and times) but they don't work, even when I set up all times as blocked. I am running Windows
 7 and have no plans to upgrade on my very old laptop. The Homework account logs on any time no matter what.</p>
<p>I deleted the user account and created again and no difference.</p>
<p>I have one account for a child that shows standard user - parental controls on. It is working just fine.</p>
<p>On the Parental Controls page under Control Panel, my child account shows Parental Controls On but the Homework account does not.</p>
<p>NOTE that the Homework accound does enforce all the other Parental Controls, such as blocked websites, but does not enforce the time limits.</p>

            I have spent hours here. I have the exact same problem as OP. I originally removed the standard account because it would not connect to the internet at all. When I then added a new user account (standard), the internet worked, but the time limits did not.
 I have tried Christian_Co's troubleshooting, have removed child and account from computer and live account, and even uninstalled family safety and reinstalled it and added everything back to computer and live account.&nbsp; The time limits do not work on this account.
 It is being monitored, and the other two child accounts that are on the computer do have time limits working. The ONLY difference I am seeing between the ones that work and the one that doesn't is the working accounts say "Standard user - Parental Controls
 On" and the one that doesn't says "Standard User" only.&nbsp; So I guess my question is, how do I get the parental controls onto that user? I have tried and either it goes straight to windows live, or (after I removed family sa

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for participating on this thread. I understand that you are having issues with your Family Safety and I would like to ask some questions for isolation.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is your operating system?</li><li>What is the version of Family Safety? To check, press <strong>Windwos + R</strong>, type
<strong>appwiz.cpl</strong> and find the version of Windows Essentials.</li></ul>
<p>Also, I would like you to try creating another standard user account and configure it to Family Safety. After that, check if it will show as
<strong>Standard user - Parental Controls On</strong> or just the <strong>Standard User</strong>. Kindly gave us a screenshot also of that figure to isolate further. If you need help on getting the screenshot, you can follow the instructions depending on your
 operating system:</p>

            Hi David.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Does it start faster in Safe Mode with Networking, or Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>?  If so this could be caused by drivers.
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps what I'd do at this point is wait a few days for Spring Creators Update to be released, install Media Creation Tool from this link and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />You can monitor the Windows 10 Blog here to get notified of the exact date for release of Spring Creators Version 1803 which is soon:   <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#utpDefLLBfmPO4gr.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#ut...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            <p>Hi there. thank you for getting back to me so quickly.</p>
<p>I am using the built in Mail app in windows 10 to access emails.</p>
<p>I am referring to outlook.com through msn - not office and through this ( via Chrome) I can access all my missing sent emails. - but would like them all to come in to my sent items box?</p>
<p>I don't know where to find my email client on here despite searching. I know originally I seem to remember POP3 but with this new laptop in 2014 and windows 8.1 the only way we could use the mail app to receive or send all emails was via a new msn account.</p>
<p>Hope this helps and look forward to your reply.</p>

            <p>Hello again. Thank you for your reply. I did run the app troubleshooter but no difference.</p>
<p>I have noticed however that my sent items since the upgrade are not disappearing daily &nbsp;- I thought they might be only saving for one month which was a worry ! My solution has been to open a new folder named old sent emails on my outlook.com account accessed
 via the web and tried putting a few of my old sent items in there and when I opened up my Mail account on here &nbsp;- there was the new folder with them in !!!!! What a relief !!!</p>
<p>So I will proceed to add the ones I want to save. I do hope this helps others with the same problem.</p>
<p>I also found copy worked but &nbsp;paste wasn't working in the Mail app - yet was in notepad or word and so now have to use Ctrl +C to Copy and Ctrl +V (not P)! to paste. hope this helps others too.</p>

            <p>I have had the same issue with sent items since moving to Windows 10. When I send an e-mail using the Win 10 built in application on my PC, the e-mail briefly appears in sent items, then disappears. It is also listed in all mail along with all my notifications
 etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using my Gmail account and the e-mail appears there (in sent items) .</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So, some questions:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, is the Sent Mail folder like the Outbox in Outlook? Stuff is only there while being sent or if there is a issue with sending?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I get a reply to the e-mail it appears in my Gmail account (in Win 10 and Gmail)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where is the "sent" e-mail stored after it is sent but before it gets replied to? It is there somewhere since I can see it I All Mail</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click All Mail, how do I know which folder any particular e-mail is stored in?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Restart problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markduncan64  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Restart problem</h2>
                    <p>I have been having a problem with the restart function for a couple of weeks now. Not really sure if it was an update issue from the updates of 9/12/16 or 14/12/16 as I don't restart my computer that often.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Restart, the computer shuts down to a point where I get a black screen but a No Signal warning on the monitor. The power button is still lit up. I have to press the power button to switch it off and then press it again to boot up the computer. It is as
 though the computer has forgotten that it is supposed to reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any answers?</p>

<p>Is any part of the laptop so hot that if you touch it you need to pull your hand away because of the heat?&nbsp; Overheating is a common cause of unexpected shutdowns.&nbsp; Check to make sure the fan is running and do your best to clean out the intake and exhaust
 vents (I know it's hard on a laptop but do your best).</p>
<p>Do you get any error messages or does it just power down?&nbsp; Does it shutdown gracefully (closing programs and such like you hit shutdown yourself) or does it abruptly crash closed?&nbsp; You say you are getting blue screen error messages - this typically means
 a hardware-related problem (but not alll the time).&nbsp; There is other text and codes on the bluescreen message that are important to help narrow down the cause - if you could provide them EXACTLY that would help.</p>
<p><span><span>Read the posts and follow the steps suggested by Spirit MVP in the following thread regarding the Blue Screen of Death.&nbsp; They
 should help you resolve your problem. </span><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistahardware/thread/8cd8362e-7d06-46fb-afd7-84d54b6a8ea7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistahardware/thread/8cd8362e-7d06-46fb-afd7-84d54b6a8ea7</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 A lot of what he suggests is duplicated below, so you can skip whichever steps you've already tried (depending on whether you deccide to try the below first or try his procedures first - that's up to you).</span></span></p>
<p>What AV program are you using (name and version) and is it up to date?&nbsp; Has it detected any infections recently (even if it says it cleaned them)?&nbsp; If so, do you know the names of the infections?&nbsp; You may be infected with malware.&nbsp;
<span>
Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:
</span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a><span>&nbsp;and
</span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp; You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></a><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials
</span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></a>
<span>(with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time).
<span>&nbsp;</span>You may also want to try the free Avira at: </span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></a><span> and Avast at:
</span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></a><span>.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Reboot after completing all the scans.<span>&nbsp; </span>You may also want to try the free OneCare at
</span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></a><span> and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good
 maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If those optonss don't work, we'll need to do a general troubleshooting to try to find the cause and repair it.</span></span></p>
<span><span>
<div>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work.<br />
<br />
If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp; To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make
 the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work, and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted,
 push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a><span>&nbsp;along with burning software like:
</span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;and, of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32.<span>&nbsp; </span>Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post
 back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It may want to schedule itself to start at the next startup.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Agree and then reboot so the program can run. It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning shutdown (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools
 / Event Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></a><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This could be caused by device driver problems or hardware problems in general.&nbsp;
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp; Although this will not affect your data,
 settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work.&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had
 to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<div>
<p><span>Go to Device Manager by going to start / search box and type device manager and enter and then double-click on the
 program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each for further details and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get
 drivers (you should do so for as many devices as you have time for - this can help in ways beyond just resolving this issue), do so from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you should turn off automatic driver
 updates from Windows Update as follows: </span><span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></a><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><span>.&nbsp; Once
 you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows: </span>
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>To test your hard drive, check the manufacturer and then get the diagnostic utility from:
</span><span><a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 If it fails the test, replace it.&nbsp; If it passes the test, then there's probably nothing wrong with it.<br />
<br />
You can also test your RAM at </span><a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.memtest.org/</span></a><span>.&nbsp; If it fails, test each chip individually to find those that are bad and replace them.&nbsp; If it passes,
 RAM is probably OK.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>It's hard to test any other devices on the system&nbsp;(especially a laptop) without special tools or special (expensive) diagnostic programs (and parts
 to swap out to check to see if the problem moves - again, hard with a laptop).&nbsp; If we've reached this point and the problem still exists and the laptop is still under warrranty,&nbsp;initiate an immediate claim.&nbsp; If it's no longer under warranty, the manufacturer
 may still be willing to help&nbsp;you for free using certain methods (perhaps not by phone but maybe by online chat) - check it out and see if they have any advice to offer.&nbsp; It may well come to the point where the only option is to take it into a computer repair
 shop (NOT Geek Squad or any of those big store centers) but a true professional (or maybe even the manufacturer).&nbsp; We haven't quite reached that poiint but we're getting close.</span></span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp;
<span>
Here's the procedure: </span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work.&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install
 (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work (or you can't get
 your hands on a Vista disk), then I'm afraid the only option is a clean install.&nbsp; You can use Knoppix
</span><span><a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;with
 a good ISO copier like: </span><a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm</span></a><span>&nbsp;along with a blank CD.&nbsp; This should give you enough
 access to the system (if you can't get in any other way) to backup your important data.&nbsp; Once done, you can do a clean install either using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk or the Recovery Disk or the Recovery Partition (whatever process is dictated
 by your computer manufacturer – you may need to contact them for the procedure and perhaps to get recovery disks).&nbsp; To do a clean install proceed as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp</span></a><span>&nbsp;(adapted as necessary by the procedures of your computer
 manufacturer).&nbsp; Then you will need to re-install all your programs, reset all your preferences, reconfigure your network and email settings, restore your backed up data, run Windows Update with possibly nearly 100 updates pending,...</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If that point, we've reached the stage where it is likely a hardware problem and you have to decide what to do and/or
 who to use.</span></span></span></p>
<p>Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve your problem.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</p>

<p>above shown are the bluescreen images.</p>
<p>in addition. i used kaspersky, malwarebytes, superantispyware,ad-aware, housecall to scan my laptop and i did deleted and quaranteed all viruses.i can assure you that my laptop is 100% clean of all infections.</p>
<p>i used sfc /scannow and found corrupted file but was unable to fix them, also used check disk and memory-diagnostic tools and did not find any errors.</p>
<p>as per your previous reply i did not attempt to use any bootable CD's to perform any repairs as im not that confident doing them,&nbsp; unless otherwise its done by a professional.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i hope the given info is sufficient, please do look into this problem and help me. thank you.</p>

<p><span><span>0X0000007a kernel data inpage error vista:&nbsp; A page of kernel data was not found in the pagefile and could not be read into memory. This might be due to incompatible disk or controller drivers, firmware, or hardware.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This suggests that the problem might be some device driver (or perhaps even a device itself).&nbsp; In my post above I have a procedure for checking and updating all the device drivers (and firmware if applicable).&nbsp; You may
 want to give that a shot.&nbsp; I also included tests for your hard drive and RAM which you should run to rule them out as the problem.&nbsp; It can also be caused by malware (but you say your system is 100% clean so I guess we need to rule that out).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The fact that SFC found corruption it could not repair means we need to re-install the OS (since that's really the only way to repair the corrupt system files - which is probably the cause of the second error message
 in the dump you posted about which I could find no further informaton) - preferably a system repair/install but if necessary, a clean install.&nbsp; The procedures for both of these options are listed near the bottom of my prior post.&nbsp; If you have a Vista Installation
 Disk, try the system repair/install process first as that will preserve your data, programs, and settings (whereas a clean install will wipe the disk clean).&nbsp; Remember to first backup you data in either case.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Please don't be concerned about booting to a disk.&nbsp; Kids do it all the time playing games on the computer and this is really no different (as long as you follow the procedures and&nbsp;I've provided detailed procedures in
 every case where you might need to boot to a disk).&nbsp; I'm sure you can do it (just based on how you were able to gather the information you've provided and how you were able to post it with the images) - but the decision is yours.&nbsp; If you decide to take it
 into a conputer repair professional (NOT Geek Squad or any of those big store centers) check out several (and consider sending it back to manufactuerer for repair as well).&nbsp; Compare costs, quality and warranties and make your best choice.&nbsp; Be sure to backup
 you data before sending it off or bringing it in because chances are good they will wipe the hard drive clean during their diagnosis and repair procedures.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I recommend you try to follow the procedures I've previously posted in the order they are presented (though in some cases this involves booting to a CD/DVD) instead of just picking out those that don't require doing
 that.&nbsp; There's a reason they were presented in that order - it works through from the most likely and less intrusive options to the point where a clean re-installation is the only remaining option (and hope even that fixes the problem otherwise it's probably
 something hardware-related and you really will need to seek the assistance of a reputable computer repair techncian.&nbsp; But again, the choice is yours.&nbsp; I'm just trying to help you resolve this as best I can without you needing to pay money when that may not
 be required.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I hope this helps.&nbsp; Again, I'm confident you can do more than you think and I hope you try all the proposed solutions before spending money on what may turn out to be a costly repair that you could have done yourself.&nbsp;
 If you do try and you have ANY problems, post them here and I'll try to walk you through them (though the instructions I've included are quite thorough and i don't think you'd have any trouble following them step-by-step).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Good luck!</span></span></p>

<p>tnx for the reply,i will first do the startup-recovery method. however, if the latter fails,&nbsp; since i do not have an original vista installation CD i wont be able to do a repair/install on vista, and currently i do not have the time and money to spend on
 buying a vista CD, backing up my data and doing the repair/install on vista.</p>
<p>but i will post about the results on using the startup-recovery method. if this fails i will only be able to do the repair/install on vista during the middle of June (as i am a university student and only be getting my holidays in June), hopefully by that
 time, i hope this post will not be deleted.</p>
<p>thank you,</p>

<p>Good decision!&nbsp; Try System Restore first and then Startup Repair.</p>
<p>Perhaps you can find someone to borrow a genuine Vista Installation Disk of the same bit-size from&nbsp;in the meantime - a system repair/upgrade (if necessary) is preferable to a clean install.</p>

<p>i didn't do the system restore cuz sadly this problem started over 3 months ago and i was searching for a solution ever since, so to my knowledge the system restore points are updated and so it would not have restore points going back to 3 months.</p>
<p>i did the startup-recovery and it didn't find any errors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>as for the rest of the diagnosis mentioned earlier..will have to wait....till then goodbye.</p>

            Excuse me for my English. Had a similar problem on WIndows 8: see directly, and through USB-HUB - no. &nbsp;Solution: "Device Manager" ("Win + Breake", "Device Manager") - chose "controllers USB". At all points, where he found the word "hub" in the right-click
 "Properties" - "power" - uncheck "saving energy". Helped! My external HDD decided! Hope this helps and others.

 It can "see: them but the only option I get when I click on them is to close.....anyways, I am wondering if it is the Office...will call DELL today.&nbsp; REALLY hoping to have this resolved.&nbsp;

            PCI is the bus that the computer chip uses to communicate with virtually all the devices and subsystems connected to your motherboard.&nbsp; Not knowing the exact message you are getting, it would seem that one of these devices is not working properly.&nbsp;

<h2>            The system is entering connected standby when is supposed to be turning off just the screen</h2>
                    With my Surface Book 2 my Power Plan: is <strong>Screen Off after 10 min and Sleep after 2 hours</strong>, nonetheless after 10 min it will be triggered "The system is entering connected standby "&nbsp;Reason: Idle Timeout., I am confused, was it supposed to

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Connected Standby was introduce in Windows 8 to avoid waiting while your PC is booting from sleep or hibernate. The message that your system is entering Connected Standby is normal.
<strong>Connected Standby</strong> behaves like a smart phone. <strong>
Your screen</strong> <strong>is </strong><strong>off </strong>but you can still receive messages, notifications, calls and such. In your settings, it will only enter sleep mode after 2 hours.</p>

                    <p>A couple months ago, a bunch of items (weapons and apparel) turned a bright&nbsp;purplish color. When ever i try to interact with them, my game freezes and will not unfreeze, no matter how long I wait. &nbsp;Additionally, very often during a fight, the game freezes for about 1 minute and sometimes won't unfreeze at all. This is very frustrating because I don't manually save very often and I need to restart my console.&nbsp;And, when I tried to start a new game on another account, once reaching Helgen, the Stormcloak stops talking and once we get to the execution site, the carriage stops, and nothing happens.
