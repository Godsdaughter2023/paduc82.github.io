<br />
I updated my cam's drivers since I wasn't getting sound&nbsp; for 64 bit windows 7. Now I'm getting sound but when not using microphone I get a loud howling noise as If it were a test for audio. Any ideas?

<p>Yes, you can re-download your items you purchased onto your Xbox 360 using the same account if you switch to Gold. This can be found on the 360 by going to Settings, My account, Purchase History.</p>
<p>However, items you buy on the Xbox 360 will not Transfer to the Xbox One unless stated by the Developer.</p>

    <title>internet stops Freezes after sometime in Windows 8.1.. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kamit1582  say:</h3>
<h2>            internet stops Freezes after sometime in Windows 8.1..</h2>
                    I recently updated from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 x64 which installed smoothly but after sometime internet stopped working and it never starts again unless I restart windows , after digging through it I realised that whenever I open a video on internet
 or play from my computer internet freezes. Here are some of the observation I have made after trying somethings..
<div>
<ul>
<li>Internet stops completely even if I try to disconnect my lan cord it shows lan cord is connected and it remain stuck at that point when I connect lan cord again ..it connects only when I restart. Once when I disabled my ethernet from adapter settings and
 enabled it again it worked but again stopped after sometime.</li><li>I rebooted pc in safe mode with networking and internet worked fine without any issues ..only problem is that as there is no sound and display is low in safe mode so I can't work with that..</li><li>So I thought there may be issue with my display driver so I did a clean install of my latest video driver but same problem occured as i tried to open a video...</li><li>Then I disabled my display driver from device manager but the problem prevailed..</li><li>There seems no problem with audio drivers as there is no such issue when music is played..</li><li>Same thing happen when i open new gmail...</li></ul>
My System configuration:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Windows 8.1 pro x64</li><li>Intel core i3</li><li>4gb RAM</li><li>Ati mobility Radeon hd 5470</li><li>I am on proxy based internet from my college</li></ul>
Now only solution which I can think of is to reinstall windows 8 fresh which is a very tedious and time taking process as it requires &nbsp;backup and reinstalling programs..&nbsp;</div>

    <title>Communication Banning Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> all chase  say:</h3>
<h2>            Communication Banning Issue</h2>
                    People may have been noticing a spike in communications banning recently. I personally find this to be an issue that isn't the players fault. From the research I gathered, these communication bans are affecting a lot of different types of people. There
 are even posts of people with disabilities being communications banned. I think this communication banning issue deals with Microsoft’s strict code of conduct. It is so strict in fact, that people could be communication banned for sending someone a misspelled
 swear word. Is this actually protecting people and making the Xbox environment feel safe?<br />
<br />
It seems that Microsoft’s Enforcement Team has been buckling down on "accounts" that are sending inappropriate messages or participating in inappropriate voice or text communications because they want to protect the Xbox gaming environment and make people feel
 safe. "Xbox Live is designed to be enjoyed by everyone, and no one should ever have to feel unsafe or threatened on the service" - said by XBLPET Lancer Xbox Enforcement Team. About a year ago, I actually was threatened by someone on Xbox live, and that threat
 did make me feel unsafe or threatened somewhat. The person that threatened me said that they were going to come to my house and personally destroy everything I worked so hard for (There was some swear words used that didn’t offend me and other things said
 that did offended me, but I chose not to include them). I reported the person, and they were communications banned for a month (Lucky for me, that didn't make them even more angry with me). In this case, I feel that Microsoft’s enforcement team did a good
 job... But, I am well aware of the threats players throw at other players on Xbox Live, and if I cared enough I wouldn't have Xbox Live. How many people actually come through with their threats is unknown to me, but I'm sure it's very few and there is nothing
 the Xbox Enforcement Team can do about it. That is either the Federal Bureau of Investigations job, or the police depending on the situation. DDosers are personally the only people I feel threatened by in the Xbox Live environment.<br />
<br />
There seems to be more and more people being communication banned for trash talk or offensive language. My question is, by giving these people a communication ban, is that really making the Xbox experience safer? I'm sure most people see playing games see them
 as an escape from the "real world". It gives people time to relax, time to let off some steam, or some time to just enjoy a game they really love. Because some person sends some trashy message to another player, is that actually making the other person feel
 unsafe or threatened? Fun fact for people offended by swear words: It is scientifically proven that people that use swear words have a higher IQ than people that do not use swear words. So, is it really fair for people not offended by them to not be able to
 use them?<br />
<br />
I have been a member of Xbox Live for over 10 years now, and I was never communication banned until last year. The amount of trash talk back in the Halo 2 days is nowhere near comparable to how little the amount of trash talk that goes on now. I copied the
 post from the Xbox Enforcement Team on my suspension, and I'll let the community decide whether or not I should’ve been charged with a suspension. I already served my time like a criminal, so I'm fine with whatever you have to say about me. After all this
 is the forums, right. I have to expect that someone is going to say something that will offend me in some way because that's just how people talk (I don't think the Xbox Enforcement Team understands this). Remember, in order for me to be communication banned
 I have to violate the code of conduct which means I had to make someone feel unsafe or threatened. Here is the offence evidence. (This account received a temporary communications suspension as the result of disruptive communications, specifically for sending
 "I said goldy hunter. Learn to read. I don’t use op stuff cuz mama didn’t raise no *****" to another player.) I still remember that this conversation started with me attempting to compliment the other players skill (Nice Shotgun skills), and in no way was
 meant to be offensive until the other person offended me by telling me that I was an unskilled player and I'm probably a stupid little kid. We proceeded into getting into an argument about what requires skill in the game and as you can see above, I was already
 offended by this player, and I stated my opinion in an aggressive way hoping that would get his attention. I may have offended the other player after he offended me, but never threatened the other player or attempted to make them feel unsafe. I also wrote
 an apple statement saying that this conversation escalated because of both of our actions and I was originally attempting to compliment the other player. The other person didn't get communication banned.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Another fun fact, if you are communication banned you can go to Xbox Support and talk to an Xbox Live support agent. They will tell you that they have a way around the communication ban. They will tell you to make a new account and use that account to communicate
 while playing games on your account that is communication banned (Basically nobody is being punished, and the offender can still message you). So, to the people that are for communication bans, the people being banned from communication are using other accounts
 to communicate and Xbox Live agents support this. Does this change your views towards communication bans at all?<br />
<br />
P.S. I'm sorry if this is posted in the wrong section of the forums. This is my first post time posting here, and I've always found forums really confusing. I'm concerned for the direction Xbox Live is heading in, and that is why I made this post. I love gaming
 and I'm known for being one of the nicest people you'll ever meet&nbsp;

</p><p>If you've forgotten your Windows password, there are several ways to retrieve or reset it:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If your PC is on a domain, your system administrator must reset your password.</p>

<h2>            losing gta heist progress</h2>
                    
<p>when I set up my heist and someone leaves in the middle of a setup, I lose all my heist progress and when I go to the heist planning board it says 'heist recently completed'. and I have to pay another 100k setting it back up again. I phoned up rockstar and
 they refunded me the money I lost, however they insist that this is normal and that I am supposed to lose my progress when someone leaves. This is absolutely not true because I have been playing heists for a year and I've never had this problem before, and
 my friends don't have this problem either. And&nbsp;if it was supposed to happen&nbsp;they wouldn't have refunded me the money.&nbsp;I have read posts on forums about others experiencing this issue as well. If you have this problem please post on my thread so I know I am
 not the only one. And if you have any fixes please let me know. Thank you.</p>

<h2>            iphone videos won&#39;t play on Windows 8.1 media player due to an update</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>My laptop is one year old, and I download the updates regularly, it runs Windows 8.1.&nbsp; Recently, I have been unable to watch videos taken with my iPhone, and those other people have sent me, which I store on the laptop.&nbsp; The videos all relate to my grandson,
 so are really special to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep the videos in folders along with photos in certain categories, and if the cursor goes anywhere near one of the video clip thumbnails, the whole programme freezes, I get a Windows message saying there is a problem, the programme had to close.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears to be quite a common problem, there are many discussions online about it, but if I upgrade to Windows 10 will I be able to view these videos again, or what should I do to resolve this issue?&nbsp; The glitch has been apparently caused by an update,
 according to some sources.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help.&nbsp; Thank you in anticipation.</p>

 not running on this computer".&nbsp; Try these repairs as an administrator, so I do. I get same message &nbsp;" The Windows wireless service is not running on this computer", with "fixed" afterwards. Wi-Fi works for a period, each time different in length of time, before
 disconnecting.&nbsp; What do I do?</p>

</p><p>I got a copy with my computer and was using my PC without my Microsoft account, but I accidentally deleted the copy on my PC.</p>
<p>I also had a regular minecraft account and redeemed my copy of the game on this Microsoft account.<br />

<p>Now, I have logged in with this &nbsp;account and still can't find the game in my library.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can provide proof if it is needed in anyway.</p>

            Hi there, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />If you can see any photos at all in the Photos app, you can check the file location by following these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Open the photo/photos you would like to locate, through the photos app.
<br />2. Right click on the photo and select "file info".
<br />3. On the left hand side of the window under "folder path", copy the folder path.
<br />4. Press Windows key + R, paste the folder path in the run command and press enter.
<br />
<br />Copied from: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/apps_windows_10-photos/windows-10-photo-app-where-are-my-photos-stored/11de26f4-6a67-495f-b5d7-dbae22773e0e">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />If you're still having trouble locating the files, please let me know and I'll see what else we can try. Thanks!

<h2>            Desktop Background Slideshow in Windows 10</h2>
                    I just upgraded from Windows 7 and I have lost the ability to create themes. Before I could select multiple images, chose&nbsp;how long each one would be displayed for&nbsp;and save it as a theme, Whilst I can chose any of my previously created themes, I have lost
 the ability to create new ones. I'd rather do this with the same UI or at the&nbsp;very&nbsp;least a similar one but if there's some kind of workaround I'd rather use that than&nbsp;be totally unable to create themes.

</p><p>You deleted C:\Users\<em>YourUserName </em>and all its contents?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since Libraries are simply collections of shortcuts to files stored within C:\Users\<em>YourUserName</em>, the disappearance of the Libraries is understandable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Similarly, the Desktop is normally a folder within C:\Users\<em>YourUserName.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can use another account to any extent at all, use it to copy all your own files [if any still exist] together with any downloaded application installation files &amp; their product keys to an external drive.</p>

<h2>            Why can&#39;t Cortana set a reminder for every  20 minutes to leave my pc&#63;</h2>
                    It gave me the option of monthly weekly daily, so obviously totally misunderstanding what every 20 minutes means. I though it would be a simple task, and I'm sure I've seen it done on tv. In fact it hasn't really been able to help with much.

            Hi,  Kaan
<br />
<br />My name is Maritza and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />Perform the procedure to repair the system files:
<br />Follow these instructions: press the Windows + X keys and select Command Prompt (Administrator) or Windows PowerShell (Administrator), in the window that will open, you must type the commands in their respective order:
<br />• DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />• DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />• DISM.exe /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup
<br />•  sfc /scannow 
<br />
<br />Each of these actions can take a few minutes, so it is important to execute one at a time. When finished, you must restart the PC.
<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

            What I can recommend is that you completely repair the operating system, but first you must backup your files, although with this method the data is not lost but it is a good idea to backup as a security measure, third-party applications if they are uninstalled, check this link.

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Did you start facing this issue after installing McAfee?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these methods:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b><span>
 There is no option to add website URLs in McAfee firewall. <span>&nbsp;</span>However, you can add the URL in the McAfee filtered website. Click on Parental control, clicking n
<b>config</b> on the right panel, clicking on the <b>Advance</b> button and then click on the
<b>filtered websites</b> on the left had panel add the URLs.</span></p>
