    <title>Device Stage and EOS Utility - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dannyf123  say:</h3>
<h2>            Device Stage and EOS Utility</h2>
                    <p>I recently re-installed windows, and had to re-install all my camera software. I have two Canon cameras, one a point and shoot and one an EOS dslr. Now when I plug in the dslr it opens up device stage, but only offers me three choices for importing pictures.
 it offers me "canon camera window" which is useful for the small point and shoot, but it does not give me the option to choose "EOS utility", which is what i use for the dslr. I can open EOS utility separately and it works, but i can't add it as a choice in
 device stage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to add this to device stage, and then make it the default choice for windows?</p>

            <p>Hi Danny,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for posting your query on this forum. I will try my best to assist you with this query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the given description, I understand that when you connect your DSLR Camera to the computer, the Device Stage comes up without the EOS utility listed in it and instead you are getting the “<strong><em>Canon Camera Window</em></strong>”.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to change the application in the Device Stage for your DSLR Camera, you should be able to do it by clicking on the “<strong><em>Change Program</em></strong>” link under the application listed there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn’t work, then you may change the default program to “<strong><em>EOS Utility</em></strong>” for importing the pictures from the camera device. Please refer to the Microsoft Help article given below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-default-programs#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Change which programs Windows uses by default</a></em></strong></p>

            <p>Rajesh, thanks for the reply, but unfortunately this has not helped. I'll list all the problems, and they are probably all related to one problem I need to fix:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) When device stage opens, there is a link to "change program", however it doesn't list EOS utility as one of the options. it gives me only three choices, with no way to add another option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) when i go to the autoplay settings i can find my camera (listed twice for some reason) but the only options are to do nothing, or to open device stage. there is no option to use eos utility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) i am able to use eos utility, because it runs a small background program to watch for when i plug in the camera. so that is working as a workaround, but i'd prefer not to have that process constantly running.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>previously i was able to change the program in device stage to use eos utility, and now i can't. i can't figure out why. (and so i can have eos utility open, and have windows 7 "take no action". but just wondering why i can't get windows 7 to recognize that
 eos utility is installed and should be an option for this camera.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks,</p>
<p>danny</p>

    <title>Backup error code Ox81000019 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phil.lemion  say:</h3>
<h2>            Backup error code Ox81000019</h2>
                    In attempting to backup my laptop to external hard drive on network I get message "view application event log" for "VSS and "SPP" and backup terminates.I have backed up my desktop to same location with no problem. Previously backed up laptop to another
 external network hard drive with no problem.<br />
<br />
I've done searches but no results. I'd appreciate any answer that starts with "Here's what you do......." I'm not technical enough to unfold the "mystery" of VSS, SPP or even "application log". Thanks for any help.

<p>Hi Phil,<br />
<br />
The Problem here might be with the File System of the External HardDrive, Make sure the External HardDrive is Formatted with NTFS File System and not FAT32.<br />
because FAT32 does not support File size greater than 4 GB.<br />
<br />
You can also try to Increasing the Space used by Volume Shadow Copy (VSS) service. (Steps Below)<br />
<br />
1. Click the Start button-&gt;All Programs-&gt;Accessories.<br />
2. Right click Command Prompt and select "Run as administrator".<br />
3. Click Continue when the User Account Control window appears.<br />
4. Type the following command and press Enter:<br />
<br />
<strong>Vssadmin resize shadowstorage /on=C: /For=C: /MaxSize=10GB<br />
</strong><br />
(This number is just an example. Use as much as you want, the maximum number of the MaxSize is 15% of the partition space).<br />
<br />
Revert for any Doubts.</p>

    <title>Windows Adds Numbers to Network Names - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> banjo999  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Adds Numbers to Network Names</h2>
                    <p>I have been trying to resolve this issue for months and have finally found a definitive solution. Despite all my Google searching, I have not found an actual answer anywhere.</p>
<p>The problem here is that Windows will add a number to a network name whenever a change is made to said network. For instance, your computer is connected to "Network," then you change the encryption for the wireless connection from WPA to WPA2. You connect
 using the new encryption key, and suddenly Windows says you're connected to "Network 2."</p>
<p>This has absolutely no affect on anything--you can still connect to other computers on the network, the SSID remains the same, you can still use the Internet--except it's kind of annoying to look at. Maybe it's a tad bit of obsessive compulsiveness, but
 I personally don't like it.</p>
<p>I had the same issue on Windows Vista, only more extreme. I needed to make a series of changes to my router when I was running Vista to adjust to the new house and devices, and each time I'd get a new network name. Instead of replacing the old network name
 like Windows 7 does, however, it adds a new network to the list. I'd have the choice to connect to "Network," "Network 2," "Network 2 3," "Network 2 3 4," etc., and they would all connect to the same access point. Odd.</p>
<p>Point is, I've come across the issue once again while running Windows 7 and have at last found a solution.<br />
<br />
SOLUTION: Control Panel&gt;&gt;Network and Internet&gt;&gt;Manage Wireless Networks</p>
<p>Simply right click on and delete all versions of the network that are unneeded (i.e. "Network" and "Network 2"), then right click on and rename whatever network it is you're connected to (i.e. "Network 3" changed to "Network").</p>

            <p>It does not work. &nbsp;When you are under manage wireless network, the SSID does not show a number at the end. &nbsp;You can only see that number at the lower right corner of your screen, you cannot rename the SSID.</p>

<h2>            Desktop Shortcuts Not Working After September Windows 7 Update</h2>
                    I was notified yesterday of this month's updates.&nbsp; Immediately after I installed and restarted, the shortcuts I have placed on my desktop from Internet Explorer show an "Unknown File Type" security warning when I click on the icon.&nbsp; When I get the message,
 it references _url instead of url.&nbsp; What can be done to fix this?&nbsp; I am NOT interested in reloading my operating system as this seems to be the generic answer I receive from Microsoft any time I have ever asked a question.

<h2>            Window Live Mail 2012 - error &#34;an unknown error has occured&#34; when trying to delete a message from the Deleted items folder</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have installed WLM 2012 on Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit, and imported a backup of the messages to it from a previous installation I had for it (same OS, same version of WLM).</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to delete messages from the Deleted Items folder, I get the following error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>An unknown error has occured.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And the messages aren't deleted, of course.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already did a repair installation and it didn't make any difference whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything I can do to resolve this issue, other than uninstalling WLM and re-installing it??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I have installed WLM 2012 on Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit, </p>

<p>I note that you're an Insider. Is this Windows 7 installation&nbsp;the result of reverting from Windows 10? The problem you describe is a common one in that situation.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>Is there anything I can do to resolve this issue, other than uninstalling WLM and re-installing it??</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem is with the store folder and its database index, not with the program itself. Uninstalling and reinstalling is not likely to have any effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can usually remove messages from the <em>Deleted items</em> folder by right-clicking on it and selecting

    <title>Why can&#39;t I un-install Sage&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> loachey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can&#39;t I un-install Sage&#63;</h2>
                    I have just downloaded Office 2013 and now my sage won't work properly with the excel functions. &nbsp;I was told by Sage that I needed to un-install and reinstall as Sage doesn't like it as Office was downloaded afterwards?!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So now I am trying to uninstall Sage and I can't.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I press uninstall, it gives me the option or repair or uninstall so I click uninstall. &nbsp;It gives me a message saying OK to go ahead (or words to that effect) or cancel to cancel, so I hit OK......</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>and then nothing happens! &nbsp;No uninstall, nothing.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have just tried uninstalling "stickies" to see if it would do the same and no, it uninstalled them.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
                </div>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand your concern regarding the issue that you are facing.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>It is very important to have the correct <strong>screen resolution</strong> settings in your Windows PC as it facilitates better display of content and the clarity of images. Higher is the resolution, sharper are the images and contents on your PC</p>
<p><strong><span>I suggest you to check the resolution of your screen and make changes according to your requirements. To change screen resolution follow the steps below</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Go to your Desktop, right-click your mouse and go to <strong>Display Settings</strong>.</li><li>A panel will open. Here you can adjust the&nbsp;size of text, apps, and other items and also change the orientation. To change the resolution settings, scroll down this window and click on&nbsp;&nbsp; Advanced Display Settings</li></ol>
<p><strong><span>1366 X 768 is the recommended screen resolution</span></strong><span>
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>You can change it according to your&nbsp;&nbsp;requirements. </span></li></ol>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><span>NOTE: Lower is the resolution, larger is the content displayed on your screen. From the available options in the drop-down menu, select the one you want and click Apply</span></p>
<ol>
<li>If it is not the optimal setting for your&nbsp;system, you will see an Optimal Resolution Notification</li></ol>
<p><span>You may ignore the notification and confirm your Screen Resolution changes by clicking on
<strong><span>Keep The Changes</span>,</strong> or you may select another screen resolution. You will get just 15 seconds to confirm the changes or else it will revert to the default display settings</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Also try updating the Display drivers from the manufacturer's website and check if the issue persists.
<br />
Follow the steps to update the audio drivers: <br />
a.&nbsp;Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong> key and click <strong>Device Manager</strong>.
<br />
b.&nbsp;Expand <strong>Display Adapter </strong>and Select <strong>Graphic</strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>. <br />
c.&nbsp;Right-click on the <strong>Graphic</strong> and click on <strong>Update driver software</strong>.
<br />
d.&nbsp;Restart the computer and check.</span></p>
<p>

    <title>How to charge battery to full capacity again&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to charge battery to full capacity again&#63;</h2>
                    Hi. Recently I received a message on my laptop (Samsung RV520) asking did I want to set the battery to only charge to 80% as it was working on AC power most of the time. I did this but since then I have started using my laptop a lot more on battery power
 and would like it to charge to 100% again so I can get maximum use out of the battery. I can't find where to do this. It doesn't appear to be in the power settings section. Any help would be appreciated.

            <p><span>Hi Gavin, </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your question in the Microsoft Community!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>After going through your issue description, it appears that you have an issue with battery performance; I would suggest you to go through the following method.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You can try these settings and check the issue status.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on start, navigate to Control Panel.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on Performance and Maintenance, click on Power Options.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click "Change Plan Settings".
</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Set all tabs to "Never" underneath "On Battery" column.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click "Change advanced power settings".
</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Set Sleep to Hibernate after to 0 or Never.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Set Battery to Critical Battery Level to 0.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>h.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on "OK", then "Save Changes".
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This is the only time that we recommend taking the battery all the way down to zero percent. Unplug the ac adapter, and let the battery drain all the way down until the laptop shuts off. Then plug the AC adapter back in, and let it recharge to 100%.
 You may need to repeat the cycle 2-3 times before it actually reaches 100%.</span></p>

<h2>            Secure Boot Violation- Invalid Signature detected. Check Secure Boot policy in Setup</h2>
                    <p>I have a surface pro, my os is Windows 8. A few weeks ago i made the windows updates and afterwards my surface wont start up, instead it redirects me to this screen&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Every solution i have found shows disabling the secure boot from the bios, i cant manage to enter the bios, and if i disable it in here nothing new will happen. if there is anyone to help me... i would be really grateful.</p>

            <p>Hello Morris, thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>After trying different options I decided to go with the windows reset, I created a recovery image on a pendrive with the surface pro 2 downloadable from the microsoft page. Now the thing is, when I select the reset your pc option it will give me the error
 "There was a problem resetting your pc".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already surrendered with recovering my previous data, and just want my surface back. If you could help me with this problem i would really appreciate it.</p>

<h2>            Files Disappearing</h2>
                    I am working with a music software program called Finale, and for the second time, my .musx files have been deleted from my computer. I receive the following two messages, cannot open file- system cannot find specified file. .musx moved or changed. I have
 looked in %appdata%, I have searched the folder in which the file was saved on my D drive, I have clicked show all hidden folders, and nothing appears to be bringing my file back. I have contacted the music notation software company and no one seems to be
 able to tell me what the problem is and more importantly, how to get my file back. I have a Wednesday deadline and I cannot afford to start over. Please help me find my file! Many thanks, Courtney&nbsp;

            The only thing I can suggest is using a 3rd party file name search tool called Everything, from Void tools:  <a href="http://www.voidtools.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.voidtools.com/</a>
<br />
<br />The have both installed and "portable" versions.  
<br />
<br />I find it much better than the built in search. Set the options to search the whole drive, to not exclude any folders. Then search for you musx files.

<p>Dear Article Author</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your kind reply. I tried this program and was able to locate the file, but when I click on the actual file it opens up an older version of the file on my computer dates 10/27/17. The odd thing is that the file in the folder on void tools has
 the date and time that I last saved the file on my computer today, but it opens an older version of the file. There is an option to open the file as a PDF, but when I do that I get the following error message: Adobe cannot open the file because it is either
 not a supported file type or it has been damaged.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what to do, and I desperately need this music back. Thank you again for your reply!&nbsp;</p>

            Bottom line, sounds like are out of luck. There are a few long shot things you can try.
<br />
<br />Check with the company to see if the program uses TMP / temp files while it is editing, like word does. It yes, maybe you can find some of those temp files (ie deleted) and use them to recover part of your lost file changes.
<br />
<br />If you get the option to open as PDF, but it causes an error, that suggests that the file has a PDF file extension. If it does, try changing it to MUSX.

    <title>Deleting the SP1 update to W7 so I can &#34;reinstall&#34; W7 from the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jg_903  say:</h3>
<h2>            Deleting the SP1 update to W7 so I can &#34;reinstall&#34; W7 from the Install Disc that came with that computer that is pre-SP1</h2>
                    I found SP1 in the list of Windows Updates but am unable to uninstall it from there.&nbsp; Microsoft tutorial tells me that I probably deleted some needed backup files with multiple uses of "Disc Cleanup".&nbsp; And that I cannot install an older version of W7 over
 a new one.&nbsp; Sorry.<br />
<br />
Then I read to try to delete SP1 using the Command Prompt and typed:&nbsp; wusa /uninstall /kb:976932 ya know, to force the uninstall.&nbsp; But no.&nbsp; A huge page of instructions of some sort popped up with no instructions on how to proceed (nor was I forewarned that
 would be the next step once I did this Command Prompt).&nbsp; Also tried:&nbsp; wusa.exe /uninstall /kb:976932.&nbsp; That didn't work either.<br />
<br />
The problem is, I used CCCleaner to clean out the registry which I now read can just mess things up in there and to never ever clean out one's registry.&nbsp; Opinions differ on that but I wish I hadn't.&nbsp; Of course, the registry was so hosed after that I couldn't
 use CCCleaner's "registry backup" files it made before it hosed the registry.&nbsp; Worse and worse.<br />
<br />
Somewhere I have a post-SP1 copy of a W7 Install Disc but I can't find it.&nbsp; Be nice if I could just delete SP1 and use the disc I did find.&nbsp; Anyone know how I should proceed?<br />
<br />
edit:&nbsp; I just tried both of the above Command Prompts (run as administrator) again and now I get the message for both of them "Installer encountered an error 0x80070002 The system cannot find the file specified".<br />
<br />
Well heck, great, maybe SP1 IS uninstalled!&nbsp; I go back into the list of Windows Updates and alas, there it still is.<br />

1)&nbsp; I had super long shut down times and had really bad ability to connect wirelessly (I've talked about the wireless mess on another thread over on Devices).&nbsp; I thought if I just cleaned the registry up with CCCleaner maybe that would resolve something, who
 knows what, but after that I had Windows Explorer issues.&nbsp; I'm a photographer and I would try to import images off an SD card using Windows Explorer and I know what to expect.&nbsp; I put in the card, rename the folder, say "Copy" and "Paste" it onto the hard drive/folder
 of my choice.&nbsp; After CCCleaner the info box would say "importing xxx of files" when I know that was not the number of images on the card!&nbsp; Then the wrong number again would wind up on the folder I was sending them to.&nbsp; An important issue that needed fixing.<br />
<br />
2)&nbsp; The W7 install disc I have is pre-SP1.&nbsp; The W7 I have installed on that computer is post-SP1 and is considered by the W7 installer to be a "newer" version of windows so the install could not proceed.<br />
<br />
3)&nbsp; I can uninstall any Windows Update I want except SP1.&nbsp; I left click on any other Update and "Uninstall" appears in the top of the page.&nbsp; Not so with SP1.<br />
<br />
4)&nbsp; Windows Update works fine.&nbsp; This whole exercise was just an experiment in getting my registry back to "factory default" without losing all my software.&nbsp; I'm assuming I'd have to reinstall all Windows Updates after that but that's no big deal.&nbsp; Keeping all
 my photography software (CS5, LR4.4, DxO etc etc) intact was key.<br />
<br />
5)&nbsp; Any System Restore points prior to pre-downloading of SP1 (back in 2011) are long gone.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your comments.&nbsp; I'll try Microsoft Fixit and go to the other links you provided.&nbsp; I've since read that even Microsoft advises against "cleaning" the registry.&nbsp; They and others call it "snake oil" and usually does more harm than good.&nbsp; Others swear
 by it but I think in the future I'll just not "clean" the registry.<br />

I haven't ignored trying that, it's just that I've not seen that mentioned in all the research I've done over the past week.&nbsp; Not one word referring to what you suggest.&nbsp; Weird, huh?<br />

I'm not that computer savvy&nbsp; (even though I use my computers all day in my work, can switch out hard drives and video cards and such) so could you please walk me through how to do that?&nbsp; Thanks.<br />

Thanks for that tip.&nbsp; It just seems strange that with all the copyright issues with Windows a guy could just download a copy of W7 and use it.&nbsp; Do the issues just come into play when someone tries to install W7 without the install key that came with the computer?&nbsp;
 Mine is on a sticker on the side of the case.<br />
<br />
Hidden somewhere deep within a box somewhere in my storage unit is the W7 (post-Sp1) that came with another computer.&nbsp; I'm going to look for it (and try your suggestion) if I do a fresh install once again.<br />
<br />
I have a thread working on "Devices" here on these forums about the desktop in question's inability to connect wirelessly (my other desktops do instantly).&nbsp; I thought a fresh install of W7 on a new "C" disc would clear that up.&nbsp; Well, it did until I downloaded
 142 Windows Updates.&nbsp; Then the ability to connect went south again, just like it was on the previous "C" drive I had in there.&nbsp; I took the original "C" drive out, put in the new one, did the install and all the Window Updates and was back to where I was before.<br />
<br />
Not to hijack my own thread, but the desktop I'm typing out this with (W7) has the same updates and connects wireless instantly.&nbsp; I finally gave up on the problematic one and just plugged in an ethernet connection.&nbsp;&nbsp; Be nice for it to perform flawlessly like
 this one, though, it's my backup photo computer with all the same software I have on this one.&nbsp; If I'm in the middle of a job and this computer konks out for some reason, I need a computer I can just fire up and continue with that job.<br />

            <p>The issue is the licence and the CoA sticker's Product Key is your proof of having&nbsp;a licence.&nbsp; The downloads themselves [from Digital River, MS official software online distributor] have no Product Key and are therefore legitimate.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Finding your existing SP1 installation disk would be much quicker.&nbsp; </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you don't mind having to work through all the necessary updates afterwards, then you could also restore the factory image.&nbsp; You don't say what make &amp; model of PC you have.&nbsp; The procedure varies between them - the procedure will definitely be in the PC
 manual or available on the PC maker's website.&nbsp; </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I suspect that your WiFi problem involves a WiFi driver update.&nbsp; Reinstalling Windows will reinstall the driver but so would** working within Device manager [with Admin permission].&nbsp; You should be able to go into that and roll-back the driver to the previous
 version.&nbsp; I have had the same problem with my laptop, I am still having to use the 2009 driver for my WiFi card as any updated version reduces reception too much [I could just about cope with&nbsp;a WiFi router six feet away].&nbsp;
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/message/b39d2dfc-ed9b-4f82-8d2a-4a340959f271?threadId=98f9246a-8f39-4f17-bad5-b664e6da5a65">
<font color="#3165c6">Poor wireless signal Dell Inspiron 1564 laptop 1397 WLAN mini-card</font></a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>**&nbsp; Additional [1 hour later] - I've just been reading over the whole thread again.&nbsp; Since you mention that you have been running a Registry cleaner, that complicates fault-finding as the results of any individual&nbsp;Registry cleaner's actions can never be
 gauged [even by those who choose to regard them as&nbsp;effective].&nbsp; <strong>I therefore believe that your best option is restore from factory image or full re-installation and only when this is complete will you be able to conduct a worthwhile investigation into
 your WiFi problem.</strong>&nbsp; </p>

            <p>A&nbsp;back to factory reset. Note that unless you save all important stuff, it will be lost after the reset.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: bold"><font>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes..</font></span></p>
<p><font><span>For Dell, press F8
</span><span>on the keyboard until the </span><span style="font-weight: bold">Advanced Boot Options
</span><span>menu appears on the screen.</span></font></p>
<p>For HP, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For LG, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For Toshiba, press and hold '0' BEFORE and during the power up</p>
<p>For Acer, press and hold ALT + F10 as soon as you see the logo</p>
<p>For Asus, press F9 as soon as you see the Asus logo.</p>
<p>For Samsung, press F4 at power up..
</p>
<p>For Fujitsu,<span><font>&nbsp;
</font></span>p<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><font>ress the F8 key repeatedly directly after powering up</font></span></p>
<p>For Advent, restart your computer. Then Press F10 repeatedly until the message "Starting System Recovery" is displayed</p>
<p>For Sony VAIO, restart and press "F8" or "F10" repeatedly until the "Advanced Boot Options" screen appears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may have to try more than once to get any of the above to work. If after repeated attempts, you have no luck or the machine reports that there is no recovery partition, your only option is to
 contact the computer manufacturer and ask for recovery disks for the model.. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the reset, you should get<span style="font-weight: bold"><font> all</font></span> updates from Windows Update EXCEPT for hardware devices. Next, you should install a good anti-virus
 solution. ONLY AFTER you have done this should you replace stuff from backups or install anything else.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>OR.. Recovery disks from the computer manufacturer do the same except that you boot from the CD/DVD drive.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Both of the above will reset Windows 7, all software originally included will still be there, all drivers for the machine will have been installed, Windows will automatically be activated, and the
 machine will be ready run.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>There is another way but it involves use of a READABLE COA sticker which contains the Windows version and a 25 character key code. The sticker is generally fixed to the underside of laptops or latterly
 in the battery compartment or on the side panel of a desktop machine.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Is your COA sticker readable? If so, read on. If no, go back to the first two ways.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You can download OEM Windows 7 SP1&nbsp;editions which can be used in conjunction with the 25 character key code on the COA sticker. There is more to do this way as you will have to get drivers for your
 machine from the computer manufacturer website, and you will also have to go through the activation process. Sometimes, a machine will activate across the Internet when it first starts up, and sometimes you will have to activate over automated phone activation
 service.. </p>

<h2>            Windows Phone App for Desktop hangs deleting files on phone when syncing with Win10 phone</h2>
                    <p>If I sync a set of music files where some files are to be deleted, or some have been renamed, the Windows Phone App for Desktop hangs after deleting the first one or two files. The only workaround is to identify which sets of files are being deleted and
 delete them on the phone directly first - a real pain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come on, the music sync for local music NEEDS to be fixed - this (and the playlist sync issue) can't be THAT hard to address.</p>

            <p>We surmise that this may have to do with compatibility issues since the app is designed to run originally in a Windows 7 environment. We suggest running the program in compatibility mode by following the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click on the application then click on <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li><span>Click on the </span><strong>Compatibility</strong><span> tab and check the box

            <p>I've tried this and unfortunately it does not seem to change anything. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like there is a timing issue going on as it will delete a few songs and then hang - as if it's waiting for the phone to catch up, but getting in a loop waiting. The only option is to disconnect the phone from the USB connection and delete the songs
 that seem to be blocking the deletion manually and then continue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Phone is Lumia 950XL build 10.0.14393.351&nbsp;(1607), with music stored on SD card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For info, there is another bug with the sync around playlists in this scenario which I have also reported on the Feedback App - summary for those with same issue is, playlists won't sync to phone if using SD card for music storage, workaround is sync music,
 change storage settings for Music to device, sync playlists, change settings back. Posted as a discussion for reference as https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_other-winapps/windows-phone-app-for-desktop-fails-syncing/e2e54841-a019-4993-868c-83a8c4b2d968</p>

    <title>Why do my saved documents show up in a Library as well as in the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ewalton676  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do my saved documents show up in a Library as well as in the Folder I created specifically for that document&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In all Windows 2000 series and Vista I could make a folder, click and drag a document I had&nbsp;saved into my documents,&nbsp;to&nbsp;that specific folder.&nbsp; In Windows 7 you have Libraries.&nbsp; In the Library named My Documents I save a document and then make a folder to
 place this document in.&nbsp; When I drag the saved document into the folder it is now in both places.&nbsp; I want the document to only be in the folder and not in My Documents.&nbsp; It makes it more confusing and harder to find what I saved.&nbsp; I am very organized and when
 I find something I want it in one place only.&nbsp; I tried following all your help steps in Windows 7 and lost everything I had and it took me hours to find it and get it back.&nbsp; I do a lot of genealogy and save such images as book pages, census pages, death certificates,
 etc.&nbsp; I make folders for each of the categories I need to place my found data into.
</p>
<p>I just want&nbsp;the data I saved into&nbsp;the Library named My&nbsp;Documents to be in one spot, a specific folder I created.&nbsp; Not displayed in the Library as well as in the folder, that is two places the same piece of&nbsp;data is then saved.&nbsp;&nbsp;Where all my folders will show
 up in the Library named My Documents and I can open the folder and find my data easily. If I delete the data in one place it automatically deletes it where ever else the same data is stored. This double saving&nbsp;takes up needed space on my hard drive as well
 as makes it harder to find what I saved.&nbsp; This is very frustrating.&nbsp; What happened to just drag and drop and the data automatically moves to the place you specify and is removed from where you drug it from.&nbsp; I do not like this feature in Windows 7.&nbsp; It is
 too complicated and causes much confusion.&nbsp; I am not a computer teckie and do not like making changes to my system.&nbsp;&nbsp; How do I fix this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is what you have done in Windows 7, &nbsp;and what I wind up with.</p>
<p>Library</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Documents (why do I need two locations&nbsp;named My Documents?)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My Documets (my data is first saved&nbsp;here) (when drug and dropped to a specific folder it should disappear from here and show up only in the folder)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Folder I created. (data drug and dropped in the folder, the&nbsp;duplicate of the saved&nbsp;data stays in My Documents, both places, why?)</p>

            <span>No duplicates are created, you're just looking at the same file from two different angles. &nbsp;I know this answer is long, but it will explain...</span>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Libraries are not different folders or locations. &nbsp;They're actually just combined views. &nbsp;Put literally, they operate like this: when you open your Documents library, it runs a search of two locations:&nbsp;<i>your documents</i>, and the&nbsp;<i>public documents</i>&nbsp;folders,
 then shows you every file or folder it found in those locations. &nbsp;The point is to give you one combined view of all the documents you care about, regardless of where they are. &nbsp;If you had documents on a network drive or external hard drive, you could tell
 the library to search those folders too and include them in the combined view.
<div><br />
<div>When you save something to a library, the library just puts it in the default location (in this case, the default would be something like C:\Users\John\Documents) and it begins showing up in the library's search result. &nbsp;If you delete something, you're
 deleting the original: &nbsp;there never were two copies or anything, the library is just there to combine multiple places to make it easier to see all at once.</div>
<div><br />
<div>You might think you have no use for this -- and you could very well be right. &nbsp;If that's the case, just use it normally and don't bother including extra folders in the library. &nbsp;That is to say, just pretend that your Documents&nbsp;<i>library</i>&nbsp;is your Documents&nbsp;<i>folder</i>.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I, on the other hand, use it like this: &nbsp;I have a lot of movies, TV shows, video clips and other video content. &nbsp;So much that it takes up several hard drives. &nbsp;I told my Video library to show all these locations so that I can browse all my movies from
 one Library, rather than trying to remember which drive a particular show was on.</div>

            %windir%\system32\mspaint.exe in the Start Run box should open it, if it does, you can create a shortcut for your Desktop or Start Menu via the mspaint.exe.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Maybe Enterprise is too highbrow to understand abbreviations (I was going to say nicknames) in that by Paint you mean MSpaint.exe?

    <title>Accessing remote server via remote desktop and ftp - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gismgr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Accessing remote server via remote desktop and ftp</h2>
                    At my office I need to log in to a remote server running Windows Server 2003 Enterprise Edition SP2.&nbsp; We have several different computers in the office, all in the same room, that need to access this remote computer.&nbsp; Four of them are running XP, one is
 running Vista, and one is running Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Everything is working just fine on all the computers EXCEPT the one running Windows 7.&nbsp; I cannot get to the remote server via Remote Desktop, nor can I FTP to it, from win7.&nbsp; I can do both of those things from all the xp computers and vista.<br />
<br />
I am able to FTP to other remote servers from win7, and I can use Remote Desktop to access other computers on the same domain as the WIN7 box.<br />
<br />
The remote computer is accessed via IP address.<br />
<br />
I've disabled the antivirus and firewall (we use Symantec Endpoint Protection).&nbsp; No change.&nbsp; I've tried various tweaks to the TCP/IP settings.&nbsp; No change.&nbsp; I've adjusted the security policy on Windows 7 so that it matches the policy settings on one of the working
 XP boxes (in particular, set Network Security: LAN Manager authentication level to Send LM &amp; NTLM with NTLMv2 if negotiated).&nbsp; No change.<br />
<br />
Is there another setting or security policy somewhere that I need to change?&nbsp; Maybe one of the NTLM restrictions that are part of the win7 secpol but not available in vista or xp?&nbsp; Is there a setting somewhere that might be restricting access via IP address?&nbsp;
 Any suggestions at all?<br />

The folder says Video RM and Video TS.&nbsp; No audio folder.&nbsp; Both folders contain files.&nbsp; I'll try video ts and see if it has the material unless you have another suggestion.&nbsp; Many thanks.

    <title>CPU Throttling after Windows 10 Anniversary Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jackthorntonctr  say:</h3>
<h2>            CPU Throttling after Windows 10 Anniversary Update</h2>
                    <p>After an automatic (without asking first) upgrade to the Windows 10 Anniversary edition, my computer started running slowly. I assumed it was probably a typical software problem (e.g. far more time expended in security activities), but then I looked at the
 Task Manager performance tab and noticed that my 2.4GHz-rated CPU is running at 0.60 to 0.79 GHz. It would normally show both baseline and boosted speeds up to 3.0GHz.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find it a bit much to believe that, coincidentally, exactly when the update arrived, my fan or heat or CPU failed (note that my CPU is running from 41 to 54 degrees centigrade, which is not terribly cool, but FAR from the 100-degree limit). I think it
 more likely the new OS is somehow telling the CPU to throttle itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone else whose system is running like dog droppings after the upgrade check to see if their CPU speed has dropped?</p>

            <p>Wow. Sure enough, I went into my BIOS and disabled "Intel SpeedStep", which OS's use to **** around with processor speed to "save power and lengthen the life of your components". When I next booted into Windows 10, the processor was running at the rated
 speed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows is supposed to detect when you're not stressing your computer, and only adjust down the clock rates then; raising them back up when demand rises. The new "and improved" Windows 10 update kept my clock rate at 25% of rated speed regardless of what
 I was doing and how much demand I was placing on the processor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Way to go, MS. In addition to applying an update first thing in the morning WITHOUT ASKING ME FIRST, said update taking a complete hour WHEN I HAD HIGH-PRIORITY WORK I NEEDED TO GET DONE in order to, I don't know, keep my job - they also made sure to hobble
 my computer so I couldn't do work efficiently afterward. </p>

            Hello, same happened to me about a week ago, changing BIOS settings (speedstep) didnt help, nor clean reinstall. I found it possible to tweak the system with Throttlestop and make a task scheduler for the .exe on every startup. Only solution that works
 for me. Issue was exactly the same.

            Apparently Fall Creator even goes further with CPU throttling or more defined its supposed to limit CPU access for apps running in background. But I feel laptops are suffering from more then just background apps throttling CPU use. My laptop is slower
 to boot, opens apps slower and just feels like CPU is really throttling back. I ran Task Manager and it does appear it takes a lot of demand to get the CPU up to its rated clock speed. Many users have found that Fall Creator makes all but the balanced profile
 in Control Panel power as hidden and I think this is to aggressively de- rate the CPU to brag about how Fall Creator saves battery. Well yes, it may indeed save a bit more battery, but at the expense of performance.&nbsp; A work around is find Mobility Center and
 switched your power setting back to performance. This at least sets CPU to its max clock speed. The other option is go into advanced settings in power profile and set CPU minimum percentage back up so it does not reduce clock speed s

<h3> redtopia  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Mail app - zoom in when composing adds horizontal scrollbar</h2>
                    <p>When composing a message in the mail app, I want my text size to be the default 11px because that seems like a reasonable font size to send. On the other hand, I prefer that my text is a bit larger, which makes it easier to read. If you zoom in when composing
 a message in the Mail app, you get a horizontal scrollbar, which is a terrible user experience all around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Outlook, I can send 11px fonts and set the zoom to 125% (or whatever), and there is still a single vertical scrollbar in the compose window.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to zoom in without getting a horizontal scrollbar?</p>

            Hello Redtopia, my name is Irisdiel and I am an independent advisor.
<br />I suggest following the instructions down below.
<br />
<br />Open powershell as administrator
<br />Run the command Get-appxprovisionedpackage –online | where-object {$_.packagename –like “*windowscommunicationsapps*”} | remove-appxprovisionedpackage –online
<br />Re-install Mail, People and Calendar from the Store (green tile)
<br />
<br />Hope this helps!
<br />Thank you and good luck,
<br />Regards- Irisdiel H.
