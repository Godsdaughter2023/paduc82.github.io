<h2>            New folder on my D drive made up of 22 letters and numbers.</h2>
                    I purchased a new computer a couple of weeks ago with Windows 7. I have a hard drive which is partitioned into C and D.&nbsp; Today I noticed a new folder on my D drive made up of 22 letters and numbers.&nbsp; Within that folder are the following files $shtdwn$.req,
 3 files with FAEF7E2F-A0E..., mpasbase.vdm._p, mpasdlta.vdm, mpengine.dll, mpengine.dll_p, and MPSigStub.&nbsp; Are these windows files? I have ran my antivirus and spyware no viruses or spyware was found.

<p><span>The files that you are referring to are temporary files created during the update process of either Windows Defender or
 Microsoft Security Essentials. You can delete those files and folders off, this will not cause any problems.</span></p>

<h2>            Powershell has stopped working message on    Windows 7    64 system</h2>
                    <p>I tried to post this once already but i cannot find my responses nor my question from before so I'll re-post it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if this problem was caused by a windows update, but it seems to have started soon after I did it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been besieged &nbsp;by &nbsp;pop up &nbsp;"Powershell has stopped working" &nbsp;that happens every 10 seconds or so. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure if this is malware or if it was caused by the update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions on how to perform system checks or diagnostics would be appreciated. &nbsp;I've attached the signature below and it looks quite different from the previous posts. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I still have a restore point for last Monday, I'm not sure if I should try to restore it before performing any clean boot. &nbsp; or System file checker &nbsp;to diagnose corrupt files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a recommended procedure to follow for example. &nbsp;1) try restore point</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 2) try clean boot</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3) try system file checker</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;4)Or malware remover &nbsp;malwarebites &nbsp;anti rootkit etc.</p>

            Hi, this is the problem with drivers of your touchpad.<br />
Download the latest drivers for the touchpad from the laptop manufacturer website<br />
<br />
If drivers are currently there. Disable the Pointing Stick from the options of the Drivers ( pointing stick is found in between Keyboard Alphabets G H J.<br />
Some times with Pointing stick goes bad this problem occurs..<br />

<h3> &#91;g70115&#93;  say:</h3>
<h2>            How To Change Protection to the Program Files folder in Win 10</h2>
                    <p>There is a C:\Program Files\ folder and I am using Win 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created a Sub folder called SS&nbsp; (i.e. C:\Program Files\SS\ ) and I want users to add data and make changes to data in that folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to makes changes to the security like those on the C: drive. &nbsp;&nbsp; Currently I am using the C:\SS\&nbsp; folder and I have not issues in users making any changes.&nbsp; Once I put SS into the Program Files folder, when I make changes to a file, it wants me
 to save it else where and then move it back into the folder. &nbsp; That works, but it would make user very unhappy doing that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I change the security of the SS folder within the Program Files???&nbsp; I want it to work like the SS folder was under the C:\ drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any suggestions for me?? &nbsp; Is it possible to do what I want??</p>
<p>
</p><p>

I've just downloaded and installed windows 10 on my machine and it went quite smoothly, but my cursor doesn't show up in the installation screen after the first boot. My mouse wasn't lit up and the led backlight on my keyboard was frozen. Both they keyboard
 and mouse do not work. I've tried plugging in a basic keyboard and mouse. The basic ones work in bios but there was still no cursor in the installation screen.<br />
<br />
Please help. Thanks in advance.<br />
</p>
<p>PS: Posted on behalf of a friend, he currently does not have a device capable of accessing support.</p>

<p>
</p><ol>

<p>Try to pin different Keyboard and Mouse to your system and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you force restart your system and try to plug in different Keyboard and Mouse to your system and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you had mentioned that basic one works in bios, so I would suggest you to check in the BIOS settings whether the Keyboard and Mouse options are enabled.</p>

            I am experiencing a similar issue -&nbsp; I loaded Windows 10 onto my laptop last night and although my laptop keyboard works (hence why I am able to write this message),&nbsp;the touchpad for my cursor does not, and there is no cursor visible on my screen. Any
 ideas on how to fix this?

            <p>So I just managed to get my issue fixed! I spoke to Asus (as I have an asus laptop) and they told me to go and&nbsp;download&nbsp;new drivers. So I went&nbsp;to asus.com --&gt; Service --&gt; (enter your computer model number) --&gt; Windows 10&nbsp;drivers --&gt; download the ATK &amp; Touchpad
 drivers. I then removed the old drivers and&nbsp;loaded these new ones. Apparently the whole touch-pad not working thing has been a pretty common issue with the windows 10 update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, hope this helps!</p>

<p>Thank you for replying at all. It appears that one Win 10 update disabled my Acer usb ports. BUT a later update fixed it. All has been stable in that regard for more than a week. Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Virtual desktops</h2>
                    <p>If you open a word document on desktop number 1, then open a new virtual desktop and open a new word document it opens up on desktop nr 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To avoid it you have to first open word on the new desktop then open the document.</p>
<p>This happens on different applications other than word. Are there any possible fixes in the future?<br />

<div>The document that you are creating on virtual desktop has the same location. That s why you are able to see it in desktop no 1. So, that's a in built feature.</div>

<p>Did you even read the question?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I have word open on desktop 1, then I change to desktop 2 which does not have anything open yet.
</p>
<p>Then I open my documents folder and double click the document I would like to open.
</p>
<p>Instead of opening the document on desktop nr 2, it changes back to desktop nr 1 and opens it there.
</p>
<p>How is this a feature?!? </p>
<p>
</p><p>If I wanted to open something on desktop nr 1 I would use desktop nr 1.&nbsp;</p>

            You must remember that a single copy of Word is loaded and that one copy handles every document you open. The only way to get a document onto a different virtual desktop would be to start a second copy of Word.

<p>In the article you linked it says talks about 4 goals Microsoft has with virtual desktops:</p>
<ol>
<li>Give you more desktop space to group related windows</li><li>Help you quickly locate and switch to any window or group of windows</li><li>Let you easily re-organize your groups and move windows as tasks evolve</li><li>Keep you in control of the degree of separation between your grouped windows</li></ol>
<p>Not being able to control what desktop the program opens on really doesn't fit in with these goals.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give me one good reason for why it is suppose force me to change virtual desktop when I open a program, just one good reason and I will consider to drop the issue. To me this sounds like virtual desktops isn't ready yet and you refuse to&nbsp;acknowledge that
 there are bugs, because this makes it very hard to work with multiply virtual desktops.</p>

            I just don't understand why it would force me to change from desktop 2 to desktop 1 when I open a program, the reason I opened it in virtual desktop nr 2 is because i wanted it to be in virtual desktop nr 2. Not being able to control what program is in
 what desktop makes virtual desktops useless.

            <p>When you open the second document it opens it in the original copy of Word. To open a second copy go to the taskbar and right click on the Word icon. In the context menu click on Microsoft Word; do not left click on the icon. You now have two copies of Word
 running and you can move one of them to your desired virtual desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you could just move one of the documents to another virtual desktop.</p>

            <p>I understand how to work around the problem, but the problem is still there. It just seems like you are saying "We know that there is a problem with virtual desktops, but we wont do **** about it"</p>
<p>
</p><p>There isn't one case I can imagine where it would be a good idea to change the desktop for the user, the point of virtual desktops is to organize what you are working on to different desktops, this goes against that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This also happens sometimes when you press start in a different virtual desktop, but I am guessing that this is how it is suppose to be?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Alan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are missing the entire point of wanting virtual desktops.&nbsp; Virtual desktops have been around for decades on other operating systems.&nbsp; Or, on this OS using third party programs to accomplish virtual desktops.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The goal of virtual desktops is that when you are in that desktop, the computer acts like it is the only desktop.&nbsp; Would it make sense to you to open Word and it open up on your best friend's computer in the office next door?&nbsp; No!</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to me you have a work around for how this can work.&nbsp; What you describe above is what Windows SHOULD do for the user.&nbsp; The user shouldn't have to work around the feature to get things to work like they want.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your response is that "most people" would want it to work this way, that is hogwash.&nbsp; All other implementations of virtual desktop work the way sirBait has described.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I am in a desktop, and I want to open up ANYTHING, I want it to open up in THAT desktop.&nbsp; Not any other desktop.&nbsp; Don't make the assumption that the user is stupid and doesn't know what they are doing.&nbsp; You describe above how to open up a 2nd copy of
 Word.&nbsp; When I click on a Word document like sirBait describes, make it the default that a 2nd copy of Word is opened in the 2nd desktop.&nbsp; Then, the user doesn't have to take a bunch of manual steps to accomplish what is obviously what they would want (since
 they are intentionally on the 2nd desktop).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you think other people still want this original (IMO broken) functionality, then create a flag to keep the old functionality.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>sjmyst</p>

</p><p>I have no intention of defending how Word works. I was merely attempting to explain how I believe Word does work.</p>

<h2>            The Procedure entry point problem</h2>
                    After start up I get an error message saying the procedure entry point is Not found for XTray.exe . This is accompanied by a long list of of numbers and letters and further information about the dynamic link library win32RenderingEngine.dll.&nbsp; How can i
 resolve this problem?

<p>Do you have or have you ever had any McAffee products installed on your system (if so, what names and versions)?&nbsp; Is one currently installed (if so, what name and version)?</p>
<p>Do a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">complete</span> search of the C:\ drive for the Xtray.exe file and then the win32RenderingEngine.dll file and please post back the exact and complete file paths ( C:\Program Files\... or whatever).</p>
<div>
<p><span>To search the
 Click on that.&nbsp; That will do a quick indexed search and bring up a dialog box.&nbsp; Click on Advanced Search.&nbsp; Click on the location drop down menu and find Drive C: and click on it. Check the box "include non-indexed, hidden, and system files (may be slow)."&nbsp;
 Then click on Search.&nbsp; You will now be searching your entire hard drive for the specified file.&nbsp; And yes, it's not a very efficient way of searching the entire drive for a file but that's how it's done in Vista.</span></p>
<p>Download and install Autoruns <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</a>&nbsp;and run it to check what is starting during startup.&nbsp; This product is MUCH superior to msconfig which comes with Vista.&nbsp; Look through the list to find Xtray.exe and/or win32RenderingEngine.dll
 (there may be more than one entry so check the whole listing).&nbsp; To stop these programs from starting at startup, delete them from the startup list (or uncheck the box so they are not included in the startup list).</p>
<p>You may be infected with malware. <span>
Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:
</span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and
</span><span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span><span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a></span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials
</span><span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></a></span><span>
<span>(with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time).
<span>&nbsp;</span>You may also want to try the free Avira at: </span></span><span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a></span><span>
 and Avast at: </span><span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a></span><span>.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Reboot after completing all the scans.<span>&nbsp; </span>
You may also want to try the free OneCare at </span><span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></span></a></span><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></p>
<p><span>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></p>
<span>
<div>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span>
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work.<br />
<br />
If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning startup (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools /
 Event Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a></span><span>.
<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work.&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install
 (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></p>

<h2>            Windows Update&#58; Internet Explorer 11 for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems</h2>
                    <p>I have a question about Windows Update.&nbsp; I have Windows Update set to run automagically.&nbsp; For the most part it's worked fine with benign neglect.&nbsp; Periodically I notice updates when I power off and boot up.&nbsp; That makes the shut-down process and boot-up process
 a little slower than usual, but otherwise things go fine.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Lately, however, I had occasion to look at the update history and noticed that the following update had
<em>failed.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Internet Explorer 11 for Windows 7 for x64-based Systems</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's weird about this is <em>I already have Internet Explorer 11 installed on my computer</em>.&nbsp; The descriptive text for the update makes it look likely that this is not an incremental update to IE 11, it's an update intended to install IE 11 on a computer
 that doesn't already have it.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Download the fast and fluid browser recommended for Windows 7.<br />

http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=281970</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, can I, should I just hide this update and carry on?&nbsp; IE 11 appears to be working.&nbsp; Or, am I in danger of missing something?&nbsp; What puzzles me here is the question, why would Windows Update offer me an installation of IE 11 when
<em>it's already installed on my computer</em>?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do those of you who are well informed think?</p>
<p>

            <p>IF you do not want Windows 10, you may be in luck.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason you have not been invaded by Windows10 is that the system doesn't think IE11 is installed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it works fine and you do not want win10, I would hide that update and be happy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Story:&nbsp; Microsoft is kind of shooting itself in its own feet.&nbsp; Their "upgrade" program requires the latest up to date IE11 be running.&nbsp; There are millions upon millions of Windows users who haven't used IE in many years, and if it exists on their system,
 it is an old version.&nbsp; They prefer other browsers (MS competitors) like Chrome or Firefox.&nbsp; Consequently, they are free from Win10 hassle.</p>

Although you would be prompted to confirm the purchase, you should not be charged again for this content as the price for this should state that it is free. After you confirm the purchase within the in-game store, are you then able to see if this content is in the ready to install section when you <a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/purchasing/redeem-token-where-is-game-or-dlc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">manage</a> this game? </p>

            <p>Hi Miss Edi,</p><p><br />To clarify, yes I followed the steps outlined in my original post for each of the 4 DLCs, including Burial at Sea: Episode 1 or Burial at Sea: Episode 2 (Part 1 of 2).</p><p>After you confirm the purchase of&nbsp;Burial at Sea: Episode 1 or Burial at Sea: Episode 2 (Part 1 of 2) within the in-game store, nothing appeared in the "Ready to Install" list. Even the in-game store didn't label the DLC as "PURCHASED" as it had done for Clash in the Clouds and Burial at Sea: Episode 2 (Part 2 of 2).<br /><br />I have actually spoken to someone on web chat since writing my original post, and they have helped me with a workaround whilst escalating the overall issue to a support team. To be honest I didn't expect such a quick response on the forum, but thanks for responding!</p><p><br /></p><p>--------------</p><p><br /></p><p>@Ambassador Zemi: Some Xbox 360 season passes worked slightly differently to how X1 passes work these days - they were more like 100% discount codes automat

<p>Is it posible for you to change it to <strong>X: \windows\system32&gt; </strong>??.<br />
<br />
If you're Able to, and since we almost run out of option, you may try this command:<br />
<br />
<strong>rstrui.exe</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>That is the System Restore. I suggest you choose the backup generated 7 days ago, or that would all be up to you now, sir</p>

<h3> marcomoho-ad  say:</h3>
<h2>            Google Chrome suddenly crashes &#40;win32k.sys error &#38; BSOD&#41;</h2>
                    <p>In a few weeks time I have had a Bleu Screen of Death occurring on my home computer. I do have Vista and even have to clean up my PC several times a day, just to keep it running. Sometimes even Malware Bytes Anti-Malware doesn't work on start up, the next
 day it does. It is strange, I even manually removed the Chameleon Version as that seemed to give the problem of those notifications, nothing happened there though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lately, a few weeks ago and yesterday evening, my computer suddenly experienced the Bleu Screen. Have checked for malware, but that is not the case. When the Bleu Screen happened, I had Google Chrome open in two tabs. Visiting marktplaats.nl &amp; trying to
 visit Facebook. Chrome became very slow, the sites wouldn't load and then... POOF! I caught the BSOD and a few moments later my computer restarted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>win32k.sys was part of the error message, I guess. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When it happened:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had Chrome open on 2 tabs, no other programs were open. I hadn't cleaned up my computer in several hours and Chrome became laggy. I guess the problem seems to be in Chrome. Am starting to want it to remove more and more from my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to fx? If you say that I have to check the BIOS, then how do you do that??? I am not familiar with computers, so I have to be honest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the guilty party seems to be Google Chrome in this case as it has been open during both&nbsp;crashes.</p>

            <p>Ever since this problem happened, Malware Bytes Anti-Malware was starting to act more and more weird. Was suddenly closed upon startup, or even when I was just doing other stuff on my computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First re-installed all MBAM products. Of course de-install and then re-install them. Due to Friday the worst acting weird up by this program and of course not having internet. Restarted my computer 2 times, but that didn't solve it. After the 3rd time my
 Internet connection was restored. Got my Lifetime subscription back to, thank goodness. That part though has been solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Log files contain no valuable information about the crash though, category 6008 was the only thing that was noted. Since the BSOD I had no other crash, just waiting till the next one. Unfortunately even with Whocrashed I was unable to determain what could
 have caused this crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Honestly after my computer crashed I immediately cleaned it up. Thereby the recent happenings are gone though, but it seems my computer has no problems left.

            Hi<strong> SPBM,</strong> <strong><br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting on Microsoft Answers!<br />
<br />
1. </strong>Run time error messages are specific to Programs and Applications.<br />
<div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Check whether the <strong>Windows Installer Service</strong> is running?<br />
a. Click on <strong>Start</strong> ; In the <strong>Start search</strong> , type <strong>
services.msc</strong> and hit<strong> Enter</strong> .<br />
b. Restart the <strong>Windows Installer service</strong> by right clicking on the Service and clicking on restart.<br />
<br />
<strong>2. </strong>It is a possibility that a start-up program is unable to launch properly.<br />
If you can provide the complete error message with the application associated that would be of great help.<br />
<br />
<strong>3.</strong> If the error message does not have any Program associated check in Safe Mode and perform a clean boot to find the root cause.<br />
Please check whether you face the same issue while working in the safe mode.<br />
<strong>Step 1. Safe Mode</strong> <br />
1. Restart your computer.<br />
2. When the computer starts you will see your computer's hardware being listed. When you see this information start to gently&nbsp; tap the F8 key on your keyboard repeatedly until you are presented with the Windows 7 Advanced Boot Options screen.<br />
3. Using the arrow keys, select the Safe Mode option you want.<br />
4. Then press the enter key on your keyboard to boot into Windows 7 Safe Mode.<br />

6. Do whatever tasks you require, and when you are done, reboot to go back into normal mode.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Step 2. Clean Boot</strong> <br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; password, Or click Continue.<br />
2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
3. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup items check box.<br />
4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
5. Click OK.<br />
6. When you are prompted, click Restart.<br />

<h3> dpsmqs  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I keep the three finger tap functionality, but turn off Cortana activation&#63;</h2>
                    I have successfully used the regedit function to reapply the three finger tap to open link in new tab when in browser, however each time I do this it opens Cortana. While I can disable three finger tapping all together through the SettingsTouchpad steps,
 I want to keep the three finger tap, but lose the Cortana function.&nbsp;

<p>I have tried this solution, it does not work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>By default, a three finger tap invokes Cortana, see screenshot, if this is unticked, it no longer invokes Cortana, but that means that three finger tapping itself is disabled, not merely the Cortana element.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to keep the tapping, but not the Cortana. If I untick the box tapping just doesn't do anything, whereas if I do tick it, in addition to the changes I've made using the registry editor, it now opens links in new tabs, as I want it to, but it also opens
 the start menu, which I do not want it to.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5e65cb70-7f34-4dd8-b4f1-6a2461fd55ab?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5e65cb70-7f34-4dd8-b4f1-6a2461fd55ab?upload=true" /></a></p>

            I in fact appear to have already done this, but thanks for the suggestion. Currently the three finger tap now opens the link in a new tab (what I want) but also opens up the start menu, as if I had clicked the windows icon on the bottom left. Therefore
 while it does open a new tab, it also brings me out of the browser to open the start menu, which is very disruptive.&nbsp;

<p><span>Hi Gambe,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 antivirus program is installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: &nbsp;</span></strong><span>Check to see if the following helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Plug
 the wireless adapter into the back of the Xbox 360 console. Unplug the network cable from the console, if one is attached. The console will default to the wired connection if a network cable is inserted rather than create a wireless bridge to the network.
 Skip this step if you are using an Xbox 360 console.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Turn
 on the Xbox 360 console. The Dashboard menu will appear. Scroll up to the “My Xbox” section of the Dashboard.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Scroll
 right to the “System Settings” option under the “My Xbox” section. Select this option by pressing the “X” button on the controller.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select
 “Network Settings” from the system settings menu. Select “Configure Network.” Select “Wireless Mode” from the first group of network settings that appear.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select
 “Scan For Networks.” This will scan the area for any wireless networks close enough to create a wireless bridge to the console.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select
 your wireless network from the list. This will usually be the network with the strongest connection strength, unless there are other wireless networks in very close proximity to your Xbox 360 console.</span></p>
<p><span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Enter
 the security information for your wireless network into the prompt. This information will need to be obtained from the person that set up the wireless network or directly from the wireless router.</span></p>
<p><span><span>h.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select
 “Test Xbox Live Connection.” This will verify the wireless bridge between the Xbox 360 console and network is functioning properly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Temporarily disable the computer`s anti-virus
 program and check if you can perform these steps. If no issue occurs, then you might need to firewall settings within the security software.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span>&nbsp; Ensure to enable your anti-virus back on the computer
 after you finish these steps. It is not recommended to disable these settings on the computer. This is just to troubleshoot the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Regards,</span></p>

            Thanks for responding. I contacted Microsoft Support and spent 3 1/2 hours with them trying to fix my computer. Turns out it was a compatibility issue with Windows 10 and there were even more issues. After they tried everything, I had to reset Windows
 10. Just finished doing that and reinstalling a bunch of software that got deleted. Should be okay now. MS Support said it could have been a compatibility issue with Avast Free Antivirus software. They recommend not using it and instead using Windows Defender
 or using Avast, but turning it off when downloading Windows updates.
