<h2>            Entry Point Not Found AVIFIL32.dll</h2>
                    <p>When I try and start a game on my PC I get this error message:</p>
<p>csgo.exe - Entry Point Not Found<br />
The procedure entry point WideCha√≤ToMultiByte could not be located in the dynamic link library C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\AVIFIL32.dll.</p>
<p>I've tried everything that is game-related and i'm wondering if it has something to do with corrupt windows files.</p>

    <title>Windows Update will not update other MS programs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bruinwar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update will not update other MS programs</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a brand new reinstall of Windows 7 Pro. &nbsp;I deleted all partitions &amp; did a fresh install. &nbsp;Windows Update worked (it took a while to work) &amp; updated Windows completely. &nbsp;I've been fixing a lot of computers lately &amp; I've had some struggles with Windows
 Update however, this time I am totally stuck. &nbsp; None of the fixes seem to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update will not update Office. &nbsp;The link "<em>Get updates for other Microsoft products. Find out more</em>" links directly to a simple page with the instructions on how to find &amp; start Windows Update.</p>
<p><strong>I can't find a way to install Microsoft Update.</strong> &nbsp; This is a valid copy of Windows &amp; Office 2010. &nbsp;I've ran the Mr.Fix It &amp; some other MS fixes. &nbsp;I've scanned with System File Checker:
<em>"Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations."</em> &nbsp;I've rebooted dozens of times. &nbsp; Why is MS Update not available?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Screenshots:</p>

</p><p>Good morning Bear,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Exact date &amp; time: Nov 19 at 8:33PM I deleted the former partitions.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The machine was full of malware, worms, or whatever.&nbsp; The owner reported a large amount of symptoms &amp; that it also had been running slow.&nbsp; His AV reported many infections &amp; was unable to remove them.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My policy is to get the data off the machine, wipe, &amp; re-install.&nbsp; I don't remove viruses, it's too time consuming.&nbsp; Not that I do this for a living, I do it for close friends, family, &amp; co-workers.&nbsp; I am just a long time computer enthusiast.&nbsp;&nbsp; This machine
 was built by the owner &amp; myself about 4 years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The owner provided me with&nbsp;his Win7&nbsp;&amp; his Office 10 disks &amp; keys.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both activated&nbsp;normally, as expected.&nbsp; After installing Win7 I&nbsp;flashed&nbsp;the BIOS, installed all drivers, then connected to the internet &amp; immediately began the Windows Update process (which
 took many hours to get the first set of downloads). </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me add that if I go to Excel or Word (or any other Office program) &amp; click File&gt; Help&gt;check for updates&gt; it directs me to that same simple page with instructions on how to find Windows Update on my computer as shown in the screenshot in my first post.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there another way to install Microsoft Update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply,</p>
<p>Joe S.</p>

<p>This is a Consumer-specific forum. I may end up asking you to seek further assistance in the more appropriate
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/windows/en-US/home?category=w7itpro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Win7 IT Pro-specific forums</a>. That being said and <em>assuming Win7 64-bit...</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer <em>each of the following </em>[admittedly tedious] <em>diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply, preferably
<em>without</em> quoting my post:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1a. How long has the computer been connected to the internet since you did the clean install of Win7 on 19 November 2015?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1b. Have you restored any of the owner's data backups to the HDD since the 19th?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. What is the <em>full name</em> of&nbsp;the currently&nbsp;installed anti-virus application or security suite and
<em>when (approx. date) does&nbsp;the current subscription (if any)&nbsp;expire?</em> What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender) are installed? What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Has a Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed on the computer since the 19th?</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Have you tried Repairing Office 2010?</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>If all were well with the computer, installing Office 2010 should have 'automagically' enabled the "Get updates for other Microsoft applications" option. Ditto if you installed Silverlight or any Windows (Live) Essentials applications.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>5a. Is&nbsp;KB3100773, KB3100213, KB3097877, KB3101722, KB3097989, KB3092601, KB3101246, KB3101746 and/or KB3081320 listed in
<strong>Installed Updates </strong>(<em>not </em><strong><em>Update History</em></strong>)? [1]</p>
<p>
</p><p>5b. How about KB310<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">2810</span>, KB3035583, KB2952664 and/or&nbsp;KB2990214?</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. <em>Assuming Java is installed =&gt;&nbsp;</em>Is <strong>Java Version 8 Update&nbsp;66</strong> (or higher) installed? TEST HERE USING INTERNET EXPLORER&nbsp;<em>ONLY!</em> =&gt;
<a href="http://java.com/en/download/uninstallapplet.jsp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>7. Is Adobe Flash Player <strong>v19.0.0.245</strong> (or higher) installed? TEST HERE USING INTERNET EXPLORER
<em>ONLY!</em> =&gt; <a href="http://www.adobe.com/software/flash/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>8a. Is Internet Explorer 8 (IE8), IE9, IE10 or IE11 installed? </p>
<p>
</p><p>8b. <em>Assuming IE9 or higher =&gt; </em>What Update Version &amp; KB number are displayed in the
<em>second line of text</em> in IE's Help | About [<strong>Alt+H+A</strong>] tab; e.g.,
<strong>Update Version: 10.0.99 (KB1231231)</strong> ?<br />
<br />
8c. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>9. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic; System Mechanic; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; Registry Booster; McAfee QuickClean; Glary Utilities; AVG PC TuneUp; Norton Registry Cleaner; PCTools Optimiser; SpeedUpMyPC;

            <p>Bear!</p>
<p>
</p><p>And anyone else that finds this thread, I found the problem &amp; it was quite simple.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Internet Explorer has to be set as the default browser to be directed to install Microsoft Update.&nbsp;</strong> The Office 2010 updates are downloading &amp; installing on that machine as I type this.&nbsp; Chrome was set as the default.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is still attempting to install itself.&nbsp; Not that I am against it, I've updated four machines to it so far.&nbsp;I am using it right now on my Surface.&nbsp; But they are sure pushing it hard.&nbsp; I had to check optional updates, scroll down &amp; uncheck the Win10
 update before proceeding to install the Office updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every build I do includes Chrome &amp; Firefox. At one point&nbsp;I accepted Chrome as the default.&nbsp;&nbsp; I discovered that when I&nbsp;sat down to compose&nbsp;the post that would answer all the questions above.&nbsp;&nbsp;I planned to use IE as the browser to post it &amp; when I opened it,
 I&nbsp;it asked if I wanted IE as the default browser.&nbsp; Hmmmmm.....&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;so I tried &amp; viola!&nbsp; Or is it&nbsp;shazaam!&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for all your assistance,</p>

<p>That may have been the fix for you but it's not necessarily the fix for others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If all is well with the computer-in-question, installing MS Office (and/or Microsoft Security Essentials and/or&nbsp;one or more Windows [Live] Essentials applications) should enable the "Get updates for other Microsoft applications" option automatically - even
 with an alternate browser configured as the system default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The behavior &amp; resolution you described may have occurred if you installed Chrome - and allowed it to became the default browser - before you installed MS Office &amp; clicked on the "Check for updates" link (which would have invoked Chrome, not Internet Explorer).</p>

<h3> sqrly  say:</h3>
<h2>            What are the MSN Weather App Live Tile &#34;Requirements&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    <p>What are the actual requirements for the "Live tile" for the built in MSN weather app to function?</p>
<p>
</p><p>#1 Will it work if I'm only signed in locally and have never signed into any of the windows apps?</p>
<p>
</p><p>#2 How, "specifically" does it connect to the internet? (what needs to be allowed in the firewall)</p>
<p>
</p><p>#3 Are there any privacy settings that could effect it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>#4 Are there any group policies that could effect it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>#5 Are there any known conflicts with 3rd party security programs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running win10x64 Pro and the weather app works fine but the live tile does not, actually none of my live tiles do. I don't have any "apps" that didn't come with windows. I'm on a PC, I prefer "Programs". (LOL)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have&nbsp; the "Configure Automatic Updates" Policy enabled and set to "Notify for download and Notify for installation".</p>
<p>PS: You can disable automatic updating in the same place people, if you have a version that includes the group policy editor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Windows Firewall Control 4 to&nbsp;give "ME" control of my Windows firewall instead of Microsoft. So I have a few of the things that try to sneak out through svchost&nbsp;blocked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also use Webroot SecureAnywhere Antivirus and Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit (free).</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of these security programs is probably blocking something it needs so I'd like to know exactly, what it needs.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 4 switches off when unplugged from power - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 switches off when unplugged from power</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just recently, my Surface Pro 4 turns off when unplugged from power. The Surface then can't be turned on again until it is plugged back into power and hard reset (hold down power button for 30 seconds, hold power and down volume button for 15 seconds, turn
 on). It is unable to run on battery power alone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The power charger appears to be working normally as the LED is lit when plugged in. Also the battery says it's 100% charged and the settings in the Device Manager indicate that it is working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried updating software, updating battery drivers and a full factory reset. Nothing helps. Also, unfortunately, my device is out of warranty now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else experienced this problem? How does one fix it, short of sending the whole unit back to Microsoft for a pricey service/replacement?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Sinead</p>

<h2>            Failure to unlock BitLocker encrypted HD after new windows 10 installation</h2>
                    I have exact same problem, but the problem remains after full win update to Windows 10 Pro, version 1511, 10586
Failure to unlock BitLocker encrypted HD after new windows 10 installation

</div>
<div>
<p>I have 2 HD on my desktop. The first (SSD) with windows installation (C:), and the second is a large HDD where I keep my data (D:).</p>
<p>In the second HDD I have a partition (E:) which is Bitlocker encrypted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When my SSD died, I replaced it and had a fresh windows 10 installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, I tried to access my encrypted partition on the other drive, but my password is not working (The password is correct).</p>
<p>I also tried the recovery key, stored in my microsoft account. It's not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How could I unlock it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notes:</p>
<p>1) After the fresh windows 10 installation, my second HDD was unassigned. I assigned it as D: again, so now it is Local Disk (D:). I don't remember if the name was different before.</p>
<p>2) The encrypted partition was Encrypted (E:). When I browse it, I see it as Encrypted.vhdx. But in devices and drives, I see it as Local Disk (E:)</p>
</div>
<p>In my case, I have a partition of a fixed data drive which is encrypted with bitlocker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem happened&nbsp;<strong>after I replaced my damaged operating system drive</strong>&nbsp;(which is not encrypted) and installed windows again at a new operating system drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that, when I try to unlock the encrypted drive, is says that&nbsp;<strong>"The password entered is incorrect",&nbsp;</strong>but I am absolutely sure that the password is correct.</p>
<p>Then I try to enter the recovery key, which I found in my microsoft account and it says that&nbsp;<strong>"The key doesn't match this drive"</strong>. Again, I am sure I used the correct 48 digit recovery key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this describes better my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>

            <p>Sigh,&nbsp; This is the 10th time today I have had to give the bad news.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bitlocker is tied to the OS, when you replaced the drive and re-installed windows you broke that tie.&nbsp; If the password and recovery key do not work the data is for all intents &amp; purposes, gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never use bitlocker.</p>

            <p>The one reply you have received before mine is not quite correct, and indeed, alarmist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That aside, I strongly suspect that your issue is that you have the Recovery Key for your system drive and not for the e: partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you established BitLocker, you should have performed an audit of the Protectors and Recovery Keys applicable to each drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to say, but if you don't have the correct Recovery Key, then your data is lost. I hope that you can recover from a backup.</p>

<h2>            Cannot play Tomb Raider&#58; Definitive Edition</h2>
                    
<p>After a lot of thinking I decided to buy Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition this morning. After purchasing the game, I went to sleep to let the game download and install. I woke up and tried playing it (as it finished installing), but everytime I try to start
 it, the game goes to a black screen and does not continue any further.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I deleted the game and tried to re-install the game, hoping it would fix my problem, but it installed again, and yet I am still getting stuck at a black screen. I have tried power cycling my Xbox One, but nothing is working. All of my other digital work
 perfectly fine, except this one and now I'm not sure I even want the game anymore. Can anyone help me with this?</p>

<p>I would try deleting the game, do a hard reset, and then re-download.</p>
<p>To delete the game hit the menu button on the right of the xbox button. This will bring up the options to stop installation, uninstall, and manage game.</p>
<p>To do a hard reset hold the power button down on the front of the console for 8-10 sec until it shuts off then unplug it from the outlet for 30 sec. then plug it back in and power back on and try re-installing the game again.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will fix the problem for you. Good luck!</p>

    <title>Xbox One fan running while turned off in &#38;quot&#59;instant - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sigmathedj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One fan running while turned off in &#38;quot&#59;instant on&#38;quot&#59; mode &#40;it&#38;&#35;39&#59;s not the PSU fan&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>This started happening just recently. I have an Xbox One in my bedroom. The other night while I was in bed reading a book, every so often I could hear a whirring sound, like the sound of a laptop fan kicking in. It would go on for a few minutes then stop,
 but then a while later it would come back.</p>
<p>It happened a couple of days in a row, so on the second night when the noise started I went over and checked my Xbox One. The fan in the console was spinning and the air coming out of the top was hot, like I'd been playing it for hours or something.</p>
<p>A friend of mine bought an Xbox One recently and when we were playing Titanfall last night, I asked if he used the "instant on" mode on his console and he said to me that he disabled it because the fan in the console kept coming on and the console was getting
 hot.</p>
<p>I can't speak for my friend, but in my case, it is definitely not the PSU fan. I can clearly hear that the noise is coming from the Xbox One and the air coming out of it shouldn't be that hot when it's in standby mode. I know the console may make some noises
 if it's downloading updates, but that's not the cause here as hot air was constantly coming out of the console while it was in standby mode and the fan would kick in periodically every 45 minutes or so for a period of about 3-4 minutes.</p>
<p>Do you think this is likely to be a software issue? I really don't want to do another console replacement as I've had all kinds of hassle with that already, including MS trying to charge ¬£600 to my credit card because I hadn't returned a console when I had
 actually returned it.</p>

<p>I havent had an issue with the fan randomly starting up. Since you said it happens while in stand by when you have it in Instant On mode, what happens when you use the other setting? If it happens then too, you should set up a repair.</p>

<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>If I use the power saving mode, it turns completely off and stays off - it never makes any noises and is completely cool.</p>
<p>I don't know for sure, but I suspect that it's a software issue, a bit like when you have something in Windows that prevents your PC from going into sleep mode properly. It used to work just fine and the console is in otherwise full working order, so I don't
 think it's a hardware issue, but that's just an educated guess.</p>

<p>Hi SigmaTheDj.</p>
<p>Interesting and annoying at the same time. Interesting because I may have a perspective for you. But first a story about a *** (me) who took his XBOX One apart, voiding the warranty, to fix a noisy fan, ending up buying an aftermarket PWM fan (4pin), finding
 out it didnt provide sufficient wind to cool the heat sink, and then applying another fan, which was not a PWM (3pin) finding out that the fan doesn't stop spinning when the console is in instant on mode. The 4th pin is the switch, telling the fan to stop
 spinning. I'ld suggest that there's a loose connection in the plug, on either the fan or the mainboard end.
</p>
<p>I might go ahead and try throwing myself over the cliff and install a water cooling system in it.</p>

<p>I always had the ticking sound from PSU. Now its the XB1 fan itself.</p>
<p>I'm guessing my room is too hot in summer time.</p>

            There's no UI to adjust it. &nbsp;You can adjust it directly in the registry, but it will only apply for any programs that still actually query and use those settings (which isn't many). &nbsp;So you won't see it apply unless you run some old Windows 95-2000 program,
 or a program built for XP-7 that didn't support the DWM aero themes.

SUMMARYThis article describes how to recover a Windows XP system that does not start be...This article describes how to recover a windows XP system that does not start because of corruption in the registry. This procedure does not guarantee full recovery of
 the system to a previous state; however, you should be able to recover data when you use this procedure.
</em></p>
<p><em>Warning Do not use the procedure that is described in this article if your computer has an OEM-installed operating system. The system hive on OEM installations creates passwords and user accounts that did not exist previously. If you use the procedure
 that is described in this article, you may not be able to log back into the recovery console to restore the original registry hives.
</em></p>
<p><em>You can repair a corrupted registry in Windows XP. Corrupted registry files can cause a variety of different error messages. See the Microsoft Knowledge Base for articles about error messages that are related to registry issues.
</em></p>
<p><em>This article assumes that typical recovery methods have failed and access to the system is not available except by using Recovery Console. If an Automatic System Recovery (ASR) backup exists, it is the preferred method for recovery. Microsoft recommends
 that you use the ASR backup before you try the procedure described in this article.
</em></p>
<p><em>Note Make sure to replace all five of the registry hives. If you only replace a single hive or two, this can cause potential issues because software and hardware may have settings in multiple locations in the registry.

<p><em>Manual steps to recover a corrupted registry that prevents Windows XP from starting<br />
The procedure that this article describes uses Recovery Console and System Restore. This article also lists all the required steps in specific order to make sure that the process is fully completed. When you finish this procedure, the system returns to a state
 very close to the state before <br />
the problem occurred. If you have ever run NTBackup and completed a system state backup, you do not have to follow the procedures in parts two and three. You can go to part four.<br />
Part one<br />
In part one, you start the Recovery Console, create a temporary folder, back up the existing registry files to a new location, delete the registryfiles at their existing location, and then copy the registry files from the repair folder to the System32\Config
 folder. When you have finished <br />
this procedure, a registry is created that you can use to start Windows XP. This registry was created and saved during the initial setup of Windows XP. Therefore any changes and settings that occurred after the Setup program was finished are lost.
</em></p>
<p><br />
<em>To complete part one, follow these steps: <br />
Insert the Windows XP startup disk into the floppy disk drive, or insert the Windows XP CD-ROM into the CD-ROM drive, and then restart the computer.
<br />
<br />
Click to select any options that are required to start the computer from the CD-ROM drive if you are prompted to do so.
<br />
When the "Welcome to Setup" screen appears, press R to start the Recovery Console.
<br />
<br />
If you have a dual-boot or multiple-boot computer, select the installation that you want to access from the Recovery Console.
<br />
When you are prompted to do so, type the Administrator password. If the administrator password is blank, just press ENTER.<br />
<br />
At the Recovery Console command prompt, type the following lines, pressing ENTER after you type each line:
</em></p>
<p><em>md tmp<br />
copy c:\windows\system32\config\system c:\windows\tmp\system.bak<br />
copy c:\windows\system32\config\software c:\windows\tmp\software.bak<br />
copy c:\windows\system32\config\sam c:\windows\tmp\sam.bak<br />
copy c:\windows\system32\config\security c:\windows\tmp\security.bak<br />
copy c:\windows\system32\config\default c:\windows\tmp\default.bak </em></p>
<p><em>delete c:\windows\system32\config\system<br />
delete c:\windows\system32\config\software<br />
delete c:\windows\system32\config\sam<br />
delete c:\windows\system32\config\security<br />
delete c:\windows\system32\config\default </em></p>
<p><em>copy c:\windows\repair\system c:\windows\system32\config\system<br />
copy c:\windows\repair\software c:\windows\system32\config\software<br />
copy c:\windows\repair\sam c:\windows\system32\config\sam<br />
copy c:\windows\repair\security c:\windows\system32\config\security<br />
copy c:\windows\repair\default c:\windows\system32\config\default </em></p>
<p><br />
<em>Type exit to quit Recovery Console. Your computer will restart.<br />
Note This procedure assumes that Windows XP is installed to the C:\Windows folder. Make sure to change C:\Windows to the appropriate windows_folder if it is a different location.</em></p>
<p><strong>So this I do copiously...However on restart, the computer goes to black screen. System restore then asks for an unknown password:</strong></p>
<p>When I boot with the XP disk and click "R" to access the recovery console, it prompts me for the Administrator Password. But there really IS no administrator password on that machine! And when I try to hit ENTER to move on, it prompts me again for the password
 (which doesn't exist). 3 tries and it restarts the machine, and then back to black.</p>
<p>Attempting to start in Safe Mode from F8 yields an unsuccessful attempt as it provides a partial list of files and then stops doing anything. The last line scrolled ends "TDI.sys"</p>
<p>Is help available?</p>
<p>How can I access the recovery console?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hey Girl,<br />
<br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers.<br />
<br />
You can very much enable microphone from Control Panel. Here‚Äôs the step by step instruction:<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on the Start orb.<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on Control Panel.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Search for Sound and click on it. A new window titled ‚ÄúSound‚Äù should open up.<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to recording tab.<br />
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click on an empty area of the window and click on Show Disabled devices to show the other devices on the computer.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your disabled microphone should show up. <br />
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-Click on the microphone and select ‚ÄúEnable‚Äù.<br />
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-Click again on the microphone and click Properties.<br />
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Levels tab and make sure that the Microphone is not mute. Drag the slider left or right to decrease or increase the volume as per your choice.<br />
9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, go to playback tab, right-click on the blank area and select ‚ÄúShow Disabled Devices‚Äù to check the microphone configuration.<br />
10.&nbsp; Close the window.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
That should do the trick.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate for choosing windows 10.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am happy to inform you that DirectX 12 will work on&nbsp;Intel(R) HD Graphics 3000 Windows 10. So I suggest you to upgrade and you will get best experience on windows 10.<br />

            <p>Thanks for the reply but I'm just getting confused on your answer from Intel's. I asked the same question on their forum but they say that DX12 and Intel(R) HD Graphics 3000 are not compatible.</p>

            &nbsp;Hi,
<div>
<p>
</p><p>This is to inform you that &nbsp;drivers for any hardware device are provided by their respective manufacture. If drivers are not available then DirectX 12 may or may not work with Windows 10, in that case you to need to contact the manufacturer since they are
 responsible for drivers. However you can try installing windows 8.1 drivers in compatibility mode and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer the below link,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, identify the Skype name by follow this link: <a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Continue.</strong>&nbsp;From there, you'll be able to see the Skype accounts related to the email address. Identify the Skype account you wish to gain access with and proceed with password reset on the same page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if during password reset you no longer have access to the <strong>security information</strong><em> (masked alternate email address or phone number that you add to your account used to verify account ownership)
</em>then proceed to answer this <a href="http://account.live.com/ACSR" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>About using Skype, please be informed that Skype-to-Skype calls are free all over the world. However, if you're calling to a landline or mobile number using Skype, you will be asked for a little

                    <p>On&nbsp;October 25th, my account AnakinSpartan was permanently suspended. Minutes later, I&nbsp;&nbsp;jumped to the enforcement page, where I submitted an inquiry explaining that my account was compromised.

The support agent told me that he would escalate my case to be investigated&nbsp;but it turns out&nbsp;he did not. After waiting this long without any messages from either&nbsp;the enforcement team or&nbsp;support&nbsp;I decided to contact support again today.&nbsp;The agent I spoke to today&nbsp;informed me that the previous agent in fact&nbsp;did not escalate my case.

<p>Now I want to know, what I should do because i bought the controller in a bundle. I was told I'd had 2 years guarantee when I bought it last September in my GameStop shop.</p>

<p>If you do as The Little Moa said, you should be fine.</p>
<p>I'm curious, though. Did you have to pay for the 2 year warranty on your controller, or was it included in your purchase? When I accessories from GameStop I have never even been informed of any warranty on the items.</p>

            <p><strong>Doing a Custom Install</strong></p>
<p>Using the custom install option allows you to reinstall your original copy of Windows while preserving your personal data by moving it to the Windows.old folder. Of course, you will need to reinstall your applications and hardware drivers. To begin, retrieve
 your installation disc for your copy of Windows and make sure you have the product key.</p>
<ul>
<li>Boot to the Windows 8 desktop.</li><li>Insert your Windows 7, Vista or XP disc</li><li>Click Install Now (Windows XP users, please restart from the installation or recovery disc).</li></ul>
<p>To learn how to change your BIOS options to boot from the DVD drive, see the following tutorial:<br />
<a href="http://notebooks.com/2011/05/05/how-to-load-bios-and-change-boot-configuration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://notebooks.com/2011/05/05/how-to-load-bios-and-change-boot-configuration/</a></p>
<p><strong>If you have an RTM disc</strong></p>
<p>If you have the original RTM disc for Windows 7 or Vista, you can download an updated disc with Windows 7 SP1 or Vista SP1 integrated. This should at least take some of the load off when it comes installing post SP1 updates or Service Pack 2 for Vista.</p>
<p><strong>Download the corresponding edition of Windows 7 you have a license for from the following link. You can identify the edition on the COA sticker attached to your machine, at the bottom or within the battery compartment (laptop) or top/side if its
 a desktop computer.</strong><br />

<p>Unfortunately, Windows XP users will need to get a hold of a genuine copy of Windows XP with SP3 disc. It should not be hard to get one, but will require that you look for one if you can‚Äôt find yours.</p>
<p><strong>If Windows came preinstalled on your computer.</strong></p>
<p>If Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7 came with your computer, this might be a bit tricky depending on the version of Windows you are running and the options you selected during the installation of the Windows 8 preview. I have noticed that installing later
 versions of Windows can sometimes render a recovery partition inoperable.</p>
<p>Some computers that come preinstalled with Windows often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into it when you start your computer by
 pressing a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p><strong>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular computer brands:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For Dell, press CTRL + F11 directly after powering up the unit.</li><li>For HP, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</li><li>For Toshiba, press and hold ‚Äô0‚Ä≤ BEFORE and during the power up</li><li>For Acer, press and hold ALT + F10 as soon as you see the logo.</li><li>For Samsung: Tap the F4 Key at the Samsung logo when you first power on.</li><li>For Asus, press F9 as soon as you see the Asus logo.</li><li>For Advent, restart your computer. Then Press F10 repeatedly until the message ‚ÄúStarting System Recovery‚Äù is displayed</li><li>Lenovo <a href="http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/document.do?lndocid=MIGR-4HWSE3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/document.do?lndocid=MIGR-4HWSE3</a><br />
Lenovo notebooks include a feature called the Lenovo OneKey Recovery button, which is used to boot into the Recovery Environment and reinstall Windows.</li></ul>
<p>If your recovery partition happens to be damaged, then you will need to use the link to download the corresponding edition of Windows you have a license for and use the product on you COA sticker. Again, Windows XP users will need to borrow a disc or likely
 use the recovery discs that came with your system.</p>
<p><strong>Doing the Custom Install</strong></p>
<p>A custom install allows you to reinstall Windows without actually formatting the hard disk.</p>

<p>When installation is complete, setup your user account and password.</p>
<p><strong>Recovering your personal files</strong></p>
<p>Now the important part of doing this will be recovering your personal files. To do that, browse to the root of the drive where Windows is installed, normally C:\. There you will see a folder called Windows.old</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/image10.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f12%2fimage_thumb10.png%3fw%3d436%26amp%3bh%3d280" /></a></p>
<p>In this folder you will find your old User folder with all your personal folders for Documents, Pictures, Music, Videos etc. You can copy the contents from within each folder and paste them into your respective personal folders in Windows 7.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/image11.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f12%2fimage_thumb11.png%3fw%3d463%26amp%3bh%3d359" /></a></p>
<p>After you have copied over your data, you can delete the folder if you wish. This is just the basics though and you might have other data stored elsewhere that you need to recover from the Windows.old folder such as email or even your iTunes
 Library. See the following article for instructions about recovering email and other data files.</p>

            Hi CristianBS 
<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Spell checks are not application specific. This will be at the Windows level. Hence, if you disable spell check at Windows level, it will be disabled for entire Windows.
<br />
<br />Windows Key+i &gt; Devices &gt; Typing &gt; Here, you can switch off both options under Spelling
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

            Unfortunately this does NOT resolve the problem. I have disabled spell checking and auto correction in Windows 10 but it does not affect Windows Mail. There are hundreds of posts about this problem on forums and windows support messages. It is as if they
 are independent of one another. The only way to solve it is to add languages and change those everytime in windows but it still does not solve the problem if you want to write in a mix of languages. The user should decide if you want or not spell correction
 and NOT windows. Until the n I just installed a new mail program eM client and the problem is solved. No more Windows mail fo me.&nbsp;

            <p>Hi Joni,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue. However, I would appreciate if you could answer a few questions to narrow down the issue in order to provide you with better assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Do you also get any error CODE along with the message?</p>
<p>b) What is the make and model no. of your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem may occur if Windows optional update is not detecting latest drivers installed or if Windows Update service is corrupted. Follow these methods and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong>: I would suggest you to Rollback the drivers and then try installing the update and check. Windows allows you to rollback to previous Driver versions. Here‚Äôs what you need to do to complete the task.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key + X</strong>, Click <strong>Device Manager</strong></li><li>Locate and double-click the hardware device whose driver you need to rollback</li><li>In the <strong>properties dialog box</strong>, click the <strong>Roll Back Driver button</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Yes </strong>when you are asked, ‚Äú<strong>Are you sure you would like to roll back to the previously installed driver software?‚Äù</strong></li><li>Restart Windows after the previously installed driver is reinstalled</li></ol>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> You can roll back only to the previously installed driver and not to the drivers installed before it.
</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> If you are able to manually install the latest graphic drivers. You can hide the update, and then Windows Update won't offer it to you again unless you choose to restore it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To hide an update</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap <strong>Search.</strong><br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click Search.)
</li><li>Enter <strong>Hide or unhide updates</strong> in the search box, and then tap or click
<strong>Hide or unhide updates.</strong></li><li>Do one of the following:<br />
&nbsp;<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>If you have any important updates, click the link that tells you important updates are available.<br />
&nbsp;<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>If you have any optional updates, click the link that tells you optional updates are available.</li><li>Select any update that you want to hide, press and hold or <strong>right-clic</strong>k it, and then tap or click
<strong>Hide update</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3: </strong>If issue still persists, follow the troubleshooting steps from this article and check if it helps:</p>
