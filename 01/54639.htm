    <title>Why does Windows 7 Photo Viewer not allow me to view pictures&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why does Windows 7 Photo Viewer not allow me to view pictures&#63;</h2>
                    The error message states,<strong> "Windows cannot access the specified device, path, or file. You may not have the appropriate permissions to access the item."<br />
</strong><br />
NOTES: I have no problems with the Photo Viewer in my original, administrator account. This problem occurs with the second account I created (standard user).&nbsp; What's interesting is I created 2 other test accounts, one as standard and another as administrator...neither
 of those worked as well!<br />
I can open pictures using other programs (e.g., Photoshop Elements and Media Center).

<h2>            Surface Pro 2 Disk Clean Up problem</h2>
                    <p>I Have a Surface Pro 2.&nbsp; When I run Disk Cleanup and check "Windows Update Cleanup" among others, it shows that it is cleaning the various categories I check marked, but as soon as I run it again, the "Windows Update Cleanup" files are still there (in this
 particular case, 198 MB).&nbsp; Usually, when Windows has cleaned up these files, subsequent runs of Disk Cleanup will not include the update files as available to clean up until you have received more updates at a later date.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to get rid of these files numerous times and they will not go away.&nbsp; I have had to uncheck the update files to avoid the extra time Disk Cleanup takes to clean the update files.&nbsp; What gives?&nbsp; I don't have this problem on any of the other 3 Win8
 PCs that I have.</p>

It is merely a repair install nothing special.&nbsp; If you Google the terms "repair install in win 8" you get more than 180,000 hits.<br />
<br />
I am not fond of one size fits all solutions and am wary.<br />
<br />
If you are having an issue with the current OS you are using you probably are better off starting a thread and having someone walk you through the steps while explaining the pitfalls.<br />

            <p>The built-in Windows Help and Support&nbsp;explains refresh/repair&nbsp;accurately and completely. Also Microsoft Windows online offers everything you need to know about these two procedures. MSDN and TechNet get as deep in the technical weeds you could ever want
 to go. However,....</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Try Supersite for Windows (<a href="http://winsupersite.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winsupersite.com/</a>). Paul Thurrott has many great articles re: Windows 8 and 8.1 and walks you through step-by-step and explains exactly what the differences are. Paul has written extensively
 on Windows 8 &amp; 8.1 and gives a fairly reasonable review of the good and not so good.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I recommend always being conservative about which sites to follow regarding the advice they provide. Often they tell you how to do a procedure and it may seem 'cool' on the face of it but it may be something you really shouldn't be doing: i.e., registry
 cleaners without knowing what NOT to use, etc. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I am not familiar with 'eightforums' which is meant as no negative about the information they share. But it is a
<em>forum</em>...and ALL forums are subject to bad information and misinformation as well as good information.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I also find the information at '7 Tutorials' (yes they cover 8 &amp; 8.1) to be outstanding...but again with the caveat not everything possible should be done if you are not technically inclined.</p>

            Thanks but nobody is answering my question . A "Refresh" wipes out all desktop applications and all games on that drive but a "repair" install does not. It saves all your desktop applications and all your games. But this is the only site anywhere on the
 web that says you can do a "repair" install on Windows 8 and 8.1 like you used to be able to on Windows 7.No I have no problem-I made a system image to restore windows. The question is, is a "repair" install for real as described in my original link as this
 is the only reference to a "repair" install on Windows 8 , I can find anywhere on the internet??

            <p>You will find that <strong>Brink</strong> who wrote that tutorial is extremely knowledgeable and I have never found any issues with his tutorials.&nbsp; The repair install, I have found, works as he has described.</p>
<p>Since you have a system image, you should try the repair, as you can always go to the image.</p>
<p><br />

<p>I always recommend creating a system image periodically for backup.</p>

            But I bet they all&nbsp;actually lead&nbsp;you to the Refresh feature which some may call a repair .I mean a repair install as in Windows 7 which allows you to keep your programs and applications, and most drivers which the Refresh feature does not. You know I am
 talking about Windows 8.&nbsp; Microsoft doesn't mention it anywhere. The link I posted is the only mention of it for Windows 8 I have seen.

<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>"Apps you installed from websites and DVDs will be removed. Apps that came with your PC and apps you installed from the Windows Store will be reinstalled. Windows puts a list of removed apps on your desktop after refreshing your PC. "</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm talking about a repair install that leaves all your programs you downloaded from websites and DVD's intact- not a REFRESH. See my original link. In Windows 7 you were able to do that but not apparently in Windows 8 except for the Windows 8 Forum where
 I got the link. I'm not talking about a refresh,reset,restore,custom refresh, or restoring from a system image.</p>

<h2>            My C drive is almost full, while my D drive is empty</h2>
                    <p>First of all, I transitioned from Mac to Windows two weeks ago, so I am new to all of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased a Laptop for school next year two weeks ago. The computer has a 1tb HDD and 128gb SSD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I was browsing my files when I realised that there are two disk drives, a C: Drive and D: Drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The C drive is 230gb while, the D Drive is 930gb. The C Drive is almost full, while the D Drive is basically empty (only used about 200 mb).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I’ve only installed Google Chrome and Steam and three games. This is taking up all of the C Drive.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions are: </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Is there a way to start using the D Drive, because that has virtually been untouched, while all my files are on the other drive. Ive read that when you download something off the internet, you are prompted with the option to select where to download that
 file (C Drive or D Drive) however I can’t find that option. Ive attempted to do this through Storage settings however I have found out this only applies to apps downloaded off the Microsoft store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Should I download files into the D Drive from now on? Or should I only use the C Drive? What type of files go into each Drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. How can I increase C Drive space? Or how can I transfer files and apps into the D Drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im very confused, all help received would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

<p>It seems strange you say the PC has a 128GB SSD and a 1TB HDD and then you say C drive is 230GB and D drive is 930GB. I would have thought the C drive would be using the SSD.</p>

</p><p>You can change the location of your personal files to the D drive by opening File Explorer. Either use shortcut keys winkey+E or click the File Explorer icon on the Taskbar. Once File Explorer is open you should see the Documents, Pictures etc. folders.
 If you right click the Documents folder, for example and select Properties you can select the Location tab and then Move. In the windows that opens locate the D: drive and (I would) create a new folder with your name, then open that folder and select OK. You
 can do this for each of your personal folders.</p>
<p>With regard to saving downloads it depends on the browser you use. If it is Edge (the default) then when you select an item to download you can select the choice selector and then Save as. Then locate where you want to save. However if you change the location
 of the Download folder using the method above then you should be saving to the D: drive in the location you Moved to.</p>
<p>Where Steam is concerned you may have to install your games again and locate the D: drive during the install. Games tend to be large so I can understand them taking up space.</p>

<p>Thank you for your quick reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I this is my first Windows computer, so all of this is still a learning curve.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ive conducted some more research and apparently its possible to allocate space from the D Drive to the C Drive. Is this safe? I have no personal files on the D Drive except for the default files. If I proceed with this, will my computer be corrupted?</p>
<p>

<p>If you have two physical drives you cannot allocate space from one to another.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you right click Start and select Disk Management you can see the setup of your drives. Again you said initially you had an SSD and HDD so you cannot move space between these two.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really need to see the drive setup. So you can use an app called Snipping Tool to create a screenshot. type snip into Search and select the top result.</p>
<p>Select New in the tool and draw around the Disk Management window. Select save and a location (files are normally called Capture by default) then close the snipping tool. You can post the image here using the icon on the reply toolbar.</p>

<p>I can't tell from the Disk Management screen if they are SSD or HDD but it definitely shows they are different drives so you can't move space between them.</p>
<p>If the make/model spec shows SSD and HDD then Disk 0 is the SSD and Disk 1 is the HDD.</p>
<p>I can see you still have quite a lot of space left 147.78GB, which is a significant amount of space.</p>
<p>If you start to use the D: drive moving forward then you will keep most of your free space on C:. Look at moving your personal files using the method I mentioned earlier and if you can set Steam to install to the D: drive and/or move your current Steam files
 to D:. But you need to move the files using the Steam install process don't just move them in File Explorer or the games may not load.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the inconvenience you're going through. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you tried restarting your PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you already installed the application, then most probably this won't appear under Programs and Features in Control Panel. Sometimes exiting temp files that are related that particular application will still cause some issues.&nbsp;Suggest you to try with the
 below mentioned steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open run command by pressing <strong>Windows Logo key&nbsp;+ R</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>%temp%</strong> into the run command and Hit Enter key</li><li>Delete all files and folders from the temp folder. Choose skip if any pop ups appear saying any of the files could not be deleted.</li><li>Reboot your PC now. If require, try to fresh install the desired software again to see if it works fine.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted if you require further assistance.</p>

            <p>Yashwanth,</p>
<p>Yes, I did restart my computer but&nbsp; the same error message came up after I rebooted&nbsp;This is the exact info that comes up. "The installer has encountered an unexpected error installing this package. This may indicate a problem with the package. The error
 code is&nbsp;2718."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed you instructions that you provided above and then I did a shut down and rebooted and&nbsp; the same error&nbsp;comes up. HP PhotoSmart Essentials is the application that is trying to load via Windows installer as I sign on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also believe that I also followed the instructions that you provided when I first was having issues with this. I also tried installing new software after and it would not let me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did find out exactly where this file is located and was wondering if it would be possible to just delete the exe file from the&nbsp;and then try reinstalling. I noticed that it is in Program files(x86) &gt;digital imaging&gt;bin but this also has so many other files
 and extensions, I'm not sure what or how to do this, or if I should do anything with these?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know that this is more simple than this seems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any information or steps to do this would be most appreciated.</p>

</p><p>This may happen due to software conflicts.</p>

</p><p>Clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” to reset the computer to start as usual.</p>

<h2>            Disconnected When GTA V is launched</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I have had GTA V for a few weeks now and it has worked perfectly fine until the last week. When I turn on my Xbox and sign in, My Xbox Live works perfectly fine until I launch GTA V. I rang up Rockstar a couple of times and They told Me to ask over
 here.</p>
<p>I have fast broadband (at the moment www.speedtest.net says 34mb/s download speed and 10mb/s upload.) I can play online on any other game. If you could help it would be much obliged.</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi there Dubbya,<br />
<br />
Are you just having this disconnect issue when playing GTA V?<br />
<br />
<br />
If so, I would definitely recommend trying the steps outlined in the the Rockstar Support article on
<a href="http://support.rockstargames.com/hc/en-us/articles/200525767-GTA-Online-Connection-Sync-Problems-Losing-connection-to-online-games-empty-lobbies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
GTA Online Connection &amp; Sync Problems</a>. There are some specific steps for the Xbox 360 console and some other general troubleshooting at the bottom of the article.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>So that we don't commandeer this thread</strong>, if you've tried all those steps and are still having issues,<strong> please go ahead and create a new thread</strong> detailing your situation along with any error code/message you may see and the troubleshooting
 steps that you've tried.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>From your description, it shows that the Windows Media Center crashes when you try to view LIVE TV or View Movies and
 you get the error message “Media Center has stopped working”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>I would like to know if you made any change to the computer before this issue occurred?</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Please follow the instructions and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 1</strong>: I would suggest you to check in
<strong>Turn Windows Features on/off </strong>to ensure that the Media Center is successfully installed.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Please use this link to Turn it Off and On.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/turn-windows-features-on-off</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2:
</strong></span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to place the computer in “Clean boot” and then check how it works.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps to place the computer in clean boot state.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Step 1:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>a. Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b. In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click the ‘Boot’ tab and uncheck ‘Safe Boot’ option.</span></p>
<p><span>d. On the ‘General’ tab, click to select the option ‘Selective startup’, and then click to clear the option Load startup
 items check box.</span></p>
<p><span>e. On the ‘Services’ tab, click to select the ‘Hide all Microsoft services’ check box, and then click ‘Disable all’.</span></p>
<p><span>f. On the ‘Startup’ tab, click ‘Open Task Manager’. In the Task Manager window under startup tab, right click on each
 startup item which are enabled and select ‘Disable’.</span></p>
<p><span>g. Click ‘OK’, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If it works in clean boot state, then follow rest of the steps.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>a. Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click the Services tab, and then click to select the Hide all Microsoft services check box.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click to select half of the check boxes in the Service list.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Click OK, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Step 3:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a. If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you
 originally selected in the Service list.</span></p>
<p><span>b. If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes
 that are cleared in the Service list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>c. If only one service is selected in the Service list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes
 the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft
 service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a. If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you
 originally selected in the Startup Item list.</span></p>
<p><span>b. If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes
 that are cleared in the Startup Item list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span>c. If only one startup item is selected in the Startup Item list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item
 that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.</span></p>
<p><span>d. If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft
 service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the Hide all Microsoft services check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Step 6:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine
 whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Step 7:</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a. Press the ‘Windows + R’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b. In the ‘Run’ windows type ’MSCONFIG’ and click ‘Ok’.</span></p>
<p><span>c. On the ‘General’ tab, click the ‘Normal Startup’ option, and then click ‘OK’.</span></p>
<p><span>d. When you are prompted to restart the computer, click ‘Restart’.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p>Hello there!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay, first of all, please do not name and shame other users on the forums. I can assure you, just because you are getting disconnected, does not mean you are being 'hacked'. However you may be facing a DDoS attack, if this user said something along the
 lines of 'I will kick you offline' etc... Of which if this has happened, I recommend you review the
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/connecting/dos-attacks-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">DoS Attacks | Denial of Service</a> page for advice, guidance and things you can do in this kind of situation. I also recommend you
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/account-banning-and-player-feedback/file-player-complaint" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
File a Complaint</a> of which will then send a report to the enforcement team for them to investigate and take the necessary action they believe is required. As well as this I suggest you
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/account-banning-and-player-feedback/mute-block-avoid-players" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Mute, Block, and Avoid</a> the user(s) to prevent further communications and lower the chances of connecting to them in a matchmaking lobby online. In cases like this, that is all that can be done. However, rest assured, all reports are looked in to and dealt
 with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, could you please perform a Xbox LIVE test and if any errors pop up view them on the
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/connecting/connection-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Connection Error</a> support page and follow the solutions on there. Next, please perform a
<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/9/p/3528493/reply.aspx/speedtest.net" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Network Speed Test</a> and post the results here so we can make sure it is not your network!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another page you may want to try and look at, and go through, is the <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/connecting/connectivity-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox LIVE Connection Help | Fix Xbox LIVE Connection Problems</a>. To add on, in case you are unaware, here is a guide on how to test your Xbox LIVE connection:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the <b>Guide</b> button on your controller, go to <b>Settings</b> and then select

<h3> dougblueglass  say:</h3>
<h2>            Photo app hijack</h2>
                    I inserted a scan disk with pictures and was prompted to pick how to open and selected Windows Photo Gallery as I have many times before, the prompt said every picture contained errors I selected download anyway and they went to the Windows 10 photo app!!
 Never appeared in Windows Photo Gallery!&nbsp; Then the photo app shows them to me and the screen "refreshes" and they're gone.&nbsp; Next day reappear and as I am looking at them it "refreshes" and they're disappear!&nbsp; I cannot put them on Snapfish download either.
 Never had any problem until Windows 10. They are not in the OneDrive either. ?????

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I do appreciate your efforts and time. Before you check the photos in the Photo app, check fi they are copied into your system so that you can open them either by using a Photo app or Photo Gallery.
</span><span>It could be possible that photos have not been copied properly.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Are you able to open the other&nbsp;photos fine without any issues?&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Wow, next time you ask a question you are going to need to provide a lot more info than that, but luckly for you, there is an easy fix.<br />
<br />
There is no way to ""recover" that info. All you have to do is type in your email address and password and check the "Remember me" box. And login, that's it.

                    <p>I have windows 10 installed and my computer does not have a cd drive. Does anyone know how I can copy a music cd from an external CD drive and then copy it to a usb stick? I can see the external drive on my computer but can find no way of controlling it.
 I have checked auto play and whilst this is ticked nothing happens.</p>
<p>Can anyone help please?</p>

<p>Hi Trevor,<br />
<br />
You can transfer your music file via Windows Media Player by ripping your CD. Ripping a CD is copying music from an audio compact disc (CD) to a PC. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Insert your CD</strong> from an external CD drive and open <strong>Windows Media Player</strong>.</li><li>Locate <strong>Organize &gt; Options &gt; Rip Music</strong>.</li><li>Provide all the information on where to save your music and what will be the format.</li><li>Click <strong>Apply</strong> and Select <strong>OK</strong>. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Check if all of your music has been transferred to your PC and copy it into your flash drive.<br />
</p>
<p>Let us know the outcome. We will be glad to assist you. </p>

<p>Sorry for the delay. </p>
<p>
</p><p>An alternative way of extracting your music file from a CD is by transferring it manually. Follow these steps to do so:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><em>Open </em>the content of your CD.</li><li><em>Select</em> the contents you want to transfer.</li><li><strong>Right-click</strong> on the contents and select <strong>Copy</strong>.</li><li><em>Open</em> the location you want the files to be saved in (external drive).</li><li><strong>Right-click</strong> on the location and select <strong>Paste</strong> to transfer the copied contents.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes. </p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I cant gain access to the external drive. This happened after a recent Windows up-date. I suspect that the up-date has changed registry settings so the drive is no longer controlled. Hopefully Microsoft will release a patch for the problem.</p>
<p>Is there another solution?</p>
<p>Kind regards</p>

<p>Thank you for the information.<br />

If that's the case, we suggest uninstalling your external CD driver thru device manager. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><em>Unplug</em> your external CD drive.</li><li>Go to <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Device Manager</span> &gt;&nbsp; Locate your external CD drive &gt; Right-click and select
Driver</span> tab &gt; Select <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Uninstall Device</span></strong>.</li><li><em>Restart</em> your device.</li><li><em>Plug</em><em>-in</em> your external drive.</li><li>Check if you'll be able to copy your music files. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Update us with the outcome so we can provide further assistance.</p>

    <title>Definition of the Word &#34;Rootkit&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> microcode man  say:</h3>
<h2>            Definition of the Word &#34;Rootkit&#34;</h2>
                    (Sorry if this is the incorrect Topic, but at least it includes the word Definition ;-)<br />
There are two competing definitions for the word; Rootkit<br />
<br />
The first is:<br />
- ROOTKIT = 1st: "conceal itself", 2nd: "malicious", performs actions detrimental to network, system, or user(s). It must to the do the 1st, and the 2nd is assumed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (In this definition the first part, <span style="font-style: italic">root</span> means somthing which lies below the surface.)<br />
The second is:<br />
- ROOTKIT = Software which includes Privileged Code, utilizing protected system resources and functions. The term originated with Unix System Utilities which supplied administrative functions not in the operating system. The current use is for both legitimate
 privileged software, and malicious software which gains and utilizes privilege through unauthorized means.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (In this definition the first part, <span style="font-style: italic">root</span> means the privileged or administrative account on a Unix System.)<br />
<br />
People who work with or for one the AV Utility organizations, use the second. They will commonly refer to a rootkit detection of a system modification made by a valid software package as a Legitimate Rootkit, and the detection as a False Positive. So they specifically
 differentiate between Legitimate Rootkits and Malicious Rootkits. The Virus Definitions for all utilities include a list of these Legitimate Rootkits to eliminate the False Positive detections.<br />
<br />
It would appear that the dividing line might be IS Professionals and "lay people". But the Microsoft document,
<a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/a/b/e/abefdf1c-96bd-40d6-a138-e320b6b25bd3/understandingantimalwaretechnologies.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Understanding Anti-Malware Technologies</a>, seems to be using the first definition. The intended audience is business people, but the expectation is it was written by an IS Professional.<br />
<br />
Is there a Senior Security Analyst at Microsoft who might have actual experience back to the origin of this word. (No offense kiddies, but looking for some who actually fought in the "Little Indian-Big Indian war".)<br />
<br />
<br />
(Note: Rootkit is always indicated as misspelled, so the developers of Office have not yet added it to their dictionary of "existing words")<br />

            <p>Then don't you think it might help to post in Unix forums instead of Microsoft&nbsp;forums if you're looking for people with Unix experience?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The thread may be in a different&nbsp;part of the overall Answers Forums site, but you're still in the wrong place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To use an analogy, you're going to a plumber's forum&nbsp;to ask for information about how the Electrical Code came&nbsp;to be 120 and 240 circuits in&nbsp;homes instead of asking at an electrician's forum.&nbsp; Maybe some plumber also does electical work and might know, but
 aren't your chances of success dramatically higher asking a group of electricians instead?</p>

            Hi AEFELTON310Felton.
<br />
<br />You can use few different ways to get to the Systems Properties.
<br />
<br />Look at this guide: <a href="https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/6-ways-to-open-computer-or-system-properties-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.isunshare.com/windows-10/6-ways-to-...</a>.

<p>Hi, im not entirely sure if this is right but go onto task manager (CTRL+ALT+DEL) then click task manager when you are in task manager look at the top of the window and you should see a few options, make sure you are in processes.
 (if not click processes) When you are in processes scroll down and right click something like
<em>system&nbsp;</em>or a&nbsp;<em>service host </em>after you do this click open file location, and hopefully you will be in system 32, now click the top bar that says
<strong>"&gt;This PC &gt; Windows (C:) &gt;Windows &gt; System32"</strong> and type&nbsp;<strong>SystemProperties</strong> it should come up with lots of options like
<strong>SystemPropertiesAdvanced.exe</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>SystemPropertiesComputerName.exe</strong> ect.</p>

<h2>            bad_pool_caller in windows 10</h2>
                    I upgraded from Windows 7 - Windows 10 at the end of July.&nbsp; That went well.&nbsp; A week later I added a new user to my computer.&nbsp; That seemed to go well.&nbsp; But now, whenever I shift from one user to the other, several minutes after the seemingly successful
 shift I get BSOD with a cause of BAD_POOL_CALLER.

<h2>            Windows 10 Won&#39;t Boot After Anniversary Update</h2>
                    <p>After the update&nbsp;installed, my computer now boots only to a small symbol in the bottom right of the screen that resembles a tree with a blinking underscore line beside it. I can boot to a USB extracted ISO of the Windows 10 installation, but none of the
 Advanced Options will repair. System Restore can't find any restore points. Start Up Repair reports that it can't repair the PC. Go back to the previous build reports that it can't take the PC back to the previous build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was a perfectly operating Windows 10 PC before the update began.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for whatever assistance you can provide.</p>

            The same thing happened to me. I run windows 10 on a Lenovo Yoga 14. After the laptop restarted several times during the anniversary update, in the last restart it stopped booting the windows. It got stuck on the splash screen (lenovo logo) and kept restarting
 endlessly without being able to boot windows. At least for me the option of going back to the previous built worked (the startup repair didn't work and the restore process couldn't find any restore point). So after being able to boot windows again I tried
 to update again and EXACTLY THE SAME thing happened. The previous built worked again and here I am asking you what should I do for this update to work without destroying my laptop.

            <p>Thank you for your reply Nachappa;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done the power drain, as well as your steps 1 to 8. I cannot boot to the desktop, no error message is displayed other than the tree shaped symbol and flashing cursor, and I access the BIOS in the usual manner. All attempts at using the repair functions
 from the USB are reported to fail. I have also tried all the other repair functions from Advanced Options, as well as the Bootrec command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only issue/question I have found since is that as I use the command prompt from the Advanced Options&nbsp;to move between drives I see that the C: drive is a 93 Mb partition&nbsp;with only a 0 byte file called recovery.txt, the boot drive is listed as X:\Sources,
 D: is the USB stick used to boot the system, E: is the HD that was listed as C: in Windows before it wouldn't boot, and F: is a 118 Mb partition with only the same recovery.txt file. I have a moderately good understanding of Windows, but am not sure whether
 this is typical when booting from a USB and attempting a repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again for your input;</p>

            <p>In a completely baffling twist, I turned on my computer and, after a much longer boot than typical, my PC is back to what seems to be normal. This after numerous reboots, booting to HD, USB, hours of being off and on, and peripherals and HDs being connected
 and not. No idea as to why it is now working, but will be rebooting, attaching peripherals and HDs, and reporting back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did tempt fate and checked for updates. It began, as it had before all the trouble began, loading the Anniversary Update. I halted it. More later today.</p>

<p>I've been building and repairing PCs&nbsp;off and on&nbsp;for more than 25 years, and this is the oddest episode I've ever been through. With all peripherals and numerous internal HDs installed, the system is now working properly. The only difference is there is now
 an additional drive, E:, a 449 MB partition of C: with the Recovery folder. My best guess is that the update wanted a Recovery folder and when it didn't find one, because it didn't exist or was hidden, it went about creating or unhiding the partition for it,
 along the way temporarily affecting the boot. All of the other drives were moved along the alphabet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why it took several dozen reboots&nbsp;is beyond my comprehension. Hopefully this is helpful to someone.</p>

            <p>Windows 10 has got to be the worst operating system rollout in the history of computers. Its still in beta form and &nbsp;you're selling/giving it to millions of people. This is inexcusable Microsoft!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is worse than the Windows 95 upgrade disks from 21 years ago and I didn't think it was possible to be worse than that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, this is unprofessional, you need to get this right. The blogs and Google/Bing search strings are full of issue after issue after issue after issue with Windows 10. This is unprofessional, half baked crap.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's been new issues with every update, every update is a crap shoot whether they will correct a problem or cause new ones, and in this case the worst problems of all. Bricking your computer, losing all your files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This latest one is the worst ever, my computer wouldn't boot at all after the anniversary update. I pissed away an entire weekend trying to get it to work to no avail. Finally I downloaded the ISO file from MS made a installation DVD on another machine.
 Popped it in the brick, uh laptop, I formatted the HD, did a fresh install and..........same thing. Will not boot to a desktop. Just like before. It just sits there for literally hours with either a blank screen or the little circle swirl going round and round,
 but never boots to a desktop. Sometimes before I did the clean install it would go to the Bios setup screen over and over and then to the black screen, but never to a usable desktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is beyond absurd Microsoft. I'm just glad I've been backing up data regularly. Sad that I have come to count on Microsoft to fail, miserably. But glad I was smart enough to back up to ensure my data losses were minimal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thinking back now, this entire last year has been a frustrating mess with Windows 10. I installed it on a 64 bit ASUS N76VJ with an i7 processor, Nvidia graphics and 16 GB of RAM. It was factory configured with Windows 8 and I opted for the "Hey try out
 the new Windows 10 for free" messages that started popping up about a year ago. It's been a blur of crap ever since. Sometimes it would go for a little while and seem to be getting better, then a new update and it's crap again. But during that entire year
 the boot up has been painfully slow with Windows 10, and even when I would get to the desktop, almost nothing worked, IE the start menu would't open up until it had been running for about 15 minutes. What kind of excuse for an operating system is that? 10
 minutes to boot and another 10-15 before the OS works right? &nbsp;<br />
<br />
So I'm finally fed up, I just installed Windows 8 and wow, it may not have all those slick features (that work sometimes) but it boots up in 45 seconds and I can use the OS right away.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is the buggiest, worst, OS I've ever used.</p>

            <p>hate to say it, but none of these suggestions work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the only one that seems to work short term is a clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>after 2 weeks of this issue, I've managed to get Windows 10 running for a total of 24hours, before Windows starts playing up. with anywhere up to 4 hours for boot just to get to the recover media first screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the media recover option only allows you to do the basics, command prompt, but with limited affect, recover, restore, roll-back, all fail, even with images and backups sitting on media that is accessible, and trying to access safe-mode is a joke.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>all f8 commands are ignored during boot, and even using recover media's advanced options and setting it to F4 or F5 safe-modes, fails to boot into safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i've had complete folders disappear and are only visible in cmd with dir/a/p command. even had this happen to the primary drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm wondering if there's a i/o caching error, which seems possible cause of property changes to folders and files, could also explain boot issues if this caching issue causes damage to boot files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how long will it before Microsoft fixes this, surely 2 months is more than enough time to find and fix, or at least find an boot-level repair tool that actually works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>system is as follows:</p>
<p>i7 980x</p>
<p>24gb</p>
<p>Windows 10 Pro</p>
<p>primary boot is raid-0 raptor sata3</p>
<p>other drives are raid-1 sata2 HDDs</p>
<p>Gigabyte x58 motherboard</p>
<p>R9 280 tri-x </p>
<p>
</p><p>this system never had issue with Win7ult, or with Win10pro upgrade.</p>

<h2>            Enlarged View problem</h2>
                    I have Windows 10, recently the display has enlarged. I have checked the display settings. Everything is at the recommended setting and the only other option makes the problem worse. The current resolution is set at 1024x768 and the scale is set at 100%.
 However I can not see the window button on the lower left side of the screen and the icon in the lower right corner of screen by the clock, because the screen view is too large. How do I get the settings back to the way they were a few weeks ago. (I already
 looked into the restore setting as well, unfortunately there are no restore dates prior to this issue)

            Hi your Display Driver will need rolling back . . . Windows Update has lately been installing incorrect display drivers . . . 
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager (accessible by right clicking your Start Button) 
<br />Expand the Display Adapters Section
<br />Right click your graphics card, choose properties

<br />Option 2. Remove AMD drivers completely and Install the legacy ones from the AMD site:
<br />What you need to do:
<br />1. Uninstall everything of AMD using this: <a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/AMD-Clean-Uninstall-Utility.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/kb-articles/Pages/...</a> and reboot
<br />2. Reboot.
<br />3. Make sure your device manager shows Microsoft Basic Display adapter.
<br />4. Download the legacy driver from here(You might have to do a bit of exercise to locate the driver:
<br /><a href="http://www.support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>
<br />5.Run the Setup and you should be good to go.
<br />Option 3: See if Windows itself has some history of the Older Driver:
<br />Solution by Ken-C here:
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/windows-10-set-display-resolution-to-1920x1080/8ad4adc6-7cc1-494e-b296-e6c4dd8caefa?messageId=913d5c97-7dd7-4780-b735-1026da383882">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />Please note all the steps need temporarily disabling of Windows update or driver updates so that newer driver doesn't install automatically.

<h2>            Skype on Samsung Note 8 with Android 8.0.0 keeps stopping</h2>
                    <p>Skype on Samsung Note 8 with Android 8.0.0 keeps stopping. It shows an error that says: Skype has stopped. That's it. Nothing else. I've re-installed it, I've cleared the cache on it, I've cleared the cache on Play Store before downloading and installing
 Skype again. None of these worked. Oh, I've also rebooted my phone in-between a re-installation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why doesn't skype like the Note 8?</p>

<h2>            Task image is corrupt or has been tampered with.</h2>
                    <p>I have 43 files in my Task Scheduler library that are "corrupt" and the message completely covers any action that I can take to resolve it.&nbsp; I have tried every suggestion to fix this mess including scans, virus checks, deleting using Command Prompt, and
 NOTHING has worked.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Two files show a possible location where they might be, but 41 of them show absolutely no location and when I try to delete them with Command Prompt, it can find no path to them.&nbsp; But still they are screwing up my ability to backup my
 computer.&nbsp; Computer geeks can figure this out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely, someone at Microsoft knows how to fix it.&nbsp; It's because of the security update KB2305420.&nbsp; I can't find it on my installed updates, but it must be on my computer or I wouldn't be having these headaches.&nbsp; Please, Computer Guru, come out of hiding
 and show me how to fix this so I can get my computer backed up.<br />

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue and your efforts towards resolving it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to software conflicts or corrupt Windows files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>perform clean boot </strong>and check if it helps.<br />
Refer this article:<br />
<strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</strong><br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” to reset the computer to start as usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it does not help, I would suggest you to <strong>run system file checker(SFC)</strong> and see if it helps.<br />
Refer:<br />
<strong>Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files</strong><br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>System file checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this information helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do let us know if you need any further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p>I've tried the Microsoft workaround&nbsp; like it suggested.&nbsp; I tried the clean boot.&nbsp; I could not single out any program that would be the cause of stopping me from backing up my computer.</p>
<p>When I ran the sfc/scannow, it said there were no integrity issues.&nbsp; I found a website called repairtasks.codeplex.com that suggests the cause of this problem is when a person upgrades to Windows 10 and then returns to Windows 7&nbsp; within the 30 days allowed--I
 did that.&nbsp; That coincides with the beginning of my problems (even though the security update KB2305420 update specifically states it causes the same problem).&nbsp; My Update History does not show this update in the history of installed updates.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried to download that program, it said "Windows cannot access the specified device path or file.&nbsp; You may not have the appropriate permission to access the file."&nbsp; I am the administrator of my computer.&nbsp; I don't know why I don't have permission.</p>

            <p>Ratandeep, thank you for trying to help, but it's been to no avail, I'm afraid.&nbsp; I tried the clean boot and did the sfc and the message I got there was that there are no integrity issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found a website called "repairtasks.codeplex.com" offering a download to fix this problem.&nbsp; They say is is caused by reverting from Windows 10 back to Windows 7 (which is what I did, and I now realize is when my problem started).&nbsp; However, when I
 tried to download the program, I get a message that I don't have the appropriate permissions to access the program.&nbsp; I don't know whom to go to to get the permission if I actually have to get it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you give me any advice about that?</p>

            I ran the system file checker.&nbsp; No errors found.&nbsp; This has me puzzled beyond belief.&nbsp; I'm no computer geek, but it seems no-one has an answer that has helped me so far.
