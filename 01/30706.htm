    <title>Stealth 420x Turtle Beaches no audio. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Stealth 420x Turtle Beaches no audio.</h2>
                    
<p>I see a lot of people are having headset issues, but I have a completely different issue.</p>
<p>So I bought the Stealth 420x today and when I got home no troubles whatsoever. I just got off from work and wanted to try them out some more. When they are on and I'm at the dashboard I can hear the audio when changing tiles and clicking tabs, but if I click
 any application like settings or games they go mute and won't make any noise.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span>&nbsp;I can restart the console and they will work at the dashboard again. I can mute the headsets and hear the automated voice say: mic on, mic off. Also I can hear the audio presets being named when I switched through the different
 options.&nbsp;</span> </li></ul>

<p>I am a NXOE member so I'm assuming that can be a reason, but like I say when I got home and used them for the first time I had no troubles.</p>

    <title>Virtual Desktop Keyboard Shortcut Bug - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christcx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Virtual Desktop Keyboard Shortcut Bug</h2>
                    <p>So while using the Windows Key+Control+Left/Right Arrow keyboard shortcut that switches between your virtual desktops, I noticed an inconsistency with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use my left control key to do this keyboard shortcut, only the shortcut that uses the left arrow key works.</p>
<p>In other words, <strong>Left </strong>Control+Windows Key+Left Arrow works, but
<strong>Left </strong>Control+Windows Key+Right Arrow doesn't.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However there doesn't seem to be a problem if I use the right control key instead of the left one, however that makes the keyboard shortcut awkward to press.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am on a clean install of Windows 10, and the left control key works fine otherwise, but I was wondering whether or not this could be fixed.</p>

</p><p>Thank you for responding, however I cannot obtain keyboard drivers for this keyboard since it's a laptop keyboard and I looked on Samsung's website. I have a Samsung computer, and they don't have drivers for their keyboards listed on their website. &nbsp;I was
 wondering whether or not this could be fixed with a registry tweak for something similar. My laptop is a Samsung branded one and its model number is NP780Z5E-S01UB</p>
<p>
</p><p>The keyboard driver listed under the Device Manager is named 'Standard PS/2' keyboard.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t play fortnite without first logging in to the adult profile</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I downloaded fortnite using my adult profile on my xbox one, but now when my son wants to play, he has to log in to my adult profile to start the game or else gets an error message telling him he needs to use the profile of the player who downloaded the
 game. So now for him to play he needs my passcode and now can change the family settings without me knowing.&nbsp; How can he start the game without going on my profile first.</p>

<p>Sorry to hear it.&nbsp; You would need to double check his online preferences to make sure it's set so he can play online games.&nbsp; It could also be a rating thing.&nbsp; If he's younger than the intended audience for the game then you would need to give permission
 for him to play each time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could also make sure that your gamertag is set as Home on your console so he can share your content without needing your tag signed in.</p>

<p>Since the wording on the other posts point in the right direction, it's worded "backwards".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You don't set an account or Gamertag as your "Home", but it's the other way around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your adult account "owns" the Fortnite game, and by going to the console settings while you're signed in, you can have your account set the console your son is playing on as your accounts's "Home Console".</p>
<p>
</p><p>That way, your account will share the ownership of the games and Xbox Live Gold memberships with this specific "Home Console", which means that everyone (including your son) can play your games on that "Home Console" of your account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So you're setting the console as your account's "Home Console".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be aware, that your account can set a Home Console only five times during 365 days. So do not repeatedly set and unset the Home Console setting on the console your son plays on, and do not move the Home Console setting to other consoles unless absolutely
 necessary (e.g. your son got his own console, or that console had to be replaced for repairs).</p>

                    <p>Original title: HP Officejet Pro 8610 -- can't sent fax from computer (using Windows 10)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I seem to be able to send print jobs successfully from the computer, I am unable to send a FAX from the computer. &nbsp;I've tried removing the printer and re-installing it but to no avail. &nbsp;When I send the print job to the "FAX - HP Officejet Pro 8610"
 printer, I receive the error message "Error Printing on Fax...." as a standard error message. &nbsp;I am using Windows 10 so I think the problem is linked to Windows 10 installation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice? &nbsp;Thanks.</p>

</p><p>Internal fax modems plug directly into your computer motherboard, similar to the way a video or sound card is plugged in. External fax modems are small devices that connect to the serial or USB ports.</p>
<div>you may also try to reset the fax modem to check if that helps.</div>
<p>

</p><p><strong>Method 1: Troubleshoot</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows 10 has a built-in troubleshooter</strong> to check and fix issues with hardware and devices. I would suggest you to run this troubleshooter to check if the issue is with your Printer. Refer these steps:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Press Windows key +X, select Control panel<br />
2.&nbsp;Change the view by option on the top right to Large icons<br />
3.&nbsp;Click on troubleshooting and click on the view all option on the left panel<br />
4.&nbsp;Run the Hardware and devices as well as Printer troubleshooter</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong>Try the printer diagnostic utility as this resolves many common printing issues and check if that helps.</p>

<h3> willcopeland  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help&#33; ASUS X555Y</h2>
                    <p>Recently I have been getting this message whenever I would restart my Laptop (ASUS X555YA, running Windows 10) that says "Reboot and select proper boot device or Insert media in boot device and press a key" I couldn't get past it so I decided to seek help
 online. I did all the steps on this article.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using the tool to create installation media &gt; Using the installation media you created</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>After I boot from the USB stick containing the tool, after about 10 seconds I am taking to this screen with the Windows logo, and about after a minute of the screen with the Windows logo and a spinning circle thingy, I am taken to a black screen. And that's
 where the problem occurs. It's just a black screen. I've tried pressing all the keys, and restarting the PC, only to be taken back to it! Please help. I have tried all my boot options and nothing is working. My BIOS boot setup looks like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Boot Option #1&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;[Lexar USB Flash Drive 1100]</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have no idea what to do and I feel like I am running out of options. Should I try switching the order around? Btw, I'm no techy savvy so please explain it in a way I can understand. Please reply asap! I'm freaking out because I have so many important files
 on this computer that I need to move onto a separate USB Stick. Thank you, god bless!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I've removed the battery and did all the steps you have told me to do. Unfortunately, it did not work for me. I'm about 99% sure I did everything correctly. If there is any further assistance that you can provide for me, please do so. It just goes back
 to the same, stupid black screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; I am not sure if I'm doing something wrong, if it's something on the manufacturer's end, or maybe it's just my luck, but I am slowly losing hope of anything good happening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; Please help, thanks.</p>

    <title>Should MS bring back MSN Live Messenger&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ramdisk12242254  say:</h3>
<h2>            Should MS bring back MSN Live Messenger&#63;</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(43, 43, 43, 1)">I am sure by now we are all aware of the purchase of Skype by Microsoft and the planned merge of said Skype franchise with their
 highly popular and well loved Instant message service Windows Live Messenger. What was a surprise and an underhanded move by Microsoft was that this merger also meant the shutting down of the Windows Live Server all together (apart from mainland china) and
 a non-optional switch to Skype for all Windows Live/MSN users if they wished to keep their contacts....whether they wanted it or not. It is also a surprise at Microsoft's blatant "Cyberbullying" tactics and language in their emails in forcing users to upgrade
 not to mention the abuse of Human Rights and privacy by taking away not only the Windows Live program itself - which for many is a basic lifeline to communicate - but also by changing and moving their emails to Outlook WITHOUT the users permission. As a long
 time Windows Live user, I am appalled at Microsoft's lack of consumer care and am shocked that they are being allowed to treat people this way. Simply because the company invested in Skype they are bulling their consumers into using a system they do not want,
 do not need and have now no other choice to use because Microsoft has made it clear that is the only way they will be able to use/keep their Windows Live contacts intact. Thus bullying and holding their Users to ransom. Why not keep both Windows Live Messenger
 and Skype? The company would be quite capable of doing so seen as they are allowing users in China to keep the service and it would not come at a great cost to the company as by keeping them both Microsoft's revenue, value and popularity would only rise and
 it would multiply the amount of users they gain - with the current plan of action they are taking, Microsoft are set to lose at least half of all Windows Live users. If the company were so set to merge both programs, why not simply merge and upgrade the Video
 call/Video chat service on MSN that has always been present on Windows Live anyway to a Skype mode plug-in (as that is what skype was intended for in the first place) instead of forcing users to use a program they do not need or want and trying to give people
 a half thought out weak IM add-on to Skype that is not reliable nor does it have any of the features or functions of Windows Live/MSN. This world is supposed to stand up against and not tolerate any form of cyber bullying, bullying in general or breach of
 privacy and yet Microsoft is being let to get away just that. As a company reliant on it's consumers Microsoft's actions are appalling by ignoring the needs and wishes of their users. And as a consumer and person I feel deeply offended and let down at being
 treated in such a manner and feel we must stand up against Microsoft for their bad conduct, breach of privacy and human rights, also for the companies "Bullying" tactics and for our right to use a system we love. We have a right to be heard. LISTEN TO YOUR
 CONSUMERS MICROSOFT. BRING WINDOWS LIVE MESSENGER BACK.</span>

<p>Hi Barry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>There might be an application that is causing this issue in creating a folder. May we know if there are third-party antivirus applications installed on your device?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, may we know if you are running a Windows Insider build? If you are, kindly post back what build version is running.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>and thank you for the quick reply.</p>
<p>I think I have the full version of W10 and use Office 365 and I attached below my system info if that helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do run a program called "ScanGuard" which may coincide with the issues.</p>
<p>It use it to scan my hard drives but if not required should I remove it as i am not confident it does anything useful?? &nbsp;It is a paid version for $29.00 annually. &nbsp;Can I get rid of it and see how that goes.</p>
<p>

            You posted that you are running a third-party application to scan your hard drives. It could be that this application is restricting you from renaming newly created folders. We suggest that you temporarily disable this application. After disabling the
 application, attempt to create a test folder and rename it.

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>I deleted the third party software and tried again several folders and same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is involved in fully re-installing my W10?? &nbsp;I know I will loose many saved shortcuts etc but may be worth it as a last resort. &nbsp;My Onedrive stuff will remain and my Office 365 will take some time but at least it will be clean.</p>

<h3> mythonaut ix  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stream-play&#58; Half of the screen is broken when PC is plugged in.</h2>
                    
<p>The issue I'm having is very strange. &nbsp;The remote stream-play function seems to work surprisingly well, however I have one BIG problem... If I try to stream while my computer is plugged in, the right-hand half of the screen blurs into incomprehensible nonsense.
 &nbsp;Literally ONLY when the PC is plugged in. &nbsp;If I begin streaming unplugged, it will work fine until the moment I plug it in.</p>
<p>It's not a problem with the screen itself, because it works perfectly fine with any other app/program on the computer, regardless of whether or not it's plugged in. This error ONLY occurs when streaming from the Xbox One. &nbsp;I've messed with the power settings
 and can't seem to find anything there that is affecting it. &nbsp;I can only imagine this is something that will be addressed in a software patch, but in the meantime, is anyone else having this problem? &nbsp;Does anyone have any suggestions?</p>

<p>Everton1878, I have the exact same computer (Sony Vaio Flip) with the exact same problem.
</p>
<p>Try unplugging it, and then start the stream. &nbsp;I'm betting it works just fine on the battery.</p>
<p>Let's hope this gets patched sometime soon. &nbsp;I bought a Windows PC with this feature in mind, and I'll be extremely bummed if the one I chose just doesn't can't do it.</p>

<p>I tested it last night without the cable plugged in and it works fine</p>
<p>Unfortunately it looks like its a problem with the laptop</p>
<p>Sony were saying not to upgrade yet until they tested everything but I think that's mostly to cover themselves</p>
<p>One bit I saw said they wouldn't have the drivers updated until November!</p>
<p>It may even be something physical with the laptop, maybe there is some interference

<p>Disable X-Reality for mobile in the Vaio Control Center (Image Quality)</p>

<h3> petersissakis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Pro Pin is not working and not able to back up system.</h2>
                    <p>Before the Windows 10 anniversary update my laptop had no issues was working perfect, and I loved it.&nbsp; After the update occurred and the system rebooted it went right to blue screen.&nbsp; I ended up having to use Windows on USB to repair, but it never worked
 properly and still would blue screen periodically.&nbsp; So I was forced to reinstall windows from scratch. After after formatting hard drive and reinstalling windows and all my software I decided to do a back up just in case.&nbsp; Windows back up didn't work it would
 give me a message that it couldn't complete system image.&nbsp; Windows wouldn't back up my system so I ended up using Easeus Todo Backup instead, not a big deal. After that I decided decided to program my PIN but wasn't able to.&nbsp; I would go through all the steps
 of putting in my Microsoft password and choosing a PIN but it would just reset right back to as if no PIN was programmed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up getting support but no one can could solve these issues.&nbsp; I gave them remote access to my laptop and I have spent days with them to no avail.&nbsp; No one can tell me why my PIN won't work or why I can't back up to my external drive.&nbsp; They ended up
 screwing up my laptop even worse and I had 5 users on my laptop that Microsoft support put on my laptop in order to try and fix these problems. So Again I do a fresh install, and again I still have the same problems, and that's with only windows installed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm wondering if It's possible to trade in my Windows 10 for Windows 8.1 as I don't know what else to do.</p>

                    Hey guys,<br />
<br />
<br />
Just got a BSOD, with the "reference by pointer" error 0x18:<br />
<br />
On Thu 10/7/2010 10:52:09 PM your computer crashed<br />
This was likely caused by the following module: ntoskrnl.exe<br />
Bugcheck code: 0x18 (0x0, 0xFFFFFA800E510060, 0x2, 0xFFFFF88002129B00)<br />
Error: REFERENCE_BY_POINTER<br />
Dump file: C:\Windows\Minidump\100710-24835-01.dmp<br />
file path: C:\Windows\system32\ntoskrnl.exe<br />
product: MicrosoftÂ® WindowsÂ® Operating System<br />
company: Microsoft Corporation<br />
description: NT Kernel &amp; System<br />
The crash took place in a standard Microsoft module. Your system configuration may be incorrect, possibly the culprit is in another driver on your system which cannot be identified at this time.<br />
<br />
I know my RAM is good as I ran testing for 7 passes very recently.<br />
<br />
<br />
Windows 7 x64.&nbsp; Dump is here: http://www.crookedpathfilms.com/Sharing/minidump.zip<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated!<br />

</p><p><strong>This website only allows so many comments per poster per time limit. So you might have to refresh this page to get further replies on this comment.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now your claim of NUKED, whatever that means, well maybe run disk check on the drive and select to make repairs. This might fix the system volume information file or fix a possible issue with the drive itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>WHAT DOES NUKED MEAN ?????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ok, you state that you had an old hard drive that I guess quit working or Windows crashed on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So then on another PC, or you installed Windows on another drive and connected this old BAD NUKED drive. Now you can see all the data aka files and folders, but you can not access them ????? Is this what you are saying ????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because if you give me the specifics, I can help you one way or the other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a PC or a laptop ????</p>
<p>
</p><p>And is this NUKED drive an internal or external USB HDD ????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you see the drive in Computer Management&gt;&gt;Disk Management<span>&nbsp; </span>????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you see the drive in THIS PC location ????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you see it in Device Manager<span>&nbsp; </span>????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, if it was a drive that was previously formatted NTFS and either did or did not have Windows installed on it, then you should be able to access the drive and files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, As I have did in the past on drives with Windows installed, you probably have to take ownership<strong> YOU
</strong>of the drive and/or user folder to be able to access and move the files to new location. You also need to add
<strong>YOU</strong> in the user list in ownership security settings window with full control/permission.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Link here shows in details how to do this.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Then Restart the PC and try and access the files.</p>

<p>Nuke is a term used to completly wip a drive using Darik's Boot and Nuke.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
What happened was that I had a faulty PSU in the past but I thought it was the hard drive so I switched them. I later found out it was the PSU, I replaced the PSU and I realised this hardrive was absolutly fine, so I wanted to have two harddrives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Internal HDD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see the drive in Disk Manager and Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is NTSF and Windows is erased from it.</p>

    <title>Old Realtek card reader driver blocked in Fall Creators Update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andylp92  say:</h3>
<h2>            Old Realtek card reader driver blocked in Fall Creators Update</h2>
                    <p>Hello!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just wanted to ask whether there is a way to tell Windows 10 to use a driver that used to work fine in a previous build of Windows 10, instead of blocking it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm on a 8-year-old HP laptop that uses a Realtek card reader. When I tried updating to the W10 Fall Creators Update, I noticed that (yet again) my card reader stopped working, but I couldn't make it work again anymore, as Windows said that the driver I
 used was causing stability issues of some sort and hence was blocked. The version of the driver is&nbsp;6.1.7600.31, dated&nbsp;10/30/2009, and signed by the&nbsp;Microsoft Windows Hardware Compatibility Publisher.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On previous occasions that my card reader would stop working, I only needed to reinstall the driver and do one small tweak in order to make my card reader work again without any stability problems, but now I couldn't seem to do it anymore, so I resorted
 to reverting back to a previous build of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So is there a way to either bypass that block or something like that? I tried using newer drivers, but if I recall correctly, it doesn't work well with my card reader and only makes my system slow down. I don't see why the same driver that so far has been
 working fine since I updated to Windows 10 shouldn't work again in a slightly newer version of Windows 10!</p>

<p>Whoa! Okay, so here what's happened:</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of restarts later all of a sudden my card reader comes back to life just like that, no questions asked. No more objections to the old driver, no nothing, so, miraculously, the problem fixed itself!</p>
<p>
</p><p>(now if only I could do the same with my hp mobile data protection sensor that stopped working months ago)</p>

<p>Looking to set custom locations for our users to choose from our 2 Offices, Home and then the ability to add custom locations for client sites. Has anyone done this or is it possible even.</p>
<p>Also are we able to sync users custom locations between computers, seem to have different lists on each machine I use.</p>
<p>Using 365 and Skype for Business 2015 client across the board.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>hi ryan,</p>
<p>by mentioning â€˜custom locationsâ€™, are you referring to this field in the skype for business client?</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/07760aad-87f3-4597-913f-8f3a2be54557" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/07760aad-87f3-4597-913f-8f3a2be54557" /></a><br />
<br />
if yes, itâ€™s not feasible to set custom locations for your users as an admin in office 365 currently. and based on my tests, neither is it possible to sync usersâ€™ custom locations between computers. thanks for your kind understanding.</p>
<p>meanwhile, i can fully understand your concern. and as this constructive idea may also benefit many other office 365 users with similar requirements, we welcome and encourage you to share this brilliant idea with our related team through

<h2>            Windows 7 will not start after Windows update</h2>
                    
<p>Windows 7 Home Premium 32 bit will not start after a recent Windows Update. &nbsp;This happened on Friday September 17th.</p>
<p>Hangs at Windows logo and when I run system recovery it can not repair the issue.</p>
<p>When I try to boot into safe mode it hangs after loading Classpnp.sys</p>
<p>I tried a system restore in recovery mode back to to September 13th which was the oldest restore point available and that did not work.</p>
<p>I am running MS Security Essentials and I do not recall what IE version I am running or if there was a trial version of any AV software originally installed on the computer.</p>
<p>Vista 7 Home premium was an upgrade installed on 32 bit Vista about a year ago. &nbsp;The PC is a Compaq C700 laptop.</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>I do not have any USB devices connected to the computer</p>
<p>1) I did try last known good configuration as stated in my first email and it did not work.</p>
<p>2) I can not run&nbsp;<strong>Dism /online /get-packages</strong><span>with
 the online option from recovery mode. &nbsp;I tried dism with the image option instead pointing to c:\ and the latest two updates were on 8/25/2010. &nbsp; Maybe these were the last updates since the 9/13 restore point I went back to. &nbsp;</span>Should I remove those?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thanks!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other people (including me) are having this same problem. &nbsp;It is being caused by the Silverlight update, and it's somehow corrupting people's computers. &nbsp;System restore, and re-imaging my hard drive back to August 20th did not fix my boot-up problem. &nbsp;I
 had to disable the Microsoft Power service to finally get my computer to boot up normally. &nbsp;But without that service I can't get sound and a few other things.</p>

            is there any other software that can burn dvds and then play to stand-alone dvd players? i have bought other software that will only play on my pc and not dvd player, RealPlayer is the only one that seems to work, but since switching to 8.1 from 7, i'm
 not able to burn dvds w/o RealPlayer crashing, not sure what to do, this is horrible and RP agents don't seem to be any help.&nbsp; I could burn as many dvds/cds as i want in a day; but now i'm lucky if i can burn 1 successfully, I've tried today and have had 3
 shut downs, while loading 3 sets of random media clips to burn, i'm so tired of this i cold scream!!!

    <title>Cannot get any new keyboard to work. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> keith powell  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot get any new keyboard to work.</h2>
                    <p>My 800 wireless keyboard is getting worn out so I bought a new Logitech one but it wouldn't work as the Microsoft drivers always over-ruled any of the Logitech plug and play facilities. I also tried a Maplin wireless keyboard but that won't work either.
 I gave in therefore and bought a new Microsoft Wireless 900 Desktop</p>
<p>&nbsp;st thinking that staying with Microsoft would solve the problem but that is not the case. The new set-up will not work, and is not recognised. I have then deleted the drivers for the 800 set-up and then closed the computer and then replaced the USB plug
 and restarted but then neither the new nor the old will work. As soon as I replace the new USB for the old, the 800 is recognised but I cannot get my PC to recognise my new keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do please?</p>

            <p>Thank you for bothering to respond to my problem and for your thoughts on the subject. My basic problem is that my new keyboard and mouse do not work at all once the computer has been started with them attached</p>
<p>&nbsp;The drivers for the old keyboard and mouse are up to date and are said to be working correctly. If I remove them the keyboard and mouse cease to work so I cannot run any of the "Fixit" routines as I cannot interact with the PC. Similarly, when I re-start
 the computer by pressing the on/off switch, without the old drivers the old keyboard doesn't work and the new keyboard will not work either so I cannot run any sort of troubleshooter programme.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can you do when you have no interface with the computer to find out why the new keyboard and mouse are&nbsp; not working when they are attached?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can you do when the old keyboard and mouse are, correctly, found to be working but something in their setup is preventing any other input devices from working?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought that buying a new Microsoft product would work with the drivers for the old set-up but this doesn't seem to be so. Is there a difference between an 800 and a 900 keyboard - they are both meant to be plug and play.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is driving me mad!!!</p>

            <p>Further to my reply, no-one else came up with a solution but I solved it myself the old fashioned way. I borrowed a wired keyboard and a wired mouse and then removed the drivers for the Microsoft products and closed down the PC. I then removed the USB "transmitter".
 I then restarted the PC with the wired keyboard and mouse and ran Wise 365 to check the registry and remove any further traces. I then shut down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then inserted the USB transmitter, with the wired items also in place, and switched on the system. After waiting for a reaction while the system recognised the new USB item and that then started to transmit to the wireless keyboard and mouse - about 45
 seconds - they started to react. I unplugged the wired versions and the system is now running with its new wireless keyboard and mouse,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lets hope that my fingers don't wear out the letters oon the keys so quickly this time!!!</p>

<h2>            How to disable Cortana</h2>
                    I don't have a windows phone, I don't search from desktop. This is something Google came out with a while ago I DO NOT DO THIS. I actually go to Google or Bing and search. This is eating up my Ram and I am not using it. There is a problem if I get rid
 of it I lose my "Start menu" also? Why tie this into the start menu? I won't buy a windows phone. I need to disable this. So far W-10 is lagging my pc and eating up tons of Ram and CPU. I hope you are listening to us and working on it. Even though W-8 never
 was right. So again my question How do I disable this, I mean really disable it and NOT use my Ram. I don't use it ever!

            Hi,<br />
<br />
If you prevent Cortana from running as a Windows Process you also lose all<br />
of Windows Search. So if Cortana is disabled think of what remains as just<br />
Windows without Search (which is what it really is). And I certainly don't <br />
recommend doing it.<br />
<br />
One way is to use a Local Account and Cortana does not run.<br />

There are actually several methods to stop Cortana as a Process - here is a <br />
Search.<br />

    <title>How to determine when User accounts was created&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to determine when User accounts was created&#63;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I'm working with a company on their WORKGROUP network. They have a PC which is shared with an account's ID and password known to the Administrative staff. Also, I believe that the shared account has Admin level access. This morning the PC has additional two
 accounts created on it and nobody knows how or who created them.&nbsp; Is there a way to find out when aforementioned accounts were created? And, if possible, which ID was used to create them?<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help.<br />

            There are two answers to your question:<br />
<ul>
<li>The Event Recorder (eventvwr.exe) will show you when an account was <span style="font-weight: bold">
created</span>, but only if the policy to record security events is activated.</li><li>The creation date of the folder c:\Users\JoeDoe (for example) will tell you when the account was first
</li></ul>
