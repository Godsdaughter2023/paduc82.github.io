    <title>Windows 10 Installer does not use hard drive - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Installer does not use hard drive</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to reinstall Windows 10 on an HP 7800p SFF, however the installer assures me that the drive I am trying to install to cannot be used displaying the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Windows cannot be installed to this disk. This computer's hardware may not support booting to this disk. Ensure the disk's controller is enabled in the computer's BIOS menu."</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Nothing was changed prior to the reinstall attempt</li><li>Other OSs including Windows 7 install on the drive without issue</li><li>CMOS reset does not help</li><li>The installer cannot run the driver setup from the HP website complaining that the driver is not compatible with Windows 10 (The driver installed fine on the previous Windows 10 installation)</li><li>Changing drives does not help</li><li>Using a different Windows 10 installation medium does not help</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to do a Windows 7 to Windows 10 upgrade is not an option as I don't have the product key and the installer does not have an option to skip activation and use the Digital Licence after upgrading.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What else can be done to get the system to reinstall?</p>

            Hi  Idontwantanaccount 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media       
        </p>

<p>Booting the Installer is not the issue. The Windows 10 simply does not want to be installed on the drive saying it isn't bootable despite being bootable by multiple other OSs including the previous install of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system is from 2008 and therefore doesn't have UEFI.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Keyboard Layout creator 1.4 Wrong msi</h2>
                    <p>I used the editor to simply add a foreign character.&nbsp; I entered the character, did a verify and then did a test, which worked.&nbsp; I then did a build and setup package.&nbsp; If I run the setup, it appear to run ok but it does not work even after a reboot, nothing
 happens.&nbsp; The I noticed that the build creates 3 msi files.&nbsp; There is an I64, a 386 and an AMD.&nbsp; I definitely have have a 64 bit I7.&nbsp; The msi that gets installed is the AMD.&nbsp; If I manually try to run the other 2 msi's they will say that that are not supported
 with my processor.&nbsp; If I uninstall the AMD msi, the US Custom layout goes away.&nbsp; If I delete the AMD msi, the setup will not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how do I get the setup to run the correct msi or otherwise get this to work.</p>

&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for taking the time out of your day to share your issue with the community. &nbsp;We'll want to try a few things to resolve this sort of issue.</p>
<p><br />
Before we start these steps though we'll want to ensure that this content was originally purchased using the same Gamertag and console that you are currently attempting to access the map packs with.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Delete the map pack files from the World at War folder on your console's hard drive.<br />
&nbsp; </li><li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Clear the system cache</a>.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; </li><li>Re-download the content from your <a href="https://live.xbox.com/Download/History/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><br />
After that we'll want to try accessing the content once more. &nbsp;Please let us know how it goes and if you run into any other questions along the way!</p>

<h2>            Downgrade from W10 to W7 has caused corrupt task scheduler</h2>
                    After upgrading to W10 none of my usb ports would work so I uninstalled 10 and reinstalled 7. When I tried to do a backup I got corrupt file message. Thinking I my laptop was infected I tried to download the safety scanner and all I got was the spinning
 circle. Checking into forums it seems others are having the same kind of issues. I can't open the task scheduler without a barrage of error messages coming up. Is there a, simple,&nbsp;way to fix this. I would appreciate any help or info. Thanks&nbsp;

Re-build Windows 7
</p><div>
<p>If you are going to do a re-install, you may be able to take your data off first.&nbsp; Remove the hard drive and put it into a USB external drive housing.&nbsp; Connect to a working PC, copy the data off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Always check to ensure the hard drive you are about to rebuild is actually sound from a hardware perspective.&nbsp; Download and run your hard drive manufacturer’s drive testing software.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you had or have Windows 10 installed</strong>, you are unlikely to ever get Windows 7 working again satisfactorily unless you do a complete re-install.&nbsp; In this case, a System Repair disk is not going to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>If you have a corrupted Windows 7 system</strong>, you are trying to recover, you want to try a System Repair disk to boot the PC.&nbsp; It may be more successful in fixing and offer other alternatives.&nbsp; If you do not have one, go to any other PC that
 has windows 7 with the same bitness (32/64).&nbsp; Start globe, All Programs, Maintenance.&nbsp; You need just a blank CD.&nbsp; When you boot, ensure that you are in fact booting on that CD and not the hard drive.&nbsp; Usually pressing F12 will lead you to the option to do
 so.</p>
<ol>
<li>Factory restore — replaces everything on the hard drive with exactly what it had on it when you bought it.&nbsp; You access this before Windows starts using a special key that can varies by brand.&nbsp; F11 is the most common. This is an option only if the installed
 hard drive is the original.</li><li>“Upgrade” install using the Win7 install disk.&nbsp;(<em>This is not an option when recovering from a Windows 10 installation</em>). You start as if you are re-installing from scratch but when it gets to the point where it offers the Upgrade choice you choose
 that.</li><li>Full Clean install.&nbsp; The only absolutely sure way to have a perfectly clean system.&nbsp; If you are not using a brand new disk, when it shows the screen to select where you want to put Windows, click on the Advanced link and delete all partitions.&nbsp; Do not install
 any software until after ALL Windows Updates are installed and Device Manager shows all devices installed.</li></ol>
<p>You will need a Win7 install disk for 2 or 3.&nbsp; You will need a legal product code for 3 and the win7 disk must match the edition of the code and its bitness (32 or 64).&nbsp; If you do not have the original Windows 7 install disk, borrow one from a friend.</p>

<h2>            Logged on as Administrator but access to C&#58;&#47;Documents and Settings is denied.</h2>
                    My CAD program keeps locking up and I'm working with the mfr on that - but, they asked me to "remove the folder Config and also the files from the folder "Built-In" that can be found along the path like "C:/Documents and Settings/&lt;username&gt;/Application
 Data/IMSIDesign/TurboCAD/17/Professional/Profiles". Easy enough...<br />
<br />
BUT, 'WINDOWS' tells me that access is denied when I go to open C:\Documents and Settings... I am logged on as Admin so what is the deal??<br />
<br />
Any suggestions?<br />

<h3> architsareen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 stuck in &#34;Automatic Repair&#34; loop</h2>
                    My laptop has suddenly ran into the "Automatic Repair" loop. I wanted to boot my laptop in Safe Mode so I restarted it using the Shift key to bring up the advanced options. After I selected the safe mode option my laptop rebooted and started Automatic
 Repair. It diagnoses for errors and then brings up a screen showing that Automatic Repair is not working. Then it shows Shutdown and other options. After shutdown and turn on, it enters the same loop. I am not able to use the other options since they require
 an Administrator password, which I do not have. I booted from a Windows 8 CD by changing the BIOS order but still it enters the same loop. I am unable to do anything, Please help.

<h2>            How to Customize File Sharing Permissions to Create&#47;Modify&#47;Delete FILES... but not FOLDERS&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello.&nbsp; &nbsp; I need to customize a shared folder on my network so that one user (Reba) can create, append, modify, delete all FILES within that folder and subfolders... but Reba should not be able to create or delete the FOLDERS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tested various configurations, and the closest I've been able to come is to create
<strong>TWO sets</strong> of Advanced permissions for Reba:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">1.&nbsp; The first instance of Reba, is ALLOWED,&nbsp;applied to "This folders and subfolders,"&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Traverse folder / execute file</li><li>List folder / read data</li><li>Read attributes</li><li>Read extended attributes</li><li>Create files / write data</li><li>Write attributes</li><li>Write extended attributes</li><li>Delete subfolders and files</li><li>Read permissions</li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">But Reba is DENIED permissions&nbsp; of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full control</li><li>Create folders / append data</li><li>Delete</li><li>Change permissions</li><li>Take ownership</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">2.&nbsp; The second instance of Reba, is ALLOWED,&nbsp;applied to "Files Only:"</p>
<ul>
<li>Traverse folder / execute file</li><li>List folder / read data</li><li>Read attributes</li><li>Read extended attributes</li><li>Create files / write data</li><li>Create folders / append data</li><li>Write attributes</li><li>Write extended attributes</li><li>Delete subfolders and files</li><li>Delete</li><li>Read permissions</li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">But Reba is DENIED permissions of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full control</li><li>Change permissions<br />
</li><li>Take ownership</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>The above configuration does deny Reba the ability to create folders/subfolders... but ALLOWs her to delete folders (which I do NOT want her to be able to do).</p>

            Hi, 
<br />
<br />Incorrect Permission settings created for the Particular file, folder or drive can cause this issue.
<br />I would suggest you to modify the permission settings on the folder or the hard drive on which you are unable to create or modify or delete files. 
<br />Follow the below Steps:
<br />1. Right click on the file or directory. 
<br />2. Click on “Properties” on the right click menu. 
<br />3. Click on “Security” tab. 
<br />4. Click on “Advanced” button at the bottom. 
<br />5. In Advanced Security Dialog window, click on “Owner” tab. 
<br />6. Here you will be able to see current owner (i.e. Trusted Installer). 
<br />7. To take ownership of the object, click on the Edit button. Give permission to UAC. Then highlight the user name in the “Change owner to” box that you want to assign as the owner for the object. Click “OK” to finish the process. 
<br />8. Back in Advanced Security Settings window, you will see the current owner has changed to the user you just selected. 
<br />9. Click “OK” button to exit this window. 
<br />10. Click “OK” again to exit completely from the Properties window. 
<br />11. Repeat step 1 to 4 to open the object’s Properties window again. 
<br />12. Back in object’s Properties window, click on Edit button, and confirm the UAC elevation request. 
<br />13. Highlight the Administrators in the “Group or user names” box. If the user ID or group that you want to manage the permissions for the object doesn’t exist, click on “Add” button, and type in the user name or group name desired into the “Enter object names to select (Can use Everyone as user Name)” box, and finish off by clicking on “OK”. 
<br />14. In the Permissions for Administrators box below (or any other user name or group name you chose), click on “Full Control” under the “Allow” column to assign full access rights control permissions to Administrators group. 
<br />

<h2>            Mouse movement freezes the OS for a few seconds at random intervals</h2>
                    <p>I just bought the MSI Cyberpower PC and booted it up and I have been having this problem all night. I have tried the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Updating Windows</li><li>Updating the drivers for the mouse (it just says I have the best version)</li><li>Restarting the computer</li><li>Unplugging and plugging the mouse into the same port</li><li>Unplugging and plugging the mouse into different ports</li><li>Troubleshooting the mouse through windows</li></ul>
<p>The mouse that I have is the one that came with the PC, so I am pretty sure there is no issue there. It is a brief freezing of the screen that causes all currently programs to stop until it unfreezes a second later. The problem seems to happen at random
 times. I really have no idea where to turn for this issue. I have seen countless posts about this and none of them seem to be helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please don't tell me I have to take the computer back....</p>

</p><p>A software conflict is a common cause of performance issues in Windows 10. That being said, I will need more information to properly address your concern. Please verify the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you getting any error messages?</li><li>Have you tried running the troubleshooter for hardware and devices?</li><li>Can you tell me the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>OS Build</strong></span> of your Windows 10 system? Right-click the
<strong>Start</strong> button, select <strong>System</strong> &gt; <strong>About</strong> and then scroll down to
<strong>Windows</strong> <strong>specifications</strong> to find this information.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you haven't tried yet, you can run the troubleshooter for hardware and devices to scan and fix your PC for any issues with your device drivers. You need administrator access to perform this operation.</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the <strong>Start</strong> button, select <strong>Settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>Update &amp; Security</strong> &gt; <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Hardware and Devices</strong> under <strong>Find and fix other problems</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Run the troubleshooter</strong>.</li><li>If prompted, choose <strong>Yes</strong> or enter the administrator password.</li><li>Follow the on-screen instructions.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>To identify which program is possibly causing the random freezing, let's perform a clean boot. A clean boot stars Windows with a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This procedure will help us determine whether a background program is causing the
 issue. Refer to this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="How to perform a clean boot in Windows">support article</a></strong> for the steps on how
 to perform a clean boot. For more details, you can watch our <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RYJfK4hpQM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Microsoft Support: Help! Windows Clean Boot">YouTube video</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/-RYJfK4hpQM?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/-RYJfK4hpQM?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="font-weight: bold">IMPORTANT</span>: Go to the section: <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">
Reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</span> to boot the PC in normal startup after identifying the cause of the issue.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Family - getting error when trying to add additional children or adults - Please try again later. We can&#39;t do this right now.</h2>
                    <p>I installed the Microsoft Family parental controls on my Windows 10 machines this weekend.&nbsp; By install, I mean set it up online and enable it on the PC's.&nbsp; I added my children to the my outlook account and they show up there now.&nbsp; However, now I cannot add
 any more children or adults to my account.&nbsp; I keep getting the error message stating:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try again later. We can't do this right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been getting this message for 48 hours now.&nbsp; I've tried from my phone, several different PC's with different OS's and several different browsers all resulting with the same error.&nbsp; I've even used a different adult from this account...still nothing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created another microsoft family account with another email address of mine and it works there, just not on this account.&nbsp; It appears that my account is having some sort of issue preventing me from adding any other people.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, any advise?</p>

            You are referring to the Windows.old folder right?
<br />
<br />If so, there are several ways you can delete it. Personally, I recommend waiting the 10 days and let it delete itself automatically.
<br />
<br />Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
<br />
<br />Then hit Enter
<br />
<br />
<br />Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
<br />
<br />Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
<br />
<br />Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
<br />
<br />Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
<br />
<br />
<br />After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
<br />
<br />As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.
<br />
<br />
<br />Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
<br />
<br />Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
<br />
<br />Another way you can try removing Windows.old is using the following commands:
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: cmd
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />First, you will need to take ownership of this folder, so at the command prompt, type
<br />
<br />takeown /F C:\Windows.old\* /R /A
<br />
<br />and hit Enter.
<br />
<br />Next, in the command prompt, type
<br />
<br />cacls C:\Windows.old\*.* /T /grant administrators:F
<br />
<br />Hit Enter.
<br />
<br />Then type:
<br />
<br />rmdir /S /Q C:\Windows.old\
<br />
<br />Then hit Enter.
<br />
<br />Exit then restart.  	
<br />
<br />If this does not work, try using a free third party utility such as TreeSize to remove it. Learn more about how to download, set it up and use it:

<pre>After buying several rockstar games have come to the conclusion that they are swindlers, their games are aimed at unscrupulous rabble.<br /><br />&nbsp; Absolutely all rockstar games have mod for cheating, if you're an honest person get ready for the whole mob fueled by rockstar you make the game unplayable and may even averiarte the console, that is happening now with their games, for me this company is pure garbage laughs honest people who play fair.<br /><br />&nbsp; If you have had unpleasant experiences thanks to Rockstar esfadores contact me and we will see how we can get this discontent to this dirty company, they know they will not laugh at us.<br /><br />&nbsp; I recommend everyone not to buy products rockstar and tell everyone you know to not do so either.</pre>

<pre><span>good luck to those who buy the games rocksara praised from reaching an idiot to console freezing them and screw them to disk or the reader of your xbox (all with the complacency of rocksar)</span></pre>

<p>Argument #1: opinion</p>
<p>Argument #2: An even GREATER opinion</p>
<p>Argument #3:So you are saying you have a way of taking down/disconnecting R*?</p>
<p>Argument #4: No one will do that except a deluded individual such as yourself.</p>
<p>Argument #5: Poor software security is the problem; not R*. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>In conclusion, is this translated or is this your first time typing on a keyboard? I found it very difficult to understand you at parts.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>So, after playing several R* games, you have come to the conclusion that they are swindlers...Hmm, how so? "Unscrupulous rabble"? Big words; perhaps you could explain what "unscrupulous rabble" means rather than trying to look smart. If someone doesn't know
 what you are trying to point out in your argument, then you don't look so smart after all.
</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Although all R* games may have mods, that does not specifically mean that R* are to blame. There are other games that also have mods: Test Drive Unlimited 2, Saints Row 2 and The Third, Need For Speed Hot Pursuit 2010, etc, etc. Not just R* games have mods;
 EVERY game has mods at one point. What are you are saying is completely subjective. EVERY game will eventually have mods; not just R*'s, so your argument is invalid. And furthermore, R* are NOT the ones that make up the mods. Mods are created by exploiting
 security flaws within the game, whether they be memory leaks, running unsigned code, or even using devices such as Jtags. "Script kiddies", people who write custom code for games, are the ones responsible for mods. I'd name some who are responsible but forum
 rules forbid it. Hmm, "the company is pure garbage". Yet another opinion because I'm still playing GTA: Iv to this day. The difference between you and I is I STAY AWAY FROM the modders.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>WTF is "estafordes"? This tells me this is translated using a translator or you mispelled something. This only worsens your argument and makes people less likely to read. "Disconnect to this dirty company". Again, would be nice if you typed something legible
 so we could understand it. This sounds like you want to stop buying games from R*, in that case, simply stop buying their products. I don't see why people have to "contact" you to do so. Are you trying to make a "class action lawsuit" or something? Even so,
 they wouldn't accept it. R* makes a quality game. The "script kiddies" are the ones responsible for ruining it. Blame the modders. That what we all do because they are the ones responsible.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>So, by the looks of it, you want to encourage people to boycott R* by the looks of it. I'm sorry but this will never happen except for "deluded individuals such as yourself". Players by games and products from R* because they know what they are getting is
 worth it. They are buying a quality product as much as you disagree. R* are not like EA which will just shovel out any new game and change a few things. R* meticulously takes the time and effort to make a good and quality game. Why do you think they have delayed
 GTA: V? To make it better!</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Yep; good luck to me and all the other who read this. And good luck to you as well. While we are all enjoying the game, you will be left out of the loop. No one can prepare you for that feeling, so I say again, good luck. Ugh! Console freezing is again done
 by "script kiddies/modders". Ugh! More intelligible babble: "and screw them to disk or the reader of your xbox". I have no idea where you are trying to go with this.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Please carefully reread over everything I've said. R* is a company that provides quality products, not "garbage" or "unplayable" games like you've been stating as fact. R* also are not responsible for the "console freezing" or the cheating" or even the mods.
 "Script kiddies and modders" are to blame for ruining the multiplayer, and I can agree with you that they made MP garbage ATM. Unfortunately, there is nothing that R* can do about it because there are far too many of them and it's not entirely M$'s job either
 so you just need to deal with it for now. GTA: V will have Max Payne 3's Cheater Pool feature; I can almost guarantee this since R* are well aware by now how bad of a problem modders can be. In closing, what you have said about R* is 100% BS. Good day!</p>

<p>@Dingo, I've provided valid arguments to each of his "assumptions/opinions". As you can see, I still have not received a reply from said poster, so it seems that what I have said has rocked his little arguments to the ground and he has sulked off the battlefield
 defeated because what he is saying is lies and slander of R*'s good name. Countless others have also stated why his assumptions/opinions are wrong. I only came in to address why he is wrong and I have done that. I won't let players, even trolls, post false
 accusations of R* because they are one of the only DECENT gaming companies still around today that provide games with the idea of "quality" rather than "quantity".</p>

<p>I don't think you understand the meaning of the word "scam". Practically all games and software have glitches and issues. Just because something doesn't work as intended or because someone exploits the software doesn't mean that anyone has scammed you. That's
 just how things work when it comes to software. It's code written by imperfect humans, so there are going to be flaws and mistakes. If that's not something you can accept then you may want to look into other hobbies besides video games.

<p>All I can say is you are assuming things based on knowledge you do not possibly have at the moment. Live a day in a R* dev's shoes. See what they go through on a daily basis and when creating a new GTA game. See how many hours they have to put in, the pay
 rates, and the amount of work involved into a game and then come back and tell me you still won't accept the few glitches/bugs that are present. Like Stat said "it's code written by IMPERFECT humans, so there are [always] going to be flaws and mistakes". You
 can NEVER expect software to be FLAWLESS. That is like asking for world peace, which is a very, unlikely thing. If the software was made by computers or machines then it would be perfect and flawless, but because we are "imperfect humans" and are flawed we
 will ALWAYS make mistakes and a few flaws. Same with the computers we create; since they are created by flawed humans, that means that the computers themselves are flawed, in one way or another, as well, and that can also lead to mistakes in the coding or
 software.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Lastly, there are ALWAYS exploits around ANY type of software. 2011 PSN Hack. Sony believed it had done away with its system being hacked by fixing one of the "loaders." After the first one got hacked "metloader", Sony pooled all its security into the next
 loader called "bootloader" (place where LV0 encyption keys were held as well). The 2011 PSN Hack was showing how this new loader could also be hacked, but since Sony pooled all its security into bootloader, there are no layers left and now they must suffer
 until the new console comes out, Playstation 4.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I gave that example to show that companies aren't perfect but neither is the technology they use. Don't blame the company DIRECTLY for the problems in the software. There are other factors that can affect the INTEGRITY of the software/coding.</p>

<p><span>Hi
<span><span>walkook</span></span>,</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you make any software or hardware changes on your computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you get any error message/code when the CD/DVD rom stops working?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does the CD/DVD drive shows up in Windows Explorer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s try this:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Run the “Fix it” tool from this link:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Your CD drive or DVD drive is missing or is not recognized by Windows or other programs</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/314060" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/314060</span></span></span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If it doesn’t help, remove and reinstall the existing DVD/CD-ROM drivers. To do this, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span><br />
1. Click Start, and then click Control Panel.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click System and Security, click System, and then click Device Manager.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span>
 If Control Panel is in Classic View, double-click System, and then click Device Manager.</span></p>
<p><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow.</span></p>
<p><span>3. In Device Manager, expand DVD/CD-ROM drives, right-click the CD and DVD devices, and then click Uninstall.</span></p>
<p><span>When you are prompted to confirm that you want to remove the device, click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Restart the computer. After the computer restarts, the drivers will be automatically installed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope the information helps. Please post back and let us know.</span></p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To help you resolve the issue, kindly change the set the BIOS Non-Execute Memory Protection to Enable. If issue may persist, we suggest that you perform a startup repair from Windows Recovery. You may follow the steps provided in this

</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for your suggestion. However, I don't even know what this<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> BIOS Non-Execute Memory Protection
</span>means. And, when this problem occurs, mouse or any thing else is inoperable; only the blank screen with the logo of windows and the phrase at the bottom, " Automatic Repair Started". So, I am unable to do Windows Recovery, unless you please or somebody
 else can tell me how to do that. Now let me state the status now: After I waited for about 3 hours and nothing happened--PC froze, I &nbsp;disconnected all from the PC, disconnected power, and then reconnected power and pushed the power button to start the PC.
 Same outcome--phrase and logo. I then waited for about an hour and saw the following sentences on my screen:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Automatic Repair
</span>-- Your PC did not start correctly. ......Press Restart or Advanced Operation...</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I presses the Restart sign , and the computer started fine.&nbsp;Now, I am afraid of rebooting the PC, because I suspect the same problem will occur. This problem started, as I have mentioned earlier, after I replace Windows 7 by Windows 10. I am sorry to
 say that I am not vey happy with the Windows 10, If somebody can assist me, if possible, to go back to Windows 7, I will be highly obliged.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks for your supporting replies. I am sorry, I have not tried yet the last reply, because I am in the middle of using the PC for important work and I don't want to take a chance on that. As soon as I finish this work, I will try it. At present I put the
 PC to sleep for the night.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p><strong>Hi All, Im after some help trying to work out what is causing my Win7 Pc fall over a few times a night! Seems if i leave it for more than an hour i return to a BSOD!</strong></p>
<p>I get the following:-</p>
<p>The Windows Driver Framework has detected that a violation has occured.</p>
<p>Stop Code:-</p>
<p>0x0000010D (0x0000000000000005, 0x0000000000000000, 0x0000000000001401,0xfffffa8005902c80)</p>
<p>It creates a Minidump which i have idea how to read.</p>
<p>I read on another post that it seemed to be linked to their Firewire, I too use a Firewore Soundcard, Focusrite Saffire, Could it point to this?</p>
<p>My system is Windows 7 64bit Ultimate, running an Intel E8400 3ghz on an Asus P5Ke with 4gb Ram.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<h2>            I reset my pc then storage became half full. how come.</h2>
                    my brother gave me his computer. so i decided to reset it, take all the apps installed out from it and install new one that i prefer. also i wanted to sign in as in my account. then after resetting it, i signed in with my account, my last laptop and everything
 from it kinda show up in this comoputer. because the wallpaper is the same now and i went to `my computer` and it says 312 gb free from 900gb. i dont get it. not any new apps were installed or anything, how come my storage is half full? can someone plz help
 me. im thinking of deleting some files but it might affect how the computer works and i might blew it. so please anyone? thank you and have a good day.

            Hi Mark,
<div><br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</div>
<div><br />
I understand that your system memory is half full even after performing a System reset. I’ll certainly help you with this.</div>
<div><br />
Since, you have mentioned that you went to <strong>“My computer” </strong>to&nbsp;check the drive space,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>I would like to know if you have installed Windows 10 on your system. I’m asking this question because,
<strong>“My computer” is renamed as “This PC” in Windows 10.</strong></div>
<div><br />
To check which version of Windows is running on your computer, press <strong>Windows key + R</strong> to open
<strong>Run command </strong>and type <strong>winver </strong>and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.
<div><br />
I’ll proceed with Windows 10 troubleshooting steps. Please correct me if you have not installed Windows 10.</div>
<div><br />
Did you check <strong>Remove everything </strong>option while resetting the computer? It’s possible that you have selected the
<strong>Keep my files</strong> option while resetting. Hence, the old files are not deleted and consuming space on your drive.</div>
<div><br />
I would also suggest you to check if you are OneDrive account is downloading files on your computer.</div>
<div>
<p>

<h2>            Extremely High DPC Latency primarily occuring during gaming - HD Audio Bus, NVIDIA Kernal Mode Driver, DirectX Graphics Kernal</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hello,</span></p>
<p>I have read many, many of the forum posts over the past year or so that these issues have been going on. It seems that something fixes the issue, then it comes around again with a vengeance. These are the worst readings I've seen on any forum, and
 I think that was largely because I shut the game (StarCraft II) down the instant I noticed the spike on LatencyMon. Normally this issue causes complete lock up and/or straight crash. There's a framerate stutter and audio pops/clicks like many of the other
 posts on this forum and others. While this has more of a tendency to occur in Blizzard games, it occasionally happens with other games or just browsing the internet. The main culprits have been pretty consistent, but this last pull show a few more than expected
 with high latency. When this issue occurs, there is also a spike in System (as high as ~50%) and/or System Interrupts (as high as ~30%)CPU usage. The highest combined I've seen between the two was ~60% (40/20 system to interrupts).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I have been battling this issue on and off for a period of time, I have done many, many of the normal and abnormal fixes suggested. I have rooted around in the BIOS, ran system scans with no issues, changed Windows based settings, reinstalled
 windows 10, disabled each of the graphics cards individually to confirm it's not restricted to one, updated all drivers, disabled hardware in Device Manager, removed and installed video drivers, gone from stock to oc and back on CPU and Ram, etc., etc., etc.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>SPECS:</p>
<p>Mobo: Gigabyte Z170XP-SLI<br />
CPU: i5 6600K tested from 3.5-4.5 GHz at various levels<br />
GPU: 2x Galaxy GTX 660 SLI (as mentioned tested each individually as well as SLI)<br />
Ram: TeamElite Plus 16 GB DDR4 2400 (2x 8 GB)</p>
<p>OS: Windows 10 Pro Version 1607</p>

<p>
CONCLUSION<br />
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
Your system appears to be having trouble handling real-time audio and other tasks. You are likely to experience buffer underruns appearing as drop outs, clicks or pops. One or more DPC routines that belong to a driver running in your system appear to be executing
 for too long. Also one or more ISR routines that belong to a driver running in your system appear to be executing for too long. One problem may be related to power management, disable CPU throttling settings in Control Panel and BIOS setup. Check for BIOS
 updates.&nbsp;<br />
LatencyMon has been analyzing your system for &nbsp;0:16:50 &nbsp;(h:mm:ss) on all processors.<br />

&nbsp;REPORTED HARD PAGEFAULTS<br />
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________<br />
Hard pagefaults are events that get triggered by making use of virtual memory that is not resident in RAM but backed by a memory mapped file on disk. The process of resolving the hard pagefault requires reading in the memory from disk while the process is interrupted
 and blocked from execution.<br />
<br />
NOTE: some processes were hit by hard pagefaults. If these were programs producing audio, they are likely to interrupt the audio stream resulting in dropouts, clicks and pops. Check the Processes tab to see which programs were hit.<br />
