<h2>            Repairing disk errors. This may take over an hour to complete.</h2>
                    After my PC froze, I did a hard shut down by holding the power button. When I turned it back on, I was taken to the automatic repair screen, and then the repairing disk errors screen. The 1 hour then turned into 1 day. I tried to reinstall Windows with
 the installation media on a USB flash drive but it always says "Startup Repair couldn't repair your PC". System restore won't work, refresh PC won't work, not even reset PC will work. I have a Notebook Model HP Pavilion 15 Notebook PC.

<p>Hi DJ,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to corrupted system files. Since the recovery options did not work, suggest that you perform a Clean Install by following the instruction on this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">link</a></strong>. This has the download link to Media Creation Tool
 and all necessary information you need to know throughout the troubleshooting. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you need further assistance, feel free to let us know.</p>

            Will there be a way to backup my personal files? I have a couple of documents that I'd like to back up but the Recovery Wizard also doesn't work. It keeps giving me a FFFFFF0C error code.

<p>Hello DJThompson593,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You are unable to get to the Windows desktop....correct? &nbsp;And you are perpetually in Automatic Repair Options....right? &nbsp; The "Return to Windows 10" doesn't work....right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you get to the <strong>Command Prompt</strong> in WinRE aka Advanced Startup options? &nbsp;If you can get to the command prompt in WinRE, then perform a
<strong>chkdsk /f &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>from there<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Perform the &nbsp;CHKDSK /F order from the command prompt in WinRE! &nbsp;Do not add the R stipulation to the command &nbsp;at this point, just the CHKDSK /F. &nbsp;This will perform a degree of repair. &nbsp;If this completes successfully, you will be returned to the Windows desktop.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, at some later date, I would perform from an elevated command prompt the fuller function of &nbsp; CHKDSK /F /R &nbsp; &nbsp;This command takes five hours and fifteen minutes on my 2TB HDD but the "R" command goes through the entire HDD and repairs all clusters and
 corruption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Wayne</p>

    <title>Xbox One disc read error &#47; Noises - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One disc read error &#47; Noises</h2>
                    
<p><span>Hi there,</span></p>
<p><span>Previously, roughly a couple of months ago, I sent my xbox off to be replace/repaired due to a faulty disc drive that would require me to put a disc in from 2-30 times before
 it bothered to read this disc. This issue happened mainly with xbox one games but occasionally did it to dvds/bluray discs. It would also make a strange grind noise or clicky noise (sounds like the drive is jumping the disc or something like that). Anyway
 after much hassle of redownloading everything which costed me much time and money, despite having an external harddrive I had to redownload or update many of my games.<br />
<br />
Anyway this new replacement console was working 100% aside from the re-downloading of most my games. However a few weeks in I had my first instance where it wouldn’t read this disc, my gut jumped but worked on the second try. Progressively for a couple of months
 it has gotten worse with me being to putting a disc in a dozen times before it works or it makes weird noises.<br />
<br />
Where do I go from here? I really don’t want to send it off and then fork out another $100 on internet to redownload everything due to going over data usage (I know I can wait and download one at a time but I own the games and I shouldn’t have to wait months
 to play my games I have already bought and own). Even a free month xbox live like last time would be very little compensation when considering it made up for the 3-4weeks duration it took to replace in the first place. Any suggestions what to do? It's only
 a matter of time before I have to put a disc in 30 times with a 5 min hard reset, unplugging, etc. Just to get stuff to work.</span></p>

            <p>Sorry to hear that you're having this issue again. </p>
<p>Can you please try heading to Settings&gt;Disc &amp; Blu Ray and uncheck the box marked Enable BD Live then click on Clear Persistent Storage 3 times. &nbsp;Finally hold the power button on the console for 10 seconds until it shuts down.</p>
<p>If that doesn't fix the issue you may need to send it in again but there is a silver lining. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Get yourself an external hard drive. &nbsp;It must be USB 3.0 compatible and can range in size from 256GB - 16TB. &nbsp;Set it up on your console and move all of your games and DLC to it. &nbsp;That way when you get the replacement console all you need to do is plug in the new drive and you're off to gaming land again.</p>

<p>I might have to send it back again then, another 3 week wait over a holiday :/</p>
<p>That's the thing though, I have an external hard drive. It's a Seagate 2TB hard drive with usb 3.0, but most the games needed redownloading or updating because when I got it connected to the new console the games were running sluggish and sometimes asking
 for a disc despite some games being online downloaded. Some of these games included Tomb Raider definitive edition and fifa 14, in terms of disc based games I had to re-install titanfall, dead rising 3, watchdogs, ryse and assassins creed black flag, all of
 which needed updates, some big. Especially dead rising 3 with its 13gb update that I had to re download. Since my games have almost tripled in number since then I'm worried what will happen if I go down this road again.</p>

<p>A solution that works for me is to hold the disc for a split second while the console is trying to draw it in, and after the console starts to pull a little on the disc, let it take the disc. That has worked every time for me since last November.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p><strong>Maybe this can Help.</strong></p>
<p>Most Laptops have a physical switch for the Wireless card. Read the computer's manual and make sure that the Wireless card is On.</p>
<p>Check the Device Manager for valid Wireless card entry.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_dm.jpg</a></p>
<p>If there is No valid entry, delete any Bogus Entry, and re-install the Wireless card's Drivers.</p>
<p>Check the Network connections to make sure that you have a Wireless Network Connection Icon/Entry, and that the Properties of the Icon (right click on the Icon) are correctly configured with TCP/IPv4 protocol in the Network Connections Properties.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_connection_tcp.jpg</a><br />
<br />
<strong>Make sure that if there is a vendor's Wireless Utility the utility is Not Running together with the Windows native Wireless utility.</strong></p>
<p>Make sure that No Firewall is preventing/blocking the Wireless components to get to the Network.</p>
<p>If everything above is OK and it is not connecting to the Wireless router. Log from any computer that is, or can be connected to Wireless Router with a Wire, disable the Wireless Security, make sure that the Wireless broadcast is On, and try to connect with
 No Wireless security.</p>
<p><strong>When working turn On the Wireless security.</strong></p>
<p>Note* People sometimes make mistakes in writing and retyping the security passphrase.</p>
<p>Alternative way is to copy it from the Router's menu, and then paste when asked by the Wireless card.</p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>I really checked and configured every thing and it does Not work.</strong></p>
<p>Software Firewall application that is Not configured to allow local traffic (between the computer and the Router is a possible issue too.<br />
some 3rd party Software Firewalls keep blocking aspects of Local Traffic even it they are turned Off (disabled). If possible configure the Firewall correctly, or totally uninstall it to allow clean flow of local network traffic. If the 3rd party software is
 uninstalled or disables, make sure that Windows native Firewall is <strong>On </strong>

            Hi there Sukanyasinha! Unfortunately there is no word count in notepad, however if you are running Notepad++ you can see the word count by double-clicking on Status Bar (shortcut to View → Summary)
<br />View → Summary
<br />TextFX Tools → Word Count
<br />
<br />I hope I could be of assistance :)

<h2>            WLM Error message saying &#34;This message could not be sent</h2>
                    Why am I all of a sudden receiving an error message saying "This message could not be sent. Type an email address for one or more receipients..." I am using one of my categories within WLM on my Windows 7 based PC which has previously been working fine,
 but not as of this monring. Also, when I try to edit that category to see if anything is wrong, it comes up saying "offline" and no sign of the 50 email addresses that were in there for the past while?<br />
<br />
I checked online in the forum and all it told me was that I must have an error in the email addresses, but it was fine the day before.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try repairing your Windows Live Mail and see if still happens.</p>
<p>Follow these steps:</p>
<p>1. Click
Control Panel</span>.</p>
<p>2. Under <span style="font-weight: bold">Programs</span>, click
<p>3. Right-click on <span style="font-weight: bold">Windows Live Essentials</span> and select
<p>4. Click <span style="font-weight: bold">Repair all Windows Live programs</span>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like you to see if this also happens on the web mail to check if this is a Windows Live Mail issue or a browser issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I apprecaite your reply. It sounds like there are some "undocumented" features withing WLM, to think that one has to remove / reinstall it in order to get it working as it used to several months ago? Frankly, I was thinking, in that it used to work fine
 a few months ago, that the problem now exists due to some recent WLM update that might have occurred? if this is true, am I safer to simply try going back to prior Windows Restore point?<br />
<br />
That said, if I am to Unistall the program, in doing so, is there any chance that I would lose any of my exisiting folder categories/emails/email accounts as I can't afford to lose that functionality?<br />
<br />
BTW, the same, despite using my WLM on my PC and not the cloud, I did try this on the web itself and had the same problem.<br />
<br />
Looking forward to your reply.<br />

<p>Have you printed out address labels without a problem in the past with the same number of lines.&nbsp; Consider this point, address labels (Avery) have a template that defines the<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">allowable</span> print spacing.&nbsp; "Text size"
 determines the number of lines.&nbsp; Try printing with a smaller text size.</p>
<p>An example:</p>
<p>Using MS Office Word 2007, you can import the Avery label add-on. This addition imports all the Avery templates. The 8160 template (1.0 x 2.675)&nbsp;is an excellent address label format. It allows Arial font, 12-14pts text, with 3 lines. But the address label
 8167 (1.0 x 1.75)&nbsp;with 3 lines will only allow 6pts text.</p>

            Not printed labels before. Have tried using a smaller font, which was better but the top line was too close to the top of the label. Tried hitting enter to move the text down, but then the bottom half of bottom line vanished again.

<p>This is more a label size problem. As I said above, templates make creating labels easier. Then you are able to preview and make changes. Which label size are you trying, and how many lines. Again, my example is exact for the label # and the pts size.</p>
<p>PS&gt; I routinely use MS Office Word 2007,&nbsp;with the&nbsp;Avery label add-on for 6 different label sizes, churning out 100's.</p>

            <p>Hi Flamadidle,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forums.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the description, it appears that you are getting an error message "BSoD; STOP: c0000s1a, status of 0x00000000 (0xc0000001 0x001003a8)". I will be happy to help you with this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Have you made any changes on the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If you are able to boot, I would suggest you to upload the

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">c. Reboot the computer.<br />

If this fixes your problem, enable to hardware devices one at time to find the exact device causing this problem. After you found the device that causing the problem you can resolve by installing latest driver or replacing the device.</span></p>

<p>I would also suggest you to follow the steps from the link and check if it helps.</p>

<h2>            Removing XP Mode from Windows 10 Pro</h2>
                    <p>Having upgraded from Window 7 Pro with Windows Virtual PC-XP Mode to Windows 10 Professional I have been left with a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
I have been unable to remove any references to the programs used within XP Mode which now appear in the apps listing in the Windows 10 Start page - They all have uninstall options which do not function (of course!)</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
Anyone got any clues?</p>

<li>Select the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Start</strong>&nbsp;<span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span>button, then select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Settings&nbsp;</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>&gt;<strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Update &amp; security<span>&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</strong>&gt;<strong><span>&nbsp;</span>Windows

<p>BUT on the Advanced options page there IS NO View Your Update History option to click on! &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now on https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/windows-10-view-update-history/1fd53e7d-2dea-4f40-bfdd-fe2459350675 while in the 2015 responses posted it indicates the same steps but the Sept 10, 2017 post by Bernard Corrigan
 indicates what I indicated above that there is no View Your Update History option to click on.&nbsp; This isn't the first and only instance of seeking help for other issues that such guidance fails to yield accurate steps to follow or get a solution. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So why can't MS supporters verify that their answers actually work for the versions being responded to?&nbsp; I used to provide documentation and the details matter - you're wasting people's time and causing frustration for people who have turned to MS (the Community?)
 and the steps don't solve the problem and now users have to go searching for other responses that also give the same type of NON-answers that don't provide accurate steps or solutions. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As big as MS is and for all the time spent on creating features and updates that have bugs galore, why can't they invest the time to create ACCURATE steps and views of what they're telling users to follow to solve or get information about MS Windows / Products.&nbsp;
 Quality is ensuring both that the products work as well as making sure the documentation is ACCURATE whether it's the USERS GUIDE, or Support Help, etc. &nbsp; Yes, things change, unfortunately, but when posting answers, MAKE SURE the answers are current and not
 steps you used to do but probably don't now as one or more options, steps or views don't exist (or are hidden...) anymore.&nbsp; This applies to even ordinary users who try to be helpful because they ONCE upon a time used the steps they're going to now provide
 and assume the steps can still be followed to the view or solution you achieved. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you look at the bug history of MS Windows and Products it's staggering.&nbsp; No wonder there's so many security issues and just plain failures of applications and features.&nbsp; It's not all MS issues - vendors are and have the same lack of quality, attention
 to details and testing before releasing (unleashing!) their $#(*&amp;-$ (actual characters, not a curse word).&nbsp; I now only use Windows for the mere fraction of what it's supposed to be able to do and provide since it's so buggy and dissatisfying to use.&nbsp; You can't
 get MS support without paying for it but you've paid for the program and products which they SHOULD absolutely make sure all the products work without the bugs and issues and security flaws before they inject more features and improvements(?) that will perpetuate
 the lack of quality and bug issues ad infinitum...all I can say is I HATE MS, I despise MS and there's no real hope for MS to end their cycle of poor quality and endless updates that never get it right.&nbsp; Well, that's my rant and my question.&nbsp; Even simple things
 plague MS Windows and Products for which solutions are in the same category of poor quality and lack of accuracy leaving users unable to get good resolutions to be able to use their devices the way they should be able to and cursing MS for the (*#&amp;$@W issues
 they keep running into!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aww, what's the point, like I said, look at the absolutely, never ending updates of bug fixes (with features releases - always generating more bug issues) history and you have to wonder - how many screw-ups does it take to change a lightbulb or a MS function?&nbsp;
 Just one, multiplied by the number of MS employees that exist...and there's still no accurate answer to those posters of this very simple function of how to view the Windows updates on your computer.</p>

<p>Sorry Cass, but you missed the whole point - please re-read the topic question and the very first sentence in the diatribe that I posted. &nbsp;Also take note of the words right after the first sentence, "For example", is meant to show just ONE of the seemingly
 infinite failures of MS to provide steps that accurately show the words, commands, actions, tabs, figures, etc., that a user will try to follow the advice or answers of solutions given to remedy an issue that they are experiencing. &nbsp;Your response indicating
 that I could LEARN more by clicking on the link for learning more about updates is so far off base about the issue that I posted. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue reflects the entire spectrum of ALL aspects of MS Windows (and indeed - all MS products) of poorly reviewed answers given as steps and solutions for users to follow.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm questioning whether you actually comprehend what you read since the very topic and (again) the first sentence doesn't refer to an issue about updates. &nbsp;It's sad to me how some people seem to gloss over what they're reading and go off on some tangent
 instead of recognizing and understanding what was actually written.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you not comprehend that in the second paragraph of my posting where I referenced "<span>&nbsp;that there is no View Your Update History option to click on" as reported by another poster who had tried to follow the steps (which
 again, for your understanding - had been referred to at the onset as AN EXAMPLE of my topic) provided as a solution for the problem by an MS community poster who failed to ensure that the steps, paths, links, etc., being provided were in fact accurate and
 current for the system, environment, etc., being asked about.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
I've clicked on and read so many LEARN MORE links and read responses offered as solutions given by MS on their support pages and those on the MS Community that so often UTTERLY FAIL to provide accurate and comprehensive steps to follow in their given instructions.
 &nbsp;Yes, some of the providers offering solution responses to users with problems do a very good job of following up to help as it's not easy to always get succinct info from users about the system, software and symptoms needed to help clarify the exact problem
 encountered.&nbsp; However, I've often seen experienced MS Community posters do the same thing you did here - fail to absorb and comprehend what was posted and give an unrelated response to their cry for assistance.</span></p>

<p>Yep Steve, that's quite a rant and fairly well describes&nbsp;one key problem with the idea of Windows_as_a _Service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had returned to the original thread you&nbsp;mentioned above, you'd have discovered a follow-up post responding to both a later poster with the same question as well as Bernard.&nbsp; This explained that the inaccurate information was due to a change in the
 Windows 10 interface which replaced the earlier Advanced options step with direct access to the Update history selection item.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also please note that responses within that thread were completely accurate as of the time those posts were originally made in 2015, since as the most recent post mentions, this particular change occurred in the Windows 10 Creators update first released&nbsp;in
 April 2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your complaints are technically valid, but not truly useful in either the environment or situation that these forums and Windows 10 currently exist.&nbsp; That's due to the fact that these are Community forums, which means that most responses are by other consumer
 users rather than Microsoft employees and even those tagged as such are primarily outsourced contract workers, often providing canned responses or links to previous responses within the forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other extenuating circumstance is the Windows 10 servicing model, since unlike past versions, this leads to a quickly changing product that operates more like a set of fast cycle updates similar to a beta.&nbsp; Though the multi-tier approach (deployment
 rings)&nbsp;tries to reduce the quantity and severity of any errors, it isn't always successful and so some problems do get through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the most important thing I believe you've missed is that the primary purpose of Windows 10 is to remove much of the excess legacy code that's built up over the years and also simplify and harmonize the display and operation of Windows across all
 of the physical platforms it now supports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a huge challenge and as such will clearly result in some rough spots along the way, but by moving the entire Windows 10 ecosystem quickly and in close synchronization, this provides the 3rd-party vendors with a relatively consistent set of platforms
 over which to simplify and improve their own software as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So though the problem of outdated documentation is somewhat inherent with the Windows 10 servicing model, the improvements in consistency and simplicity of the core code are making the support for both Microsoft and it's 3rd-party partners easier as time
 goes on.&nbsp; This also reduces overhead and so&nbsp;improves performance, stability&nbsp;and power consumption&nbsp;for both older PC&nbsp;and newer mobile&nbsp;hardware, as well as improving security over time as much of the worst and most vulnerable&nbsp;legacy code is eventually removed
 completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though the direction Microsoft is taking may not be clear to everyone, the reality is that what they're doing is stripping Windows down to its roots and rebuilding it in place, all while retaining operation for both customers and partners on both their existing
 hardware and the newer streamlined high-efficiency devices that younger users want.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm personally impressed that there haven't been bigger problems than we've seen and the security improvements this has provided are evident in the generally reduced malware
 issues we're seeing in these forums.</p>

<p>You are quite correct Rob in that MS Windows is always improving or trying to anyways and it is a massive fragmented environment when you include the wide mix of vendors and non-oem equipment that different chip microcode architecture, different OSes, different
 components, and expanding standards into an open environment of competing sources.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the issues as you relate is the legacy of backwards compatibility and MS's efforts to reduce Win 10 to a more bare bone platform. &nbsp;I understand that and it is a good direction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue of changes (due to all sorts of aspects - updates, fixes, competition) leading to obsolescence of documentation, posted solutions or guidance, in my opinion is in part a failure to anticipate such things as future usage, features/options, scale-ability,
 human disabilities, and technological advancement in knowledge and materials. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That being said, the obvious rebuttal is who (or what organization) is omnipotent enough to foresee and create a product that can grow with changing wants and needs to not have changes that will be obsolete regarding it's previous versions of connections,
 operations, documentation, etc. &nbsp;Unfortunately, while it can't be avoided completely, to greatly reduce the backward compatibility and obsolescence issues requires that much more thought be given to development of a product to address those factors of future
 changes. &nbsp;For example, take the old standard keyboard using qwerty. A rather simple implementation for interfacing with the old mainframes and PCs. &nbsp;There were a lot of issues and changes to that device that were in large part due to the ANSI standard first
 introduced which I and others often found lacking in forethought that lead to limitations that quite frankly could have been avoided to a large degree with a mindset that would have wondered about what kind of limitations, future needs / desires, disabilities,
 components and environments might develop over time. &nbsp;One of the factors in looking ahead is that many people (apart from a DIY inventor who might have and envision such forethought's about their pursuits )&nbsp;are mentally stuck looking at primarily the current
 situation and available resources along with the push to get their product to market ahead of possible competitors that just getting the project milestones done (and ahead of time!) don't allow for much thoughts apart from perhaps a passing thought or mention
 that is usually quickly dismissed as undo-able, not viable, not, not, not at this point in time, etc. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I've always had, probably just like you and countless others, problems in using devices, documentation and limitations of products not only in the designed aspects of the product but then you get the BUGS that are essentially due to human mistakes, logic
 errors, lack of quality testing and analysis, etc., that lead to the inaccurate user's guide documentation and the need to fix / update which brings me right back to my complaint about quality and accuracy that is exasperated by the changes and revisions that
 often aren't documented properly even when done by the programmers or engineers that made the changes. &nbsp;I have often run into current solution documentation for current fixes that weren't accurate in showing the proper steps, illustrations, etc., for the issue
 and wasn't due to as being obsolete or older releases. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I once did beta testing for a software product our company was interested in buying that was in its 8th revision. &nbsp;I installed and tested it and there were so many BUGS of large and small issues that I wound up writing over eight pages on legal size paper
 identifying for the vendor issues that THEY SHOULD HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES and should have found most in the first or second release which indicates how little quality testing went on and this was for a pretty established software company.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, Rob, I appreciate your thoughts and response from my rant and you have several good points and opinions about this subject. &nbsp;Have a great week.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes Steve, I understand your frustration with inaccurate&nbsp;documentation and the confusion that often exists when using devices, but then I think that's the entire point as to why Microsoft needed to produce Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I say this because what I noticed during my career supporting computing systems, much of it as a network manager or administrator supporting Windows clients, is that the best place for&nbsp;most documentation is within the system itself.&nbsp; Designing this into
 the embedded help and other systems not only avoids the issue of documentation that's out of sync with the version being used, but it also allows developers to document any changes as they occur, rather than the more traditional method of producing this separately
 after the fact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Within Windows 10 this implies using Cortana, since even&nbsp;its basic text mode quite simply resolves this problem.&nbsp; For example, typing "update history" in the Cortana search dialog brings up a list, which may not always contain a perfect match, but often
 includes the item within the list below and takes you directly to the desired screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently typing this on a Windows 8.1 laptop, that when I initially started using it had caused me much grief similar to your own discussion here, primarily due to the fact that the new GUI had dropped the familiar Start menus in an attempt to make
 it more touch friendly.&nbsp; However, after a few days or so, I finally tried using the search and found that I could simply start typing what I wanted on the Start screen and usually within the first few letters the&nbsp;item I wanted was at the top of the selection
 list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously many never figured this out and so Windows 8 failed to catch on, mostly due to the fact that lots of legacy menus and selections were buried deep in the layered interfaces that had developed over time, since each successive set of abilities typically
 got patched onto the existing with its own interface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This mess is what Windows 10 has instead tried to not only simplify and harmonize for different device interfaces like touch, but also for consistency in the interface structure itself, using the more naturally organized drill-down menus and attempting to
 place selections within the most appropriate locations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your specific case, the initial placement of update history within the Advanced Options menu wasn't an obvious choice, since this buried it within a menu that at least now contains several other settings relating to optional update components.&nbsp; However,
 by moving the Advanced options selection into a group of Update settings further down the screen and leaving the Update history selection immediately below the Check for updates button, the association is actually much more appropriate and obvious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My point here is that though this was a lot of change in a relatively short time, the eventual solution is far more sensible&nbsp;and so likely to be found easily, especially by anyone not already familiar with the past interface(s) like young or otherwise new
 users of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So though as I mentioned above, I understand the frustration that all of this seemingly radical change is causing long-term users of Windows, the point is to create a simplified and improved interface for all users, new and old, with a consistent&nbsp;structure
 that's scalable and useable on all of the physical hardware&nbsp;platforms and with all of the various input devices that Windows now supports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a final thought, I'll risk offending you to point out that the problem here is actually that&nbsp;older users like ourselves, who don't particularly like change, are often fighting the new interface rather than forgetting the old ways and opening our minds
 to learn the new method and locations where the otherwise mostly familiar functions of Windows can now be found.&nbsp; This is&nbsp;the core discovery I made for myself with Windows 8.x, finding that once I stopped trying to directly translate the Start menu selections
 of the past and instead used the more advanced functions of the new system, its operation became much easier to learn.</p>

<p>Hi there Rob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nope, I'm not offended at all. &nbsp;I understand what you're saying and I would not find fault with the effort that MS with Win 10 to make it easier to find something (apps, help, info, guidance, etc) and embedding it into the system(s) so that it isn't a separate
 effort to retrieve it (whether it be in a file cabinet, database, hard drive, server, a librarian, a community...)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm all for attacking a fragmented system that may or may not have been that way until it had to be updated or changed to fit the changing needs of the business or using population so that it doesn't stay fragmented and filled with obsolete aspects that
 are like forgotten orphans. &nbsp;These may even be still accessed by those that are resistant to change if the resource isn't removed so that all must adapt so there isn't a need to update multiple resources by those responsible for implementing changes and updates.
 &nbsp; With employee turnover, the people that were responsible for maintaining and have the historical knowledge of those older resources may no longer be there when a replacement employee may only be aware of the latest and more widely used process leading to
 the problems that occur when the older resources are overlooked when an update / change maintenance occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like you, I've been in various IT / IS positions, ranging from programmer, analyst, tech support, system librarian, database administrator, &nbsp;document writer (ISO certification, in-house training courses, daily job checklists, SOP checklists, programmer documentation
 templates, emergency recovery procedures and contacts list, and OMG, too many others - I was extremely anal about providing abbreviated and expanded references to ensure everyone, including stand-ins for when the responsible personnel were absent for whatever
 reason that someone could step in to those processes that could be accomplished by fairly intelligent people who could read guidance that even identified the typical results they should expect and errors and how to react to recover or stop and escalate...).
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I worked in a wide variety of companies as I progressed in IT and IS positions and became a system administrator with one of the nation's top defense firm (which despite their immense investment and hiring of highly certified Six Sigma colored belt personnel,
 I was often dismayed by the lack of quality and attention to detail in their results) and also as an IT / IS manager for a large national alcohol distributor. &nbsp;I had been in the military as an Avionics repair tech, where documentation was extremely detailed
 and spanned several levels from the basic, intermediate, and expert versions which had requirements to be reviewed on required periods to update and remove obsolete references. &nbsp; I was assigned an additional responsibility to bring my unit's library up to
 code since it had failed an inspection several times overseas when staffing turnover and deployments resulted in it not having been maintained for way too many periods and was quite out dated and a genuine mess. &nbsp;Which is another example of how quality and
 accuracy is put on the back burner when staffing doesn't allow for the niceties(?) to be given the time to be accomplished.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, as you indicate, Win 10 is a major effort to improve from the legacy mess - and I'm not an anti-change type. In my positions and encounters, I've witnessed, even in those major organizations and companies that have dedicated departments and assigned
 personnel&nbsp;to provide the support services to ensure quality across the board, it always falls back to the level of thoroughness by the individuals (and teams) as to the outcome of how well something turns out. I've known some very intelligent and accomplished
 individuals that just cannot be thorough and detailed - something that is a limited abiility in many people. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe this is because knowledge of processes consisting of multiple steps becomes ingrained / condensed so that the multiple steps or actions involved of going from A to B to C to D to E...Z simply becomes "A,E" or just "A" &nbsp;to them. As a result when
 tasked with breaking down their knowledge to relate those important details to others, imparting it either verbally or documenting it, the process / steps of their knowledge to others, they overlook those individual elements / items since their brain has automatically
 coalesed it into a single reference item. &nbsp;It has become a simple step,"A", in their mind. &nbsp;We all do this and once well learned, it can take a lot to separate and see those separate elements that exist inbetween which are steps "B to C to D to...Y" when required
 to pass or break down that intimate detail knowledge as a sequence of discrete elements. &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>This is a problems when people try to provide detailed answers or guidance of a process since the many steps are stored much like a compressed file or a Japanese character - the condensed knowledge is now just an abbreviated symbol or acronym that they access
 when performing said process and is automatically executed by them without concious recognition of each progressive step. &nbsp;I've often noted how when others try to instruct users what they need to do to carry out some process or task, I would often hear the
 users complain to me or others that all the steps in between the steps provided weren't communicated to them leaving them frustrated. &nbsp;This oftens affects many of the steps that were communicated where what the trainer or teacher just reports as a short list
 of steps but are actually a much longer list of steps that waere left out since each of the "A" steps they possess is a condensed list in their mind that they are prone to fail to extract them all to some degree.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While the embedded documentation system that Win 10 has implemented is a great approach, it will be subject to this very issue where in order to impart all the necessary information, it requires the documentor to decompress the compiled step(s) that they
 possess and see as a single step or a short series of steps, is actually many more steps that needs to be provided. &nbsp;To extract these steps requires them to behave like a proof reader would and focus to recall what each element represents in each of their
 integrated step "A". &nbsp; That's why document writers really need to have a novice review what they have written for clarity, understanding and even have that person try to carry out steps to determine it's accurate and not missing steps or additional clarification.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for running on like that, I've always invested too much "sharing" that I should recognize as demonstrating that I'm a real blowhard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a great weekend - it's college football and Michigan is facing Purdue and Michigan State is taking on Notre Dame - let's see how many STEPS it takes them to complete a drive and score enough points to win!</p>

<p>Well, Cass, yes, I do like to complain - especially when I see substandard quality...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly, when I wrote this RANT, I wasn't asking for a specific help response as you seem to think.&nbsp; Again, it was, simply stated in the first word of the topic title and in the first paragraph,&nbsp; "WHY..." which is asking for an explanation - not a presentation
 of a specific request for technical help of a bug problem.&nbsp; You should also have noted that the rest of the sentence related to documentation issues overall.&nbsp; Your response that assumed the "For Example" issue that I presented was what I was asking for help
 in this topic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have in the past read the white papers that MS produced for updates and then would read the links to their support and guidance pages on how to resolve noted issues that their updates were supposed to resolve and surprise failed in both - the update and
 the guidance provided, which often included inaccurate steps or steps that weren't available as had been indicated are issues that drove me to despise MS more and more for the terrible design and never ending bug filled releases and the buggy / inaccurate
 documentation provided to resolve those issues...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You keep responding, saying that you've provided the link for me to find the answer to the issue saying that I should have clicked on it, and voila, I'd have detailed info on the issue.&nbsp; Frankly, when I had looked for the info on the issue, I looked at a
 lot (A LOT) of responses and at just what point, especially when I see another, much earlier prior poster indicating that the RESPONSES to others about the issue were given various inaccurate guidance or references AND THAT THE STEP TO PERFORM, WASN'T AVAILABLE
 TO CLICK ON.&nbsp; Well - at what point of reading continuous posts of inaccurate responses and LINKS that I followed, do I have to keep reading, reading, and reading and trying, trying, ... and not having success in finding accurate steps, etc., that will perform
 or aren't available in the sequence where they were indicated carry out a step?&nbsp; AND why doesn't MS directly take on the responsibility in directly responding to the issues of users to resolve these bugs to using MS products instead of palming it off to a
 community?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My post was a catchall of what I and I'm sure, so many others have encountered and been frustrated with regarding MS Windows and their other applications.&nbsp; I was a programmer, tech support, EDI admin, system librarian, documentation writer, system admin,
 IT / IS manager in a variety of environments, systems and OSs, and my complaints about MS can easily apply to the entire spectrum of hardware and software vendors - quality and accuracy of products takes a back seat to rush to market and the whole concept
 of having to pay for continuous annual support to fix the BUGS, get updates and new releases with ohhhh, new features (also not quality tested as the future versions will indicate the bug fixes for each release.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>While requests by users of all types for help to find a solution to issues of such bugs in MS Windows / appls, for particular build releases and versions have been always hampered by backwards compatibility, it's in the "MOMENT" releases of updates and the
 likes, when new bugs are encountered and answers sought that a community (novices, experienced users, hacks, and MS proficient users / employees(?) who can all contribute and respond to try to help -&nbsp; the issue of quality and accuracy by MS in the first and
 last place is the root of the problem and then exasperated by the backward compatibility issue since it can lead to answer responses that are based on info, links, clicks, etc., that aren't where they were in the older version/release and for those that try
 to follow the request, well, FRUSTRATION, since they try to follow the advice and it dead-ends and they have to post and read more posts looking for an answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen this as well as current answers that aren't documented accurately, in fact, perhaps you'll recall the below response to a user that indicates that for accuracy, a reply should always be reviewed for accuracy, completeness and I dare say, maybe,
 just maybe, attempting to verify that the steps provided are relevant for the version presented by the seeker (assuming the responder has access to the same) and isn't based on an older and likely changed, redelegated elsewhere not easily found or reworded,
 removed, hidden, etc.</p>

<div>
<div>
<div>try this:</div>
<div>Open your all apps menu by clicking on the windows logo and selecting the icon third down from the top. Scroll down until you see Windows System and click on it.</div>
<div>Right click Command Prompt. Click Open as Administrator.</div>
<div>Wups! Forgot a step! Select "More" THEN right click Open as Administrator</div>
<div>SORRY!</div>
<div>I'll get this right if it KILLS me. The problem is I just DO it I don't think about the steps. Like riding a bicycle, you know.</div>
<div>ps:&nbsp; if this doesn't work you may have a corrupted windows installation and since you cannot open command prompt you may need to reinstall windows altogether.</div>
<p>
</p><p>And that's another aspect of accuracy - the responder knows the steps, etc., for what and how to do something but when providing guidance, can easily leave out steps inbetween A and Z.&nbsp; This isn't the type of issue I take as a fault per se, since that's
 a normal part of compiled memory in human beings.&nbsp; No, the fault again, is that MS (and others) that create a product fail to quality bullet proof it, document it (how many times have you read documentation or instructions that weren't accurate or complete?)
 and support it so that the product sold works as it should and not have to be neverendingly fixed, updated and patched and demand support money to fix the damn product that was purchased and then demand annual support for the product as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, if you care to respond to the issue that a more careful reading on your part should, OMG, reveal, then I'd be interested in such dialog but NOT in trying to reiterate the herring you seem to have interpreted as the topic of my ire.</p>

</p><blockquote>
<p>Yep Steve, that's quite a rant and fairly well describes&nbsp;one key problem with the idea of Windows_as_a _Service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you had returned to the original thread you&nbsp;mentioned above, you'd have discovered a follow-up post responding to both a later poster with the same question as well as Bernard.&nbsp; This explained that the inaccurate information was due to a change in the
 Windows 10 interface which replaced the earlier Advanced options step with direct access to the Update history selection item.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also please note that responses within that thread were completely accurate as of the time those posts were originally made in 2015, since as the most recent post mentions, this particular change occurred in the Windows 10 Creators update first released&nbsp;in
 April 2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your complaints are technically valid, but not truly useful in either the environment or situation that these forums and Windows 10 currently exist.&nbsp; That's due to the fact that these are Community forums, which means that most responses are by other consumer
 users rather than Microsoft employees and even those tagged as such are primarily outsourced contract workers, often providing canned responses or links to previous responses within the forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other extenuating circumstance is the Windows 10 servicing model, since unlike past versions, this leads to a quickly changing product that operates more like a set of fast cycle updates similar to a beta.&nbsp; Though the multi-tier approach (deployment
 rings)&nbsp;tries to reduce the quantity and severity of any errors, it isn't always successful and so some problems do get through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the most important thing I believe you've missed is that the primary purpose of Windows 10 is to remove much of the excess legacy code that's built up over the years and also simplify and harmonize the display and operation of Windows across all
 of the physical platforms it now supports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a huge challenge and as such will clearly result in some rough spots along the way, but by moving the entire Windows 10 ecosystem quickly and in close synchronization, this provides the 3rd-party vendors with a relatively consistent set of platforms
 over which to simplify and improve their own software as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So though the problem of outdated documentation is somewhat inherent with the Windows 10 servicing model, the improvements in consistency and simplicity of the core code are making the support for both Microsoft and it's 3rd-party partners easier as time
 goes on.&nbsp; This also reduces overhead and so&nbsp;improves performance, stability&nbsp;and power consumption&nbsp;for both older PC&nbsp;and newer mobile&nbsp;hardware, as well as improving security over time as much of the worst and most vulnerable&nbsp;legacy code is eventually removed
 completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though the direction Microsoft is taking may not be clear to everyone, the reality is that what they're doing is stripping Windows down to its roots and rebuilding it in place, all while retaining operation for both customers and partners on both their existing
 hardware and the newer streamlined high-efficiency devices that younger users want.&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm personally impressed that there haven't been bigger problems than we've seen and the security improvements this has provided are evident in the generally reduced malware
 issues we're seeing in these forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rob</p>

<p>I'm not so prepared to give MS a pass on this. They have the ability to ensure formal procedures are followed to ensure the documentation (all of it) is updated before the changes are released. That's what the rest of us do, so why doesn't MS? They talk
 the talk, I expect them to walk the walk!</p>

</p><blockquote>
<p>Yes Steve, I understand your frustration with inaccurate&nbsp;documentation and the confusion that often exists when using devices, but then I think that's the entire point as to why Microsoft needed to produce Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I say this because what I noticed during my career supporting computing systems, much of it as a network manager or administrator supporting Windows clients, is that the best place for&nbsp;most documentation is within the system itself.&nbsp; Designing this into
 the embedded help and other systems not only avoids the issue of documentation that's out of sync with the version being used, but it also allows developers to document any changes as they occur, rather than the more traditional method of producing this separately
 after the fact.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Within Windows 10 this implies using Cortana, since even&nbsp;its basic text mode quite simply resolves this problem.&nbsp; For example, typing "update history" in the Cortana search dialog brings up a list, which may not always contain a perfect match, but often
 includes the item within the list below and takes you directly to the desired screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm currently typing this on a Windows 8.1 laptop, that when I initially started using it had caused me much grief similar to your own discussion here, primarily due to the fact that the new GUI had dropped the familiar Start menus in an attempt to make
 it more touch friendly.&nbsp; However, after a few days or so, I finally tried using the search and found that I could simply start typing what I wanted on the Start screen and usually within the first few letters the&nbsp;item I wanted was at the top of the selection
 list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously many never figured this out and so Windows 8 failed to catch on, mostly due to the fact that lots of legacy menus and selections were buried deep in the layered interfaces that had developed over time, since each successive set of abilities typically
 got patched onto the existing with its own interface.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This mess is what Windows 10 has instead tried to not only simplify and harmonize for different device interfaces like touch, but also for consistency in the interface structure itself, using the more naturally organized drill-down menus and attempting to
 place selections within the most appropriate locations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your specific case, the initial placement of update history within the Advanced Options menu wasn't an obvious choice, since this buried it within a menu that at least now contains several other settings relating to optional update components.&nbsp; However,
 by moving the Advanced options selection into a group of Update settings further down the screen and leaving the Update history selection immediately below the Check for updates button, the association is actually much more appropriate and obvious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My point here is that though this was a lot of change in a relatively short time, the eventual solution is far more sensible&nbsp;and so likely to be found easily, especially by anyone not already familiar with the past interface(s) like young or otherwise new
 users of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So though as I mentioned above, I understand the frustration that all of this seemingly radical change is causing long-term users of Windows, the point is to create a simplified and improved interface for all users, new and old, with a consistent&nbsp;structure
 that's scalable and useable on all of the physical hardware&nbsp;platforms and with all of the various input devices that Windows now supports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a final thought, I'll risk offending you to point out that the problem here is actually that&nbsp;older users like ourselves, who don't particularly like change, are often fighting the new interface rather than forgetting the old ways and opening our minds
 to learn the new method and locations where the otherwise mostly familiar functions of Windows can now be found.&nbsp; This is&nbsp;the core discovery I made for myself with Windows 8.x, finding that once I stopped trying to directly translate the Start menu selections
 of the past and instead used the more advanced functions of the new system, its operation became much easier to learn.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rob</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I really don't get the reason for simplifying the interface. I am all for change but making things take more steps is not an improvement. Neither is removing the ability to copy text from apps using the new paradigm. Or trying to stop people organizing the
 start menu/screen as they want....</p>
<p>
</p><p>They need to make Windows work on all devices, but the way is not to dumb it down for all, but to build interfaces that makes full use of the device your using. Things that are hard to do with a touch interface or a small screen should not be removed for
 everyone. That just makes us feel like we're being punished for wanting to do things that are more complex than the average person.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS have supported us in this in the past, so why change now? "It's hard" isn't a reason for anything, and it's pretty lame given the way MS present themselves as a company. I expect businesses to live up to their hype.</p>

<h2>            USB&#47;Centronics parallel Printer crashes system with system_thread_exception_not_handled&#40;usbprint.sys&#41;</h2>
                    I have a fresh install of Windows 8 Pro.<br />
<br />
When I connect a USB/Centronics parallel printer cable I immediately receive the error system_thread_exception_not_handled(usbprint.sys).<br />
<br />
The system halts and restarts.<br />
<br />
In 2 cases the system would not restart and went into recovery mode.<br />
<br />
In one case the system had to be restored from a previous image and backup.<br />
<br />
<p>My System has an AMDFX8120 8 core processor, 32G memory, 2x 2TB SATA Hard Drives, 1 Western Digital, 1 Seagate and&nbsp;a 3TB USB 3 Seagate drive. Motherboard is MSI 970A-G45 (MS-7693) with all BIOS and driver patches up to date. Graphics card is GIGABYTE GeForce
 210 (nVIDIA GeForce 210 (GT218)). DVD is LG GSA-4163B with an IDE/SATA adapter fitted.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Things I have tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>Removing and reinstalling usbprint.sys. -- Receive same error.</li><li>Plug cable into USB slot on front of PC -- Receive same error.</li><li>Plug cable into rear usb2 slot on motherboard -- Receive same error.</li><li>Plug into USB3 slot on motherboard -- Receive same error.</li><li>Plug into NEC/PCI Usb 2 slot -- Receive same error.</li></ul>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have tried each of the above with cable only and no printer attached. <br />
</p>
<p>I have tried each of the above with cable attached to 2 different HP Deskjet 350 printers.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In all cases as soon as I plug the usb cable in the error occurs.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I welcome any suggestions to help me debug this error as I really like the Deskjet 350 printers.</p>
<p><br />

<p><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65</a></p>
<p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.<br />

<h3> nick harmer  say:</h3>
<h2>            StorageDevicePolicies and UASP</h2>
                    <p>Why do versions of Windows above 8.0 not respect the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\StorageDevicePolicies\WriteProtect registry entry for devices which use the USB-Attached-SCSI driver?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When connecting a SATA drive through an ASMT 2115 adapter, I only get write-blocking if I connect it through a hub (the Device Instance Path starts
<strong>USBSTOR\\</strong>).&nbsp; If I connect the same drive through the same adapter directly to a port on the motherboard, it doesn't write-block (the Device Instance Path starts
<strong>SCSI\\</strong>).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way to work around this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, why does it not work the same for both drivers?</p>
<p>

<h3> masterman_777  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Server 2003 R2 SP2 - When users attempt to browse a certain folder, they are unable to view files.</h2>
                    Hello, I have Windows server 2003 R2 SP2 Installed in my Environment and I have promoted it as a File Server. I have created some share folders and given access to the respected Users &amp; Groups. Everything related to access is working fine but when the
 Users try to access the shared folder Location (E.g.: 
\\Servername\) they can see the list of shared folders, although they don’t have the access to use other shared folders and while accessing other folders the Users get Access is Denied. The problem is that I want to hide all the Shared folders so that only
 the person who has the access to the respected folders can see his folder. I found an Article called ABE (Access Based Enumeration), so I have downloaded that tool and deployed in my environment and have enabled the ABE on a particular folder but still all
 the Users are able to View those list of shared folders. Kindly need your help in solving this problem.

<h3> joeysundberg  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sorting My Pictures folders in Photo Gallery &#40;and Library&#41;</h2>
                    I want to sort my folders by date but with newest to oldest. I have looked all over and cannot figure out a way to do this. Whether in Windows Live Photo Gallery or from my "Explorer" window, my oldest picture folders always come up first and I have to
 scroll to the bottom of the list. So for example, I now have to scroll through 4 years worth of picture folders to get to the folder from today.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
PS Any suggestion on how to get rid of the JXR message?<br />

            <p>Hi JoeySundberg,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting. I understand that you want to arrange your photos&nbsp;by date&nbsp;from the latest to the oldest. You can do&nbsp;it in Photo&nbsp;Gallery by&nbsp;following these:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. On Photo Gallery, right-click on the interface then select <strong>Sort</strong>
<strong>by</strong> then choose <strong>Date</strong> <strong>taken</strong>.</p>
<p>2. After that, right-click then select<strong> Sort by</strong> again, now choose
<strong>Descending</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I would like to ask what is the exact message you are receiving for the JXR you are describing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'll wait for your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Richard</p>

            Thank you. I've always been able to sort the photos (the View menu lets you do that without the right clicking). My concern is with the pane on the left - the one with the folders. I took a snapshot of my screen... More often than not, I am looking for
 a recent folder (I know what date I'm looking for) and I would prefer to not have to use the search option. Your way, to get my most recent photos I need to highlight all the folders in MY Pictures. I guess you are telling me there is no way to change the
 order of the folders listed in the left pane. Below is a picture of my screen.&nbsp; I just want that left pane to sort Descending, so today shows up first.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e279a9b7-9054-4e76-be40-c6d153863b55" />&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
As for the JXR message, every time I open Photo Gallery I get a message asking if I want Photo Gallery to open JXR files YES of NO.&nbsp; No matter what I click, I get the message again the next time I open the program. Here's a picture of that too. Photo Gallery
 is already my default program.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time.<br />

            Clarifying... I guess I should say that I want my folders to sort Descending but within each folder I want the pictures Ascending. Seems these photo programs should be flexible enough to handle that...<br />

            You have a corrupt user profile. 

your files and applications are still there. Sometimes restarting a few times will resolve the problem, or you will need to create a new user account then copy over your files. Your corrupt user account can be found under C:\Users. You might need to take ownership of the folder, then recover your data.

Try booting into Safe Mode then try logging in. If you are able to log in, create a new user account.

<p>There seems to be a lot of people having issues with this. I've looked at a few other threads and nobody seems to even try to help us. Can we at least get an answer on whether or not there's anything being done to fix it instead of being ignored?</p>

<p>fAnd Mr. Whatevertheheckhisnameis isn't helping by pointing us towards a page that we can all obviously navigate to. IF we can make it to the forums we can make it to the account management page. The problem is that there is literally no pay with Paypal
 button. If I miss out on the $2 for 2 months deal I'll be pretty angry.</p>

<p>Xbox Live, PayPal and others are currently under attack from LulzSec or something like that, so Microsoft shut PayPal down temporarily, just to be on the safe side. &nbsp;I called their customer support and they told me that it is "Down for maintenance and should
 be up in less than 24hrs". &nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this answers your question :)</p>

            2 reasons this happens.
<br />
<br />Antivirus software you are running or existing corrupt files.
<br />
<br />First disable your antivirus while you are doing the update.
<br />Second do the steps below in order.
<br />
<br />Go to search and type command prompt and right click and select to Run as Administrator.
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter 
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (do this command at least twice in a row)
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download 
<br />
<br />REBOOT
<br />
<br />Still doesn't work then Go to search and type command prompt and right click and select to Run as Administrator.
<br />Type one after another
<br />
<br />Net Stop bits 
<br />Net Stop wuauserv 
<br />Net Stop appidsvc 
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc 
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak 
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak 
<br />Net Start bits 
<br />Net Start wuauserv 
<br />Net Start appidsvc 
<br />Net Start cryptsvc 
<br />
<br />Try update again.

            Hello, 
<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help.
<br />Regarding your issue, I would first suggest is to
<br />Try resetting Windows updates using an automatic script. See:
<br /><a href="http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows-update-complete-reset-in.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.yourwindowsguide.com/2015/12/windows...</a>
<br />Make sure you run the script as an administrator.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.
