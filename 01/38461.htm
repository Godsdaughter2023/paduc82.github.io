                    <p>Think it might be Spanish?</p>

<p>el resumen del fin de semana</p>
<p>
</p><p>and others. I'm not sure I like the auto creation in any case but I certainly don't want it in a language I don't speak (OK I know we Brits should be better at languages so apologies for that :) )</p>
<p>
</p><p>This creation pops up notifications on both my PC and my Nokia so I guess it's on OneDrive?</p>

            Where are all these languages coming from? I don't want the albums to be auto-created in the first place, but to have the dates listed in a multitude of languages is ridiculous. The local language settings should be used.

<p>Hello ? </p>
<p>Anybody there ?</p>
<p>Still happening, to me anyway and we are now in May 2017</p>
<p>Is anyone closer to finding a solution to this bizarre behaviour, as I am evidently not the only one affected !</p>
<p>I am also getting in addition to Spanish and German, Cyrillic or Greek dates which are, as it happens, totally incomprehensible to me.</p>
<p>The Microsoft 950XL&nbsp;Windows Phone is&nbsp;in Windows 10 and&nbsp;is set up with location France but default language English.</p>
<p>Wouldn't be quite so bad if it was in French, I could understand if it was but it seems to take a language at random

    <title>Pressure sensitivity on pen doesnt work on ANY drawing programs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nookinooks  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pressure sensitivity on pen doesnt work on ANY drawing programs</h2>
                    Hello i had my surface 3 for 5 months now and i never had any problems with pressure sensitivity, it always worked just fine until recently. Yesterday i was drawing on Clip Studio Paint when the pressure sensitivity goes off, and i thought maybe i changed
 it on accident i tried going to the preferences on clip studio and change them back to normal as before, but the pressure sensitivity doesnt change, i go to flash CS6 i does the same thing. I ended up checking the surface app, and the pressure sensitivity
 there works just FINE, i have no idea whats going on i tried finding for an answer on google but there's nothing. Please help!!!!

<p>Hi Cindy,<br />
<br />
Software conflict could be one of the factors why we are having issues in turning on/off the Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and airplane mode. To get a clearer picture of the issue, we want to ask you a few questions:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you make any changes to your PC before the issue started?</li><li>Did you get any error messages when you're trying to turn on/off the Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and the airplane mode?</li><li>When did the issue begin?</li><li>Did you perform any troubleshooting steps? If so, can you tell us what are those steps?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>We'll keep an eye out for your response.</span></span><span> <br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<div>1. Is your other USB devices works?<br />
2. Are you facing the issue only when you connect the Printer?</div>
<div><br />
<br />
I would suggest you to follow the below Method and check if it helps.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1:<br />
<br />
</strong>Try connecting to a different USB port and check if the Printer gets detected or try connecting the Printer on a different computer.</div>
<div><br />

http://support.microsoft.com/mats/hardware_device_problems/en-us</a></div>
<div><br />
<strong><br />
Method 2:<br />
<br />
</strong>Remove and reinstall all USB controllers.<br />
<br />
To remove and reinstall all USB controllers, follow these steps: </div>
<div><br />
a) Click Start, click Run, type sysdm.cpl in the Open box, and then click OK.<br />
b) Click the Hardware tab.<br />
c) Click the Device Manager button.<br />
d) Expand Universal Serial Bus controllers.<br />
e) Right-click every device under the Universal Serial Bus controllers node, and then click Uninstall to remove them one at a time.<br />
f) Restart the computer, and then reinstall the USB controllers.<br />
g) Plug in the removable USB storage device, and then test to make sure that the issue is resolved.</div>
<div><br />
<strong><br />
Method 3:<br />
</strong></div>
<div>Update chipset drivers and check if it helps.<br />

<h2>            What can I do with this broken controller&#63;</h2>
                    For Christmas I got an Xbox One S (White) controller. I know that specific kind tend to have problems so I wasnt surprised when it wouldnt stay synced to my xbox for more than a couple minutes at a time. I requested a repair and today i recieved my replacement.
 The menu button on it doesnt work, so no pausing games or ability to access system options through the dashboard. I've tried contacting support and they tell to to request a replacement but the controller they sent me is old and it says that there isn't a
 warranty available due to activation date. Idk what to do.

            Thats not right because the controller should still be under warranty whether its a refurbished one or not. You bought a new console and is covered for a certain period of time .<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Device
 Service and Repair</a>&nbsp;should be able to register your whole xbox including the controller. If anything you can request a call back and ask to speak to a supervisor.

                    I had an iphone 7 with a world saved to it and my iphone 7 broke so i wasn’t able to transfer my world into another device (not sure if i’m even able to do that anyway).Is there any way i could get the world back onto my new phone? Since i used my xbox
 account to login with the old iphone, shouldn’t the world save and download onto my new phone? Please let me know asap. Very disappointed if i’m unable to obtain my old world.

<p>If you at any point in time synced your iPhone to iTunes in the time before you broke your phone, you may be in luck. If your phone backed up onto your iTunes account, you should be able to recover it by uploading the backup to your new phone. If you haven't,
 but you still are able to hook up the broken phone to your iTunes on the computer, then I would follow the instructions on this article:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Save-the-World-Minecraft-PE/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.instructables.com/id/Save-the-World-Minecraft-PE/</a></p>

<h2>            Start Menu Sync</h2>
                    I'm using many different systems (20+) on the same outlook account and trying to get them to sync the start menu. So far, the synchronization has been very sporadic and largely unsuccessful.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have been changing the start menu on a single system to see if the syncing works, and it changes on a few of the other systems but won't on the majority. I have checked to make sure all of the setting are turned on, and they are. I don't know what else
 I could do to get the other computers to sync.</div>

            Thank you for the reply.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>However, I have already checked this article and have all of the sync settings turned on and am still not able to sync properly.
<div><br />
<div>I have run the troubleshooter as well and have not received any type of error explaining why the sync is not working properly.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>It seems that different things sync while others don't. For instance, though I have all of the sync setting turned on, only the background will sync on certain computers while the start menu and tiles remain unchanged.&nbsp;</div>

            Since the newest Surface Pro shipped with the Creator's Update, there isn't a recovery image available for Anniversary so there's no quick solution. For the Intel video,, you can try a generic driver from the Intel site. Don't run the exe, extract it and as you've done, manually browse and load it. I don't know that there is a solution to the Surface Serial Hub Driver. See https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/surface/2017/06/17/surface-pro-and-surface-laptop-drivers-and-firmware-initial-release/ for the long version of a reason the Hub driver is an issue.

<p>Hi Raitis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Even if you already installed the latest Windows updates, in some cases, the drivers remain outdated. This causes compatibility issues and this could be the reason why you're experiencing messed monitor display.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To get this issue fixed, simply update the drivers in your device. Kindly refer to this article to see how:</p>

<p>We appreciate you getting back to us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to verify, have you tried to reinstall the graphic driver as stated on the instructions on the link we provided you? If the Windows system didn't find any new driver for your graphics device, have you tried to look for new one on the manufacturer's
 website? If you haven't, we suggest that you do as this process can help us to resolve the issue. Since you just had Windows updated, some drivers' components are not totally compatible with the latest updates.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please update us with the result.</p>

<p>I am having the same problem. Just bought a new SSD hard drive and installed a new copy of 64-bit Windows 10 home. Everything was working just fine until it started doing windows update. That's when the screen colors and resolution got completely jacked
 up. It is so bad that small text, such as what I am typing now (on a different computer of course), is un-readable! I (think) I was able to install the amd radeon automatic driver update tool, but so far that did not fix the problem.&nbsp; Fwiw, it is a MSI Radeon
 R7950 Twin Frozr 3GD5/OC graphics card on a MSI Z87-G41-PC-Mate motherboard with an intel i7 and 16GB of ram.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On startup, the MSI motherboard logo displays perfectly, but when windows 10 loads up, the display goes to s#$@. How can I fix this when I can't even navigate the menus because the text and images are un-readable?!</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would suggest that you boot in Safe mode. The issue is expected NOT to exist in that mode. Then perform System Restore, on where the latest updates are not yet installed. Here's

 it.&nbsp; See, e.g., the 20 Sept. 2014 post from mrphster on page 2 of this exceedingly long thread.&nbsp; Also see

            <p>The problem is with the security permissions on your profile temp folder. To fix it navigate to %temp% or C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Local and right click on the Temp folder and choose properties, then click the security tab and click advanced.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>On the permissions tab you should see the permissions that are there. There should 3 which are:</p>
<p>'SYSTEM' with Full control which applies to 'This folder, subfolders and files'</p>
<p>'Administrators' with Full control which applies to 'This folder, subfolders and files'</p>
<p>'Your Username' with Full control which applies to 'This folder, subfolders and files'</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>and all 3 should be inherited from the C:\Users\[Username]\ folder. </p>
<p>If you don't have the 'Include inheritable permissions from this object's parent' option ticked, then tick it and click continue if there are any problems, then remove the permissions that aren't inherited.</p>
<p>Once you click 'Apply' and click 'OK' you should have the permissions to write to the directory and you won't get those error messages any more.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hope this solves your problem</p>

<h2>            Kinect Party Free&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Spent 2 hours playing the new free game Kinect Party last night and have to say it is quite a lot of fun especially posting up photo's on Facebook wearing some dodgey looking costumes. &nbsp;Great little surprise that will no doubt be played quite a bit on Christmas
 and New years day with a little alcohol on board.</p>

<p>Well thats 4 free kinect games this year or is it 5 that you could get free.</p>
<p>How nice considering in the life time of Live there's only been 5 free games for non kinect people. ! dashboard game that wasn't anything really beyond a simple mini game. One region locked game for the US. One which required the vision camera to work and
 3 that have been free 2 of which were sponsored by Doritos.</p>

<p>That wasn't meant to be free though it was an apology for the server issues over Xmas that year. otherwise it wouldn't have been free at all.</p>

    <title>Default Program Associations for JPG and PNG reset to blank every few - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kentlafavers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Default Program Associations for JPG and PNG reset to blank every few days.</h2>
                    <p>I work with Windows 10 enterprise edition and while in Service Manager looking at a ticket, I can try to open an attached screenshot and I will get the error message saying this file type does not have an associated program to open it.&nbsp; It can be either
 a jpg or a png.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can go into&nbsp;Control Panel\Programs\Default Programs\Set Associations and set them to Paint and it will work fine for a couple of days, then it will reset to not having an association any more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Desktop Support guys can't explain it, so I'm wondering can somebody help me with a powershell script that will set the associations?&nbsp; Drilling down through the menu system to get to the right window is a pain in my butt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!,</p>

<p>Whats commander mode? Linky no worky.</p>
<p>[/quote] Assuming its similar to BF2 commander, its one guy who has a top view of the map. (Looked like satelite imaging, and he could toggle it to play in the first person). The commander could order squads to attack/defend objectives/key points on the
 map. (great idea, but nobody listen to commander lol). Another great thing was commander could call in artillary, vehicle and ammo drops on friendlies, and use the map to spot enemies and relay information to entire team. Seeing how you could only communicate
 in your own squad. Was a great idea in theory, and if the people actually listened to the commander it make the game very tactical.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Among the things you tried, did you update your WiFi adapter driver? Also, see if disabling power management fixes the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press the Windows logo key + X and click Device Manager. Look for your WiFi adapter under Network adapters node.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click and select Properties. Under the Power Management tab, uncheck 'Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if that fixes the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Linley.</p>

<p>Hi Bomber,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to manually update the adapter driver. All seemed to be good for a bit. Then it dropped again. I was pretty confident I had the windows issue resolved because the adapter did update this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to call my internet provider and ask if there may be an issue from their end. They made some changes to settings and it has been working as it should for the past few days.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi Las Vegas Karen,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>•
</span><span>How are you trying to perform backup?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>•
</span><span>Are you trying to perform complete PC backup or only certain files?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>•
</span><span>When exactly are you getting this error code?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>•
</span><span>Which version of Vista is installed on your computer?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The error 0x80070001 ERROR_INVALID_FUNCTION is usually the result of an error caused by something interfering during the transmission of data.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This issue may be due to several reasons, however the most common would be due to another program or process that is running and causing the problem.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> You may
<strong>perform a clean boot and try to run the backup program</strong>. You can start Windows Vista by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The following link has steps showing how to perform clean boot:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Click Start, type "MSCONFIG" (without the quotations) in the Search Bar and Press "Enter" to start the System Configuration Utility.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: Click Continue if the "User Account Control" window pops up.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Click the "Services" tab, check the "Hide All Microsoft Services" box and click "Disable All".</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Click the "Startup" tab, click "Disable All" and click "OK".</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Restart the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: Clean Boot is a troubleshooting step. If some programs have been disabled, you can re-enable them later. If you see the System Configuration
 Utility, check the box "Don't show this message" and then click "OK".</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Run the backup program immediately after the reboot and before you perform any other functions on the computer. Do not use the computer while the
 backup program is running.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>After performing backup, see the section on the above mentioned link to how to return your computer to a Normal startup mode by following the steps
 under “Reset the computer to start as usual.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> If the issue still persists, you may follow the steps in the link
 below: </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may receive error messages when you try to perform a backup operation on a Windows Vista-based computer:

    <title>What are the default attributes for the Windows 10 &#34;Documents&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gordie z  say:</h3>
<h2>            What are the default attributes for the Windows 10 &#34;Documents&#34; folder&#63;</h2>
                    <p>What are the default attributes for the Windows 10 "Documents" folder housed in the User folder? &nbsp;If three or so people who haven't messed with that folder could enter the following into their Command Prompt window and the results are the same, then we'll
 have confidence those are the from-the-factory-settings...&nbsp;ATTRIB "C:\Users\<em>x</em>\Documents" where
<em>x</em> is the name of your user folder. &nbsp;Or a link to documentation defining the default attributes of the "Documents" folder would be great. &nbsp;Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why? &nbsp;I moved the hidden "Music" folder under Users\My Folder to the "Documents" folder under Users\My Folder. &nbsp;It wasn't pretty - before I new to use Preferences\Location Tab\Move to move these, I tried to drag 'n drop it, finally figured out how to do
 it properly, but somewhere along the line the "Documents" folder became hidden (in my user folder but not in the "This PC" window). &nbsp;Wanting it visible, I researched, found the ATTRIB command, and tried to unhide the folder by entering ATTRIB -h "C:\Users\<em>x</em>\Documents"
 but received the message "Not resetting system file - C:\Users\<em>x</em>\Documents . &nbsp;I found this error means "The specified files already had system attributes, so none of their attributes may be reset with the Attrib command unless you specify a +s or
 -s switch..." ( https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc975258.aspx ). &nbsp;So I then entered either ATTRIB -s -h "C:\Users\<em>x</em>\Documents" or ATTRIB +s -h "C:\Users\<em>x</em>\Documents" -
<strong>I don't remember which</strong>. &nbsp;This unhid the folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, ATTRIB "C:\Users\<em>x</em>\Documents" returns "S &nbsp; &nbsp;I &nbsp; &nbsp;C:\Users\<em>x</em>\Documents" now which seems suspect because I don't know if I changed the "S" attribute and "I" means do not index content (or maybe content has not been indexed) and I think
 documents should be indexed to allow better searching. &nbsp;That is why I'd like to know what the attributes of your "Documents" folder are (assuming you haven't messed with attributes or anything that might mess with them (permissions, etc?). &nbsp;Thanks.</p>

    <title>Possible file explorer issue Win10.1607 Pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bojie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Possible file explorer issue Win10.1607 Pro</h2>
                    <p>Here is the issue. Hopefully somebody would be able to chime in or provide some insights or solutions. Please bear with me since this might be a little bit long. I have contacted Microsoft support 3 times regarding this and none of the sessions resulted
 in a fix. The second call actually ended with the agent just disconnecting our remote access session without saying anything - she basically just hang up on me. The first and 3rd attempts were both courteous and professional despite non-resolution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently upgraded 9 personal home machines to 1607 or the anniversary update. All these machines were running 1511 without any problems. Seven (5) of the machines are running x64 Home. Two of them are portables running x32 home. The last two desktops are
 running x64 Pro. The first seven computers have had zero issues with the update/upgrade. The last two running Pro are the ones with problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A bit of info regarding the two pro machines. Desktop A is an AMD machine with an FX8350 processor, 16GB memory, Crucial SSD for boot and programs, a WD black drive for files and documents and a dedicated WD Mybook external drive for backup and other files.
 It has two AMD video cards in crossfire. The second machine is an Intel based processor, i5-4570, 32GB of memory, Sandisk SSD for boot and programs, a WD blue drive for files and documents and a dedicated Buffalo/Samsung external drive for backup and other
 files. It has a single AMD video card. Both machines have dedicated printers (both epson) shared among the other computers on the home network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There's not a lot of 3rd party programs installed. Both have Microsoft office pro 2013 and Visio pro 2013 (retail disc version), Kaspersky internet security 2017, iTunes, VLC for media playback, and additional firefox and vivaldi as alternative browsers.&nbsp;
 The only difference in software between the two is that the AMD machine has games (stream) while the intel machine has photoshop CS6</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I did the upgrade for all of the 9 machines, I opted to download the media installation tool, obtained an iso and burned the iso to disc. This prevented any possible hiccups during a streaming update as well as saving me bandwidth since I did not have
 to redownload Win10 for each machine. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Upgrade proceeded smoothly for the other 7 machines. These last two showed "issues" from day 1.&nbsp; For both machines, once you open file explorer &gt; my computer &gt; select any drive &gt; select any folder &gt; open the folder &gt; select and open a sub-folder , then another
 folder and another (basically you are going 3-4 folders deep). When you click back &gt; back &gt; back (several times returning to the root folder then finally to the local drive, "my computer" is blank and I get the endless green bar and "working on it" screen.
 It never completes or opens. Control panel becomes devoid of icons as well. </p>
<p>
</p><p>From day 1, iTunes will not launch or open on the intel machine unless I disable the network card or unplug the network cable on the intel machine. The AMD machine was completely unresponsive after the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So option was to revert to 1511 right? Wrong. I tried going back and I was met with the "cannot go back to previous version since it has been more than 9 days since you have upgraded your system". Huh? It has only been a day - not even 24 hours. So at this
 point there was no other fix but to do a clean, fresh install on both machines. CD-based reinstallation. Everything seemed to work well until about 3 weeks later.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The AMD machine started showing the same symptoms. Mapped drive wont open or getting message that it has not been restored. Returning to root folders after going into a sub folder is now getting slow. Opening "my computer" takes a bit longer than usual,
 then finally, it wont open at all. At this point computer 1 is back to what computer 2 was immediately after the update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did hardware checks (scandisks /F, chkdisk etc) for possible drive issues or crosslinked files. I tried SFC/scannow for file integrity and corrupted system files. I tried safemode, cleanboot (disabled all non-microsoft services), minimal drivers, autorunsc
 / winternals, quick access has been set to open this pc) , but no setting would allow me to get file explorer working as expected</p>
<p>
</p><p>So as I mentioned above, I made my first contact with Microsoft support. I actually made a short 30-sec video to clearly explain what the issue was. The first person I spoke with was very confident that running in-place upgrade would solve the issue. I was
 adamant about this but he insisted. It's basically installing windows over windows. So we proceeded.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the upgrade, Desktop 1 was now in even worse condition. All the USB 3 ports on the motherboard were disabled. No errors were showing up in device manager (hidden or otherwise). I tried removing all detected controllers. I tried reinstalling the usb
 drivers from the motherboard install disc - and it was saying that there were no usb3 chipsets found.&nbsp; Itunes was now acting in the same manner as the intel computer (I have to disable the nic or unplug ethernet) for the program to launch. Mail (the default
 program that came with Win10) could not connect or fetch any email - but Windows live mail still connects without any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A second contact with Microsoft connected me with a female agent who proceeded on doing remote access troubleshooting on the AMD machine. After about a little over 2 hours, she just ended the session without saying anything. You can tell by the console connection
 that she terminated the connection on her end and it was not just a disconnection issue.&nbsp; At this point, machine was more weird. I had delegated folder icons on my taskbar / desktop that could not be removed. All my drives (including card readers, and hidden
 partitions were now showing up as non-removable icons on my desktop). </p>
<p>
</p><p>So I tried a 3rd time Microsoft contact. The agent was up front and honest and told me this was the first time he heard about the situation and that he could not provide an answer but the case would be escalated.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The behavior of both computers are practically identical. I do not think it would be a case of hardware configuration since the other 7 machines on my home network have similar components. All machines are configured with an SSD for Os and HDD for files
 option. All machines share folders with one another. Each computer has a dedicated external usb drive. All computers have access to a central NAS. There are 5 printers shared among the 9 machines. All are running the same version of Kaspersky internet security
 and 2010 retail versions of office. </p>
<p>
</p><p>computers are not on a domain. computers are not using a homegroup. indexing whether enabled or disabled has no effect</p>
<p>disabling or enabling antivirus has no effect. Creating another admin user and using that account yield the same issue. Signing in with a Microsoft account or using a local account does not have any effect either</p>
<p>At this point I will be doing a clean install for the AMD machine.&nbsp; I've never had to do s clean install since Windows 7.

            <p>I have no issue regarding doing a clean install. But my question still remains: What could be causing this issue / corruption?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To give you a timeline on all 9 machines, I installed the Anniversary update on Aug 2-3</p>
<p>
</p><p>By Aug 4, I had to do a re-installation (clean) install on the 2 machines running Win10 Pro.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Aug 30, the AMD machine (mentioned above) began showing the issues I described earlier. Microsoft support instructed to an inplace update - which messed up things even more. Eventually, I did a clean install again and reverted to 1511. Now setup to defer
 updates. I essentially had to do 4 installations on this machines within a 1 month time frame.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Sept 7, the Intel machine also running Pro.1607 began showing the exact same issues. I had to perform a clean install and reverted to 1511 and setup to defer updates as well.&nbsp; I ended up doing 3 re-installations on this machine within a 1 month time frame.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No issues when the machines were running Win7/8.1. No issues with Win10.10041 (tech preview), Win10.10240 RTM</p>
<p>and Win10.10586 (1511). All installations were clean installs. Problems only arose with 1607.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other 7 machines running 10.1607 (home64 and home32) have not had any problems since. The file explorer and app issues have not appeared. The software installed across all the home64 machines are similar (itunes, kaspersky internet security 2017, retail
 Microsoft office 2010 and 2013 pro,&nbsp; retail Microsoft 2013 visio pro, firefox as a secondary browser and all pertinent drivers for printers (each machine has a printer hardwired via usb) and shared among each other on the network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the question remains? What could be causing the issue and why only the PRO machines?

            <p>I'm having almost the exact same problem. The 1607 update was installed yesterday. If I open File Explorer I get the same green bar. I noticed that when I'm getting the eternal green bar, I can open a file fold on my desktop and it's fine. Sometimes I can
 open a file location in file explorer and the icons are no longer showing thumbnails or the icon for the file type. If I go out and return to the same directory, they are correct.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I got an error yesterday when trying to backup a library I created that has links to all the directories I need to do a clean install and the image below is the error message box. I can still copy directories by the copy and paste method so I have finally
 backed up everything under my user profile AND all the installation programs for the software I have installed. I am going to try to uninstall update 1607 and go back to 1511. I am also deferring all updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>I have run sfc.exe in the command console as administrator and it comes back 100% verified (even in safe mode). I have checked the file systems and they are 100% fine. When I reboot the system takes much longer to come back up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you find out what is causing this, please let me know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Here's&nbsp; an interesting situation that just recently cropped up</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">One of the machines that is still running Win10-1607 just developed the same symptoms.&nbsp; The issue for me here was that this machine never had issues prior to the most recent updates pushed to the machine. When I wrote the first
 entry for this question, the machine was running fine. The second to the last update were the installed around Sept 01 (including but not limited to KB3189031 and 3176938). After those were applied, the machine continued to function without the "file explorer
 error". </p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">I turned the machine off and the machine remained unused for at least 3 weeks until I restarted it and applied updates that were available Sept 26 (this update included KB3193494 and again some updates for Flash and Microsoft Office
 2010 products). After applying all the updates, and the requisite restart - the machine now has the "file explorer issue". Everytime I try and open a window like "my computer" and control panel, I just get the annoying "working on it" eternal green bar</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">I tried removing / uninstalling the update but it looks like it contained not a single patch but a group of patches altogether. The KB isn't even listed under the installed updates.&nbsp; So again, I'm at a standstill. Is it just me
 or are there others out there experiencing the same problem (and not reporting it) or is this issue being ignored?
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Looks like I will be reverting to 1511 on this machine as well.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">

</p><p style="text-align: justify"><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b5ef88a4-044d-477d-941e-49fa54a4c3e5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b5ef88a4-044d-477d-941e-49fa54a4c3e5" height="571" width="551" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify">This is a fairly recent machine running a Xeon Haswell Processor on a Z97 motherboard, GTX970 video card, 32GB of RAM, SSD for boot and OS and 2 WD Black on RAID for storage. Running Windows 10 Home64 - so I do not think it would
 be a hardware issue,. </p>

            <p>The green bar I'm referring to is the bar that goes across the top of file explorer when it's scanning the drive for files. The problem was not fixable. I store all my application data on another drive and my user profile doesn't have much to backup. So
 I simply installed a new copy of windows professional to replace the free upgrade as a clean install, then applied all the updates. It fixed the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I think happened is I had just uninstalled iTunes, which required an reboot to remove completely. Upon reboot the system applied the 1607 build update. After the machine came back up I reinstalled the latest version of the 64-bit iTunes as I just got
 a new iPhone 7. It installed but only worked for a few reboots. I'd look at a directory and it would be fine, look a second time and it would be corrupted. When I tried to start iTunes, it wouldn't execute. Reboot and it was fine for a while.... so I tried
 to copy some of the data in the Music library and I got an error message related to a corrupt registry. I opened the registry with regedit and searched for iTunes and got garbled data. While I don't have an issue poking into the registry, this was a case of...
 not worth the effort to try and fix. I reloaded the machine and it's fine. I made sure that all the applications that I reinstalled were compatible with the Anniversary update, including replacing my Office 2007 version with the latest version. So, it's all
 good at this point. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I did read that Kaspersky is not fully compatible with Windows 10 Anniversary addition. I have it installed and haven't had a problem.</p>

            <p>Hi Sandra,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the response. I became aware of the issue with Kaspersky so I made sure I installed the latest version with the reinstallation of 1607. For the two machines running Win10 Pro, I did suspect that KIS (Kaspersky Internet Security) might be at
 fault and because of their disclaimer that it was not completely compatible with the anniversary update, I opted to not install it on one of the pro machines the second time around.&nbsp; Unfortunately, that did not have any effect on the "file explorer" issue
 and both machines had the same problems recur within a week or two of each other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that I only refer to the persistent problem as a "file explorer issue". I am not sure if the issue is linked with that but file explorer is the best and first example of how the problem or corruption rears its head</p>
<p>
</p><p>So just to be clear - one Pro machine retained Kaspersky Internet Security 2017-17.0.0.611 while the other Pro machine utilized Windows defender. Both machines eventually had the same problems under a month of reinstalling 10.1607.&nbsp; As a further comparison
 to the control setup, there are another 7 machines running x64 and x32 versions of Win10 Home with the 1607 update. All are running Kaspersky as well without any issues - except for one Xeon based "gaming" machine which practically turned off for more than
 3 weeks. I only recently powered it up, applied new updates and was getting ready for Gears of War 4 game (which required 1607) to be begin with. The update process (including Video card drivers) went without any issues (as I have illustrated above), but the
 subsequent reboot left me with a pc with the chronic green bar problem.<br />

<p>I believe the green bar that Jim was referring to is the same problem that I have.&nbsp; It is the "working on it" progress bar for file explorer. For me, this only happened after the update to 1607. Never had any issues with 1511. A clean and fresh install of
 1607 gave me a pc without that issue for about a day or so. After grabbing all the requisite Microsoft and Driver updates, the issue came back.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>In one of the discussions on the link you posted, Microsoft's solution, was to move all of your apps and data to the C: drive. That fix works for some but by no means all users. I can partially attest to this because the problem does seem to go away when
 I only have the SSD connected as a single drive. However, this is an acceptable workaround since I have more than 2TB of data on the (secondary) D drive. If Microsoft admits that this is an existing issue, then I am hoping that a fix or patch would be released
 soon.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>As of the time of writing, both Pro machines are running 1511. Absolutely no issues.

<p>What I think happened is I had just uninstalled iTunes, which required an reboot to remove completely. Upon reboot the system applied the 1607 build update. After the machine came back up I reinstalled the latest version of the 64-bit iTunes as I just got
 a new iPhone 7. It installed but only worked for a few reboots. I'd look at a directory and it would be fine, look a second time and it would be corrupted. When I tried to start iTunes, it wouldn't execute. Reboot and it was fine for a while....
</p>
<p>
</p><p>.........I made sure that all the applications that I reinstalled were compatible with the Anniversary update, including replacing my Office 2007 version with the latest version. So, it's all good at this point

</p><p>Hi Jim, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I HAD the same issues with itunes, Windows 10.1607 and several iphones.&nbsp; I believe the issue with iTunes is more on it not being to "communicate" which is why it would not launch or execute. Should you have the issue recur, try this:&nbsp; (On a wired connection)
 simply unplug your Cat5 cable, wait a few seconds then start iTunes. It should immediately launch. Then go back and plug-in your network cable and resume as normal. If you have a wireless connection or simply do not feel like unplugging the wire, simply disable
 the NIC temporarily (change adapter settings &gt; disable, launch itunes &gt; enable). It is obviously a pain to have to work this way but this is one of those "quirks" that popped up with 1607. It doesn't seem to matter if the entire pc was updated (from 1511)
 or if&nbsp; you did a clean install with a new iTunes installation. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a clean install of 1607 then installed itunes64 and the problem resurfaced a few reboots later,&nbsp; after reverting to 1511, iTunes starts normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for Microsoft Office, I have a retail Office 2013 Pro (disc version) on the two machines and I do not want to try a 365 subscription to test if it would have any effect</p>

            A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Reinstall. I would recommend that you should consider a clean install of your existing Windows 10. You can use below guide by Greg Carmack, MVP for this purpose. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)

<br />
<br />If you want a very lightweight guide - Start fresh with a clean installation of Windows 10

            Hi PwnStarFTW ... if you are not on the internet then it won't be able to connect using your Microsoft account after a refresh\reset of a PC.
<br />Try logging in with the local admin account.
<br />Or log in using safe mode.

            Hi PwnStar.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'll give you everything possible to try for sign-in failure so that at least something will work:
<br />
<br />First see the various troubleshooting steps here: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-10-account-password-from-login-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-windows-...</a>
<br />
<br />  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-security/troubleshooting-log-in-issues-in-windows-10/e7f397aa-417c-4479-80cb-d69d20ef18cc">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-windows-password/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/recover-lost-w...</a>
<br /> 
<br />Next try enabling the Hidden Administrator account to log into and set up a new Local Administrative Account to sign-into, move files over and set up, using Option Five here:   <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable-disable-elevated-administrator-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable...</a>
<br />
<br />To do this you'll need to access a Command Prompt in repair mode using whichever method works here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.  You can also try the option to System Restore.  If you don't have the password this may be limited to using the booted media.   
<br />
<br />If necessary you can  create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />After it loads, on second screen, choose Repair Your Computer, then Advanced Troubleshoot Options to try System Restore, or if that fails the Command Prompt to enable the Built-in Admin account .  
<br />
<br />If this fails from the Troubleshoot Options try a Reset, saving files.
<br />
<br />If this fails choose Install Now, then Custom Install, then at drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof.   Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is a step included to rescue your files first if they are not backed up using the bootable media here:   <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope having the full range of options helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />This will allow you to login as built-in administrator, then you can manage your system.
