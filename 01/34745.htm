<h2>            Brink Review Thread - Add Yours</h2>
                    
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fmagicr.co.uk%2fwordpress%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fBrink.png" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All we seem to be playing these days is First Person Shooters and in Brink, that's what we have. Can Brink step up to the mark in the wake of the impressive Crysis 2? We're going to give you the low-down on this highly anticipated release from developer
 Splash Damage, produced by Bethesda. <br />
<br />
Set in the near future, Brink places you firmly on the 'Ark' a floating city just off the beautiful coast of San Francisco. The 'Ark' houses near 50,000 inhabitants scrounging for basic supplies due to the severe overcrowding. I'm going to stop right there
 for a moment because Brink is not about story-telling, nor is it pretending to be. Brink aims to seemlessly blend the single player and multiplayer aspect of the game, which it does albeit in a slightly confusing fashion. You can select Story Mode and join
 a public session to face off against human enemies as opposed to AI, or go at it Solo. The choice is yours.
<br />
<br />
The first time you boot up the disc, you're greeted by what only can be described as an RPG style character creation screen, which is something 99% of RPG's would give a lobotomy for, it's impressive, but this is a First Person Shooter? Which begs the question,
 is it necessary? I think in Brink's case it is. Burning away hours in the customization screen only adds to time spent, where content is otherwise on the slim side.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fmagicr.co.uk%2fwordpress%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fBRINK-Character-Clip.jpg" /></p>
<p><br />
Normally I would tell you a bit about the campaign mode and the single player features however, Brink doesn't have a single player/campaign per se. This is a multiplayer game in the same context as Unreal Tournament and Quake Wars, where the single player modes
 are essentially the multiplayer side of the game but with bots. I would love to have had a dedicated campaign mode in Brink, whenever multiplayer got you down or frustrated, at least you could unwind, relax and just enjoy some good storytelling, not here.
 Single player is far more frustrating with largely inept bots replacing human counterparts in the same environment covering the same missions.
<br />
<br />
Brink shines when the bots are replaced by cursing, sweaty men. Multiplayer is fun and teamwork is back on the menu, success and level progression is solely based on how much of a team player you are. Are you the type of player that hits the Select button after
 every death to check your kill to death spread? None of that here, a superb experience points based system challenges your ability to work as a group and it's refreshing to play a modern day FPS that not only encourages you to play as a team, but demands it.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fmagicr.co.uk%2fwordpress%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fBrink-hands-on.jpg" /></p>
<p><br />
<br />
Level progression doesn't immortalise the players that have spent the longest time playing either, only makes you a more valued support team member. Newcomers will not be blown away by somebody that is higher level on a one-on-one duel by way of equipment,
 but by skill. Being alone out there is a scary place, stick by your team to stay alive to complete primary objectives and class specific secondary objectives. Just sticking close to a group will yield experience points.&nbsp; Once you reach the maximum character
 level, you might as well create another character and alternate between the different characters you've created, after all this is a Role Playing First person Shooter.<br />
<br />
It's only when you're either confronted or joined by bots that this game becomes frustrating and at times unforgiving. Thankfully an option to invite up to 3 other friends to strategically help you out through every mission is very much welcomed. Brink is a
 game that requires you to have plenty of friends at hand for you to fully appreciate its direction, in an era where FPS are all about lone wolves and killstreaks.
<br />
<br />
The art styling of Brink is smooth and further demonstrates Splash Damage' ability to think outside the box. Some will like the style, some won't, that doesn't mean it's a bad looking game, just notably distancing itself from the current crop of modern day
 FPS titles, for which we applaud.</p>
<p><br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fmagicr.co.uk%2fwordpress%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f05%2fBrink-Art.jpg" /></p>
<p><br />
<br />
The game mechanics from the upgraded ID Tech 4 engine is as smooth as you like and plays as you would expect, very well.<br />
Brink ushers something relatively new to the table thanks to Splash Damage' SMART system (Smooth Movement Across Random Terrain). This system in theory will allow you to manoever around the lush landscape on the 'Ark' without fuss, does it work? Yes it does,
 however it can be clumsy and difficult to master, even after spending time in the brilliant tutorial videos you'll still inadvertantly stumble over unwanted random terrain.
<br />
<br />
<b>Closing Thoughts</b><br />
<br />
Brink is a multiplayer game and as such needs humans to populate the game modes. Due to poor AI, the single player side is entirely forgettable and it's hard to recommend a full priced game for just multiplayer alone.<br />
If you're purely looking for a multiplayer game that breaks the mould of the modern day shooter and you're not interested in fancy single player campaigns and cinematic-photo-realistic-cut-scenes, you won't be looking past Brink for it's colourful art style
 and the superb team based qualities.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
<br />
<b>Verdict: 7/10</b></p>

<p>Sure seems that way :-) - anyway - played this game pretty much all yesterday, I love it - thing is I like bottlenecks in shooters and Brink is nowhere NEAR as bad as The original team fortress on the PC - can't remember the map but the attacking team at
 one point were funnelled down a corridor no wider than a fat man lying down :-). For all the people dissappointed that Team Fortress 2 wasn't updated on the 360, pick this game up. You may just scratch that long standing itch!</p>

<p>It's a thinking man/womans game. COD players need not apply. But if they want a challenage the gauntlet has been thrown down. I dare you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Loving every minute of it. Still don't understand why they nerf your teams AI as one human player doesn't really make a difference against a whole team of enemy bots. I wish there was a "To me" button to call onyour squad mates. Sick of taking on objective
 with little support. The annoying thing is that your AI bot team mates have a fetish for command posts. Honest to god, its annoying!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But when you're playing with other people. That's when the magic happens. It such a joy and also such a REFRESHING change from the god damn milking of ideas that go on nowadays. If you want change. Vote for me. Sorry wrong speech. Buy this game if you want
 change. Good change!</p>

<p>Am I missing something or is it me? I think this is one of the worst games I've played in a long time.</p>
<p>Multiplayer invite system is abysmal, especially considering the game is supposed to be mainly multiplayer.
</p>
<p>Campaign = multiplayer with cutscenes thrown in. Multiplayer is unbelievably repetitive same objects, escort someone here and there, defend this point, plant a charge, hack this hack that
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-20.gif" /></p>
<p>I've completed the resistance campaign with a friend and it was torture! Got no entertainment out of it what so ever, I only continued to play so I could give it chance.</p>
<p>Awful game.</p>

<p>Hi Nebula,<br />
<br />
Sorry to hear about the account troubles. Let's see if we can get this working for you and your sister.
<br />
<br />
I would suggest starting by resetting your Microsoft account password. I would also make sure you have the appropriate security proofs setup on your account.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You can find the steps for each of these process here in our <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/microsoft-account-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Account Help</a>&nbsp;support article.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Let us know how that goes, or if you have anymore questions. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Possibility is driver not installed properly</p>
<p>go to your manufacturer website and download the bluetooth driver for dell 6000 under win XP Pro environment</p>
<p>then go to device manager and uninstall the bluetooth device and</p>
<p>run the driver you have downloaded for dell 6000</p>

</p><p>People and businesses Paying Microsoft just so that they can keep XP is completely Idiotic !! You and they must have plenty of money to throw away. Just Upgrade to Windows 7 or 8.1 and spend you're money on something else. You won't be getting any more Updates
 from Microsoft starting this month.</p>

            Great ideal. But Microsoft is too arrogant to do that. Money is money. I guess they just want Windows 8 to be the top dog. After that it's the cloud OS. Just like cloud Photoshop.<br />

<p>Let's extend this. There is no such thing as 100% security for any software, Microsoft or not. You're right, you manage the risks. And right now, the riskiest thing you can do is run a popular operating system whose flaws are no longer fixed. You can try
 to mitigate the risks but at the end of the day, running XP will just be more and more of a security issue as more flaws are found. Security vendors will put less and less effort into protecting XP. The sooner you move to a supported operating system, be it
 a modern version of Windows or something else, the better off you will be.</p>

            <p>The best way to keep XP running and safe if not to have an Internet connection to the PC. Any file you move from another PC to XP should be pre-scanned for viruses. Most importantly is to create Image backups of the XP drive on a regular basis for recovery
 purposes.</p>

<h2>            Unable to open &#34;Configure Switchable graphics&#34; or &#34;graphics properties&#34;</h2>
                    <p>When I wanted to enhance &nbsp;software performance (a computer game that I installed from steam) with the use of the RADEON graphics (I think referred as AMD) I right clicked on the desktop then pressed&nbsp;Configure Switchable graphics....nothing happens, it shows
 the blue circle next to the mouse but no window opened, the same can be said about the graphics properties.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have checked the display drivers, both the intel and RADEON are there, all of them are up to date yet I don't have a AMD folder in the program files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really want help with this issue as I felt my PC's performance is handicapped regarding improving the performance of such software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any aid will be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do run on Windows 8 x64 bit</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the main question is, how to get these options to work again?</p>

            <p>When I use the "auto detect" driver application from the AMD website, this is what I got for the kind of graphics card: Radeon (TM) HD 7670M</p>
<p>

</p><p>By the way, the instructions in the link, do they refer to the radeon driver or the intel driver?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have I think with the auto detect utility from the AMD site, downloaded the driver for the&nbsp;Radeon (TM) HD 7670M</p>
<p>but I have no idea where it is stored, can you also tell me the possible location and possible directory where it might be stored?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
You have to do an upgrade before you can later do a clean install. So you<br />
will need to backup your data and then re-install 8.1. Then you can upgrade<br />
to Windows 10 and restore your data and re-install your programs.<br />
<br />
Of course doing immediate upgrades is essentially the same as doing a <br />
clean install as there should be no corruption.<br />
<br />
There is no product key for Windows 10. Win 10 ties the qualifying OS<br />
and your hardware to the activation. So once upgraded Windows 10<br />
will recognize the hardware if a clean install is performed. Presently<br />
the Activations Servers are very busy so hence the wait of at least<br />
48 hours before a clean install is performed and only after the initial<br />

I would suggest you to run the disc clean up and remove all the files that are not in use.<br />
<br />
Delete files using Disk Cleanup<br />

<h2>            Infinite Loading Screen Issues for TES Skyrim on XBOX 360</h2>
                    
<p><span>So, <strong>
I've deleted all my load saves</strong> or whatever, <strong>except for the last one</strong>, and I still get the ever-loving
<strong>infinite loading screen</strong>. I took out the disc and lo and behold there's literally a<strong> ringed circle-like scratch around the outer rim of my disc</strong>. Could this be the reason behind the infinite loading screen or? Because I really
 am angry that I can't continue without<strong> the loading screen taking all the time in the world</strong>. I also don't know if
<strong>it might be the DLC's I have</strong>. I have all three of them;<strong> Hearthfire</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Dawnguard</strong>, and
<strong>Dragonborn</strong>. I don't really know what the problem is but I would surely like a response on&nbsp;this issue because I seem to not be getting enough help from Youtube or other morons on the Internet.</span></p>

<p>Any time a disk is damaged or dirty it is safe to assume it is the reason for a persistent issue. If you know anyone who also has the game you could check it that way. You could try cleaning it but if it is a scratch that won't help.

<p>&nbsp; Annabelle, they tray on my 360 has abused my Skyrim disc such that it has two circular scratches. I tried cleaning it to no avail. I polished it only succeededing in putting a lot of swirls on it. Skyrim was installed on console HD prior to this abuse
 appearing.</p>
<p>The console doesn't recognize the disc as Skyrim, "Play Game" rather than "Play Skyrim" appears on the home screen. All this being said it doesn't affect my load times, OTHER THAN the console won't recognize the disc on the first attempt to load Skyrim.
 Error message says the disc is "unreadable". I open and close the tray, and the second attempt always works. It takes about 20 seconds before the booming drums begin and the graphics begin loading. Once I select "Continue", it takes 1 minute 30 seconds to
 load my character. I keep only the most recent 10 saves, and two or three milestones.
</p>
<p>Assuming you've cleared the game cache, (holding both bumpers AND "X" while game is first loading, until you see the logo) try starting a new character, save, and see what happens to your load times... should be faster I would think? I've read here that
 cleaning up your inventory of clutter helps. For instance duplicate keys (I drop them, they eventually disappear). I keep 99% of the remaining keys in a drawer in Breezehome. My lockpicking is 100, and all perks, I'll pick any locks I don't have the key too.
 If this fails...</p>
<p>I would upload that last precious save, more if you have them, to the cloud for safe keeping. Remove the DLC's and reinstall them one at a time to see if they are causing your issue. I suppose it could be that scratch, but it sounds like my disc may be worse
 than yours and it seemingly has no when the game is actually loading. Hope you find some way of correcting this... very frustrating!</p>

<h2>            DirectX and wrong amount of video RAM</h2>
                    I was having problems with "running out of video memory" errors in the Aces High online flight sim, so I did a full wipe-and-reinstall of my system.&nbsp; I deleted all the hard disk partitions on both of my hard drives and completely reinstalled Windows 7
 Pro 64-bit.&nbsp; I downloaded the latest video drivers from AMD and installed those, too.&nbsp; Here is my setup:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Motherboard:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ASUS P6X58D-E<br />
&nbsp; Processor:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Intel i7-930 2.8 GHz<br />
&nbsp; Memory:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 12 GB Corsair (2 x CMX6GX3M3C1600C7<br />
&nbsp; Video Card:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; XFX FX-795A-TDBC Radeon HD 7950<br />

&nbsp; Hard Drive #1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Western Digital 1TB 7200 RPM (WD1002FBYS)<br />
&nbsp; Hard Drive #2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Western Digital 1TB 7200 RPM (WD1002FBYS)<br />
&nbsp; Optical Drive #1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Plextor PX-880SA DVD writer<br />
&nbsp; Optical Drive #2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ASUS DVD-E818A6T DVD ROM<br />
&nbsp; Monitor #1:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ASUS VE258Q<br />
&nbsp; Monitor #2:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ASUS VE258Q<br />
&nbsp; Monitor #3:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ASUS VE258Q<br />
&nbsp; Power Supply:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; SeaSonic X750 Gold 750W<br />
&nbsp; Case:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lian Li Armorsuit PC-P50<br />
&nbsp; Operating System:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft Windows 7 Professional 64-bit<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Dxdiag reports incorrectly that my 3 GB AMD 7950 card has less than 1 GB of video RAM:<br />
...<br />
Card name: AMD Radeon HD 7900 Series <br />
Manufacturer: Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. <br />
Chip type: AMD Radeon Graphics Processor (0x679A) <br />
DAC type: Internal DAC(400MHz) <br />
Device Key: Enum\PCI\VEN_1002&amp;DEV_679A&amp;SUBSYS_32201682&amp;REV_00 <br />
Display Memory: 734 MB <br />
Dedicated Memory: 3043 MB <br />
Shared Memory: 1787 MB <br />
Current Mode: 5760 x 1080 (32 bit) (60Hz)<br />
...<br />
<br />
The "msinfo32.exe" program reports exactly 1 GB of video RAM (actually 1,073,741,824 bytes).<br />
<br />
And when I navigate to "control panel...display...screen resolution...advanced settings... adapter" it reports the following:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Total Available Graphics Memory:&nbsp; 4859 MB<br />
&nbsp; Dedicated Video Memory:&nbsp; 3072 MB<br />
&nbsp; System Video Memory:&nbsp; 0 MB<br />
&nbsp; Shared System Memory:&nbsp; 1787 MB<br />
<br />
The video RAM shortage errors continue to plague me, both in Aces High as well as other games.&nbsp; What's going on?&nbsp; Why does a fresh install go so very wrong?<br />

            Hi Mahesh,<br />
<br />
Thanks very much for the reply, but I have to disagree that this is only related to one specific application.<br />
<br />
I have an issue with DirectX and DxDiag misreading the amount of VRAM on my video card, which applies across several end-user apps, as I indicated above.<br />
<br />
What is wrong with DirectX on my fresh install of Windows (and video drivers)?&nbsp; How can I debug that, please?<br />

            Diagnosing video card problems and DirectX issues can be very "drawn out" process.&nbsp; Graphic problems are very noticeable in games so you might find a different group of users that might have more info inside the Windows Gaming community.<br />
<br />
Also, you might want to check the entire details of your video card directly, with out relying on Windows:<br />

As an additional suggestion, since this is a video card / graphic drivers / DirectX issue, you could check on a more dedicated web forum community that specializes in video card problems:<br />

    <title>I accidentally installed Windows 8 on two laptops with one license... - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            I accidentally installed Windows 8 on two laptops with one license...</h2>
                    I misread some fine print when deciding to purchase Windows 8. I was mistaken in thinking I could install the same product key onto a limited number of devices. Shortly after activating Windows 8 on two laptops however, I learned this was incorrect. In
 the end, I'm ok with this, I am perfectly fine with only one of my devices being activated, but the device I definitely want Windows 8 on was the second device I tried to activate. I was wondering if there was any way to unactivate my first laptop, and activate
 my second with the product key I purchased. I'm worried I won't be able to do this, and just wasted $40...

            <blockquote>
<p>I'd really like some further input about this. Andre's reply says "You have the option of installing another version or edition of Windows or obtain a product key for it."<br />
<br />
Is this saying I DO need to buy a new key? Even if I uninstall the product key from Laptop A? What I WANT to do, is uninstall the product key from Laptop A, and then use that same product key on Laptop B. If I knew one key = one activation, I would have never
 had put Windows 8 on Laptop A. I admit it was my misunderstanding, but I am curious if it's possible to uninstall the key from laptop A, and reuse that key to activate Laptop B.
</p>
<p><br />
According to Andre I CAN uninstall the key from laptop A, but when I tried to use that key on laptop B it was still telling me that it was already in use. Then, without even putting in the Product key into laptop A, it re-activated itself with the key. I confirmed
 that the key was uninstalled, but it went ahead and reapplied again. <br />
<br />
Am I out of luck? Did I really make a $40 mistake?<br />
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can, and apparently did successfully, deactivate Copy1. You do not have to purchase a new key for it unless you want to use Windows 8 on this device. It is now in trial mode. Before the trial mode is over you can remove it and reinstall whatever system
 you used before or install something else. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the key has been removed, reboot. The system should now work fine with all features. That should continue throughout the trial period. Then it will enter a time of reduced functionality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For greater certainty: It is not necessary to purchase a new key unless you intend to use Copy 1 beyond the trial period.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for Copy 2. Probably, you will have to use the phone-in activation method. Call the number for your region. They will take you through the steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for Copy 1 reactivating itself with the same key, you might have to remove the key from both copies and wait a while before inserting it in copy 2. You can discuss this with the activation folk if you get a live one when you call. If you don't, call back
 and stay on the line without pressing any buttons or saying anything when asked a question by the bot.</p>

<br />You should just be able to go to the Windows Store and re-download the app.

<h2>            Xbox App Can&#8217;t connect to console at the moment &#40;0x80000005&#41;</h2>
                    <p>My xbox app keeps showing me this error and cannot conncet to my xbox. It will show me that it can find my xbox but when i try to conncet, it gives me the error in the title of the post, along with the error code 0x80000005. I have tried EVERYTHING to fix
 this. When I type in my Xbox’s ip number, it gives me another error and still wont connect. Everything is set to what it should be. I have allowed sharing and streaming on my xbox. I have also tried soft resting my console with no luck. I deleeted the app
 on my phone and my laptop and reinstalled. I have tried signing in and out of my xbox and the app. I’ve gone all over the net to forums and videos and still cant find a solution. And xbox still hasnt called me back. This is honestly frustrating and a waste
 of time. All help will be much appriciated.</p>

Let's try to power cycle your console. Please hold down the power button on the front of the console for approximately 15 seconds until the power light shuts off. Wait about 60 seconds, then power it back on. Be sure you see the green "XBOX ONE" animation loading
 screen when you power it back up.&nbsp;&nbsp; Reset router too

<p>Hey Issac,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out. I see your PC is unable to establish a connection to your console even after quite a bit of troubleshooting. Going by the steps you took, this is starting to look like a problem with how the network is setup. In order to move
 forward, I'd like for you to test out the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/p/xbox-beta/9nblggh1j27h?activetab=pivot:overviewtab#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Beta app</a> as well. If you receive the same message as with the regular version of the app, we might have to dig into the router's settings and make sure there isn't something as simple as a firewall preventing the connection. Let us know how it goes!
 :D</p>

<p>Hi Isaac,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to hear that you are still running into this issue. You've done quite a bit of troubleshooting to no success so I'm starting to think it's network related and not necessarily console software problems since you've already hard reset and soft factory
 reset your Xbox. Connecting the console to your devices is highly dependent on whether or not they are all on the same subnetwork and wireless band.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go ahead and check your Network settings on the console and run a Detailed network test to get an idea of your networks stats. Do the same on the Xbox app and make sure the app is properly connected to Xbox Live.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you ever manually changed the SSID of your network? Double check that the SSID is displayed exactly the same on both devices.</p>
        </p>

<p>Hi Isaac,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so kindly for the update and photos with your reply. From what I can see, it looks like your console is doing just fine as far as the networking details, and it appears you may be on the same IP on both devices and the SSID as well, so this is definitely
 a conundrum. Ideally, you should be connecting; however, you are not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be worth a try manually switching up your DNS to a Google Public DNS for testing purposes on both your iPhone WiFi settings and the Xbox One console as well. In addition to this, you should also set up a static IP address for the console just to be
 sure that it remains on that IP and doesn't switch up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p><a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/network-ports-used-xbox-live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Network ports used by Xbox Live on Xbox One</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternatively, after researching the error code (which I found was associated with updates of sorts on Win10 devices) and the interface between the iPhone and Xbox App, I did notice that there was a trend at some point of the iPhone 6 (specifically) having
 issues with Xbox App usage due to not being updated. </p>
<p>
</p><p>A bit of a long shot, but essentially, you may want to try logging out of the Xbox App on your iPhone (<strong>Settings &gt; Sign Out</strong>) and then deleting the app and searching for an update for your iPhone. If it does perform the update, then go ahead
 and add the Xbox App back onto the phone, log into the app and attempt to connect your two devices once more. Barring that working, you may want to
<a href="https://support.apple.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contact Apple Support
</a>to see if they have anything to impart on this, or have any further information regarding the situation.</p>
<p>Give this a try and please let us know the results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this helps you a bit more.</p>

<p>Hi sorry for the late response.</p>
<p>i have tried all these things still with no sucsess. I did not however call apple support. I figured that if I cannot stream to my Windows laptop for the same reason as my iphone, then apple probably would have nothing to do with it. I may try on the weekend
 when i have more time. This is just very strange as everything seems to line up. I have also attached a picture of how it looks on my laptop. I changed its settings and IP and its address as well. I can see my xbox but I cannot connect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Hi Ramesh
<br />
<br />Sorry that model is only supported up to Windows 8.1
<br />
<br />Is there specific functionality on that monitor you need to use from the driver package.
<br />
<br />Typically in Windows a monitor driver is rarely required, you just load  the default Windows driver with the correct resolution and clock speed

            Hi Ramesh, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />If Dell haven't released the driver for your monitor, you probably won't be able to safely find it anywhere else.
<br />
<br />You could try the latest available driver, for Windows 8.1 at the following link:
<br />

<br />
<br />You could also get in contact with Dell Support to see if they know of a workaround:

<p>Thanks Dave, I saw that.</p>
<p>The extended/mirrored display&nbsp; keeps flipping back and forth. I have tried changing the resolutions/HZ and all, but no luck. I&nbsp; am trying to&nbsp; to use it as an&nbsp; extension with a VGA to HDMI converter cable.</p>

            Hi Ramesh
<br />
<br />The VGA connection is not the problem, it supports max 2048x1536px @85 Hz (388 MHz)
<br />
<br />Your monitor is rated at 1600 x 900 at 60 Hz.
<br />
<br />Open Device Manager, and expand the monitors section
<br />
<br />Is that monitor set as generic PHP Monitor or have you specifically set that to LCD 1600 x 900 at 60 Hz
