<h2>            Tips for selecting shapes and objects in Word 2007</h2>
                    
<p>I've been using Word forever, and have always been able to choose multiple graphics in a document, for example, to group them.&nbsp; I can't seem to make the ctrl or shift key work now, though.&nbsp; The "help" does not help, it just says what I already know:
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Select multiple objects.</td>
<td>Press and hold SHIFT or CTRL while you click the objects.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p>
What is going on?

<p>Hi tnlee76,</p>
<p><br />
Welcome to Microsoft Answers!!</p>
<p>a)&nbsp; Does this happen only with Microsoft Word or does it occur with other programs like “Notepad”?</p>
<p>b)&nbsp; Is the Control button working fine with other programs?</p>
<p>c)Were you able to use the function key earlier in Word 2007?</p>
<p>The control commands (keyboard shortcuts) for Word 2003 and Word 2007 are the same. There has not been any change with respect to the same.</p>
<p>You may try and use the other <strong>“Control”</strong> button and check if the issue gets fixed.</p>
<p>You may use another keyboard and check if the keyboard shortcuts work.</p>
<p>You may refer the link below and check for the keyboard shortcuts for Word:</p>

    <title>Wireless Desktop 5000 Windows 10 Support - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the judge  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wireless Desktop 5000 Windows 10 Support</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, </p>
<p>&nbsp;I have upgraded to Windows 10 (from 7 ultimate) and have been having issues with my Keyboard, some of my quick buttons no longer work (the row along the top - web home, mail, docs etc) the web home and mail keys no longer open anything but
</p>
<p>all the others work as before.</p>
<p>I have uninstalled and reinstalled the software and drivers but alas still no joy, I have also tried reassigning the keys manually to open Edge and Win10 Mail, but all I get is 2 or 3 seconds of the blue spinning disc then nothing.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that on the Microsoft support and driver page, when trying to select an operating system, Windows 10 isn't listed..........at all, am I looking in the wrong place, possibly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 start menu most used tab is missing recently used list</h2>
                    <p>I know this is a confusing description, I haven't seen it posted anywhere else though. I know there was a recent patch that consolidated the most used/program files in the start menu somehow, now that that has happened, I am not seeing my recently used portion
 of the most used items. More specifically, I use RDP for work a lot, I used to have the RDP most used, then an arrow I could expand on the right to show my recent connections, I could just click one.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I've tried checking and unchecking "Most used" "Recently used" and "Show Recently used items in the start menu" in the start menu options</li><li>I've tried restarting</li><li>I thought this may have been a bug, but it's appeared on both my work and home PC now on 10</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>You can see the issue a little better here, hopefully this makes the issue more clear:</p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/a/hA1ZM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://imgur.com/a/hA1ZM</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to reiterate, I've already checking/unchecking "Show most used apps", "Show recently added app", and "Show recently used items in jump lists on start or the taskbar" to no avail</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Alright,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I've tried creating a brand now account, as well as copying the profile, and I'm not seeing that jump list still. I'm almost wondering if the functionality is just removed with a recent update...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Might be time to start using classic shell on 10 if I can't get this working.</p>

            In case anyone is looking at this, it's the anniversary update that ruins the start menu. If you roll it back it stops being awful. Which is sad, because the rest of the update looked good. I literally use my most used connections every day, so taking
 that functionality away (with no way to re-enable.... why?) really is a huge deal breaker.

            So it was the 1607 anniversary update that broke my start menu, I rolled it back and have it the way I want it now. It would be really nice if they had the option to at least get the jump list back. I don't mind anything else about the start menu really.&nbsp;

    <title>Windows 8.1 hidden files and folders don&#39;t show - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mohammaddiab  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 hidden files and folders don&#39;t show</h2>
                    <p>I think this is a bug in Windows 8.1 latest build. I can NOT show hidden files and folders using the "Folder Options "&gt;"View" tab. The ONLY way I can show file-s and folders is by selecting the "Hidden Items" &nbsp;check box. No viruses or malwares on the system
 , and it is not a behavior of a malware. it looks like a bug in some windows 8.1 update. this wasn't the behavior when I first installed the system ( only 5 days ago )</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f92f2aa6-6e89-440b-8cb4-93fbaa1cceee" /><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Details:</strong><br />
<br />
I wasn't able to change the Folder options to "Show Hidden Files, folders and drives" . every time I change that and hit apply. nothing happens. when I check back I find that it is still at "Don't show hidden files, folders or drives" . The first assumption
 is that it is a malware that is preventing the system from showing hidden folders. so I did all the tests and scans with no malware found.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was a suggestion on multiple forums to manually change the value "CheckedValue" to value 0 , in
<strong>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced\Folder\SuperHidden]</strong><br />
but that didn't solve the problem. I deleted the whole key and hit refresh and restarted , waiting the system to recreate it , but that didn't happen. so I suspected that this registry key is NOT USED ANY MORE in windows 8.1 to reflect the folder and files
 hidden settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I just did a full search in registry for the value "SuperHidden" , and I found one in the registry for the user</p>
<p>"[<strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced]</strong>"</p>
<p><br />
I tried to change values like "HideFileExt" to see if it affects windows or not. and It did change the windows explorer to view hidden file extensions. So I tried to find the key that should show and hide files and folders. That one was "Hidden" , its value
 was 2. when I changed that value to 1 I can see hidden files and folders. and when I changed it back to 0 or 2 , I can't see the hidden files and folders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The interesting thing is that , when I changed "Hidden" value to the value 1. and went back to the Folder Settings , I found that both options "Don't show" and "Show" are both un-selected. as you see below.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/20f08319-0a0d-4959-b5d3-3c5a9d673d7a" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also I found a shortcut , instead of going to the registry and change the "Hidden" value &nbsp;, I can just select the "Hidden Items" from the Folder View menu ( as you see below ) , which will set the &nbsp;registry "Hidden" value to 1 , so I can see hidden files
 and folders.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f92f2aa6-6e89-440b-8cb4-93fbaa1cceee" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>To summarize, here is the behavior :</strong></p>
<p>in registry location&nbsp;"[<strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Advanced]</strong>"</p>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>change "Hidden" value to :</td>
<td>What "Folder Options" dialog show in "View" tab</td>
<td>Effect&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>"Don't show hidden files,folders, or drives" is selected&nbsp;</td>
<td>No hidden files or folders show up.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>Both options "Show" and "Don't show" are not selected.</td>
<td>I can see hidden files and folders.&nbsp;<br />
and , also the "Hidden Items" checkbox shows the mark now.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9a807ac7-51e4-4703-83f8-6ef0c5157e0d" /></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2 ( default )</td>
<td>"Don't show hidden files,folders, or drives" is selected&nbsp;</td>
<td>No hidden files or folders show up.&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The behavior of the "Hidden" value when I change the options from the "Folder Options" dialog from "View" tab</p>
<p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>"<strong>Don't show</strong> hidden files,folders, or drives" is selected&nbsp;</td>
<td>'Hidden' value changes to 2 &nbsp; ( no hidden files shows up )</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>"<strong>Show </strong>hidden files,folders, or drives" is selected &nbsp;</td>
<td>'Hidden' value changes to 0 &nbsp; &nbsp;( still no hidden files shows up )</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So there is no way to show hidden files from the "Folder Options - View Tab" , as they set the "Hidden" value to either 2 or 0 , and both values don't show hidden files or folders ,as I noticed.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The Bug :</strong></p>
<p>So as you see , when I do changes from the "Folder Options" View tab , the "Hidden" registry value changes. &nbsp;When I select "Show" the value changes to 0 and NOTHING changes it back to any other value.<br />
If there is a malware or a virus it would change or reset it back.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Now when I start to show the "Folder Options" then show the "View" tab, and WITOHUT making any changes yet. I hit refresh &nbsp;in registry and find that registry value changes its value back to "2" ,
<br />
So just loading the Folder options , "View" tab m changes the registry value , which doesn't make sense.&nbsp;<br />
And because the registry value changed back to value 2 ,&nbsp;&nbsp;I see "Don't show" selected.
<br />
<br />
Remember I just loaded the "Folder Options" dialog and just viewed the "View" tab , that should never change the current settings. so I believe this is a bug and it is likely to be related to the main problem where I can NOT show hidden files or folders until
 I change the "Hidden" value to 1 ( or select the check box "Hidden Items" from the Folder View metro menu ).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not a malware or virus , as the registry value doesn't change by itself. beside that I already did a full scan using "Bit Defender 2014" and "Malwarebytes" and even using "MS Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool"<br />
<br />
-Update 1 &nbsp;</p>
<p>I created new account and still see the problem, so , it is a global problem and not a corrupted user profile.</p>

            <p>A most helpful article. - An important point for the missing manual for Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was a big problem with my new PC running 8.1 and the reason turned out to be the fact that hidden files failed to show. I ended up&nbsp; generating the missing folders to get my E-mail client to work. I did not realize that these were "hidden" files. --&gt;
 AppData, Roaming, Local....</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem can be assigned to the miserable way that MS displays the Control Panel&nbsp; compared the neat list in Windows XP.&nbsp; That and the missing Manual for Windows 8,1 combined with the awful SEARCH system makes life difficult using Win 8.1.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; The SEARCH system has long been a problem with Microsoft, in that it brings up dozens and sometimes hundreds of unrelated hits. Looking for a unique item which I generated, XYZ.mbx, brought up 381 items, where there should have been a single one. I was
 trying to find where that mbx was located on the disk. - Imposssible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, MS has this unhappy habit of providing "hints" in one file only to direct you to a second one or even more. Straight instructions is something they don't seem to believe in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; That s also why I automatically avoid BING, the MS search engine. </p>

<h2>            Windows 10 crashes, won&#39;t restart, possibly graphics related.</h2>
                    <p>Since going from Windows 8 to 10 I have had frequent crashes where the screen just goes black. Occasionally it recovers in a few seconds but usually it doesn't and I have to manually turn it off. Oddly, it won't turn back on afterwards unless I let it sit
 for quite awhile (to be clear: the computer turns on, but the monitor stays black). This means my computer is a brick for several hours a day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens almost always during video games (although also at what seem like random times), and when it does recover sometimes I see an error that the Nvidia display driver crashed. I think this is likely a bug between Nvidia and Windows 10. I know there
 was a known bug, but none of the solutions I found online helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if anyone has any ideas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Nvidia GeForce GTX 560.</p>

<p>Hi Rells, </p>
<p><br />
Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your inconvenience due to system crash . I will be glad to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the computer screen crashes to a black screen when you are playing games, then the issue could be due to some incorrect settings or due to a corrupt or incompatible driver.
</p>
<p>I suggest you to follow below troubleshooting steps and check if it resolves the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Check the Device status</strong><br />
</p>
<p>Check the device status in the device manager to know if the issue is caused due to a hardware&nbsp;or due to a drivers. Refer to these steps:<br />
a) Press<strong> Windows key + X</strong>, select <strong>Device manager</strong>.<br />
b) Expand the "<strong>Display adapter</strong>" section to locate the display adapter/graphic card.<br />
c) Check if there is a yellow exclamation mark or a red cross mark over it.<br />
d) Right click on device and select <strong>Properties</strong>.<br />
e) In the General tab, check the device status. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Compatibility Mode</strong><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A compatibility mode is a software mechanism in which a software either emulates an older version of software in order to allow incompatible software or files to remain compatible with the computer's newer hardware or software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to go manufacturer's website and install latest available drivers. If you don’t get the driver that is compatible for Windows 10, you can download the driver that is compatible with Windows 8.1 and can make it run in Windows 10 with Compatibility
 mode. </p>
<p>Follow the steps below on how to install driver in compatibility mode:<br />
1. Download the driver from the manufacturer’s website and save it on your local disk.<br />
2. Right click on the setup file of the driver and select "<strong>Properties</strong>".<br />
3. Select "<strong>Compatibility</strong>" Tab.<br />
4. Place a check mark next to "<strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode</strong>" and select operating system from the drop down list.<br />
5. Let the driver install and then check the functionality.</p>

            Hi  PJRyan1, I am Rob, an independent and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. Please remember as independents we are not responsible for the development of Windows or the computer hardware and drivers. If you will work with me I will be here to help until the issue is resolved.
<br /> 
<br />Can you tell us what or how you uninstalled the Intel? For many drivers all you need to do is restart the system.
<br />
<br />Depending on what was uninstalled these may help.

    <title>windows 10 font too small - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tamowen  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 10 font too small</h2>
                    <p>I just got a new computer with Windows 10 loaded on it. The font is way too small. I have gone to control panel/appearance and personalization/Display. The option to "Change only the text size" is grayed out so I am unable to do that.&nbsp;Under "Change Size
 of Items", I have clicked on "use these display settings" and it shows that it is set on 125%. However, the font on THAT page IS 125% and what I want! As soon as I x-out of that page, I'm back to my small font. If I adjust the font to 150%, it is too large!
 I want the 125% that is on that one screen only to apply to my whole computer. Why won't it do that?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also gone to "adjust resolution" and tried changing it, but anything other than the recommended setting of 1920 x1080 leaves me with blurry icons.&nbsp;</p>

            The solution is there, but it's well hidden. In the Start menu select Settings; in Settings select System (not Personalization, as you would expect); in System select Display. Unless you want everything larger, skip Change the size of text, apps, and other
 items; instead click on Advanced display settings; you can change screen resolution for the optimum size with your monitor, or make it larger or smaller if need be, but the default will probably give you the best picture. Click on Advanced sizing of text and
 other items; there you&nbsp;have the option to Change only the text size.&nbsp;Below that heading is&nbsp;a pull-down menu where you can change the text size for Title bars, Menus, Message box, Palette titles, Icons and Tooltips. Set these to suit your personal needs, then
 click Apply to try out your changes.

            <p>I changed all those settings that you recommended and while it helped in some areas, some things were still tiny. (For example, the mail in my inbox was tiny). So I've gone back to the 150% screen size (where the recommended is 125%) and have to zoom out
 on my screen occasionally because it is too big. Better too big than too small I guess!</p>

            <p>The settings I wrote about are for system, not application, font sizes. Unfortunately some applications don't allow us to increase font sizes the way we would like. This is an application specific issue and e-mail clients are, in my experience, the most
 common offenders. I suspect this has to do with interface limitations of one kind or another—which is, ultimately, an example of poor design, putting the user last.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At least there is the option to increase the size of everything, though the increments are a bit limited. Still, if you need to use it, it's a great feature, no doubt preferable to messing with the screen resolution.</p>

            <p>The location of the fonts won't do you any good. It's the magnification of the fonts on screen that you need to know about. I explained in my post above how to enlarge the system fonts on screen. Admittedly it's not as easy as it once was in earlier versions
 of Windows to increase the font display size. And, frankly, in my experience, it doesn't work as well. But it's easier in Windows 10 than it was in Windows 8, which I found to be a nightmare and a half. Still, Windows 7 is/was more like the old Windows where
 stuff could be found where you expected it. For seemingly perverse reasons Microsoft has moved around a lot of standard functions. No doubt they have their own reasons for doing so, but they don't serve users very well. Maybe once we get used to Windows 10
 things won't seem so difficult.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I, too, have a visual impairment. But my solution may not serve you, as there are a wide variety of visual challenges and there is no one size fits all solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rather than trying to answer your questions on a blog like this one, I suggest you look for a local low vision center. They will be able to help you find solutions specific to your needs. That's not to say I won't offer more help if you need it, but your
 local center will have resources I cannot provide here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for fonts getting blurry when they are enlarged, that has more to do with the quality of the computer, its screen and video card than it does with the operating system. You simply cannot get a good quality picture on a cheap computer.</p>

            <p>I just did the most recent win10upgrade, i think they call it. my computer had been down, psu blew with constant reboots from the unintended/forced win7==&gt;win10 change</p>
<p>so, now the fonts are so small, screen fonts, or text or whatever they changed the name and location to..beats me. I had used the top suggestion with the limited ability to increase font size, not font family any longer, just the size in icons, menu pallette
 and such. now, it isnt there anymore. the advanced display settings are gone. so, all i hve is the option to get 125% everywhere? it is pushing the icons off the screen, and is totally unacceptable. I started with the preview/insider program over 2yrs ago,
 and i railed and cried about the dumbing down , making an ok win7 far less so they can fit the OS on a 16gb pocket size whatever and forgetting about the home computers with plenty of storage to house the stuff that is not even an option, gone.
</p>
<p>i use the cortana, cant even find any 'font size' in the stupid thing not there. linux is now in 2 of my machines. at home. if it could handle video better, i would drop all my microsoft OS.
</p>
<p>I wish i could mark one of these helpful, but as of apr 22 or 23, 2017 the update or upgrade thing has moved or changed or deleted that method to increase the icon, pallette, menu task bars sizes. i can change other things&nbsp; as with theme, color , background,
 nice i suppose. but still cant read the print. </p>
<p>why do or did they do this? I have pretty good vision too. </p>

 now is that windows update always fails to install new updates ans MS Edge always give me&nbsp;</span></span>Error Code: INET_E_RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND.<br />
<br />
He made something that is blocking them. <br />
<br />
All others web browsers are working nice: Firefox, Chrome and Opera. It isn't DNS or network problem. The DNS is set up to google's defaults. The oinly problem is that only Edge don't work. Neighter windows update.</p>
<p>

            Hi Diego.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Do you have a System Restore point to roll back to before the tech changed the Settings?  Check here:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If not I would contact him to ask exactly what he changed so you can change it back.  
<br />
<br />If not then Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It  is a better install than any amount of money can buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn what works best and how to apply it with your own hands.  
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

</p><blockquote>Hi Diego. I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.
<br />
<br />
Do you have a System Restore point to roll back to before the tech changed the Settings? Check here:
<a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a> <br />
<br />
If not I would contact him to ask exactly what he changed so you can change it back.
<br />
<br />
If not then Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> <br />
<br />
Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files. Then continue with the other steps.
<br />
<br />
If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now. This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> <br />
<br />
But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as
 long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>. It is a better install than any amount of money can buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn what works best and how to apply it with your own
 hands. <br />
<br />
There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:

<br />
I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Thank you for your answer.<br />

</p><p>It isn't viruss or malware because i've latest kaspersky total security up to date and did a full scan yesterday, don't find nothing.<br />
I tried disables it too, to check if its him thats blocking, so it isn't. Still got error even with kasper disabled.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure its some permission config in somewhere. My account is a local account, maybe some way to convert it to ms account? I cant acess ms store (Code: 0x80072EE7), xbox (just closes after i open it), so there're something that's blocking specific
 ms services...</p>

<h2>            Unable to install manuals</h2>
                    Hi. the problem is this...I am trying to load a Vauxhall TIS disc and it loads so far then this message appears E2491:Creation of cpriodb failed- error code 42 'attach to CD-ROM database cpriodb: romfile 0 has unsound size 1522933773 (8192)' . It then
 askes to uninstall then re install the programme but the same thing happens. I assume its a problem with the installation disc? I have tried to load the disc on several different OS but get to the same point each time. The suppier of the disc says that it
 needs to be installed using windows 7 pro or ultimate. Im not convinced. Any help would be greatfully appreciated.

            You could have a bad disc. But&nbsp;it is more likely that the program can't be installed on Windows XP.
<br />
Have you actually tried to install it on a Windows 7 computer? Does it work on that operating system?<br />
<br />
The manufacturer will not what operating system is supported since they created it.

 &nbsp;Now I can start in the safe mode &nbsp;but cannot use the recovery tool as it says the recovery stick I have is not a valid media. &nbsp;I would like to reload windows 8.1 but of course the tablet came with the program pre-installed so I do not have a physcial copy
 of the program. &nbsp;I went to Best Buy and Staples to see if they could help and they're response was that they could reload Windows at an exorbitant price. &nbsp;any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;

========================================<br />
M4A is an Apple format....you could try the free version <br />
of Apple QuickTime...or the freeware VLC Media Player. <br />
<br />
If you already have the QuickTime player...copy the M4A<br />
file to your desktop / right click it and choose...Open <br />
With / QuickTime.<br />
<br />
Or...you could try installing a Codec Pack that may enable <br />
Windows Media Player to play your M4A files. See link for<br />
Codec Pack at the end of this post.<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System <br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />

            <p>I too had this problem but have I fixed. &nbsp; it I think. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;there is a thread named&nbsp;<strong>Windows 10 attributes</strong>. &nbsp;where I detailed my steps. &nbsp;(sorry my ipad doesn't show me the exact address. so I cannot paste a link to it. )</p>
<p>
</p><p>in short</p>
<p>step 1. &nbsp;make yourself the administrator</p>
<p>
</p><p>step 2. give your administrator &nbsp;full control "permissions" to read/write files. &nbsp;this is not automatic when you make yourself an administrator (I thought it should be and spent many hours tinkering frustrated &nbsp;only to discover but its not automatic but
 instead a whole other step you must do)</p>
<p>
</p><p>step 3 &nbsp;unmark the "read only" box and apply the changes. &nbsp;If you get a box that tells you you need admin rights. click continue. &nbsp; &nbsp; and you will see it change the folders. &nbsp;if it doesn't and you can click okay right away then you need to repeat &nbsp;step 2
 and 3&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In another thread someone said the marked read only attribute is a red herring but I could not save any files until I did step 3</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not disable OneDrive as some have suggested. &nbsp; I have files on there I need to backup elsewhere. and I wasn't sure if disabling OneDrive would have any effect on those files. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;look for the brilliant tech Shawn's steps. &nbsp; his steps are shorter than mine. &nbsp; &nbsp;I am currently trying to find that post again.... &nbsp; i have misplaced it in a sea of folders/storage issues</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>good luck with this Very Frustrating issue.</p>

<p>They used to have the option online for most regions, and recently got rid of it. I'm not sure why. So hopefully they'll bring it back. Cancelling the card is also not a good idea because they'll still try to charge your account and will suspend your account
 until you pay off the balance.</p>

<h2>            windows 7 - windows failed to start 0xc00000f</h2>
                    I have the HP Pavilion dv7 - 4065ei and i get this.<br />
<br />
Windows failed to start up. A recent hardware or software change might be the cause. To fix the problem:<br />
<br />
1. Insert your windows installation disc and restart your computer.<br />
2.choose your language settings and then click next.<br />
3.click "repair your computer."<br />
<br />
If you do not have this disc, contact your system administrator or computer manufacturer for assistance.<br />
<br />
Status: 0xc000000f<br />
<br />
Info: The boot selection failed because a required device is inaccessible<br />
<br />
There is one problem, I do not have any CDs for it. <br />
Everything was working great untill last night. Last night I created a partition from a drive I had using the Computer Administration section of Control Panel. I had a Hard drive which was in use. Before partitioning, it said it had 550 GB free. So i made a
 partition of 30GB so that I can install UBUNTU parallely. I did so, finished all the installing by booting from the disc which had the installation of Ubuntu. Everything went dandy.&nbsp; When it asked me where to install the operating system, I chose the 30GB
 hard drive I had just partitioned and I read online that before I install the ubuntu operating system, I have to format the drive to some format "ext4 Journal...". And so I did during installation of Ubuntu. It installed and updated blissfully. So after the
 installation completed successfully. I decided to restart my computer so that I can go into my windows partition and bring over some files. When I restart, the above message appears.<br />
<br />
I am so worried, there is no way to get into any of the operating systems, I have no backups and have a lot of data. I have data of my university work and projects I was working on. Please someone help ASAP.<br />
<br />
What do i do? please explain simply. as i am not a computer wiz. please and thankyou<br />
<br />
Thank you very very much.<br />
<br />
Kind Regards.<br />
<br />
Bruno<br />

            I find it strange, you are not a computer wiz, yet you are capable enough to setup a partition, download a Linux operating and install it.
<br />
<br />
My suggestion is to try and backup your personal files to external hard disk using Ubuntu installation by copying the files from the unbootable Windows partition to the external hard disk. You should be able to to browse the Windows drive from within Ubuntu.
<br />
<br />
The next thing you will need to do is reinstall Windows 7. Your HP should have a recovery partition, try booting into that and start the recovery process.
<br />
<br />
HP laptops come preloaded recovery partition will allow you to create a set of Hp restore disks that can be used to recover all of the original software in the event of a major problem by tapping the F10 key continuously when the PC is first boots up.<br />
<br />
If yours recovery partition is damaged, you will need to contact HP and request a recovery disc set for your computer:<br />
http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/document?lc=en&amp;dlc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;docname=c00810334<br />
<br />
In future, when you want to try Linux, try doing it in a virtual machine program and learn to backup before making significant changes to your computer.<br />

<h2>            Windows installation issues</h2>
                    <p>Backstory:</p>
<p>I originally built my PC back in 2016.&nbsp; I'll list the components below at the end to avoid confusion.&nbsp; From 2016 to March 2018, my PC would randomly restart giving no errors.&nbsp; It bothered me a little, but not enough to really care to do anything.&nbsp; In March
 2018, I wanted to upgrade my GPU.&nbsp; In order to do so i had to download new drivers (according to the manual), so I did.&nbsp; The restarts got progressively worse and started to get random BSOD. For the most, part they were always different.&nbsp; Looking online, I
 could not find any good solutions except do a clean install.&nbsp; I did not have anyway to back up my files, and i didn't have any important ones on the PC so i didn't.&nbsp; I did a clean install, completely removing Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>April 2018:</p>
<p>So I went to reinstall windows using my original Windows USB and Key I purchased from Amazon.&nbsp; When attempting to install, I would get a dark blue screen (same color as the Windows setup screen, not the color as the BSOD) and it would freeze.&nbsp; So I thought
 maybe using an ISO would work (after spending hours talking with someone from Microsoft this was recommended).&nbsp; Nope.&nbsp; With the created media file, i am able to get to the windows setup screen, where it shows "Getting files ready for installation".&nbsp; At this
 point, the PC either crashes and reboots and restarting the process, or it just freezes.&nbsp; I replaced my motherboard, RAM, and SSD, but i still get the same results.&nbsp; Since I was already in the process of moving from England to Germany (I am active duty), I
 had to put this on hold&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>June 2018:</p>
<p>I picked up where I left off, I tried re-creating the media file from Microsoft.&nbsp; Same issues.&nbsp; Then i thought to retry my original USB.&nbsp; Same issues as before, but this time I noticed i was able to get into Safe Mode.&nbsp; While in safe mode, the windows setup
 process was able to complete up to installing updates and had to restart.&nbsp; Now, I am stuck and dont know what to do.&nbsp; I removed the Windows USB, and when i rebooted my computer i get the windows logo and it ends up freezing.&nbsp; If a video helps, i can make one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Yes, not the best news you want to hear. These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Now, get ready to go back to your previous version. I recommend Windows 10 1703 because its the most stable and efficient release to date. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 4: how to recover your files from Windows.old:

<br />
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

            Hey EaglesRule.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Make sure all other drives and peripherals are unplugged.  Update the BIOS or UEFI firmware to latest, or reset to Defaults, making sure SATA controller is set to AHCI. 
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  If you're using another PC to do this then uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on first screen press Shift + F10 to open a Command Prompt, type the following commands followed by Enter key:
<br />DISKPART
<br />LIST DISK
<br />SEL DIS # (replace # with the disk # of the Windows disk from list in previous command)
<br />CLEAN
<br />EXIT
<br />
<br />Close Command Box, on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen choose Unallocated Space, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

            This would suggest a hardware issue. 
<br />
<br />Try simplifying your configuration by keeping only your mouse and keyboard attached, that means:
<br />
<br />    Disconnecting multiple display monitors.
<br />    Remove discrete video cards, use the on-board graphics if your motherboard supports it.
<br />    Swap out memory modules - a RAM module might be corrupt - you can also ensure RAM sticks are installed slots 1 and 3. Your RAM modules might be corrupt, try scanning them for errors. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/use-the-memory-diagnostics-tool-to-check-for-errors-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/use-the-memory...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />    If you have more than one hard disk installed, disconnect all except the target disk where Windows 10 will be installed.
<br />
<br />    Reset your BIOS Defaults.
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-defaults-nvram-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-...</a>
<br />
<br />    Disconnect all external devices, since connected devices can sometimes confuse setup. 
<br />
<br />If setup is successful after performing these tasks, you can reinstall each removed component.

            Could you try removing the SSD and install only to the 2 TB mechanical drive?
<br />
<br />Did you disable secure boot in the BIOS and UEFI Boot sources?

<p>No I haven't. I have run the SFC and DISM and the Troubleshooter and I have also tried to update my 1511 version with the Update Assistant and MediaCreationTool and from an ISO-file.
</p>
<p>All uppdates fails and ends with a restore of my 1511 version. I have a lot of big log files with error codes 0x80004005, 0x80070002, 0x80073712, 0x80070490. One error notice someware sticks out, indicating that the Update Database is corrupt.</p>
<p>I have more or less given up and right now I just want to stop all recurring meaningless update attempts.

            Hi Tomas,<br />
<br />
<br />
Learning that you already used a media creation tool to reinstall Windows 10, and still didn't resolve the issue you're experiencing with error codes popping up on your PC, you might be having a deeper problem which is your hardware.<br />
<br />
That being said, you may visit your PC manufacturer for further assistance to make sure that you don't have a faulty hardware.<br />
<br />
Keep your media creation tool as it will be handy.<br />
<br />
You may share with us how you will get this issue resolved to help those who are currently experiencing this kind of issue as well.<br />
<br />
We're just a post away should you have further queries.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>This issue might occur if the boot cache files along with some system files are corrupt or broken. This issue might also occur if the hard drive is going bad.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong>Important</strong><span>:</span> System Restore will not revert any of the non-system files like documents, email, music, etc. to a previous state. These types files are completely unaffected by System Restore. If your intention with
 this tool was to recover a deleted non-system file, try using a file recovery program instead of System Restore.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>One of the best ways you can improve your PC's performance is by optimizing the hard drive. Windows includes features to help optimize the different types of drives that PCs use today. No matter which type of drive your PC uses, Windows automatically
 chooses the optimization that's right for your drive.</span></p>

<p><span><span><strong>Important</strong><span>: While performing check disk on the hard drive, if any bad sectors are found, then check disk will try to repair that sector. Any data available on that sector might be lost.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You may run the SFC scannow tool and restart the computer to check if the issue persists. SFC /scannow is a super-useful command you can use in any Windows version. When the SFC (System File Checker) command is used with the /scannow switch,
 the tool will scan all of the important Windows files on your computer and replace them as necessary. Missing and corrupt operating system files (like many DLL files) are arguably the biggest cause of major Windows issues.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Refer to these steps to perform a SFC scan:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a) Press <strong><em>Windows key + X</em></strong>, select <strong><em>Command prompt (Admin)</em></strong> to bring up elevated command prompt.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the command prompt type the following command: <strong><em>sfc<span>&nbsp;
</span>/scannow</em></strong> and press enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c) After the scan, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</span></span></p>

    <title>Deleted an Encrypted Bitlocker Partition - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ctu.cny  say:</h3>
<h2>            Deleted an Encrypted Bitlocker Partition</h2>
                    Here's the clearest desciption I can can up with:<br />
<br />
WAS RUNNING: Seagate 320GB HD -60GB Storage Partition (D:) -240GB Windows &amp; Everything Else Partition (C:) -additional 100MB "System Reserved" partitions -Hidden? partitions (Not sure, because I was using Bitlocker) Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit w/256 AES BitLocker
 encryption on both partitions.<br />
<br />
It had been a while since installation, and I was receiving BSODs everytime I restarted/shutdown. I figured I would do my normal routine: Backup all my documents from my Windows partition (C:) to my Storage partition (D:), delete, recreate, and format the C:
 partition, and reinstall Windows. After installation, I could simply type my password into the D: drive and unencrypt it. I've donw it this way DOZENS (yes, that's accurate) of times.<br />
<br />
This time, however, when I deleted the C: partition (using the Windows installation disc), ALL (let me dwell on that for a moment..... A L L ....)of my partitions were deleted. After a few brief moments of Turrets Syndrome, my instincts kicked in, and I shut
 off all power to the drive to preserve as much as possible. No formatting was done. It simply says that I have 290ish GB of Unallocated Space.<br />
<br />
Using another computer, I ordered and received a 2TB Western Digital HD. I removed the old HD, installed the new one, and installed Windows without a hitch. I attached the old HD using another SATA hookup (they are both SATA). I have tried using EASEUS to recover
 the hidden Storage partition (D:). I have found numerous variations of 294GB, 100MB partitions, and even found a partition with 60GB (BINGO!) but it won't let me retreive it.<br />
<br />
So here's the bottom line: Is there ANY way I can recover my partition, encrypted or not (I have the key), using my new Hard Drive and Old Hard Drive? Gimme anything.... Program names, processes, something please?!? Any help will be greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance, Richard

            I suspect you will have to engage the services of a commercial recovery business to retrieve your data, which could be costly. The bottom line is really: If you have important or irreplaceable files on your machine then you must back them up at regular
 intervals to an external storage medium that is kept well away from your PC for most of the time. I actually alternate between two of them - hard disks are cheap!
