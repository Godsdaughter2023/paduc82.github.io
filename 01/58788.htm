                    <span>I have a Surface Pro 3 which has the latest Windows updates. Ever since the last update, the cursor moves erratically around
 the screen by itself without me being anywhere near the keyboard or touch pad. I have checked that the latest drivers are installed and have run a full virus scan. I have also researched the issue which quite a few other users appear to have experienced. I
 have tried uninstalling the touch screen driver and mouse drivers but the problem still remains. I can send screen shots of the effect of the cursor movements which makes it impossible to use any application.</span>

<p>Thank you for your response.&nbsp; As advised in my original email,&nbsp; my Surface Pro has the latest Windows update and the latest mouse and touch screen drivers.&nbsp; If I uninstall the touch screen driver and do not do a restart so that it is automatically reinstalled,
 the problem of the demented cursor goes away but of course the touch screen no longer works.&nbsp; This implies that the problem is related to the touch screen driver but as the latest version is installed how do I resolve the problem?</p>

<p>Hi Johann</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried, a number of times, uninstalling the touch pad driver and restarting to allow Windows to automatically reinstall the driver but the problem remains.&nbsp; The link you provided refers to Windows version 1607 and, as advised in my original
 email, I am running the latest version 1709.&nbsp; Also, in the touch pad driver properties, the "Roll Back Driver" option is greyed out.&nbsp; At this stage I have had to disable the touch pad driver to be able to use my Surface Pro.</p>

Thank you for your assistance. Neither of the suggestions above has resolved the problem.&nbsp; The Surface Pro now also hangs on startup and it takes numerous tries to get it to boot up.&nbsp; I have now tried a reset and complete reinstallation of Windows with the
 result that the problem is even worse with&nbsp;touch screen, mouse or keyboard not working if I manage to get it to start up.&nbsp; This is my second Surface Pro with the first replaced under warranty due to battery problems.&nbsp; I have loved using the Surface Pro but
 I will never buy another Microsoft product.&nbsp; I am now investigating a replacement in a different brand.

<h2>            Bitlocker Question</h2>
                    <p>Yes, hello, MS-Community...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you help me figure out what's gone wrong here? I've been trying to get the context menu to show bitlocker back on my work pc, but when I enter the registry information from this file ( COMMANDS:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00<br />

</p>
<p>I know there are more bitlocker commands than this and I'd like to make them appear but thus far, I haven't been able to figure out why I can't coax them out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following screenshot was done in VMware and shows the extended command list after having entered the registry information:</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question to you is this - How can I make it to where I'm seeing the extended commands for the bitlocker stuff as shown here, from my virtual machine session:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have ran SFC and the results have come up clean, DISM has not returned anything bad and I appear to be up to date...is it possible that I've turned some shell functionality off?&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Bauser
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />You might want to try performing a repair upgrade to see if it resolve this issue.
<br />
<br />First, if you do have BitLocker Drive Encryption enabled, make sure it is turned off. 
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)
<br />
<br />Type the following command to unlock your BitLocker drive with 48-digit recovery key:
<br />manage-bde -unlock D: -RecoveryPassword YOUR-BITLOCKER-RECOVERY-KEY-HERE
<br />
<br />If you can remember your BitLocker user password, type the following command. After pressing Enter, you’ll be prompted to enter the user password.
<br />manage-bde -unlock D: -Password
<br />
<br />Next turn off BitLocker Encryption:
<br />manage-bde -off D:
<br />
<br />Exit then restart. 
<br />
<br />Proceed then perform the repair upgrade:
<br />
<br />Download the Media Creation Tool Now
<br /><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the MediaCreationTool.exe file then click Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement:
<br />
<br />Select the option Upgrade this PC now if you want to upgrade right away,
<br />
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. If you don’t, review the following article for instructions how to upgrade to Windows 10 Anniversary Update on a system with limited space:
<br />
<br />Please note, you have the option of choosing what you would like to keep, which includes personal files, apps and settings.
<br />
<br />If you want to perform a new install or just keep your files click Change what to keep. Once you have chosen the desired options, click Install to begin.
<br />
<br />This will be your screen for a little while. During the installation, your computer will restart several times.
<br />
<br />After the first restart, Windows 10 setup will resume. You will notice the setup experience has once again been refined from the previous animated circle. This will be your screen for a while. When complete, Windows 10 setup will restart automatically.
<br />
<br />Sign into your account.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 completes application updates and post setup tasks.
<br />
<br />That’s it, the Windows 10 Feature Update is installed.You can check Windows Update for latest updates, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates.
<br />
<br />How to prepare your computer before upgrading?
<br />
<br />Although updating to Windows 10 version 1903 is a relatively simple process, similar to a repair upgrade; users should perform some basic pre-requisites before initiating the upgrade.
<br />
<br />If you are finding it difficult to carry out some of the steps described below, please review detailed instructions how to perform them:

<p>Hey, Andre, I remember you. Hopefully, you have been doing well, it's been awhile since we last talked!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not trying to upgrade anything, I'm just trying to make some additional commands appear. Upgrading isn't an option for me at this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upgrading my machine will not solve the issue and will put me behind hours, weeks and years of work, whereas I believe this can be solved using a simple script, I just don't know how to get them to appear again like I did last time, but this is what I currently
 have from my script:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Replicating this issue on a different virtual machine, I've found that by default, the extra commands do not appear in the context menu, instead, I get 'manage-bde-dev' which is just jargon for the bitlocker stuff if you're into programming and development.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Inputting these commands only makes some of the bitlocker entries display, I can't get the other one's back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The command only edits 7 registry entries, as you can see here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Virtual Machine)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you look at it further, I made the commands originally disappear by adding "LegacyDisable" to each of the respective entries. I am trying to get the additional commands to appear as seen in my first screenshot. The script I have, when entered originally,
 hides the commands and bitlocker indefinitely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Work Desktop)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>As stated before, I can't go to 1903.</p>

<br />Here is an easy way you can try adding it back.

<br />Download the reg files from the following forum page to turn it on and it should do it automatically:

<p>No luck, unfortunately...everything is fine though. I'm just not sure what I did that could have caused those extra few commands to appear in that one instance. By default, it looks like we can't simply get them to come back. Do we really need bitlocker,
 what's the purpose of it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>From what I understand, it's encryption based stuff, but I don't have much of a plan to use it as we're using other means to protect our computers.&nbsp;</p>

            BitLocker is not a required feature, but its included in Windows 10 Pro or higher and encrypts files and folders so your files are protected from theft and espionage. If you work in a company, you might be required to use. Windows 10 Home does not include BitLocker, so, its not a required function...
<br />
<br />If you don't need it, then I would ignore it. 
<br />
<br />You can learn more about how it works...

<h2>            typing UNICODE characters from the on-screen-keyboard of a tablet under Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I would like to know how may UNICODE characters be typed from the on-screen-keyboard of my tablet which has Windows 10 as OS? Because neither trying to type them as they are typed on a normal keyboard by pressing simultaneously the left-ALT key while pressing
 successively the figures on the numeric keypad, nor using the distinct key typing facility offered by the on-screen-keyboard by typing one-at-a-time each key beggining with the left-ALT key and continuing with the figures from the numeric keypad seem to work!</p>

<h2>            Connection status unknown, DPS and missing permissions for Trustedinstaller</h2>
                    Connection status unknown, <br />
DPS and <br />
missing permissions for Trustedinstaller <br />
<br />
Hi, I am having the problem that my computer can't connect to the internet. <br />
<br />
A bit strange, because when I open the dialog to connect to the network I am told that the computer already is connected at full speed.<br />
<br />
But the network icon in the tray warns 'Connection status unknown. The dependency service or group failed to start.'
<br />
<br />
And when I open the wizard for connecting to internet there is a message "wizard cannot continue" plus the following tecknical details (this is a French version):<br />
<br />
"GUID du composant : {7071ECA3-663B-4BC1-A1FA-B97F3B917C55} <br />
Fichier du composant : [C:\Windows\system32\connect.dll] <br />
Erreur : (0x800706BA) &lt;message d'erreur introuvable&gt;. <br />
<br />
Infos supplémentaires : <br />
Failed to detect Internet connectivity"<br />
<br />
This frustrating experience originated months ago. I was busy at the time trying out several different antivirus programs, one after the other. I uninstalled the present antivirus after having tried it for a month, then went on to install the next one, just
 to see if that was the ultimate antivirus that I really would like to buy and use. Then, when I installed the next antivirus, I was told that it wasn't necessary for me to uninstall the old antivirus first. The installation program of the new antivirus would
 take care of that.&nbsp; Then I proceeded to install Kaspersky antivirus, and after that I tried Bitdefender, under the presumption that the installation program would take care of the uninstallation of the old antivirus.
<br />
<br />
I don't know if this actually produced some kind of conflict, or if&nbsp; it's only my imagination, but it was somewhere at this point that the problem started. Perhaps something happened in the registry?<br />
<br />
1. Unfortunately I didn't have any restore points of any use, probably because I hadn't reserved enough space on my system.<br />
<br />
2. I tried the command<br />
ping www.google.com<br />
at cmd.exe as administrator, but no, there was no contact with internet.<br />
<br />
3. I tried the command ipconfig and got two IP addresses correctly as an answer, other media were disconnected.<br />
<br />
4. I also tried the commands <br />
netsh winsock reset catalog<br />
netsh int ipv4 reset reset.log<br />
netsh int ipv6 reset reset.log<br />
and was told after that to restart the computer, but it didn't help.<br />
<br />
5. Of course the first thing I did to try and get out on the internet was to try Diagnose and Repair, but it still to this day the whole time says 'Network Diagnostics cannot run because the Diagnostics Policy Service is not running'&nbsp; I then get the option
 to open the Service Control Manager to manually start the Diagnostics Policy Service. But when I try to do that it remains stuck and the DPS won't start.<br />
<br />
6. In my investigations on the internet I came across some interesting information in Microsoft Answers referring to
<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/943996" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/943996</a><br />
It turns out, in this article, that ... <br />
"For the "Diagnostic Policy Service" service, the issue may occur when the account Trustedinstaller is missing the permissions for the key below:<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\DPS\Parameters<br />
<br />
The permission needed is: Full Control, Read."<br />
<br />
When comparing with my Win7 machine it turned out that indeed those two permissions are checked in this registry key. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Opening the registry editor in the Vista system confirmed that Trustedinstaller (in French CREATEUR PROPRIETAIRE) was missing the two permissions. I checked the two boxes, but here I ran into a problem: when I clicked 'Apply' the checks disappeared. Can anybody
 please tell me what is the problem here? And is this the solution to the whole connectivity issue?<br />
<br />
So, when the Diagnostic Policy Service is up and running, will it also open access once again to the internet?
<br />
<br />
My&nbsp; computer is a Packard Bell EasyNote BU with MS Windows Vista Home Premium 32-bit SP2.<br />
<br />
The forum queries about this issue are a couple of years old. Does this mean that the problem has been solved without my noticing it?<br />
<br />
Without access from the computer to internet it is difficult to diagnose and repair the computer, to solve the problem.<br />
This is a last-ditch effort, I would be so thankful if somebody comes around with the solution.<br />

    <title>Sound Not Working With Steam&#47;Battle.net&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brotuulaan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sound Not Working With Steam&#47;Battle.net&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;This is something I ran into a few weeks back while I was playing Diablo III. As any of you Diablo III players know, you are required to use WotC's proprietary client, Battle.net. Oddly, while I was playing Diablo III and watching Netflix, the sound and
 video started glitching. The sound was as if someone slowed down the stream --&nbsp;also making it poppy and static-y --&nbsp;and the video on Netflix was slowed down to match. I think that Diablo's video feed was just fine, though. I tried YouTube, and that was the
 same way -- slow video and audio.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just today, I was playing MTG 2014 when the same thing happened -- only this time it was with Steam running. Closing the client was not enough to fix the problem, but when it was finally resolved, I noticed that it had finished downloading an update to another
 game and was no longer in the task tray I'm running 8.1, so it was in the pop-up box). Now YouTube works fine. Also, Spotify and WMP were not working at all. They were either not playing at all or going so slowly that they were far more harshly affected by
 the issue than YouTube, Netflix, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I'm including a link to a video I made via GeForce ShadowPlay, and it shows what I'm talking about with the A/V slowdown. It's in DropBox, but I don't know a better way to include it if this post doesn't work the way I think it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://db.tt/k3MA5NY9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://db.tt/k3MA5NY9</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;If anyone knows the problem, I would surely appreciate the help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>---EDIT---</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just had it happen again today, but I was running only IE11 and Windows Media Center. I paused the movie to do a few other things and come back to it. When I went back, oddly enough,&nbsp; unpausing the movie was enough to temporarily fix the problem, apparently.
 Could it be a .dll file, or something, that is stopped then restarted when WMC pauses? If so, it would make sense that only stopping MtG and Diablo III were enough since they were still running in the background previously.</p>

            I think the issue may have something to do with an audio peripheral. I have Pro Tools, and it requires external hardware to interface with the program, and it takes over many functions usually handled inside the computer. I returned my speakers to the
 computer directly rather than through the interface today when I was having this problem every five minutes or so, and the issue stopped occurring. It is a Scarlett 2i2 interface, in case any of you other nerds are interested or have some ideas.

            <p>I have been running my computer without the peripheral in-line, and the problem has been non-existent since then. Since it has been so many months since that point, my guess is that I have successfully rooted out the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are having this issue with your audio/video (slowed/low fps/bit-sounding until you close your game/media programs) and you have some sort of audio peripheral, try removing that from the mix. Apparently, something as simple as running your speakers
 through an audio peripheral (mine is for recording in Pro Tools) can mess with your audio/video processing, requiring a reboot of media programs.</p>

<h2>            Should all my services be running&#63;</h2>
                    I recently got a Zperm virus and called a company about removing it. While in my computer, they saw that a lot of my services were not running and he had a cow! Also, he flipped out about some of my drivers not running either. I have a brand new Surface
 Pro 3 with Windows 10 Pro installed and it has been great, still is even with all the services not running. Do i need to turn the services on? Is that a manual thing i need to do or is there a program that does it automatically?&nbsp;

<p>Thank you for the website. I looked it over and my services matched Black Viper's. So if my services in the "Startup Type" column are default and match the W10P configurations given by Black Viper, its not a big deal if half of them aren't running in the
 "Status" column?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Restore removed applications after system restore</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dear community, after a system restore on my HP laptop running Windows 10 I found a file on my desktop showing removed apps. All of these were preinstalled&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>when I bought the laptop, amongst these are HP and realtec drivers. I have no system restore points, laptop setting for this was off , and not rescue disk. Is there any way I can get these apps back, except for having to download and reinstall them (which
 would be ok for the likes of Skype, zip7, but not for the specific HP and Realtec drivers, as I'm a technical</p>
<p>person. Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to re-install the apps back. You may also use your favorite search engine and look for software's that would help you recover the applications which were lost after System restore.

<h2>            Feature Request - Folder up arrow icon</h2>
                    I know that Vista and 7 probably have great folder navigation advancements, but I would still ask that you add the up arrow icon back to windows explorer toolbars.&nbsp; I run into situations many times a day when I would use the up arrow if I had it, but instead
 either use the keyboard shortcut or have to manually select folders from either the folder view or the path.&nbsp; I use many files across many projects at work and home, and this would be a

            In Windows Vista and Windows 7, the address bar shows the full path to a folder.&nbsp; For example:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Computer &gt; Disk &gt; Folder 1 &gt; Folder 2 &gt; Folder 3<br />
<br />
You can go directly to a disk or folder by clicking its name.&nbsp; Clicking the next-to-last folder in the path does the same thing as the up arrow icon.<br />

    <title>Virtual Memory on a tablet - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fredrik coulter  say:</h3>
<h2>            Virtual Memory on a tablet</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 10 Pro on an i5 tablet.&nbsp; It has 4 Gig of RAM, and a 512 Gig SSD.&nbsp; The RAM is pretty low, but it's impossible to upgrade the level of RAM since&nbsp;the chips are&nbsp;soldered in.&nbsp; I've been told that using the SSD for virtual memory tends to
 kill the drive quickly since there's&nbsp;a limited number of read/write cycles on a drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tablet also has a slot for an microSD card.&nbsp; My thought is to use the microSD card for my local cache of my OneDrive files and for my page files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this doable?&nbsp; What are the pluses and minuses?&nbsp; Any tips that you'd care to share?</p>

</p><p><span>Hi Fredrick, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I realize that you want to use the microSD card for the local cache of the OneDrive files and for the page files. I will try to help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are planning to keep the microSD card in the tablet then you can use that card for storing local cache files of OneDrive and also for the page file purpose, however you might encounter performance issues on the tablet.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Keep us informed to help you further.</span></p>

    <title>Bug&#58; Trusted Windows Store application icons do not appear when - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markbratanov  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bug&#58; Trusted Windows Store application icons do not appear when searching</h2>
                    <p>I have found an interesting bug for both of my Windows 10 devices. One is a desktop pc and the other is a newly purchased Dell XPS 13 laptop running Win10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When searching for an application using cortana or general search, all Trusted Window Store Applications appear as if they don't have their icon.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example search for "Settings" and icon does not appear:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/67af4501-25d3-4477-b05b-75da73b4d6e1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/67af4501-25d3-4477-b05b-75da73b4d6e1" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Search for Netflix and the icon does not appear.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4205bdd0-f9c2-4960-b053-3b39352307e7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4205bdd0-f9c2-4960-b053-3b39352307e7" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly enough,&nbsp;&nbsp;those icons DO appear in the regular menu and as Metro Tiles. It happens only during search.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/924ac486-dd05-4552-9f9e-468c45865662" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/924ac486-dd05-4552-9f9e-468c45865662" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Lastly, this anomaly only affects Trusted Window Store Applications, not Desktop Apps.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Example search for the desktop app "Illustrator":</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/33242cfb-ea38-4246-8643-de87186f6073" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/33242cfb-ea38-4246-8643-de87186f6073" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Example with both Desktop app and Windows Trusted App:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ece782f2-9930-4d21-874f-550da4890ead" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ece782f2-9930-4d21-874f-550da4890ead" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas what may be causing this? A corrupt registry value? What is the likelihood that there is something corrupt with my account -- seeing this happens on both of my Windows 10 devices?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your suggestions or comments would be appreciated. Thanks :)</p>
<p><br />

    <title>Can we have some way to exclude folders from the Photos app&#39;s - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> シェド  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can we have some way to exclude folders from the Photos app&#39;s general view&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Will Microsoft please make a small revision to the Photos app, in that, allow us, the users, to exclude folders from being seen on the
<strong>Collection</strong> and <strong>Album</strong> views of the app? <strong>
It's fine if</strong> pictures inside the excluded folders are opened <strong>directly</strong> and the images in the
<strong>same folder </strong>can still be scrolled through within the app like before, but what I'm asking is just a way to exclude it
<strong>from the general view</strong>. As I said, just&nbsp;not shown on&nbsp;<strong>Collection</strong> and
<strong>Album</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a pretty simple feature and I'm sure a lot of people would welcome it instead of being forced to move their photos out of the Pictures folder.</p>

 </blockquote> <p>The fix you posted doesn't work. Many are reporting the same thing on reddit, the forums here,&nbsp;and on news sites. The feature disappeared on the xbox beta app then the xbox app after the latest update. And it isn't just the tv listings it is also the universal remote and the volume controls. Everything that has to do with&nbsp; TV controls was removed, uninstalling doesn't bring them back. This thread should not be marked as answered because it is far from answered.</p>

            <p>If you have the C:\ESD\Windows folder, then you can create an ISO of the contents using something like ImgBurn &lt;<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/index.php?act=download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/index.php?act=download</a>&gt;. You can save that ISO to your HDD, then use it to create a DVD. Kind of a roundabout way I guess, but it works just fine :-)</p><hr /><p>&nbsp;SC Tom</p>

    <title>Windows Media Center won&#39;t change channels on my STB - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexanderchou  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Media Center won&#39;t change channels on my STB</h2>
                    i'm running win7, with a hauppauge winTV-HVR-2250. trying to setup live tv with u-verse, using a motorola VIP-1200 set top box. i have the IR blaster positioned correctly in front of the STB.<br />
i've tried every method of configuring the IR blaster, but NONE work. (automatic, remote control code selection, and IR learning). i've also tried the trick of holding down the remote button hidden from the IR sensor, and moving it into and out of the sensor's
 vision for both the automatic and IR learning setup. this did not work either (although it did say it "learned" successfully, but then does not have any effect when attempting to change channels).<br />
i majored in EE/CS, and have worked for 11 years in the tech industry, including 4 years designing consumer electronics silicon, so i don't believe i'm not following the directions correctly (re: not user error).
<br />
my logitech universal remote was able to work as soon as i told the setup what set-top box i had. i don't see why MCE can't do the same. if an appropriate solution cannot be identified, i might have to jump to the Apple bandwagon, and recommend the same to
 the dozens of ppl that rely on me for tech advice. Mr. Jobs' promise of "it just works" is increasingly compelling given all the BS i've put up with over the years dealing with crappy microsoft products that go by the mantra of "it sometimes works". FIX THIS.<br />

            Hi, <br />
thanks for your response. I've tried these steps numerous times, and media center says that it learned the remote correctly, but on step p) test channel changing screen, the channel never changes, no matter how long i wait. i've tried numerous positions for
 the IR blaster on the STB, and currently is positioned between the status LEDs and the menu button, which is where i read the IR receiver is located.<br />
my windows is already fully updated.<br />
can somebody just add the codes to media center when i select motorola stb? as i mentioned, my logitech remote did this just fine.<br />

<p>Scroll down to the following registry location:-</p>

<br />
In this key will be the dword EnableDebounce the default value of which is 1. Set this to 0 and reboot. Debounce will now be off,now retry the learning process.</p>

            i tried dozens of suggestions (and each suggestion numerous times, just to be sure), including all the ones in this forum, and nothing ever ended up working. i gave up and my HTPC is sitting on a shelf collecting dust. my solution now is to use a tivo
 series 2 (this is what i had beforehand, and i already have lifetime on it). i cannot record HD, but it's working, which is more than i can say for ***removed*** microsoft products.<br />

            <p>I have a very similar setup as the original question. Win7 media center, HVR-2250 but a Motorola VIP2262.</p>
<p>Still I have the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/e243ea62-edab-4d2a-87f4-f87f0f852759" title="S.Sengupta">
S.Sengupta</a> was on the right track with that is has to do with debounce processing. However, I believe that the suggested registry setting only affect how Win7 interprets IR signals sent to it.</p>
<p>What I believe is needed is to alter how Win7 sends IR signals to the STB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I follow the steps provided by <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/a90b82fe-94b1-4fac-a57a-e44d594c254a" title="Arya S Asok">
Arya S Asok</a>, I get stuck on step l (L). Win7 goes into a never ending loop asking for the same key to be pressed unless you point at Win7 then point the remote away and press another key and then point at Win7 again.</p>
<p>However, even when all commands are programmed this way, Win7 cannot control the STB accurately. Only some digits gets through (and some digits only get through sometimes).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that the VIP2262 uses debounce with an alternating suffix that is shared for the complete remote. I.e. if the suffix is 0 for the first key (4) pressed, it will be 1 for the second key (2). If you would press the same key again (2) it would go
 back to 0 and it would do the same if you pressed any other key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to program my universal remote from Logitech Harmony and it found the VIP2262 in the database and the remote functions perfectly so it is possible to program the debounce but I haven't found a way from Win7 to do this.</p>
