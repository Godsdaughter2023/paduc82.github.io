<h2>            Diablo III crashes caused by windows 8</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently bought a Lenovo G700 and have&nbsp;been having&nbsp;sudden freezes and crashes when playing Diablo III and World of Warcraft.&nbsp; I ran Microsoft System scanner and found no viruses.&nbsp; I then ran the system file check but have no idea how to read this file,
 the scan reported some corrupt files that could not be fixed.&nbsp; There is no constant theme to when this happens, I have updated all drivers and can't find a single problem.&nbsp; Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks </p>

            <p>Hi Dylan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>One of the most common reasons for a slow computer are programs running in the background.
</span>Follow these methods and check if it helps:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> The <strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command will scan all protected system files, and replace corrupted files with a cached copy that is located in a compressed folder at
<em>%WinDir%</em>\System32\dllcache. <br />
The %WinDir% placeholder represents the Windows operating system folder. For example, C:\Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fix Corrupted system file refer to<strong> step 3 </strong>from this link and also refer “<strong>How to manually replace a corrupted system file with a known good copy of the file</strong>” by clicking “For more information” from this link</p>

<h3> xnr amazing  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#91;Fix&#93; &#38;quot&#59;Avoid Me&#38;quot&#59; Reputation</h2>
                    
<p>For everyone that has fallen victim to the flawed reputation system and have been placed in the "Avoid Me" reputation category, here is a fix that I hope will work for everyone else.&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Go to this forum section&nbsp;http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/xbox_one_support/f/4276.aspx&nbsp;and make a new thread.</p>
<p>2) Title to thread something along the lines of "Flawed reputation system "Avoid Me"</p>
<p>3) Explain your situation. Give a brief description of what you do when you play Xbox. For example you could say "The only thing I do when I got on is play [insert game]. Mention that a lot of other people have been have been getting placed in the "Avoid
 Me" zone and there is definitely something wrong.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone wants to know, this is what I had said:&nbsp;<a href="http://gyazo.com/5e2a88205d67931d8c6726b15938e934" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://gyazo.com/5e2a88205d67931d8c6726b15938e934</a></p>
<p>4) Simply wait for a response. I was given one within 12 hours. (you can find the response at the bottom of the home page for the forum section when you are signed in on xbox.com or you can check your email) They told me they are currently investigating
 a possible issue with the reputation system and they restored my rep back to "Good Player" so I can now go back to playing multiplayer.</p>
<p>If you do believe you have been placed in the "Avoid Me" zone because of the reputation system flaw, please follow these steps. The enforcement team can't simply restore every single xbox member's rep to "Good Player" due to the case that their are mostly
 likely a few people that have legitimately been placed in their due to their actions on XBL, but for the most part, all these "Avoid Me" states are being given due to a flaw in the system.</p>
<p>I wish the best for everyone that has had this inconvenience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi there, and thanks for informing us of some possible good news!</p>
<p>I contacted Xbox enforcement around two weeks ago and my topic is still pending moderator approval. I cannot seem to locate the response they gave to you, as the last post within that section of the forum appears to be from the 9th of September.</p>
<p>It would be a relief to have my reputation issue resolved before the release of Forza Horizon 2, as it would be nice to play online and connect to sessions. I look forward to hearing from you.</p>
<p>Thanks for posting this topic!</p>

<p>He is talking of PMs. It's very likely that the enforcement team is not answering your forum POST in the forum but send you a PM instead.

 they are different from the xbl PMs ;)</p>

<p>Thanks for everyone's responses on the matter. It turns out that I did receive a PM from one of the members of the enforcement team on the 20th of September. As you can already tell, I'm not too familiar with the Xbox forums, therefore I wasn't aware that
 personal conversations existed. &gt;.&lt;</p>
<p>Although one of the enforcement team members responded to me, it seemed as if it were another one of those useless, copied and pasted responses. All it said was for me to check out my reputation through the enforcement website, and I may have been reported
 due to cheating or harassment. I was already aware of both of these things. </p>

<p>@Mechanic, the first time I posted in the enforcement forums was a day or 2 after I was placed in "Avoid Me". Customer support linked me the the enforcement section for the Xbox 360 and I was given one of those copy and paste messages.</p>
<p>Then, when I posted it again in the enforcement section for the Xbox One, which I only found out existed because of someone linking it in another thread, I was given a reply and had my reputation restored within 12 hours.</p>
<p>Make sure you make a new thread in the link I have at the top.</p>

<p>Having the same issue. I only have 7 complaints of "cheating" which clearly is sore losers giving me bogus negative feedback. I've never had an issue with my reputation and the fact that I get put into the "red" zone over that simply isn't right. Although
 I know its highly unlikely, I really hope that this issue can be fixed. I posted in the enforcement forum and also got nothing but an automated message, but I'm hoping to get another response soon. As opposed to an algorithm being the reason I can't enjoy
 online gameplay Microsoft should incorporate a manual inspection to ensure its loyal customers don't get wrongfully punished.</p>

<p>I have posted another topic within the enforcement forum and I'm awaiting a response from them. I really do hope they restore my reputation.</p>
<p>As you can clearly see, I have been receiving more false reports: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/9MAfOiO.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>We are only five days into October and I'm already having my reputation for this month hindered once again. The only game I have been playing is Forza Horizon 2, and the reports must have been filed due to the fact that I'm already rank 85 and seem to come
 1st position every couple of races.</p>
<p>I hope everyone else manages to get this issue resolved for them as well.</p>

<h2>            File search fails to find files in directories on USB drive Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I'm going to save various thousands of words by inserting images.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, these are the drives.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c5fe91d1-ae40-4595-8306-3334f17c82a4?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c5fe91d1-ae40-4595-8306-3334f17c82a4?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Searches on M: don't work.&nbsp; Note the indicated files in M:\Music.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/10aa522d-f7dc-4ecc-a3fd-8f398dfe70cd?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/10aa522d-f7dc-4ecc-a3fd-8f398dfe70cd?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the result of a search of this directory.&nbsp; Note that Windows did not find any of the four files.&nbsp; Using a capital A rather than small a makes no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6164fa0b-12bd-4333-a155-468142ae72e1?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6164fa0b-12bd-4333-a155-468142ae72e1?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Doing a similar search in Z:\HOYLE</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/572e1258-9815-4171-939c-75c7853f64de?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/572e1258-9815-4171-939c-75c7853f64de?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>This time there are results.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a40d8dc2-03ed-44b8-8ee9-78ba6c19aa16?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a40d8dc2-03ed-44b8-8ee9-78ba6c19aa16?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the Indexing Options.&nbsp; I did a refresh and let it sit overnight to be sure it had enough time to finish.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/71ba594a-8c0a-487c-b5d3-4a58a3b444b5?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/71ba594a-8c0a-487c-b5d3-4a58a3b444b5?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the DISM thing...</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b4fecf20-df19-44a7-bc29-b309c6dceb41?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b4fecf20-df19-44a7-bc29-b309c6dceb41?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed that with the SFC thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/52a34542-bb65-4c9d-8319-1c115c6d1d03?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/52a34542-bb65-4c9d-8319-1c115c6d1d03?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I then did another search in M:\Music with zero files found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now what??<br />
<br />
I should not that from time to time, the search works.&nbsp; I'd estimate it at one day a week for two or three searches.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I just have a supremely lazy Windows 10???</p>

<p>I believe that the first steps, the ones including the DISM and SFC stuff, may have done something that caused the APAgent.exe error notifications to appear.&nbsp; Those directed my attention to that fairly recent (in the past month or so) program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The possibility that the APAgent errors were interfering with searching folders on an external USB drive wasn't much of a reach.&nbsp; The Apple Time Capsule is essentially a router with an internal (but external to the Surface) drive...and some USB ports.&nbsp; And
 since I'd done everything with the Time Capsule that I needed to do and indeed had passed it along to someone else, I didn't have to keep the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since uninstalling APAgent, I've had no problems searching.&nbsp; It's been a few days now and I'm going to assert that the problem has been fully dealt with...for now, of course.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>Quando cerco di accedere tramite xbox e immetto i miei dati, mi segnala che il profilo è utilizzato già da un altro utente. Come mai?</p>

    <title>Family Gold and non-primary accounts issue with Gold Deals of the Week - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ronabo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Family Gold and non-primary accounts issue with Gold Deals of the Week and various other things.</h2>
                    
<p>Let me explain the <span>scenario.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A couple weeks ago. My girlfriend setup a Gold Family account as herself as the primary and me and her son as members of the family. Last week I noticed I couldn't see the Gold Deals of the week. I thought maybe something was wrong with XBL and it would
 fix it self eventually. Fast forward to today I noticed that new deals were up and I wanted to check them out. Low and behold I still couldn't see them. So being curious I loaded up my girlfriends account and what do you know I can see the deals along with
 lots of other things on the dashboard. &nbsp;My account on the Xbox I usually play on shows no restrictions. So I contacted Twitter support. They lead me through a few things that don't work till I discover that the Xbox I don't play on that has the primary account
 on shows me as having Family Programming instead of Standard like it shows on my Xbox. So I get the password to change it, which then I'm told the changes may take up to 4 hours.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Five hours passed and I still couldn't see the Gold DotW. But some ads/offers had now shown up I previously couldn't see. I loaded up the girlfriend's (primary) account on the one Xbox and loaded up my account on my Xbox. Doing this I noticed
 a couple of things. There is an ad for "Shocktober" in this ad there is a listing for "Terrifying Tunes" which I can't see on my account/Xbox but can see on her account/Xbox. I also don't see the gamer of the month and a few other ads and offers you can see
 on the primary account.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Now Twitter support has told me "Unfortunately, non-primary family accounts may not be able to see certain info. ^LB" &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>This doesn't make any sense as I have no restrictions. And as for not being able to see Gold Deals of the Week. What's the point of the primary account being able to give allowance if I can't even spend points on deals that I should have access to since
 I am GOLD?!</p>
<p>Needless to say I'm not happy with this. Her son missed out on getting Fallout content that was on sale last week due to this and I myself just don't like my account being treated as it's a kid. I can't even promote it as I read in the Family Gold FAQ it
 will make my account revert to Silver/Free.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can something be done about this?</p>

<p>Hey there! I'm sorry for the confusion here; hopefully I can clear things up a little for you. As a Secondary Account on a Family Plan, you have limited access to certain features; essentially you are a Child Account. You can try opening it up as much as
 possible by going to the Online Safety and Family settings on both your and the Primary Account. For more information on Family Plans, check here:

<p>Yeah I am now fully aware of what not happens to non-primary Family Gold accounts thank you very much. But you really didn't answer any of my questions. Why can't I or her son see/get Gold Deals of the Week or other various promos that may be out there?
 Like I said before we have turned off all restrictions. Nothing should be restricted. If it is, I'm not at all satisfied and would've never done the Family account stuff in the first place.
</p>
<p>First I had to go through the nightmare stuff last year with the son's account being unusable for almost a month during the Kinect Beta after I discovered a huge error now this.
</p>
<p>Not a nice way of treating 3 loyal Xbox users. &nbsp;I'm very unhappy about this mess.</p>

<p>It is my understanding that in order to add LIVE time to a Secondary Account of a Family Plan, you would need to remove it from the family, add the LIVE time, wait a short period, and then re-add it to the Family Plan. Can you try this?

<p>I am the primary account holder of this Family Gold Live account. &nbsp;We are not trying to add LIVE time to the secondary account... that doesn't even make sense, as the whole point of the Family Gold account is that we all have the same membership time. &nbsp;PLUS
 according to the Family Gold Live FAQ, if you remove a member from the Family Gold Live Pack, you cannot reinstate them for a period of time.</p>
<p>And I'm not willing to risk having the Secondary Account lose LIVE privileges to follow your suggestion that makes no logical sense to me.</p>
<p>Basically everyone in the 'Family' on this account is an Adult. &nbsp;I have removed all restrictions from both Secondary Accounts that I can both on xbox.com and on the console. &nbsp;The Secondary Accounts still cannot do the following things:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;See certain ads on the dashboard</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;See the Deal of the Week ads</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;See/enter contests</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;See certain promotions (Shocktober for example)</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;Cannot see the xbox Live Gamer of the Month</p>
<p>They are not happy to lose the ability to see the Deals and buy them with their points. &nbsp;They are not happy with not being able to enter contests and download the special gamer pics and avatar items associated with these promotions.</p>
<p>I have read all the information on family plans, and even in the support section on page "support.xbox.com/en-us/xbox-live/how-to/family-pack/managing-family-members" has the following options:</p>
<p>For Secondary Account</p>
<p>-Remove parental control over a Gold Family Pack member</p>
<p>That last item is EXACTLY what we want to do, and nowhere in the process given does it say that you will be removed from the Family Gold Pack if you do this -- it even states clearly "As a secondary Gold Family Pack member, you can remove parental control
 over your account." and gives a process. &nbsp;</p>
<p>However, if you follow this process, a screen comes up that says by removing parental control, you are removing yourself from the Family Gold Pack account.</p>
<p>Now my household is this: &nbsp;I'm 47 years old, Ronabo is 36, and my son is 19. &nbsp;We each have our own xbox console, and until 2 weeks ago, we had separate xbox Live memberships. &nbsp;Microsoft sold this package as a cost effective way for family members OF ALL
 AGES to game and save money. &nbsp;So I decided to do this. &nbsp;I read all the materials beforehand, and I removed all restrictions on all accounts. &nbsp;It is not unreasonable for accounts that are over 18 years of age to want to see the Deals (so they can give MS more
 money), the promotions, and fully participate in the community they have already been participating in for years.</p>
<p>The advice on Twitter and here has been along the lines of:</p>
<p>- 'oh just put the primary account on a thumb drive and carry it around and you'll get to see everything' &nbsp;As the primary account holder, I don't THINK so. &nbsp;I'm just as avid a gamer as anyone else here, I spent over $2500 in Rock Band DLC last year alone
 and my account isn't going to be cavalierly bandied about on a thumb drive insecurely. &nbsp;I can't even believe that a Microsoft employee suggested this.</p>
<p>And you just now with 'just remove yourself and add live time and add yourself back'. &nbsp;Adding Live time wasn't even the issue we were asking about! &nbsp;</p>
<p>What I want to know, is exactly how to set the settings to have the secondary accounts be able to see the features listed in 1-5 above, on their own accounts, on their own consoles. &nbsp;When my son was 17 and HAD a child account, he could still see the Gamer
 of the Month and Deals of the Week! &nbsp;I want them to be able to do this now.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hey there! As far as the Dashboard content goes, you can try going into the Online Safety settings of the accounts, look under Content. There should be an option to set the programming of the Dashboard from Family to Standard. Does this help in showing the
 ads you're looking for? </p>

<p>It's been set to Standard Programming since the day I set up the Family Gold. &nbsp;I just went and verified that all accounts both primary and secondary are currently set to Standard Programming both on xbox.com and verified in the Famliy Center on the console
 that all secondary accounts are set to Standard Programming.</p>

<p>Hey there again. I did some checking into this issue, and I've found that Secondary Accounts are restricted from seeing LIVE and M-rated ads, similar to a Child Account. This is because of a legal ruling preventing us from showing this advertising to these
 accounts. Also, since Secondary Accounts cannot purchase LIVE, showing these ads was also removed.<br />
<br />
In terms of getting the content these ads are offering, you can purchase them with your Primary Account, and any other account should be able to use it on the same console. The only general exception is avatar gear, which can only be used the account that purchased
 it. Does this help you work around the limitation at all? Please let me know if I can help you further. Thanks!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Well, see that's the problem isn't it? &nbsp;I have over 3000 Rock Band songs on 'my' console and that's reserved for my use. &nbsp;So if I purchase DLC for Borderlands for my son on his console in his room, then when he goes to a friend's house, he won't be able
 to use it. &nbsp;Same with Ronabo. &nbsp;And forget about getting cute avatar gear from promotions or ads for them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If this restriction had been clearly spelled out in the FAQ at <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/Live/JoinLive/FamilyPackFAQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.xbox.com/.../FamilyPackFAQ</a>, I would NEVER have signed us up for the Gold Family Pack. &nbsp;It even talks about how your child can play all his DLC, THAT HE PURCHASES, when he goes to college and isn't in the household! &nbsp;Since 19 year old boys seem to really
 enjoy M-rated games, it seems rather pointless to say 'well you get this gold account for cheap, but you can't see deals or buy anything new for your M-games unless your mommy's around to sign in on the console -- and then you can't use it anywhere else.'</p>
<p>I'm very unhappy about this, and I will be working out how to cancel this family pack and get them their live accounts back, which is going to end up costing me more money, as I'm sure that they won't be able to be restored to individual gold accounts with
 their original expiration dates. &nbsp;So I'm assuming that I will end up with having my gold time artificially extended while having to turn around and unexpectedly shell out $120 for new subscriptions to fix this for the rest of the family.</p>
<p>I strongly suggest that you take this feedback back to whoever needs to know this so that this information can be more clearly spelled out in the pack. &nbsp;Either that, or change the sloppy programming and let adult status be recognized in the Family Pack as
 it is outside of it -- by the age of the persons holding the Secondary accounts.

<p>I agree with her completely in that my husband is listed as a primary and never even plays on the xbox so now i cannot even use the content that i paid for. &nbsp;With technology as advanced as it is today you would think you guys would have figured out a way
 to enable users to change the permissions to allow for that...hmmm maybe a password..idk</p>

    <title>After system restore, Solitaire Collection progress is lost - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            After system restore, Solitaire Collection progress is lost</h2>
                    
<p>Hello</p>
<p>On March 22, I had to do a system restore to March 17. When I logged in to the Solitaire Collection, I noticed my progress was lost. The daily challenges and Star Club were in the same state as on March 17. I have redone the five days worth of Daily Challenges
 but re-earning the 90-odd stars is too much work.</p>
<p>When I look into achievements on my xBox account, it shows 301 stars. The Solitaire Collection shows 210.</p>
<p>I have tried reinstalling the app and it did not help. I chatted to a support person and they told me to post here.</p>
<p>Any idea what else I could try?</p>
<p>thanks.</p>
<p>(I only recently upgraded my PC to Windows 10).</p>

<p>More info:</p>
<p>- I replayed one game in the Star Club</p>
<p>The star count in the app was updated correctly. The one in the xBox account was not updated (I thought it's fair enough as the level should already be included in the 301 stars)</p>
<p>- I played a brand new Star Club game (one I haven't played before)</p>
<p>The star count in the app was updated correctly. The one in the xBox account wasn't even though I expected it to be updated.</p>

<h2>            LOCKED - Account suspended due to payment issue and prepaid code won&#39;t work</h2>
                    
<p>I used a debit card for XBL in 2008, it hasn't reached the expiration date, but it is no longer valid. &nbsp;My account has been suspended due to an issue with auto-renewal trying to charge that card (I've been using pre-paid cards for the past couple of years).
 &nbsp;I had just assumed it would automatically downgrade to Silver&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do have a prepaid card, but I receive an error if I try to put it in on either the website or on the console. &nbsp;Is there a way to get downgraded to Silver, so I can enter the code? &nbsp;I'll give customer service a call when they open, but if anyone can help,
 I'll be thankful.</p>

<p><span><span><strong>Hi there.
</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Unfortunately you cannot use a pre-paid code to pay off an outstanding balance against your account (if there is one that is). The LIVE system may have suspended
 your account after detecting it was not a valid payment option anymore. I suggest signing into
</strong></span></span><a href="http://www.billing.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><strong>www.billing.microsoft.com</strong></span></span></a><span><span><strong>
 and from here you can see if there is an outstanding balance. </strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Ok. The only way to pay off an oustanding balance is to add a new credit/debit card to your account, however seeing as you have been using pre-paid codes
 for some time it may be a good idea to contact the support line and explain this to them. They may be able to remove the charge and the subscription, if it renewed and charged your invalid card. It is unlikely that they will but there's always a chance.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Good luck.

 minimize buttons work fine, but I can't maximize or stretch the window, it won't budge.&nbsp; I'm typing essays and like to use the whole window.&nbsp; I'm also having a problem printing but only from Adobe files.&nbsp; It pulls the paper in and acts like it wants to start
 printing, then it just stops,&nbsp;strangely the printer shows no pending "print jobs".&nbsp; Please help.&nbsp; I'm running Vista home on a Delll Dimension and using a HP photosmart all-in-one printer.

<h2>            Streaming to my PS4 stopped working after upgrading to Windows 10.</h2>
                    I do quite a bit of streaming video&nbsp;from my laptop to my PS4 but this isn't working properly ever since I installed Windows 10.&nbsp; I have checked my sharing settings and went so far as to set up a new Homegroup.&nbsp; The PS4 sees my computer and lets me browse
 my video files but it won't let me play any of them.&nbsp; I tried viewing files that I watched recently from the same hardware to the same PS4&nbsp;but I am greeted with a screen telling me that the file cannot be played.&nbsp; This doesn't seem to be an issue with the
 audio files.<br />
<br />
Is this a known issue and is there a fix for it?&nbsp; I'll happily go back to 8.1 if that's the only recourse.

            Was able to get it going finally. You have to go into Windows Media Player and turn on Streaming. Go into your Library while in Windows Media Player, click on Stream and turn on streaming. That takes you to the setup. &nbsp;Works fine now. My PS4 can see everything
 as before.

<p>I assume that this is a TCP/IP printer that the printer has been configured at a fixed IP address... Generally, you configure it like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the Control Panel -&gt; Printers and double-click on "Add Printer"</li><li>Then when asked to choose "Local Printer" or "Network Printer", go against instinct and select "Local Printer".&nbsp; Remove check from the "Automatically Detect" box.&nbsp; Click "Next"</li><li>Select "Create a Port" checkbox and in the box below, choose "Standard TCP/IP Port", then "Next".</li><li>This will launch a Create-Port Wizard.&nbsp; Enter the IP address of the printer in the box when requested</li><li>The rest of the Wizard is fairly straightforward.&nbsp; Keep in mind that there will be a pause as the Port Creation Wizard completes and the Add Printer Wizard resumes.</li></ul>

<p>Hi petenewman,</p>
<p>I would suggest you to check for the compatibility of Panasonic nv-ex3 DV camcorder with Widows 7.</p>

            Thanks for the reply but it does not help as my camera relies on the operating system for drivers it has none of its own. The camera shows up in devices when connected and reports as working correctly as does the 1394 host controller which is a pci via
 compliant controller. I have tried&nbsp;changing the 1394 driver to the legacy driver and just recieve device cannot start code&nbsp;10 message.<br />
<br />
Thaks for your help<br />

<h2>            Skype messing up PHP&#47;Apache</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my laptop running Windows 10 pro, I have Apache/PHP/MySql setup which has been working fine till now. Recently I landed into a weird issue after Skype update.&nbsp; The "sessions" in PHP have gone for a toss. Every page is generating new session ID and hence
 variables from one page are not getting passed on to next page. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After a lot of headache on this I realized it happened only after Skype update. Further, I wanted to change the ports used by Skype and now it doesnt have those options. One of the threads said about downloading classic Skype, but the "classic" version is

            1. This might be an issue with latest Skype which is v8. 
<br />
<br />I would recommend that you should send this feedback to Skype engineers - Open v8 skype &gt; Click 3 dots on top &gt; Help &amp; feedback &gt; Give feedback 
<br />
<br />Feedback can also be given through Uservoice where you can find the feedback of others and status would be visible to you - <a href="https://skype.uservoice.com/forums/914527-skype-ideas/filters/my_feedback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skype.uservoice.com/forums/914527-skype...</a>
<br />
<br />2. As a work-around, You can download Classic Skype and use that. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/classic.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/classic.skype</a> 
<br />
<br />Good news is that Classic Skype is not going to be retired. Its last date in service was 1-Sep-18 and it has been decided not stop the services to Classic Skype for some more time. It would nag you for updating to latest version which is v8 which you will have to ignore and tolerate.

<p>May we know if you're currently on a network domain? It's possible that this feature was disabled through Group Policy settings by your local administrator. If you're not joined on a network, please have a go with creating another user account on your device

<p>No, not on a domain.<br />

Tried making another user account (as Administrator), same settings options as the main Admin account.<br />

Checked GP settings just in case, nothing relevant is enabled.&nbsp; Here are some screenshots of my settings windows:<br />

<p>&nbsp; In this last one, you can see the option I want is there in GP, but greyed out,
<em>unless</em> you enable it and select a specific lock screen image (i.e. not Showcase).&nbsp; If I enable this, select some random image and check the "turn off facts" option, but do not enable the "prevent changing" policy and still select Showcase, does Showcase
 respect this option?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The settings toggle
<em><strong>Get fun facts, tips, tricks, and more on your lock screen</strong></em></span> will only become available once you change your background from
<strong>Windows spotlight</strong> to either <strong>Picture </strong>or <strong>
Slideshow</strong>. To remove Windows 10’s lock screen ads, follow these steps: &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Start </strong>menu, and select <strong>Settings</strong>. &nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li>Choose <strong>Personalization</strong>, and then navigate to the <strong>Lock Screen</strong> tab. &nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li>Under <strong>Background</strong>, you can switch this to display either a <strong>
Picture </strong>or a <strong>Slideshow</strong>. &nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li>Unselect the option for <strong>Get fun facts, tips, tricks, and more on your lock screen</strong>.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you just want to see content that’s more tailored to your interests instead, you may do so by clicking on the icon at the top-right corner of your lock screen as shown below:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7c60e3c1-52e6-451a-8363-d31847dbbaed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7c60e3c1-52e6-451a-8363-d31847dbbaed" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>From here a menu will drop down, where you can choose from the two options: <strong>
I want more!</strong> and <strong>Not a fan</strong>. The former will give you more content related to that specific kind of ad, while the latter will change it to a different picture the next time you log in.

            So after all of this, without coming right out and saying it, the answer is, "No, there's no way to use Showcase and disable ads, they're baked in now."&nbsp; Classy.<br />
<br />
As far as the "I want more", are you saying that despite the sub-text saying "We'll keep showing you pictures like this", it&nbsp;<em>actually</em> means you see more of whatever ad links happen to be shown there?&nbsp; Are you
<em>serious</em>?

<h3> warev  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need help for reinstalling windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello! I am posting here because I am 24h/24h since two days trying to fix my PC</p>
<p>A little history of what happened: I was playing two days ago and suddenly my PC froze for 30 seconds every 2 seconds, I decided to turn it off and then everything was froze 30 seconds every 2 seconds (I let my PC all night trying to boot it with no success)
 I decide to reinstall windows 10 and here comes the real trouble.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the official DVD of Windows 10 I received when buying my PC, I tried as well a USB key, an external HDD to try to install windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happens is that I can start the installation process till the "copying files" thing with %, at this moment two things can happen: (with every support installation).</p>
<p>
</p><p>-&nbsp;"<span>Windows could not install required files. Make sure all files required for installation are available, and restart the installation. Error code 0x8007045D". So it fails.</span></p>
<p><span>or sometimes</span></p>
<p><span>- It works and restart my PC, but then "preparing devices" (something like that) then just "preparing" and a pop-up with "the computer restarted
</span></p>
<p><span>unexpectedly or encountered an unexpected error", when that happens (because all the files during setup "should have" been copied) I try to "reinitialize windows and erase everything" but then I get "there was an error
 reinitializing this PC, so I can't do that either.</span></p>
<p>It could be a problem with my HDD (I get by the way the error before choosing on which partitions to install that the HDD could be failing) but there is no sound saying my HDD is dead, and my PC is not too much old, and there was no signs of my HDD failing
 (slow etc..)</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I tried to format/remove partitions with diskpart convert raw to ntfs etc etc... all you can do in "diskpart" in cmd.</span></p>
<p><span>I never tried to install an other windows apart from the "10" (but it shouldn't work either since my PC supported it all this time..)</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I really need help.. I need to try everything and not "buy an other HDD", I was already getting HDD could fail before but NOTHING was failing at all, and I can't really buy anything for the moment. Thanks in advance
 everyone.</span></p>
<p><span>I am not a native english person, sorry for any mistakes/synthaxes.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Forgot to say I tried to change BIOS settings (CSM compatibility and such). As well as resetting CMOS/unplugging cable from HDD and put them back.</p>

            Try simplifying your configuration by keeping only your mouse and keyboard attached, that means:
<br />
<br />    Disconnecting multiple display monitors.
<br />    Remove discrete video cards, use the on-board graphics if your motherboard supports it.
<br />
<br />    Swap out memory modules - a RAM module might be corrupt - you can also ensure RAM sticks are installed slots 1 and 3. Your RAM modules might be corrupt, try scanning them for errors.

<br />
<br />    If you have more than one hard disk installed, disconnect all except the target disk where Windows 10 will be installed.
<br />
<br />    Reset your BIOS Defaults.

<br />
<br />    Disconnect all external devices, since connected devices can sometimes confuse setup. 
<br />

            Hi Rev.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Make sure all other drives and peripherals are unplugged.  Update the BIOS or UEFI firmware to latest, or reset to Defaults, making sure SATA controller is set to AHCI. 
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  If you're using another PC to do this then uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on first screen press Shift + F10 to open a Command Prompt, type the following commands followed by Enter key:
<br />DISKPART
<br />LIST DISK
<br />SEL DIS # (replace # with the disk # of the Windows disk from list in previous command)
<br />CLEAN
<br />EXIT
<br />
<br />Close Command Box, on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen choose Unallocated Space, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

            I will try to install the "1703" windows version since I already did many times CMD command like disk part, clean, clean all etc.. Fast boost I already turn off and it was already on AHCI for SATA, I will find an other USB Key I have for the 1703 and try
 again.

<p>Hello it's me again, I did the install and it was the second case I described, well, almost.</p>
<p>Installation without 0x8007045d error, restart of windows, boot on hdd, but like before, I saw "getting system devices ready" then "getting ready" (I mistranslated before, it was not "preparing devices" and "preparing" but "getting ready". BUT this time,
 no "the<span>&nbsp;computer restarted&nbsp;</span><span>unexpectedly or encountered an unexpected error" I left the PC while "getting ready was doing his&nbsp; job" because it's kinda long, but when I came back the BIOS was opened, and I
 can't use my HDD as well as the USB key I used for installation (in both CSM enable/disable) -&gt; I can't select them they don't appear.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>edit: I can make the HDD appear by changing AHCI -&gt; RAID (though I'm scared to use it to not damage a potential good install of windows)</p>
<p>edit2: It appeared for some reasons even in AHCI but I get then "the computer restarted unexpectedly or encountered an unexpected error" again..&nbsp;</p>

<h3> svb115  say:</h3>
<h2>            Get the following error when trying to download video via firewire from a Canon Vixia HV30 camcorder. &#34;The video was not imported correctly. Verify that the digital video tape is not blank, and then try again.&#34;</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I have the fololowing:<br />
Canon ViXia HV30 camcorder<br />
4 pin to 6 pin firewire cable<br />
Vista Home Premium 64 bit<br />
<br />
I get the following error when trying to download video via firewire from a Canon Vixia HV30 camcorder. "The video was not imported correctly. Verify that the digital video tape is not blank, and then try again."<br />
<br />
This error comes when using movie maker or "import video" . Windows does recognize that a camcorder is attached but does not call it Canon. I can control the camera using the import video window in movie maker once it is connected(Stop, play, fast forward etc).&nbsp;However,
 when I try to download video I get the error mentioned above. I get the same error whether I am importing HDV or DV.<br />
<br />
Please note that I have another laptop with Win XP Pro and I can download DV video from the same camcorder with a 4 pin to 4 pin firewire cable. Win XP does not support HDV.<br />
<br />
Please let me know&nbsp;how I will be able to download DV and HDV from my Canon Vixia HV30 to&nbsp;my Vista Home Premium 64 bit OS.<br />
Thanks&nbsp;
                </div>

<p><span><span>Hi svb115,</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Forums.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>We would like to get more information from you, to help troubleshoot your issue. Please answer the
 following questions as best you can.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Where you able to download the same files to the computer from the camera before?</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>What is the file format of the video?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Some audio and video file formats are not supported in Windows Movie Maker and cannot be imported.
 However, if you have a video or audio file that is not supported, you may be able to use a non-Microsoft video editing program to convert the file into a format that Windows Movie Maker supports, and then import the resulting audio or video file into Windows
 Movie Maker. Some files also require you to install a codec before you can use the files in Windows Movie Maker.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can import video from a videotape in a high-definition digital video (HDV) camera to your computer
 by using Import Video. When you import video from a videotape in an HDV camera to your computer, the video on the tape is encoded into a high-definition video file and then saved to your computer's hard disk.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Your computer must be running Windows&nbsp;Vista Home Premium or Windows&nbsp;Vista Ultimate to import video
 from a high-definition video camera to your computer using Import Video in Windows&nbsp;Vista.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For questions and answers related to importing video from an HDV camera, see
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Importing-High-Definition-Video-HDV-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Importing High-Definition Video: frequently asked questions</span></a><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>To import the entire video from a videotape in an HDV camera</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span><span>Make sure your HDV camera is connected to your computer using an IEEE 1394 connection, and then set the HDV camera to play recorded video (often labeled VTR, VCR, or Play on the camera).</span></span>
</li><li>
<span><span>Start Windows Movie Maker (click
<strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>All Programs</strong>, and then click <strong>
Windows Movie Maker</strong>).</span></span> </li><li>
<span><span>On the <strong>
File</strong> menu, click <strong>Import from Digital Video Camera</strong>.</span></span>
</li><li>
<span><span>In the <strong>
Name</strong> box, type a name for the video file for the imported video.</span></span>
</li><li>
<span><span>Choose a location to save your video file from the
<strong>Import to</strong> list, or click <strong>Browse</strong> to choose another location.</span></span>
</li><li>
<span><span>In the <strong>
Format</strong> list, <strong>High Definition Video Device Format (MPEG)</strong> should be selected. Click
<strong>Next</strong>.</span></span> </li><li>
<span><span>Click <strong>
Import the entire videotape to my computer</strong> (if it is not already selected), and then click
<strong>Next</strong>.</span></span> </li></ol>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The videotape will be rewound to the beginning, and the entire videotape will be imported to your
 computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The resulting imported high-definition video file is saved as a Microsoft Recorded TV Show file,
 which is an MPEG-2 video file with a .dvr-ms file name extension.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span><span>(Optional) If you want to stop importing video before the end of the videotape, click
<strong>Stop</strong>, and then click <strong>Yes</strong>.</span></span> </li><li>
<span><span>Click <strong>
Finish</strong>.</span></span> </li></ol>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The imported video is saved as a video file on your computer and appears in Windows Movie Maker.</span></span></p>

            Hi Halima,<br />
<br />
Let me try to answer questions as you have in your reply.<br />
<br />
I have not been able to download video ever in my computer with Vista Home Premium 64-bit edition. I have been able to download DV to another computer which has XP Pro.<br />
The video is on a MiniDV and the format is DV.<br />
<br />
I have followed the instructions exactly as you have given above to download DV and HDV but have not been successful for either formats.<br />
<br />
I have also just downloaded Windows Media Encoder x64 edition. However, I get an error&nbsp;
<br />
1 - The parameter is incorrect. (0x80070057)<br />
<br />
Any help is appreciated.<br />
<br />
svb115.

    <title>How does one change their monitor&#39;s &#34;Identity Number&#34;&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> renardthekitsune  say:</h3>
<h2>            How does one change their monitor&#39;s &#34;Identity Number&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    <p><strong>I've been have problems that seems to be tied to Monitor Identity Numbers that fully ignores the settings for which monitor is set to main monitor.</strong>&nbsp; I have looked up for days through "Microsoft Support" and through the community in here
 (and in other places), and came to the conclusion that the majority of the answers I find are just ignorant people of what is actually being asked.<br />
<br />
My current monitors I have are as shown below, with their "Identity Numbers" and with the addition of stating which one is marked "Make This My Main Display":<br />
<br />
<strong>M422i-B1 </strong>(TV screen)<br />
Resolution:&nbsp; 1920 x 1080<br />
Monitor Identity Number:&nbsp; 1</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Acer LCD Monitor P201W </strong>(Computer Screen) <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">"Main Display"</span></strong></p>
<p>Resolution:&nbsp; 1680 x 1050<br />
Monitor Identity Number:&nbsp; 2<br />
<br />
In the beginning prior to set-up, their "Identity Numbers" were originally swapped as the Acer was the original "Identity Number 1" screen, but now every time plug in a second screen (or monitor), it lists Acer as "#2".&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Despite the Acer Monitor is
 set to be the "Main Dispaly", almost all applications are opened up on my tv screen. The only way I can seem to remedy this is by moving them to the Acer Monitor and close the app on that one, but this would require to do upon right after logging into my pc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>I
 have seen suggestions of using 3rd party applications for "Window Settings", only to be failed by the many versus the few stating that Windows OS supersede those settings in terms of "Monitor Identity".</p>
<p>
</p><p>To state, a lot of people seem to assume that the&nbsp;<strong>"Monitor's Identity Number"</strong> is not important, but in terms of experience (that seems many has shared),<strong> that this is actually relevant to the system regardless of the display settings
 for what is marked as the "Main Display".</strong>&nbsp; I do hope I get a proper answer for a question that has been asked for 10 years that seems to have not been dodged and/or misunderstood.&nbsp;
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">To add, I do not seek for the answer of going through display setting and moving the monitors around as that too is, painfully in truth, a sign of ignorance.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I do apologize for typing up a long explanation, but sometimes, one needs to be detailed about the situation to show not just the big picture, but also the small ones the create the larger problem.</p>

            Hi RenardTheKitsune 
<br />windows should remember the location of the app that last time it was closed and open it in the same place, are you saying this is not happening?
<br />
<br />some other questions that may help to identify the problem
<br />are you running in tablet mode?
<br />are the apps opened in full screen?
<br />
<br />you haven't said how your monitors are connected, I would guess that the M422i-B1 (TV screen) is connected to HDMI and that the Acer LCD Monitor P201W is connected to DVI.
<br />the reason I ask is that windows assigns the identification numbers by port rank, HDMI outranks DVI so a monitor connected to HDMI will be 1 and monitor connected to DVI will get a 2, if you unplug the HDMI the monitor connected to DVI becomes 1, regardless of which is marked as the primary monitor.
<br />there are applications that will label them the other way round (my intel HD graphics control panel does) but it has no impact on the primary monitor or where applications are opened, However windows does get it wrong in the projection flyout (winkey+p) where the primary monitor is listed as second screen (?!?!) and pc screen is monitor 1 which is not the primary monitor.
<br />
<br />if you want an app to open on the primary monitor, reduce it to window (ie not full screen) move it to the primary monitor, then close it. next time you open it, it should open on the primary monitor.
<br />the easy way to move a lot of open windows is to temporarily stop extending the desktop - winkey+p choose second monitor only (so that it displays on monitor 2, the primary monitor) when you extend the desktop again all the currently open apps will stay on the primary monitor
<br />
<br />hope that helps, or at least doesn't make it more confusing, please let me know if I have misunderstood.

<p>I have <strong>Acer connected by HDMI </strong>and the<strong> M422i-B1 connected by DVI</strong>.&nbsp; That is my fault for forgetting to state what plugs were being used.&nbsp; Even with that noted, I even tried swapping plugs to remedy this sometimes, but with
 no avail.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>For what you said in the beginning, it still does that, but only for my web browsers.</strong> Everything else launches on&nbsp;M422i-B1.&nbsp; I have used the trick you stated about temporarily stop the screen extension just to moves windows quickly and easily,
 but only to be a chore now.&nbsp; <strong>At some point, Twitch, Discord, and Steam will actually start launching on the Acer Monitor</strong> up until there's a "Windows Update", in which the listed apps, plus web browsers, begin to open up on "Monitor 1" again.<br />
<br />
<strong>I do thank you for your help, and you are understanding a problem, but the core of this situation still lies within the "Monitor's Identity Number".<br />
<br />
</strong>If more questions are needed to be asked for more information (even for things I may or may not forgotten), I will answer to the best of my abilities.</p>

            sorry for the slow reply.
<br />like others, I hadn't previously considered it a problem, but that might be because I have not used an app that insists on opening on monitor 1.
<br />
<br />I have done some research and you are not alone in realising it is an issue and not just cosmetic.
<br />I don't know if you have read the following thread, there is a lot of unhelpful comments, but there are some possible solutions that you may want to try.
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/graphic-cards/15456-possible-re-assign-monitor-identities-numbers-5.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/graphic-cards/15456-p...</a>
<br />consider the suggestion from DJParent on page 5 
<br />or the suggestion by Brentos on page 6
<br />if they do not help, you could try the registry edit offered by PirateorNinja on page 4, export the registry keys before deleting anything, so that you can restore them if necessary.
<br />
<br />I would also urge you use the feedback hub (winkey+f) to bring the problem to the attention of the windows development team.
<br />include the details you mentioned here and examples of the apps that open on the wrong monitor.
<br />post a link to the feedback in this thread so that I and others can find it and vote for it.

            I have came across the thread you speak of as it was one of the top 5 searched threads.<strong><br />
<br />
I had dismissed Brentos' suggestion as I have AMD's driver (a Radeon RX 470). (Another fault of mine of not stating this for I apologize.)</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>For DJParent's idea, I had done that before</strong> in an attempt to fix a different problem, and it had reset the "Identity Numbers" in the process, giving Acer "Identity Number 1" like it had from the start.&nbsp; This only
<strong>lasted for a very short while, until Windows updated</strong> and change it all to what they are now.<br />
<br />
I'd like to do <strong>PirateorNinja's suggestion, but I don't have a back-up, external, or flash/jump drive for it as precaution</strong>.&nbsp; Despite the detailed instructions listed by this user, I prefer to play it safe if something happens.
<strong>(I could simply make a restore point on the same harddrive, but that would be a redundancy.)</strong> In terms, I'm not actually tech savvy, so in honesty, do not want to attempt this path.<br />
<br />
And I have made use of the "Feedback Hub" as you suggested, with the inclusion of the link of this thread, summarizing it to the best of my abilities.

            no need for apologies, I should perhaps have asked you what graphics card you had. Although the suggestion from Brentos mentions the nvidia control panel, my thought was that you could find something similar in the control software for your card.
<br />it has been a while since I looked at the catalyst software and am not familiar with the amd eyefinity but it might be worth you having a look.

<br />
<br />As for the registry edit, I would be happier if you had a backup first, I can talk you through exporting the registry and making the edit.
<br />if it works we could export the key so that when an update undoes the changes you can put them back with a double click.
<br />
<br />if you want, I will try the registry edit on my computer (intel HD graphics, acer monitor on dvi, LG TV on HDMI).

    <title>Display adapters - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jamesmole  say:</h3>
<h2>            Display adapters</h2>
                    <p>Ok, about three months ago I updated my Lenovo laptop. But the problem was when I logged back in all I had was a mouse and a black screen. After 4 hours I managed to fix it by booting in safe mode and opening 'explorer.exe', yet the problem still continued.
 After every update all I would get would be a black screen and mouse. Facially, my Dad took it down to London, where he works, to get it looked out by his work technician. He installed Lenovo drivers and said the Intel ones weren't compatible with the Laptop,
 and that was great! But yesterday I updated the laptop again to find the same problem. In the Device Manager there where two Display Adapters instead of one and a 'Unknown Device' in the 'Other Devices'. I uninstalled the second Display Adapter and reinstalled
 the Lenovo ones that the technician had installed. I then ran 'explorer.exe' and it was fixed, but how can I prevent this from happening again? I know the problem is extremely unlikely to be fixed and I bet it will happen next time I update my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is, how can I prevent this?</p>
