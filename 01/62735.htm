    <title>Shaking the mouse whilst gaming or watching Youtube or even scrolling - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> moltenkore  say:</h3>
<h2>            Shaking the mouse whilst gaming or watching Youtube or even scrolling chrome lags the system</h2>
                    <p>I have a very weird problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today the power in my house failed and caused my system to flat-line until I paid the meter. (Yeah, one of those stone age old things)</p>
<p>...and when the computer came back on it was unresponsive, laggy and just generally irritating to use.<br />
</p>
<p>I have tried all sorts of things, checking both the SSD and HDD for errors, clearing cache, updating drivers etc etc but nothing so far has fixed it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then suddenly, I find out that if I shake my mouse whilst playing a game that I could normally play at about 100 fps with no issues what so ever, the game suddenly cans and runs about 20 fps with constant frame lagging and such until I stop moving the mouse.
 It wasn't until this evening that I also noticed this actually extends to most desktop windows too. If I scroll in chrome and shake the mouse it becomes massively chopping and lags, if I shake the mouse over a Youtube video, it skips frames and pauses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system in question is an I7 6700k, 980 TI with a Gigabyte&nbsp;GA-Z170-HD3 and 16 GB of DDR4 ram so it's not exactly a slow machine. I have a 3 monitor setup with two 1080ps and a 2k 144hz screen sitting in the middle and I guess more importantly in this
 situation is my mouse which is a Corsair M65 pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never come across anything like this before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mouse wise, I tried removing the mouse and drivers from the system and reinstalling them. I also tried reinstalling the Intel drivers from Gigabyte however it seems, nothing has had any effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any idea as to what is going on, I'd appreciate it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            I made no changes. There were no devices attached.I've also switched it off left it for a feeling minutes to 8 hours. I've now handed it to a computer person to look at and I am not impressed at all. I've tried getting into safe mode and couldn't even
 trigger that.this is a commonly reported problem. Please fix as soon as possible.

    <title>Cursor randomly disappears within certain applications - Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cursor randomly disappears within certain applications - Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded to Windows 10. &nbsp;I am using Office 2007 and other applications. &nbsp;I have noticed that when I am in a Word document and am moving my cursor through the document it will disappear when I stop moving it (hang on there is more). If I have a
 paragraph that is in italics, the cursor does not show up at all, even when I right click or am moving the mouse. &nbsp;I have to guess where I am in the italicized paragraph, click the mouse, and only when I type on the keyboard do I know where I clicked and then
 have to use the arrow keys to get where I want. &nbsp;This disappearing cursor also occurs in other non-office programs. &nbsp;I have changed the mouse setting making sure I have unchecked the "hide pointer while typing" even though that does not explain why the pointer
 is not visible at all while moving the mouse in the paragraph. &nbsp;Any help?</p>

            Checked my drivers and they were all up to date. &nbsp;Rebooted the system about 3 times and changed the display settings to 150% &nbsp;on the external monitor from 100% . &nbsp;Now in the "italics" area of the word document I can just barely make out the top and bottom
 of the cursor as the pointer moves so I can get by with that for now. &nbsp;What I don't understand now though is why the cursor disappears when the mouse stops moving whether it is in a Word document or just an internet page with text and no potential for typing.
 &nbsp;I have turned off the "hide when typing" option under pointer options, but the cursor still disappears. &nbsp;Thanks for the quick reply.&nbsp;

            I have a similar problem. The mouse works fine in all applications except right here and in MS word 2010. I just noticed that it does not show up while I am on this site. I can see the mouse everywhere except in a document. I can see it everywhere else
 on the word screen and on this page too. I have checked the mouse, used another mouse, unchecked the hide while typing setting etc. I have repaired the MS office installation and still have the problem.&nbsp; Any ideas??

<p>I know this is an old post but I thought it would still be worthwhile responding for Windows 10 users.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step one:</p>
<p>Right click on a blank part of your desktop and choose "Personalise",</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step two:</p>
<p>Click on "Themes",</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step three:</p>
<p>On the main section of the Themes settings screen, click on "Mouse cursor",</p>
<p>
</p><p>Step four:</p>
<p>Uncheck "Hide pointer while typing" and click "Apply" or "OK",</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your mouse cursor should no longer disappear on you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*It could also be useful to put a check in the "Show location of pointer when I press CTRL key" option so if you don't know where your cursor is, you can find it by using the CTRL key.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Network Adapter Driver Code 39 Error, no ethernet connectivity</h2>
                    Win7 Home Premium 64-bit ran fine on my desktop PC for 9 months.&nbsp; Then, after a Windows update, I lost all ethernet connections.&nbsp; I&nbsp;had not made any hardware changes.&nbsp; System Restore did not help.&nbsp; Device Manager shows the same error on 6 Network Adapters:
 "Windows cannot load the device driver for this hardware.&nbsp; The driver may be corrupted or missing. (Code 39)".&nbsp;&nbsp;Drivers are: "Microsoft 6to4 Adapter", "Microsoft ISATAP Adapter" , "Microsoft ISATAP Adpter #2",&nbsp;"Microsoft ISATAP Adapter&nbsp;#3", "Terudo Tunneling
 Pseudo-Interface" and "WAN Miniport (IKEv2)".&nbsp; How to fix?&nbsp; This PC can no longer connect to the internet.

            None of the above worked.&nbsp; But I was able to find a restore point before the problem occurred (I did not think they were saved that long) and restored back to it (3 months ago).&nbsp; It solved the problem.&nbsp; The more I use System Restore, the more I like it!

<h2>            Numerous Problems&#58; Cable connection lost, no sound from TV, Voice activation doesn&#38;&#35;39&#59;t work</h2>
                    
<p>I am having several problems. The biggest is that 50-75% of the time when I turn the Xbox on there is no sound on from actual TV. I hear the Xbox and the cursor, but no sound from the actual shows when I am trying to watch something. On Xbox Live support
 it says to disconnect the power and wait 30+ seconds so that it can release corrupted configuration data. When I reconnect and go through the entire devices setup process all over again I only get sound about 50% of the time. This is extremely frustrating,
 though thanks to the repetition, I've now memorized all of my devices and their model numbers. Games and anything directly Xbox related sound fine.</p>
<p>Another problem is everytime I turn on the Xbox it tells me it's lost my satellite or cable box connection/signal. I have a Comcast cable box (which ironically it still knows down to the model name) that is directly plugged in via HDMI. Again I have to go
 through the whole previous unplugging/resetting process to get it to work. Sometimes it doesn't.</p>
<p>Also is there a trick to the initial voice activation method of turning it on? I feel like an idiot saying "Xbox On" 10-20 times until it finally works or doesn't. Is it the phrasing? Timing? Loudness? I would really love to see an in depth tutorial / walkthrough
 on Xbox Live that details the ins and outs of how to really master the system.</p>

<p>I am having the same issue with sound on live TV. Sound on apps (Netflix, YouTube, etc) and games is perfect but when I am watching live TV I have no sound at all. Tried power cycling the cable box but that did nothing to remedy the problem. Would love to
 try some suggested fixes if anybody has any.</p>

<p>You need a slight delay between 'xbox' and 'on'. &nbsp;Worked for me most of the time. Once I walked by the room on my way to the kitchen...said, 'xbox &nbsp;on', grabbed a snack, walked back to the room and sat on the couch. The Kinect recognized me and said 'Hi'
 and that just felt true next gen!</p>
<p>I had the same problem with sound and blank or frozen screen for TV. So far changing the power mode has worked for me.</p>
<p>Go to 'Settings' and then 'Power &amp; Setting', change 'Power Mode' to 'Energy Savings'.</p>
<p>Bad thing is you won't be able to use voice command to turn the xbox on and it takes a lot longer to boot up...but until they figure out a patch then I'll run it this way. Feels like the typical, 'your computer is frozen so reboot and everything works again'</p>

<p>I have a Scientific Atlanta 8300HD cable/dvr box that runs my live tv. The first night I used the XB1 I had the freezing screen/black screen issue so I searched this forum and found the following suggestions helped:</p>
<p>Settings:</p>
<p>1) TV &amp; OneGuide settings; Power settings; leave all the choices unchecked for now.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Troubleshooting; leave Surround sound (BETA) unchecked for now.</p>
<p>2) DIsplay &amp; sound; Digital Audio; HDMI audio; Stereo uncompressed for now</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Optical audio; Stereo uncompressed for now</p>
<p>3) Power &amp; startup; Turn Xbox off (if you're having the freezing/black screen issue)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Turn off after; Don't turn off automatically
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Power Options; Power mode; Energy-saving for now.</p>
<p>4) Kinect; Troubleshooting; KInect doesn't hear me (I go into this if the Kinect has trouble hearing me with voice commands and start the audio check. If you have a receiver hooked up to the XB1 as I do I have the Optical audio set to DTS Digital Surround
 and you can hear the difference on your speakers while doing this test.)</p>
<p>In my opinion it's very much like Schisma is saying that the XB1 goes into a sleep/hibernation mode and can't connect with the live tv again when you want the XB1 to wake up when you try to make everything work. Whenever I've had the freeze/black screen
 issue I've gone to the Power &amp; startup section and turned the XBox off completely. When it starts again I've seen the green Xbox screen just like the initial startup. So, I'm keeping the instant on off for now and keeping it in energy mode which kills a lot
 of the features, but also keeps my live tv on until MS can figure it out. </p>

<p>*edit - some say that they're having a problem with their dvr when fast forwarding or rewinding and the suggested fix is to leave the Optical audio to Stereo uncompressed.

<p>I have only the lost TV sound problem and what nearly always fixes it is disconnecting HDMI from my cable box (Uverse) and reconnecting it. I've used 2 different HDMI cables trying to avoid the issue but it still starts up without TV sound about half the
 time. I think I'll switch to power saving mode since I never use voice activation to turn it on, anyway.</p>

            Hi,<br />
all that depends on the software you are using.<br />
Most will let you connect to your computer and you can pull up the saving location on your cam, then drag and drop the pics to a location on your computer.<br />

<h2>            Boot problems on a nvme samsung 970Evo drive</h2>
                    Greetings,<br />
<br />
I have an equiry for boot error on my nvme drive , and how I solve it but still have boot problems again.<br />
<br />
1) Motherboard MSI x470 Gaming Carbon Pro<br />
2) The Boot drive is an Nvme Samsung 970evo<br />
3) cpu is ryzen 5 2600<br />
4) Ram is dominator platinium ddr4 3200<br />
<br />
Sometimes with a cold boot, windows 10 pro don't boot, boot loops, its trying to restore, and stopcodes<br />
I am trying to use my usb win 10 installation and my usb recovery disk but they don't work (when I take off the nvme is working the win 10 installation)<br />
<br />
My temporarly solve is to change the m.2 place to the second port, but still the same problems, and magically after time all work.<br />
<br />
I have now updated the bios of my motherboard.<br />
<br />
But I am asking why so much problems with the Nvme drives when they work with pci express lanes. The problem is unstable, and the solve is not 100% and works just when it wants to. I would like some technical information, I am my own system builder and I am
 an electronic engineer.<br />
<br />
Motherboard warning leds never show problems, and the bios is mostly untouched except ram speed. but the problem is not this because when I troubleshoot I use default speeds. I need a fix when this problem with boot comes again, some info, what is wrong.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your time<br />

            Hi Vasilios.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There's a good tutorial here for how to reinstall Windows to NVME which has worked for many others:   <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-reinstall-windows-completely-on-an-m2-nvme/644be6f8-539e-4218-8d40-1c53283d9fc3?tm=1545244578184">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />What I'd add is remove any other drives during install to avoid interference so that you can be sure the boot files aren't derailed to another drive.  
<br />
<br />If you want to try to determine if this is what has happened you can  post a screenshot of Disk Management, which I read like a doctor reads X-rays.  Follow the steps here so I can see everything needed to advise you:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/post-a-screenshot-of-disk-mgmt/04a8ef8c-c882-404e-a26b-89867c4ddf55?tm=1441932228382">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/foru...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also run a Startup Repair and additionally Rebuild the BCD to try to correct any problems with the boot files:

<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Also, it may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen crashes. 
<br />
<br />Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.
<br />
<br />Here's a link on using OneDrive:

<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop.
<br />
<br />Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.

I dont want to reinstall the windows if it is possible, but I am prepared if I have to.<br />
<br />
I don't understand how the problem dissappears and appears ( in order to fix it properly) I am making a rufus usb.&nbsp;<br />
I have a recovery usb made with the tutorials (dont work when the problem is), I have the usb windows, that don't work to go into RE options when the problem is.<br />
<br />
Now the pc has booted fine, and I have some updated that I delaying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Use only the Media Creation Tool which prepares the media to boot for both UEFI and Legacy BIOS. Rufus will only make one or the other and isn't as reliable.

<br />
Did you say that all other drives were removed when you installed to the NVME? <br />
<br />
I notice there appears to be an OS on DISK0 installed to Legacy as shown by the presence of the System Reserved Active partition, while the DISK4 OS is installed to UEFI. This means the system has both EFI and Legacy, requiring the CSM or Legacy BIOS setting
 to be enabled in addition to the UEFI. <br />
<br />
Since nothing was said about a Dual Boot is it possible there is an old System drive now used for storage that did not have its System Reserved partition wiped or deleted, as this can very well cause the problems you describe. An old System drive should actually
 be wiped to get all code out of the boot sector, with at least Diskpart Clean Command. Otherwise it will pause to query the Active flag which signals a System boot partition in Legacy BIOS, complicated even more by the fact your NVME install is to UEFI.
<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Besides removing the system reserved partition or wiping the Windows 7 storage drive to get it cleanest,&nbsp; I would go into UEFI setup and change To UEFI only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If DISK4 is the install you did to the NVME why does it still have the 500GB factory OEM partition at the front of it? Was the drive not wiped before it was installed?
<br />
<br />
Please clarify each of these so i can help you better. As of now my main concern is the Active flag and if it should even be there.

            Hello Greg, <br />
<br />
in my disk 0 is my old windows 7 install ,I have the files from this back up (my files photos etc), and reuse it on my old machine&nbsp; can it make conflicts?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
disk 4 is the Nvme, and I install it with the motherboard outside the case.&nbsp; they I just connected the drives, I can disconnect it I took the files I needed (the old OS drive)&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I don't remeber if I used the MSI SSD erase, or I did and did not worked. The Nvme was new, with all the stickers in place. Even though I have build many systems I have never made one with a SSD and Nvme before. I always check to format the disk before, but
 windows 10 different.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
thank you again for your time and effort to educate me with this problem<br />

<p>Vascilios, If you are not still booting Windows 7 on the machine then the System Reserved partition should be removed, especially since it holds an active flag that will cause the UEFI's firmware Compatibility Service Module to pause and query it during
 the boot process. <br />
<br />
Besides this there is bootable code left on an OS drive that can interfere if the drive isn't properly wiped before reusing it for data storage
<br />
<br />
So absolute best would be to move the data off to wipe the drive with Diskpart Clean Command and reformat:
<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/52129-disk-clean-clean-all-diskpart-command.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/52129-disk...</a><br />

<br />
Until you're able to do that you should at least delete the System Reserved partition in Disk Management, or from a Partition manager like Easeus. If necessary remove the Active flag first:
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/197157-partition-mark-inactive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/197157-par...</a><br />
If it balks use these same steps to remove an OEM partition: <a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2008/02/29/delete-and-remove-to-unlock-eisa-hidden-recovery-or-diagnostic-partition-in-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.mydigitallife.info/2008/02/29/delete...</a><br />
<br />
If this doesn't solve the boot problems then there is still the issue with the NVME not having it's 500mb Factory boot partition at least deleted&nbsp; so it doesn't conflict with the new EFI system partition actually doing the booting.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If now or later you want to get it cleanest wipe the drive with Clean Command to get all code in the boot sector and partition table. this will resolve best the problem with two boot partitions on the drive which could very well conflict - by the presence
 of the 500mb partition, or the code it wrote in the boot sector of the drive which was not cleaned first.

<h2>            PS4&#47;Wireless Controller not being detected when plugged in.</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to use one of my ps4 controllers to play games on my pc, but for some reason it is not being detected whenever I plug it in. It will charge and lights on it come up and everything but under devices, wireless controller does not come up. Yes,
 I've tried hitting the reset button several times. No luck. My other ps4 controller works perfectly using the DS4 tool (but the analog stick is messed up so I wanna use this one). I'm not sure why it's not working as I have all the required drivers xbox360
 driver controller driver etc and the other controller is the same so I don't see why I'm having trouble detecting this one. I've also tried plugging it into every usb I have with no luck for this particular controller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or insight would be appreciated. Thanks.</p>

<p>That's the indication it gives when the battery has failed. HP might provide a pre-boot diagnostic utility that might confirm that, or give more information.

<p>I run a herd of HP notebooks.&nbsp; When I hit this issue,&nbsp;I do this with 100% success -</p>
<p>
</p><p>1&nbsp;&nbsp; I swap out the battery</p>
<p>2&nbsp;&nbsp; I swap out the little harness that connects the plug end&nbsp;of the charger to the mother board</p>
<p>3&nbsp;&nbsp; Change the motherboard</p>
<p>
</p><p>I doubt I have ever solved this issue with steps with 1 and 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get guaranteed results with step 3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I always play around with all the suggested power off's, the battery checking, etc, &nbsp;before the new motherboard.&nbsp; Contrary to a lot of theories, a new motherboard of same specs does not deactivate 10.&nbsp; Been there, done that.</p>

                    <p>On windows XP I need to connect to two different networks. One wifi connection for internet and other one for file sharing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Different gateways, different static address, same subnet mask. But it gives problem when run simultaneously and needs

            Go to where you have set up the static IP addresses for your network adapters.&nbsp; Leave the "Default Gateway" blank for your local file sharing adapter and insert a valid Default Gateway for your wifi adapter to the internet.&nbsp; This will, of course, limit
 your local file sharing adapter to a single subnet -- which should be OK for home or small office use.<br />
<br />
This should work so long as the two physical subnets have two different subnet numbers. Generally this means that the first three numbers of the adapter's IP address cannot the same on both adapters --&nbsp; if they are, then you need to make one of the subnets
 different. (i.e. one is 192.168.1.xxx&nbsp; and the other would be 192.168.2.xxx).&nbsp; This is typically accomplished in a Router's configuration page.<br />

    <title>Final Fantasy XIII Versus RENAMED Final Fantasy XV. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smileskybird  say:</h3>
<h2>            Final Fantasy XIII Versus RENAMED Final Fantasy XV.</h2>
                    
<p>I found this out when I was looking up Xbox One on Wikipedia. It had a link to Xbox One games and found "Final Fantasy XV" XIII Versus was introduced around 2006 and was intended for just the PS3. Now Square Enix have renamed it Final Fantasy XV and will
 be released for Xbox One and PS4. Looks like theres no need for Square Enix to make games just for Play Station since PS4 and Xbox One will be using an AMD Jaguar 8 core APU. I love Final Fantasy XIII. It was my 1st Xbox 360 game and my 1st Final Fantasy game.</p>

<p>Square Enix will no longer be making games just for PlayStation. &nbsp;Final Fantasy XIV will be exclusive to PS3 and PS4 but that is a special instance that was worked out years ago. &nbsp;Square has just been having a lot of trouble getting Final Fantasy XIV rebooted
 which is why it hasn't happened yet. &nbsp;Otherwise you'll see Final Fantasy XV, Kingdom Hearts III and others being multiplatform. &nbsp;:)</p>

<h2>            W10 Creator Update V. 1703 on ThinkPad T60</h2>
                    <p>My old ThinkPad T60 is with Intel Graphics Media Accelerator 950.</p>
<p>I did a clean install of W10 V 1703 because of an endless loop during normal Windows Update.</p>
<p>The Version 1703 woks well apart from the fact that the screen brigtness at maximum is reduced to about 25 % of what it was before, so the PC is not nice to use anymore.</p>
<p>I hope a future update will solve the problem.</p>

            <p>Thanks for answer. I know the Lenovo support site.</p>
<p>I still think the issue will be corrected since it is the only one.</p>
<p>Everything worked perfectly with Version 1607.</p>
<p>It is a little bit strange that when you use the MediaCreation Tool you have to accept the Version 1703 allthough MS everywhere ask you to wait upgrading to 1703 because they know it has a lot of issues.</p>

            <p>Though you may consider "Everything worked perfectly with Version 1607." Without OEM provided&nbsp;driver and firmware support, application compatibility, and/or feature support for your device, you are seeing only about one third or less of the features and
 security provided by Windows 10. And, apparently, not even seeing that very well at this point. Use of an unsupported OS on the Internet (or any network) puts you in the same, unsafe, boat as anyone using Windows XP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installation of an OEM supported OS and requisite drivers on your old laptop will rectify your usability issues, however, it may still not be safe for network use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The same guidance pertaining to waiting until a device is provided the Feature Update through the standard Windows Update channel has been provided for every Feature Update. Hardware and software are depreciated with every new version of Windows. Following
 the provided guidance will save users unnecessary trouble.</p>

=====================================<br />
Several options for rotating a video clip...<br />
<br />
1) You can use the freeware VLC Media Player to rotate<br />
the video for a single viewing.<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
VLC Media Player (32-bit Version)<br />
<a href="http://www.filehippo.com/download_vlc_32/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.filehippo.com/download_vlc_32/</a><br />
(runs on XP/Vista/7/8)<br />
(the filename to download is : vlc-2.0.5-win32.exe)<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System<br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />
<br />
VLC Media Player (64-bit Version)<br />
<a href="http://www.filehippo.com/download_vlc_64/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.filehippo.com/download_vlc_64/</a><br />
(runs on XP/Vista/7/8)<br />
(the filename to download is : vlc-2.0.5-win64.exe)<br />
<br />
Open a video in VLC Media Player and pause it...then go to...<br />
Tools / Effects and Filters / Video Effects tab / Geometry tab /<br />
Check the Rotate box / Drag the circle / Close / Play.<br />
<br />
<br />
2) If the video is compatible with Movie Maker it<br />
has a rotate 90° effect.<br />
<br />
<br />
3) Freemake Video Converter can rotate a video clip<br />
then you can save the clip in the same format or convert<br />
it to a different format.:<br />
<br />

<p>I'm pretty stoked that they're not releasing another for a while to be honest, especially with being able to import a bunch of songs to WOR from the older games. Shame it costs points but still, nice. Enough to keep my GH cravings covered until 2012 or whenever,
 hah.</p>

<p>Hello Justice2009. To answer your question. YES of-course you can play DLC songs online, but (there is always a but) the people you play with have to have the DLC as well to actually choose it. To make it clearer, the people you are playing online with MUST
 have the DLC song you want to play, to be able to actually choose it. Hope that helped. Happy gaming.</p>

<p>Warriors Of Rock is the newest Guitar Hero for the consoles and there is also a mobile version that came out last year for the iPhone/iPod touch. A lot of people suspected that WOR would be the last GH (forever), after Activision decided to put the series
 on an indefinite hiatus. However, there have been rumors (check Google) circulating the web that Activision will soon begin work on the next installment in the series. I don't think they ever intended on breaking apart from the series, but just needed a serious
 vacation. ;)</p>

    <title>Should I stop buying Microsoft hardware&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lornephillips  say:</h3>
<h2>            Should I stop buying Microsoft hardware&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I lost my charger for my Surface Pro 2 which I purchased in 2013 and went to buy another at a Microsoft store. I was told that there is no longer any chargers available for any Surface 2 products. Bestbuy also does not carry.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been a big supporter of Microsoft even through Window 7 to 8 to 10&nbsp;but if a $2000 piece of hardware is only supported for two years I am having doubts. You can still get Apple chargers for hardware greater then 5 plus years. Why should I continue
 to support Microsoft with the lack of support on Surface Pro 2? I purchased in 2013 and can no longer get a replacement charger, Does that mean no parts for a 4 by 2017?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am truly an MS guy but question them when things like this happen. The staff in the store were rude and the technology is dropped so soon ... do I switch to Apple?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know why this decision was made and how do I travel with my Pro 2 when I can not find a charger. Most on Amazon have terrible reviews and do not give a charge or melt.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Stuck on Start Screen after Docking - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michaelbrossart  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Stuck on Start Screen after Docking</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded my Surface Pro 3 to Windows 10.&nbsp; When I dock it after using it stand alone for awhile it goes to the Start Screen even though I have the Start Screen turned off in Settings.&nbsp; I can use the Task View to get into programs that are running.&nbsp;
 I can access applications that are populated on the Start pop-up, they now show up on the Start Screen.&nbsp; I can even access the full list of applications.&nbsp; But I cannot get back to Desktop mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I boot into Windows while the Surface is in the dock everything works fine.</p>

I can connect to the internet, I have no place setting for my network (Public, Home network, Work Network) and can not set it as seen below. I can't connect to a network (even though I am connected to the router). I have read all the threads on any thing connected

            <p>Hi Bob_1816,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to check the status of the network adapter in device manger.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To check for any error message associated with Network Adapter, do the following:</p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>Start</b>, type
<b>Device Manager</b> in the Start search box and hit <b>ENTER</b>.</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click <b>View</b> on the
<b>Menu</b> bar and select <b>Show hidden devices</b>. </p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
