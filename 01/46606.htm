<h2>            Changing photo filename also changes thumbnail</h2>
                    <p>I have been renaming some photos in File Explorer.&nbsp; For some reason, the thumbnail of one photo changed when I renamed it.&nbsp; I believe it now has the same thumbnail of the photo that used to be on its "left."&nbsp; When I open it, it is the correct photo.&nbsp;&nbsp; I
 have tried closing the folder and restarting the computer.&nbsp; I renamed a few more, and they are fine.&nbsp; I also tried copying the same photo from a different folder (it's saved in a couple different places.)&nbsp; But renaming the copy resulted in the thumbnail changing
 again, to the same incorrect one!&nbsp; So weird.&nbsp; Does anyone have an idea why this might be happening, and what I can do to fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help!</p>

<p><span>Hi William,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the steps mentioned below that would help you fix problems updating office 2007 and adobe.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: When installing Adobe Acrobat or Adobe Reader 7 or later on Windows, one of the following error messages appears, and
 the installation quits:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Error 1402: Could not open key<em>[key name]</em>.</span></li><li><span>Error 1406: Could not write value Folders to key<em>[key name]</em>.&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;<br />

<p><br />
<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: You receive an error message when you install an Office program or open an Office program or document</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/838687" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/838687</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After following these steps, you can try installing Expression web and iTunes.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful and let me know if you need any further assistance.</span></p>

<h3> tim webster  say:</h3>
<h2>            RUNDLL32.EXE icon has changed to a document symbol and the program has stopped working</h2>
                    I've run a number of anti-malware and registry-fix programs.&nbsp; No sign of malware or continuing registry problems.&nbsp; Why the icon would change from an "applications" symbol to a "document" symbol in the absence of malware has me puzzled<br />
<br />
My latest fix was obtaining a clean copy of RUNDLL32.EXE and replacing the original in C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32, where C: is my boot disk.&nbsp; (Yes, I did change permissions to do so).&nbsp; After a reboot it, too, changed to a document icon and refused to run.&nbsp; Error =
 "Windows host process (Rundll32) has stopped working".<br />
<br />
I'm mystified!&nbsp; Can anybody help?<br />

            Many thanks for your help, and HAPPY NEW YEAR!!!!!!<br />
<br />
I tried both Method 1 and Method 2, but still have the same problem.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Some other facts that might be useful:<br />
1) RUNDLL32 is the only EXE file in SYSTEM32 folder that changes icons and quits working.&nbsp; As far as I can tell it is the only problem.<br />
2)&nbsp; When I copy a "clean' RUNDLL32 file it starts the copy with an "application" icon, but switches immediately to a "document" icon as soon as it shows up in the SYSTEM32 folder.&nbsp; The EXE extension doesn't change.<br />
3)&nbsp; It shows up as running in TSKMGR, using differing amounts of memory at different times, but no CPU usage except a blip when I try to run an app that uses it.&nbsp;&nbsp; It sometime shows up with two copies running at the same time, but this is rare.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thanks again.<br />
Tim<br />

            <p><span><span>Hi Chaitanya,<br />
<br />
As the error message clearly indicates, setting association for the file extension in control panel should fix this problem.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span>Here’s how:<br />
a. Open Default Programs by clicking the <strong><span>Start</span></strong> button, typing
<strong><span>default programs</span></strong> and then clicking <strong><span>Default Programs</span></strong>.<br />
b.&nbsp; Click on <strong><span>Associate a file type or protocol with a program</span></strong>.<br />
This opens list of extensions. Click on any of the extensions.<br />
c.&nbsp; To change the default program for the particular extension, click on <strong>
<span>change program</span></strong> button.<br />
&nbsp; d. Select the program you want to open with and click <strong><span>Ok</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Additional information on other default program settings:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Change which programs Windows uses by default</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />

            <p>Most manufacturers will include a trial copy of Microsoft Office with the purchase of a new computer, this usually runs for 60 days. Many manufacturers are including what is called Microsoft Office Starter which included Word Starter, Excel Starter with
 the limited capabilities:</p>
<p>What to expect from Office Starter 2010 </p>
<ul>
<li>Office Starter 2010 is a reduced-functionality, advertising-supported version of Office 2010.
</li><li>It will be pre-loaded by OEMs on new PCs with Office 2010 Single Image </li><li>Office Starter 2010 will provide new PC owners with immediate exposure to the Office 2010 experience on new PCs right out of the box.
</li><li>Office Starter 2010 will replace Microsoft Works </li><li>It will be offering the Office user experience, such as the Ribbon, with a simple path to upgrade to a fully-featured version of Office 2010 directly from within the product.
</li><li>It will be having a limited version of Word and Excel, which is fully compatible with the other Office Suites and is designed for home users who are not ready to buy a full suite
</li><li>Check the chart below for the comparison between Office Starter and Home &amp; Student</li></ul>
<p><a href="http://hsk1313.files.wordpress.com/2010/02/bf295ff516426cd98131ccd6a8a3b09a.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fhsk1313.files.wordpress.com%2f2010%2f02%2fbf295ff516426cd98131ccd6a8a3b09a.png%3fw%3d300" /></a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need more capabilities you can always upgrade to a higher edition such as Home and Student or Professional.
</p>
<p>I would recommend you check out the system details before you make your purchase, the manufacturer will often list what is preloaded.</p>

<h2>            BSOD caused by driver&#59; ntoskrnl.exe. Caused by address&#59; ntoskrnl.exe&#43;75bc0</h2>
                    <p>Let me preface this by stating that I have read as many troubleshooting guides and other posts as possible over the past week whilst this has been an issue for me. I have so far used windows inbuilt tools to test the ram as well as any bad sectors in the
 hard drive, neither found any problems. I ran memtest for 10+ hours last night and had 0 errors. I have also had driver verifier enabled which took over 20 hours to bluescreen my PC. There is nothing I can spot that is common between the bluescreens, they
 occur at different times during different processes and with varying regularity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The one aspect that they appear to share is the information displayed in the title which is displayed in bluescreenview and has been associated with my last two crashes (I have not got minidumps for previous ones).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would therefore greatly appreciate any help that can be given in resolving this as I don't have the technical expertise required to deal with this issue.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the dump file from yesterday in which driver verifier was not turned on</p>

<p>https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=7A16E3C25ED679%21107<br />

</p>
<p>And this is the dump file from today with driver verifier turned on</p>
<p>https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=7A16E3C25ED679%21108</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for your time in reading this.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Not driver verified but it doesn't matter because these are related to hardware.&nbsp; Specifically Intel.&nbsp; Called a BCC124</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><div>
<div><strong>Stop 0x124 is a hardware error</strong><br />
<div><em><em><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>If you are overclocking try resetting your processor to standard settings and see
 if that helps.</strong></span></em></em></div>
If you continue to get BSODs here are some more things you may want to consider.<br />
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">This is usually heat related, defective hardware, memory or even processor though
 it is"possible" that it is driver related (rare).</span></em><br />
<strong><br />
Stop 0x124 - what it means and what to try</strong><br />
Synopsis:<br />
<em>A "stop 0x124" is fundamentally different to many other types of bluescreens because it stems from a hardware complaint.<br />
Stop 0x124 minidumps contain very little practical information, and it is therefore necessary to approach the problem as a case of hardware in an unknown state of distress.<br />
</em><br />
<br />
<strong>&nbsp;Generic "Stop 0x124" Troubleshooting Strategy:</strong><br />
<br />
1)&nbsp;<strong>Ensure that none of the hardware components are overclocked.</strong>&nbsp;Hardware that is driven beyond its design specifications - by overclocking - can malfunction in unpredictable
 ways.<br />
2)&nbsp;<strong>Ensure that the machine is adequately cooled.</strong><br />
&nbsp;If there is any doubt, open up the side of the PC case (be mindful of any relevant warranty conditions!) and point a mains fan squarely at the motherboard. That will rule out most (lack of) cooling issues.<br />
3)&nbsp;<strong>Update all hardware-related drivers</strong>: video, sound, RAID (if any), NIC... anything that interacts with a piece of hardware.<br />
It is good practice to run the latest drivers anyway.<br />
4)&nbsp;<strong>Update the motherboard BIOS according to the manufacturer's instructions and clear the CMOS.</strong><br />
Their website should provide detailed instructions as to the brand and model-specific procedure.<br />
5)&nbsp;<strong>Rarely, bugs in the OS may cause "false positive" 0x124 events where the hardware wasn't complaining but Windows thought otherwise (because of the bug).</strong><br />
At the time of writing, Windows 7 is not known to suffer from any such defects, but it is nevertheless important to always keep Windows itself updated.<br />
6)&nbsp;<strong>Attempt to (stress) test those hardware components</strong>&nbsp;which can be put through their paces artificially.<br />
The most obvious examples are the RAM and HDD(s).<br />
For the RAM, use the 3rd-party memtest86 utility to run many hours worth of testing. (6-8 passes to stress the ram out)<br />
For hard drives, check whether CHKDSK /R finds any problems on the drive(s), notably "bad sectors".<br />
Unreliable RAM, in particular, is deadly as far as software is concerned, and anything other than a 100% clear memory test result is cause for concern. Unfortunately, even a 100% clear result from the diagnostics utilities does not guarantee that the RAM is
 free from defects - only that none were encountered during the test passes.<br />
7)&nbsp;<strong>As the last of the non-invasive troubleshooting steps</strong>, perform a "vanilla" reinstallation of Windows: just the OS itself without any additional applications, games, utilities,
 updates, or new drivers - NOTHING AT ALL that is not sourced from the Windows 7 disc.<br />
Should that fail to mitigate the 0x124 problem, jump to the next steps.<br />
If you run the "vanilla" installation long enough to convince yourself that not a single 0x124 crash has occurred, start installing updates and applications slowly, always pausing between successive additions long enough to get a feel for whether the machine
 is still free from 0x124 crashes.<br />
Should the crashing resume, obviously the very last software addition(s) may be somehow linked to the root cause.<br />
If stop 0x124 errors persist despite the steps above, and the hardware is under warranty, consider returning it and requesting a replacement which does not suffer periodic MCE events.<br />
Be aware that attempting the subsequent hardware troubleshooting steps may, in some cases, void your warranty:<br />
8)&nbsp;<strong>Clean and carefully remove any dust from the inside of the machine.</strong><br />
Reseat all connectors and memory modules.<br />
Use a can of compressed air to clean out the RAM DIMM sockets as much as possible.<br />
9)&nbsp;<strong>If all else fails, start removing items of hardware one-by-one in the hope that the culprit is something non-essential which can be removed.</strong><br />
Obviously, this type of testing is a lot easier if you've got access to equivalent components in order to perform swaps.<br />
<br />
 above without a resolution of the symptom, unfortunately the most likely reason is because the error message is literally correct - something is fundamentally wrong with the machine's hardware.</strong></span></div>

    <title>System failure due to new update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> firstfreekgeek  say:</h3>
<h2>            System failure due to new update</h2>
                    
<p>I have been using my Xbox with no problems for 2 years. I hardly play games on it any more, mostly just use it for Netflix, Hulu and as a DVD player. When I started my system on the 19th I got the message about the update and having never had an issue before,
 even after having just done the update to support Hulu, I downloaded the update. The update fully downloaded and started to install and then gave me an error. The error code is 3151-335a-b380-0502-c000-0221. I shut off the Xbox and started it again and it
 just started to apply the update and gives the same error. I called the support number and was told that it is a problem with my Xbox and that I needed to pay for out of warranty repair on it. I was told that it is a hardware failure and it had nothing to
 do with the update. The woman also told me that there is no way to reverse the update. I tried to explain that obviously my system was working before the update or else I wouldn't have made it that far, she told me it didn't matter. Now I have no way of starting
 the system that operated fine before the update. At this point I am in the process of trying to sell all my games and accessories because there is no way I am going to pay $120 to Microsoft to fix something that worked fine till they updated it. Thought before
 I just get rid of everything I would get on here and look for other possible fixes.</p>

<p>Another call to Xbox support today. After some attempts to correct the problem, they told me that it needs to go in for repair, paid repair. The support tech told me that something had to have not been working and that the update found the problem. I think
 that the update found hardware they no longer want to support but that they want it to be the job of the customer to pay for it. Canceled my Live subscription before it could bill again.
</p>
<p>Just a thought, everyone who is having similar issues, what build date do you all show on your Xbox. Mine was May 2008.</p>

<p>As far as I know, I thought all blu-ray were shot in 16:9 ratio. I've never watched a blu-ray that's had the black bars.

<p>iv not come across a blu ray player that has zoom yet and to be honest I think I will go back to dvds with movies that have 2.35 ratio, at least I will enjoy them, the 360 had a zoom function just hoping the one has cus it may win me over the ps4.

<p>When using the Xbox to watch DVDs (Best DVD player ever. So quick, and no scratched disc is too scratched) I always found that selecting the letter box screen type would usually provide me with the best fit for my television. The black bars you speak of
 are a result of widescreen.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>[snip]</p>
<p>One day I got a warning on my pc--a small yellow triangle with an exclamation mark in it--saying something like a file with a strang name like $Smft or something like this had been lost, then a similar second alert/warning.</p>
<p>[snip]</p>
<p>windows xp has named the ext hd as Local Disk (G:). under drive properties/general/ 'Type' is Local Disk and 'File System' is RAW. Used space is 0 bytes, and free space zero bytes.</p>
<p>under Properties/Hardware this drive and my C drive show up as does the floppy and the 2 cd/dvd drives. This drive shows there as WD Ext HDD 1021 USB Device.</p>
[snip]</blockquote>
<p>While you're waiting for WD support to get back to you ...</p>
<p>The fact that the external disk shows (e.g., in My Computer) as a Local Disk is normal.&nbsp; AFAIK, the distinction is between Local and Networked disks.</p>
<p>The more troubling issue is that Windows is seeing the disk as unformatted (RAW).</p>
<p>It sounds as if the Master File Table on the WD disk has become corrupt (does $mft now sound familiar?).</p>
<p>Try running CHKDSK G: /F</p>
<blockquote>
NTFS File system corruption
In very rare circumstances, the NTFS Metafiles $MFT or $BITMAP may become corrupted and result in lost disk space. This issue can be identified and fixed by running a<strong>chkdsk /F</strong> against the volume in question. Toward the end of<strong>chkdsk</strong>
 , you receive the following message if the $BITMAP needs to be adjusted:
<div>Correcting errors in the master file table's (MFT) BITMAP attribute.<br />
CHKDSK discovered free space marked as allocated in the volume bitmap.<br />
Windows has made corrections to the file system.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>This may, indeed, result in lost data (i.e., if the "free space marked as allocated" really is your data).&nbsp; However, if you've already recovered as much of the data as you can using Recuva, it's probably worth a try.&nbsp; Or, you can take a look at

            Here is my similarvstory sad story with WD TB Elements Drive <br />
<ul>
<li>* Bought it with lot of hope and pomp </li><li>* put around 300 GB (all my precious Photos, MPEGs) which I copied from my SOny Handycam, Thinking I was safe, I deleted the Sony Hanycam
</li><li>* I didnt use my Elements for anything much, just thought that it will be safe to store * Last week, bang - it shows 0 TB
</li><li>* I tried every option published on the Internet, including spending billions of hours on the bulleting boards just to hope that someone will have a solution</li><li>* the solutions given were varied (someone said corrput controller, someone said bad cable, someone said remove the casing and do some repairs, others said it is a corrupt volume etc etc)
</li><li>* Finally I located the WD service Center at my location, India (mind you - on none of their corporate sites, the WD has listed the contact numbers of service center)
</li><li>* Here is the conversation with the Service Engineer, who picked up promptly though
</li></ul>
<ul>
<li>** Have you connected your disk to the USB sir ? <br />
</li><li>** Are your seeing your Drive "H" sir ?</li><li>** I can replace your Disk immediately, but are you worried about your Data (heck, I dont mind paying a 10grand for my 300GB of photos)
<br />
</li><li>** Finally he asked me to go to "Device Manager", and "Populate" the Volume information (the basic thing that someone would have done). I still did</li><li>&nbsp;** Conclusion from the Service Engineer - In am soory sir, your disk is badly damaged and you have to "format" it * No one bothers about data ?
<br />
</li><li>* But he actually gae me a good piece of advice - take it to a data recovery center * I said ok. Then he says " but it has to be a "authorized WD" recovery center"</li><li>* I saw hope - you mean to say that you do have authorized Recovery Centers <br />
</li><li>* No sir - you send authorization mail and we will authorize you tp send it to a recovery center. Otherwise if you directly send to a third part center, you will lose warranty
<br />
</li><li>* So what should I do ? - He says " write a mail to "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***" and with 48 business hours, we will respond. Heck...in France 48 business hours will take you from one monday to the next
<br />
</li><li>* amnyway I sent the mail and hoped that they will send the details of authorized recovery center and some hope
<br />
</li><li>* they didnt take 48 hpurs though. In 24 hopurs I got amail form them. A funny mail which says "we dont have any AUthorized Third Party Recovery Centers".
<br />
</li><li>You can take it to any of your choice, but note the following terms and condisions
<br />
</li><li>a-disk should not be damaged by 3rd party, <br />
</li><li>b-disk shopuld not be burnt by third party <br />
</li><li>c-disk shouldnt be cleaned by acid by 3rd party and a few more terms of their own).
<br />
</li><li>Basically nothing to help me. Just ensuring that WD protects their backs in case I ask for a replacement So this is where I am And what should I do now
<br />
</li><li>* I called a young but trusted Engineer whom I knew. He took it to his garage like house. Used some screw drivesrs and opened the casing. He told me "boss-the head is damaged". I aske dhim why. And the truth seems to have come out
<br />
</li><li>* WD disks have a tendency to create problems in two cases <br />
</li><li>(a) over heated <br />
</li><li>(b) Indian power conditions fluctuations affect the disk and <br />
</li><li>(c) WD disks have issues when you move them in and out of USB ports <br />
</li><li>* He advised me that WD disks should be handled very carefully and should not be transported multiplemplaces My company makes Hardware for other purposes and I checked with our QA and they confirmed that they do have a problem with WD SO here I a waitng
 with bated breath for my engineer to find the "head", and check if that works. If not I have to format
<br />
</li><li>Lastly, again funny, I got a mail from WD Support and guess what, it was a "Customer Satisfaction Survey" for a Tickert that was closed....</li><li>So wait for a few days (today is Aug 30, 2011) - The Engineer is trying something, and if it works and my drive gets restored, you wll have a possible solution and I will post back here the steps<br />

<h2>            Can&#39;t download Norton anit virus or Chrome using windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I just purchased a refurbished hp computer with windows 10.&nbsp; It came with McAfee which I removed because I have a paid version of Norton anti.&nbsp; I am now trying to install Norton, I signed into my Norton account, add a device, download appears but does not
 give an option to "Run", only shows "open" and "save" and cancel, when I try either of those it says it failed to upload.&nbsp; I thought it may be mcafee but Chrome and also the Mcafee removal program mcpr.exe won't download....again only open and save with no
 "run" option.&nbsp; I could download Google from the Microsoft store and Norton Studio.&nbsp; Tried Norton fro the studio but the same result.&nbsp; Thanks, hoping someone can help.</p>

<p>If you are doing a new install using the Media Creation tool do a Custom install.&nbsp; Pick the system drive as where you want to install and click Format.&nbsp; It will remove the former build completely. Then do the install.</p>
<p>Since you have Digital Entitlement your computer is activated.</p>
<p>Since the computer was activated there is no longer a need for a key.<br />
When asked for a key just go to the bottom of the page and click on Skip, Do this later, or I do not have one.</p>

<p>If you are doing a new install using the Media Creation tool do a Custom install.&nbsp; Pick the system drive as where you want to install and click Format.&nbsp; It will remove the former build completely. Then do the install.</p>
<p>Since you have Digital Entitlement your computer is activated.</p>
<p>Since the computer was activated there is no longer a need for a key.<br />
When asked for a key just go to the bottom of the page and click on Skip, Do this later, or I do not have one.</p>

<p>No I wasn`t intending to perform a clean install at the time of submitting my question.However later that same evening windows update decided to download and install the feature update to windows 10 version 1709 which I encountered problems with, so many
 in fact I had no choice but to begin reformatting the drive you mentioned to clean install. During the attempt to format in the partitions window just prior to setup the tool itself struggled before my PC crashed with the blue screen. The 1Tb HDD will not
 even run any software beyond the initial setup window.But anyhow I have now since reinstalled into a somewhat better upgraded PC and updated to version 1709 with complete success while learning my digital entitlement was easily re-established using the activation
 "troubleshoot" option as I installed on a different MOBO.</p>
<p>I got there in the end. Many thanks for your advice Lacrumb.&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>Original Title: Windows 10 Button and Cortana failure</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems to me that with so many people having a problem with the Start Button and Cortana suddenly quitting, that Microsoft would roll out a fix.&nbsp; I've gone through these discussion threads and there are like a thousand different fixes.&nbsp; I'm no computer
 tech - just a person who wants to get some work done!&nbsp; I've spent two days trying numerous fixes and I've probably only succeeded at messing up something else in my computer.&nbsp; What is the problem Microsoft? Give us a REAL fix!</p>

<h2>            HL-DT-ST DVDRAM GMA-4080N GONE</h2>
                    
<p>I Logged onto my pc today and found out that my cd/dvd driver no longer works or exsists, i am not to sure where to get the driver from but i have tried system restore and still nothing is working.</p>
<p>I dont understand how my drive gets deleted when no one has access to my computer and nothing has been removed in the past while.</p>

<p>1. First run this fix:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.aumha.org/regfiles.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.aumha.org/regfiles.htm</a> -
<span>for cdgone</span></p>
<p>2. If that doesn't help, check to see if the optical drive is seen in the BIOS. When you first start your computer there will be a message that says something like "Press F2 to enter Setup" or the like. Press that key to get into the BIOS. If the optical
 drive isn't shown there, either it or the connection to it on the motherboard has died. If the drive doesn't show up and assuming this is a desktop computer and not a laptop, with the machine unplugged:</p>
<p>a. Change the cable going from the drive to the motherboard. Test.<br />
b. If a. doesn't help, if possible move the drive cable to another appropriate connection on the motherboard. Test.<br />
c. If still no joy, swap the drive out for a known-working one. If the known-working drive still doesn't show up, the connection on the motherboard has failed. Make the decision whether to replace the motherboard based on the age of the computer.</p>
<p>3. If the drive does show up in the BIOS, swap it out for a known-working one and test.</p>

<p>I can do everything else in reach but when ever I try to play on the map "Corvette" My Xbox says to clean the disk but I don't understand because My game is installed to my HDD... I've tried reinstalling it and cleaning the disk. I've even tried to play
 without my HDD attached to my console, still nothing. It's not too bothersome just inconvenient. I believe it is only the map "Corvette" but it might be my Xbox since It has a bunch of ether problems that I just suffer through (like constant freezing and crashing)
 because I can't afford to get them fixed. I very much like to know why it does this even though I have the game installed.</p>

<p>Can anyone tell me why battlelog doesn't work with Xbox 360?</p>
<p>Even though I have a 'Origin account' &nbsp;it only seems to work for PC but not Xbox..can't find 'My Soldier".</p>
<p>Says I have to download the game ...but I don't want to play on PC I have it already on Xbox.</p>
<p>As many Xbox gamers would have figured out that you can't customise your soldier's loadout from any menu with Xbox. So whats the story here??</p>

<p>I use Battlelog just fine. Is your Origin account linked to your Gamertag?.. No idea why you are having problems and you can actually customize your loadout at the Test Range in the menus.

<p>Don't know how to find out if Origin account to my gamertag. How do I find out? ...I can't even log into Origin ...it says it's sending me instructions to reset password but when I check that email account (same one used for xbox live) there's nothing recieved.
 Any idea's?</p>
<p>I guess I can use the Test Range ..but using mobile phone in game would be better. :)

<p>I go into Test range everytime I get the gamesave corruptet as I have to redo all my wehicle settings.Quite annoying,but easy to do.What you have to do is join the test range,and press X.Thats it!This brings up the customising screen,and you are good to
 go</p>

            Are you sure the monitor shuts down and it's not the 'Black Screen' screensaver?<br />
<br />
If you are sure the monitor is being switched off:<br />
<br />
Have you already checked the 'Advanced Plan Settings' (A link on the Change Plan Settings page), make sure that 'Turn Off display after...' is set to 'Never'. Or maybe you have to set 'Adaptive Screen Shutdown' to Off.<br />
<br />
If it still doesn't work, maybe it's a setting of your graphics card, use its settings panel then.

<h3> roz bailey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Candy Crush Re-Install&#63;&#33;&#63; for Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I was having issues with my Candy Crush App on my Laptop not connecting to the internet or syncing to my facebook, since upgrading to Windows 10 ... from Windows 7.<br />
I read that one of the ways to 'TRY' and fix this issue is to uninstall the app and then re install....</p>
<p>Problem is... I can't seem to find a way to reinstall. &nbsp;If I go through the store, it tells me that it is installed. &nbsp;But if I search for it on my system, it can't be found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I completely admit that this new interface has me more than a little confused. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I'd love a little.... or a lotta, help here. &nbsp;:} &nbsp;Could someone point me in the right direction?</p>

<h2>            How do I force a shortcut to show up in &#34;all apps&#34; view in Windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    I have a small program which uses data from whichever directory I specify in the "Start in:" box in properties. However, when I add multiple shortcuts to the Start Menu with the same target app, but different start in locations, I only see the first shortcut
 I created in All apps.<br />
<br />
I'm assuming that Windows 8, by default, ignores all application shortcuts that have different start in paths if the target app is the same.<br />
<br />
How do I change this default behavior so that all shortcuts, regardless of if they have the same target, show up?<br />

<p><br />
It doesn't look like you've read my question. I'm asking how to make all shortcuts show up when I select all apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's a quick test you can try to see what I mean:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1:&nbsp;&nbsp;Navigate&nbsp;to C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Accessories.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2:&nbsp;Create a copy of the Notepad&nbsp;shortcut. In your directory, you should see "Notepad" and "Notepad - copy".
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3: Go back to your Start Menu, select "Win + Q" and check. Do you see both your "Notepad" and "Notepad - copy" shortcuts?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 8 seems to ignore shortcuts if they have the same Target application. Even if you create a dozen Notepad shortcut copies, it will only display one shortcut in the Start Menu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And my question, therefore, is how do I force Windows 8 to show me every shortcut I create? Because each shortcut I create may have a different "start in" path.</p>

            Yes, that's what I've had to do, but it doesn't solve the issue of how to make it show up in All Apps view. Workarounds are ok, but there needs to be a switch or something built in so you can see multiple shortcuts.<br />

<br />
i was wondering if i change the sound card will it fix this problem ? &nbsp;or maybe upgrade to windows 10 ?

<h2>            Windows 10 Activation error after clean install</h2>
                    <p><span>My computer crashed due to a fault in the hard drive a little while ago, since then I got a new one among other things and did
 a clean install of windows 10 but I'm unable to activate it, even though I have a valid product key.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I'm guessing its because it was in use on the broken hard drive, is there a way to deactivate it so I can activate it on the
 new one?</span></p>

            Hi  Addii911, there is no need to deactivate the old Windows installation on the old hard drive as that would not be possible anyway . . .
<br />
<br />Activation problems after a re-install of Windows 10 are generally because the incorrect Edition (Home, Pro . . . etc.) has been installed and that does not match the previously installed Edition, which your Windows licence is for . . .
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App (gear icon on your Start Button)
<br />
<br />Go to System - About
<br />
<br />What Edition (Home, Pro . . . etc.) is reported there and does it match the previously installed Edition?       
        </p>

            If you had your Windows 10 license activated previously, you got a digital license. You will never need the product key again once you get digital license. Since, you have a digital license, hence when you do clean install, the license information is automatically picked up from Microsoft activation servers. Windows will activate your Windows license from this information.
<br />
<br />Make sure the version installed is same as it was previous. For example, if it was Windows 10 Home, you need to install Windows 10 Home only not Windows 10 Pro. If at any point during installation it asks for the key, choose you will do it later on / skip.

<p>
</p><p>I had Windows 10 Home before and I have the same one now, but this is where it gets confusing.</p>
<p>When I use the activation troubleshooter, it says the edition doesn't match and that I had Windows 10 Pro</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8b053cbc-a669-4f12-a714-1ddab7e3561f?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8b053cbc-a669-4f12-a714-1ddab7e3561f?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>But I didn't, I still have the emailed receipt from when I bought it so I know for sure I had the Home edition...</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fe53bc57-9b13-454d-8429-a5c445584b3e?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fe53bc57-9b13-454d-8429-a5c445584b3e?upload=true" /></a></p>

            Hi Addii911, yes there is an error on the Microsoft end, you clearly purchased the Home Edition and have re-installed that Edition
<br />
<br />The problem is on their end as they have you registered as a Pro user . . .
<br />
<br />You need to contact Microsoft Support, they can access your Account online and resolve this for you and set your account to show the correct Edition . . .
