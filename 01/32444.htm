<h2>            You need to install at least 2GB of RAM before you can install and run Windows 8</h2>
                    Dear Windows.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm running Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit with 6GB of RAM.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The BIOS knows this, reporting 6144MB on startup.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows 7 knows it, reporting 6GB of RAM in use.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I shelled out $$ for the Windows 8 upgrade disc today and it's completely useless because it thinks I have less than 2GB of RAM.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This needs to be fixed pronto.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My machine is fine. Same as everyone else in here. This is NOT a hardware issue.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please fix this problem.</div>
                </div>

            It would appear that the solution to this problem is to flash your BIOS with the latest update from your motherboard manufacturer.
<div><br />
<div>The install is now working. I can only pray it makes it to the end.</div>

<h2>            Sculpt Keyboard stopped working</h2>
                    I was using the sculpt ergonomic keyboard last week and it suddenly stopped working. I changed the batteries thinking that was the issue, but it was not. The green LED light will come on, but nothing will type.&nbsp; The 10 digit keypad that is separate will
 work fine.&nbsp; I contacted Microsoft today and their only solution was to drive to the local Microsoft store 4 hours away to have it fixed.&nbsp; I did update the drivers&nbsp;per their website.&nbsp; Any suggestions?

    <title>How to fix Start Menu down arrows on brand new Windows 10 install&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tom_ec  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to fix Start Menu down arrows on brand new Windows 10 install&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This bugs me every time I build a new computer and install Windows 10 on it. It's nothing I'm doing differently than the other 30 or so computers I've built and installed Windows 10 on. I'm using a USB drive that I created with FCU from the Media Creation
 Tool. Most of the installs I do with it work fine on Dells or HPs or other OEMs. The Start Menu is full of bright and shinny icons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it seems sometimes when I install on custom hardware, like an ASUS motherboard, the Start Menu never completes filling in even though I go through the whole process of installing necessary drivers and then completely run Windows Update. I now have 12
 down arrows on the start menu that should be links to programs/apps. The only thing I can do is unpin all of them and try to reconstruct what should have been there by pinning new links. But I don't know what was there and they're probably not needed for me
 or my customer. But it's just annoying anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know why the Start Menu icons don't complete with a brand new install on a brand new hard drive?</p>

            Its either an issue with your display driver or you need to install all the latest cumulative updates for your computer.
<br />
<br />This works for some users:
<br />
<br />Run the Start menu troubleshooter:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_StartMenu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://aka.ms/diag_StartMenu</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Task Manager
<br />Select the Processes tab
<br />Scroll down to Windows Explorer then select it
<br />Click Restart
<br />
<br />If that does not work:
<br />
<br />uninstall your display driver:
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart

<p>Well, the problem is magically fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Brand new install, let Windows finish installing drivers.</p>
<p>- I tried a Windows Explorer restart.</p>
<p>- I tried to upgrade the graphics driver from the Windows provided Intel HD Graphics 510 (5/25/16) v20.19.15.4463 to the motherboard manufacturer provided (10/27/17) v23.20.16.4849. I did a reboot and WSAPPX was using high CPU and disk for about 20 seconds,
 I thought it was a good sign, then it stopped and nothing.</p>
<p>- I ran the Start Menu diag tool and it couldn't find a problem.</p>
<p>- I did all remaining windows updates and it's all current and still nothing.</p>
<p>- I ran the Start Menu diag tool again and still nothing.</p>
<p>- I installed Intel Rapid Storage Manager v15.9.0.1015 since all the required .NET had been installed and since only a standard Microsoft AHCI driver was installed. After the reboot the Start Menu magically appeared with all the "New" items like all the
 junkware games and apps. The Start Menu down arrow tiles now turned into the proper tiles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why installing an AHCI driver fixed the issue is beyond me.</p>

</p><p>Well, I found two more desktops with the same issue, but never snapped out of it, Compaq 6200 Pro Small Form Factor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fresh install of Windows 10 Home, installed all drivers including chipset and sata, then installed all updates. One computer has down arrows which has 2 "Explore" arrow sets which are off screen, below image, and the other just has the down arrow squares
 missing, so the start menu is half empty. Two identical computers with windows installed the same way at the same time, but the start menus are different. Both don't have the extra game junkware either, which is odd.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what causes this on a brand new install? I feel this should be reported as a bug, but I'm sure Microsoft already knows about since they're tracking everything I click and probably see, including start menu performance. So why don't they do anything about
 these missing items?</p>

<p>This happened again with a brand new install on an ASRock H170M Pro4 motherboard. Just like the picture above. The only drivers I had to install were the chipset and Intel AHCI SATA. Did all windows updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the install again this time disconnecting from the internet during the install. I then installed the chipset and SATA drivers. Then connected to the internet and saw the process "Microsoft Content (3)" run a few different times. After a minute I checked
 the start menu and it's full with the proper icons and even has the Microsoft games junkware. And this is even before finishing all windows updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously, am I the only one having this problem on numerous computers with a brand new Windows 10 install!?</p>
<p>Why doesn't "Microsoft Content" automatically run on some installs?</p>

<p>Had it happen again to a Toshiba C55-A. Installed Windows 10 Home. Installed drivers and updates, and the down arrows were still there. I reinstalled again and tried to install the chipset and sata drivers first, and that didn't work. Then I disconnected
 the internet during the 3rd install, then installed the chipset and sata drivers. Then I connected the internet and noticed the "Microsoft Content" process run and it fixed the Start menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just now I installed Windows 10 Pro on 3 identical computer using the same USB flash drive install. Two of them updated the Start Menu correctly and are okay. But one of them never updated the Start Menu after the install and updates. I tried to install
 the chipset and sata drivers and reconnect the internet, but the Start Menu is stuck with 12 down arrows. I see the "Microsoft Content" process running but not much activity out of it. What gives?</p>

</p><p>I'll try messing with the video driver next time. But this always seems to happen BEFORE a video driver is ever installed. I can remedy the problem by reinstalling the OS a 2nd time but disconnecting the internet. Then installing chipset and video drivers,
 then connecting to the internet. That seems to work every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next time this happens (I'm sure fairly soon as I install new Windows often on many machines) I'll install the video drivers then uninstall/reinstall them. Ridiculous hoop to jump through.</p>

<p>C1 and C2 were both great games, but they need to take a different approach if they are going to make a third. I think they need to do less paranormal/drunken stupors and more of the horrid criminal underground. Maybe even throw in some elements from games
 like manhunt. More survival horror...ish.<br />
<br />
Or maybe let us experience what the criminal underground is all about and have us step into the shoes of the killers. &nbsp;</p>

I honestly doubt there will ever be a Condemned 3 since there used to be one in the works called "Rise of the Oro" but it got scrapped like two years ago. But they definitely left the ending of Bloodshot open for a third installment. &nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Please God no. I remember when I first got my Xbox, I downloaded the demo for Condemned 1. I turned it on, walked around the corner, had the CRAP scared out of me and turned it off. Never touched the game again. No monsters, no horrifying creatures, just
 people jumping around corners. </p>

<p>I thought they were both great. The only thing i didn't really like that much was the fact that you couldn't tell wether or not the main character was drunk or was actually experiencing the paranormal.<br />

The last mission was like a complete genre hop...I was stunned.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The original had me hooked. Scared the heck outta me but i couldn't stop playing it because it was so interesting. Unfortunately, the 2nd one didn't grab my attention as much. It is currently in my backlog while it collects dust on the shelf.

<p>The first Condemned was great as it had the essentials for a solid action-thriller plot and executed tense moments in first-person. I also loved the second game and thought it was the better of the two in terms of gameplay and set piece moments, but where
 they faltered was the ridiculous paranormal narrative shoe-horned in at the end. Not to mention they completely rewrote the main character into a drunken hobo that acted nothing like he did in the original.</p>

<p>Please no.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Condemned 2 wasn't bad, it was very average...but it was such a drop off from the first game that I don't want anyone to even make an attempt at a third. The first was too good. Still the only game that has given me the chills.</p>

    <title>SOLVED&#58; Task Manager Icon Missing From System Tray - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dexgypmom  say:</h3>
<h2>            SOLVED&#58;  Task Manager Icon Missing From System Tray</h2>
                    I keep my Task Manager always running as an icon in the system tray.&nbsp; After a software update which I believe to be a Windows XP or IE7 update, I can no longer minimize my Task Manager to the system tray; the icon no longer shows up.&nbsp; I have not changed
 any of the view settings on the Task Manager bar; they are all checked.&nbsp; Now, I must keep the Task Manager minimized to the Taskbar instead.&nbsp; [None of the Taskbar settings were changed for the icons in the system tray since I downloaded the SP3 for XP over
 3 years ago.]&nbsp; Could this have been caused by the update or is there a way to get the Task Manager to minimize to the system tray again?&nbsp; Thank you.

            I had tried all of those types of troubleshooting functions before coming here including a complete anti-viral software scan of my system &amp; checking the Event Viewer.&nbsp; I even went into the registry to see if something happened to the system tray.&nbsp;
 cause it to disappear.<br />
<br />
The only thing I can conclude is something went awry during the MS Windows software update and installation of KB2660456, KB2647516-IE7, &amp; KB2661637.&nbsp; This was the only thing happening while I was using MS Paint, no browser was open or other software packages
 running except that which is required to update files over an internet connection.&nbsp; To take a stab at what it was exactly would be foolish because any number of operations could have interferred with or temporarily created a glitch with the Task Manager's
 view properties.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
So I chalk this one up to not performing the most basic "glitch fixer", the reboot, in my haste to find a culprit.&nbsp; I hope my blunder will remind others not to forget to start with the basics when troubleshooting sudden malfunctions.&nbsp; Thank you for your time
 and advice.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Bitlocker will not enable on system drive &#40;But will on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> myobu  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Bitlocker will not enable on system drive &#40;But will on other drives&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I just upgraded an older laptop to windows 10.</p>
<p>This laptop was a top of the line Toshiba that came with windows Vista and I have since upgraded it to windows 7 pro and now to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It runs quite well under windows 10, BTW (this machine is a beast with 2 physical HD)</p>
<p>
</p><p>However it does not have a TPM chip in it and I followed the procedure to go to gpedit.msc and allow bitlocker to run without the chip.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>I successfully encrypted the 2nd drive with bitlocker!</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>However&nbsp; I am unable to encrypt the system drive (c-drive)</p>
<p>I get the same message that I need to select the option "require additional authentication at startup" policy</p>
<p>
</p><p>That setting is configured, and that is what allowed me to encrypt the D-Drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So to my question.</p>
<p>Is there a way to encrypt my boot drive (C-drive).</p>
<p>Or is this just a case of "it should work but doesn't"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help.</p>

            <p>Hello, Thank you for looking at my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately the article seems to explain how Bitlocker works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like I said above. I was able to use bitlocker to encrypt a non-system/ non-boot drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Bitlocker&nbsp; DOES seem to work normally upon other drives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It, however, will not allow me to encrypt the System Drive (C-drive).</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>I would like to inform you that as BitLocker requires memory to encrypt, I would suggest you to check if there is sufficient space in the drive.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to disable BitLocker from other drives and then try enabling BitLocker on the system drive followed by other drives.</span><span>

            <p>While not the solution I was hoping for, I thought I would update this in case others have the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was unable to get the <strong>C-Drive </strong>to encrypt.</p>
<p>I decrypted my <strong>D-drive </strong>and attempted to encrypt my System using Symantec's&nbsp; PGP Whole Disk Encryption.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>(The new version is a PAIN btw... because I am not a part of an enterprise environment I had to install a non-SQL management console. Generate a standalone install.&nbsp; And then install it)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case all was going well.&nbsp; I encrypted the drives and on reboot I entered my password and the system started booting ....&nbsp; Then the&nbsp;&nbsp;
<strong>BSD</strong>.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I ended up Reformatting <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Both Drives</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was forced to install <strong>windows 7</strong> back on the system as&nbsp; I could not get the
<strong>windows 10 </strong>image on a single DVD disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After making sure <strong>SP1</strong> was installed I again upgraded to <strong>
windows 10</strong>.&nbsp; But this time I told it to keep <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
nothing</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a clean install&nbsp; if <strong>windows 10&nbsp;</strong>I was able to change the Group Policy&nbsp; and was successful in encrypting the
<strong>C-drive.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently the solution is this:</p>
<p>If you have a machine without&nbsp; TPM and you wish to use <strong>Bitlocker</strong>. You will have to do a clean install of
<strong>windows 10.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps anyone that might come across the same issue as mine.</p>
<p>

            I suggest you run a SFC /scannow to see if you have any corrupt system files that might be causing your errors.
<br />
<br />
<p><span>Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
Click 'Run as Administrator'<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: </span><strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong><span><br />
<br />
This will check for any integrity violations and fix any corrupted operating system files.<br />
<br />
Restart your system<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Now run chkdsk:<br />
1. Disable any security software before attempting to upgrade or do a clean install.<br />
2. Make sure your computer is updated (devices and applications)<br />
3. Disconnect any external devices before installing.<br />
4. Check your hard disk for any errors:<br />
Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
Click 'Run as Administrator'<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f<br />
When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.</span></p>
<span>
<p>Next, check your event viewer for any errors.
<br />
<span>Open Event Viewer by clicking the <span>Start</span> button
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fWindows%2520Vista%2fmain%2f4f6cbd09-148c-4dd8-b1f2-48f232a2fd33_47.png" />, clicking
<span>Control Panel</span>, clicking <span>System and Maintenance</span>, clicking
<span>Administrative Tools</span>, and then double-clicking <span>
Event Viewer</span>.</span>‌ <span><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres1.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fWindows%2520Vista%2fmain%2f18abb370-ac1e-4b6b-b663-e028a75bf05b_41.png" />&nbsp;If
 you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<div>
<div>
<div>Note:</div>
<div>
<div>Here's another way to open Event Viewer: Click the <span>
Start</span> button <img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fres2.windows.microsoft.com%2fresbox%2fen%2fWindows%2520Vista%2fmain%2f4f6cbd09-148c-4dd8-b1f2-48f232a2fd33_47.png" />.
 In the <span>Search</span> box, type <span>Event Viewer</span>, and then, in the list of results, double-click
<span>Event Viewer</span>.</div>
<p><br />
Check both System and Application event logs. <br />
<br />
Then reply back with an update on your status. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />

Just happend to my computer. I was working on something, walked away for less than a minute, came back, PC was restarting and working on updates. Browser and Visual Studio were not closed correctly so I had to restore my files! Also the active hours are set,
 but Windows is not respecting them. Also looking at the update history the last update mentioned was from a few days ago and not today :S</p>

<h2>            keyboard stops working after waking from sleep mode</h2>
                    Hi, everyone. I've been reading everywhere about this annoying issue and still I haven't found a solution. My keyboard (internal) never works after I close my laptop's lid, meaning sleep mode, unless I restart it, which is not really nice to do 5-6 times
 a day. Before upgrading to windows 10 from 7, I had no problem at all, but ever since I started using w10 (3 days ago) it has been happening everyday! I cannot stop using sleep mode because I'm always using my laptop during the day, so turning it off every
 time I get out of the house is not a solution either. Can you please help me? I've done everything other people with the same problem have been advised to do: update drivers, enabling/disabling keyboard to wake my laptop from sleep mode, troubleshooting, etc.
 Thanks in advance.

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.<br />
<br />
We are sorry for the inconvenience caused. We will be glad to help you with this.<br />
<br />
Thank you for letting us know the diagnostic steps you have done to fix the issue.
<br />
<br />
We would suggest you to run SFC(System File Checker) scan and check if it helps. SFC determine which file is causing the issue, and then replace the file.<br />
<br />
The steps to run SFC scan are given below:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.&nbsp;Press <strong>Windows Key </strong>+ <strong>X </strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Select <strong>Command prompt (Admin</strong><strong>). </strong>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; confirmation, type the password, or click Allow.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. <strong>Type </strong>or <strong>copy </strong>the following command, and then press enter<strong>:
</strong><strong>sfc /scannow</strong><br />
<br />
The sfc /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.<br />
<br />

            Thanks for answering. Yesterday, I used the command, but it didn't work. First, I ran it and it said it wasn't able to fix the corrupted files it found. After reading a bit more in other people's questions, I ran it in safe mode, where it successfully
 fixed the files. When I restarted my laptop, I had my keyboard working normally, as I put the laptop to sleep several times to test it. However, today I put the laptop to sleep thinking it was ok, but after I opened the lid the keyboard wasn't working. I ran
 again the command, just in case, and it said there were no problems at all. So now I'm stuck again with my keyboard not working.&nbsp;

Are you the administrator or in possession of admin password ? <br />
If no either of the above, you can NOT do system restore.</p>
<p>If you are the admin .........</p>
<p>Have you tried doing system restore in safe mode ?</p>
<p>If not, give that a try.</p>
<p>If you don't know how to go to safe mode, please post back.</p>

            <p>Hello Darryl,</p>
<p>Many wireless printers require that they be setup initially using an USB connection. Have you tried to install the printer that way first?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To select the right driver I need to know what version and Bit depth of Windows you are running.&nbsp; Hint:&nbsp; go to Control Panel, select System, and the info is in the first information window. Or you can do it yourself at this link:&nbsp;

<h2>            surface rt with blinking network strength on screen</h2>
                    Hi, just performed some ms upgrades to the OS on a surface RT running 8.1 and upon auto reboot the screen is only showing a blinking network strength symbol on bottom left, if I touch the screen I will see a mouse cursor with a busy circle (it blinks).&nbsp;
 I've tried switching to projection mode with windows key +P and enter, but to no avail.&nbsp; Thanks for any suggestions.

<p>
</p><p>That means you are on the Lock screen.&nbsp; Normally pressing any key should take you from there to the Login screen and that would be where Win+P would have some effect.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried pressing Ctrl+Alt+Delete?&nbsp; There is a mode in which that is the only acceptable input at the Lock screen so maybe that would do something for you even if you should not be in that mode.</p>

</p><p>Can you get into the Advanced Boot Options?&nbsp; I don't like experimenting with mine because it always seems to involve getting a Bitlocker prompt to do it.&nbsp; But it can be done by one of the arcane multi-button presses...</p>

<p>
</p><p>So now what I'm wondering is if you are stuck waiting for more updates which can't come before you either clean out the drive or attach more storage.&nbsp; E.g. the poster seems to have found a workaround by staging optional updates one at a time.&nbsp; Otherwise,
 note that attaching more storage is now a common procedure for W10 machines which have such small SSD drives but are now always getting huge "cumulative" updates.</p>

<p>Robert, thank you again, for the "<span>arcane multi-button presses..." link, as these instructions allowed me to recover via bitlock code and a refresh.&nbsp; So now I'm back to square one with downloading and installing the slew of updates which may
 have started this problem in the first place.&nbsp; I did install a 32 GB USB drive so that the system would have additional space to work with.&nbsp; I'm only doing a group of updates at a time.&nbsp; After reading the other link, I did not find the dreaded&nbsp;</span><span>KB3033055
 update </span><span>in the list but it may show up as I go alone during the updates. &nbsp; Thanks again for getting me out of door stop mode, as that was my next use for the RT.</span></p>

            I re-downloaded the latest version and built a new bootable USB. They told me to hold the volume down button when powering up. This did, in fact, get me to the diagnostic screen. However, I was only able to do a factory reset which wipes my data. Since
 I did NOT want this, I now have to attend at their Store to get a disk image. Sucks!<br />

<p>I am certain the issue is January 8, 2018—KB4056895 (Monthly Rollup).</p>
<p>(it likely has a conflict with KB3033055)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I did a clean reset, hid KB4056895, and installed ALL other updates (except Previews).&nbsp; Surface RT is fine and there is ~15GB free space leftover.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Note that MS reports that KB4056895 causes some old machines to get "into an unbootable state after installing this KB."&nbsp; Surface RT is not mentioned (and this black screen issue is not a boot problem), but maybe the KB4056895 problem is related.&nbsp; Read details
 in KB4056895 support page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I suggest skipping KB4056895 and waiting for the February Rollup.&nbsp; Who dares try the February Rollup!?</p>

            SurfaceM, My experience indicates that the locked screen appears once you install&nbsp;<span>KB3033055 on my RT, so maybe it is different for different machines, go figure.&nbsp; So I'm stopping there until we get some sort of response/repair/condolences
 from MS. &nbsp; Appreciate the feedback. &nbsp;</span>

<h2>            How to Use Mirror Volume of a Basic Disk without converting it to Dynamic Disk</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I have two 500GB Hard Drive attached to My PC running Windows 7.</p>
<p>I want the Software Drive (D:) [in the primary hard disk] should be backed up automatically on the other hard drive. I learned a lot from the internet about Mirror volume in dynamic disks. in that case i need to convert both hard disks to dynamic disk.</p>
<p>My question is, Is there any other way to make a mirror disk of the drive to the secondary hard disk without converting the primary hard drive to dynamic disk? [i have no problem to convert the second hard disk to dynamic disk, but i don't want the first
 hard drive to be converted to dynamic.]</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>if it is not possible via Windows, is there any 3rd party software to do seamless backup of a drive to different disk without any dynamic disk conversion ??</p>

<div>Again - mirroring (the way you are presenting)&nbsp;is *not* "backing up".&nbsp; It has similarities - but it has flaws.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>- If something fries the two hard drives (possible - more so actually than just one of the drives dying a natural death) - you've lost everything if this is the only way you were protecting your data.</div>
<div>- If something happens to the system as a whole (stolen, fire, etc) - *poof* goes the data.</div>
<div>- If you are infested/infected with malware/virus - it affects *both* drives at the same time.</div>
<div>- If something starts erasing/moving/replicating to one drive - it does it to both.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You can mirror if you like; it will decrease your performance in some ways.&nbsp; It will not *protect* the data except in some very specific circumstances.&nbsp; I would still *highly* suggest some point-in-time backup solution on
 *external* media even if you decide to continue with the mirror concept.&nbsp; If you really want to mirror - do hardware mirroring - fastest/least resource intensive/best results.</div>

<h3> kevinmcconway  say:</h3>
<h2>            Neverending syncing data with cloud</h2>
                    <p>Since a few days ago, when (I think) there was an update to the Windows 10 Microsoft Solitaire Collection app, it won't work for me. First when it logs into my account it always fails the first time, but works when I click on the retry button. But then it just puts up a screen saying "We are syncing your data with the cloud. Please wait", and the usual dots going round in a circle. I wait for ages (have left it running for hours) and nothing else happens. I can close the window to quit. The only way I can make it work is to cancel logging in when it fails to log in on the first attempt, and play without logging in.&nbsp;The game works fine on my Android phone 0 OK, I know the app isn't the same, but I assume it's&nbsp;syncing data from the same source.&nbsp;(It is just the same with the&nbsp;Mahjong app&nbsp;, except of course that doesn't have an Android version.)</p>

            <p>In case anyone else is having the same problem, I fixed it (after a lot of trial and error, and&nbsp;reading of web pages, none of which really said anything useful) as follows. I set up another (new) Microsoft account. I opened the game using the new account (which was a bit awkward because I cold not get the game to start properly - I had to do it via xbox.com). The game ran properly, though obviously without all my previous records. In the game app, I then logged out of the new account and logged back into the old one, which worked, and is still working although I have now logged out of the new account entirely (and marked it for deletion).</p>

            <p>Microsoft is using a staggered approach to delivering the Windows 10 Anniversary Update. The software firm delivered Windows 10 November Update in a similar fashion. The Anniversary Update will be available first to systems that are specifically optimized
 for Windows 10. Examples include devices with UEFI BIOS, TPM 1.2 and Windows Hello Support. If you are not seeing the Anniversary Update, don’t worry, it will eventually appear; keep checking Windows Update periodically.</p>

<h2>            Scan Issue - Document Scans to very large PDF Size</h2>
                    My Cannon ImageCLASS was scanning documents to PDF format without an issue until recently. Now all documents open in Adobe Acrobat with very large page sizes. Does Scan have a magnify/zoom setting? Not sure what happened that is causing all scans to save
 in such a large page format.

            <p>I had this problem after recent WIN10 maintenance update - win10 scan app gives huge PDF page on Brother AIO.&nbsp; I checked with Brother web site and decided to uninstall Brother AIO package (including driver) and reinstall package.&nbsp; (note: I never installed
 this package when I migrated from an old Canon&nbsp;to the Brother.&nbsp; I used only the WIN 10 scan app&nbsp;and driver from WIN10.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, scan works fine now using the Brother s/w - gives 8.5 X 11 page.</p>
<p>HOWEVER, WIN 10&nbsp;SCAN APP&nbsp;STILL DOES NOT WORK!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can figure out how to tell WIN10 Support that their last maintenance update screwed up WIN10 Scan app, please do so.&nbsp; I haven't the time nor effort to figure this out.</p>

            This is the first time I have participated in a forum like this. &nbsp;I have been going crazy trying to get my file size down when scanning on my HP Photosmart C7250 I was able to get it acceptably small but when I upgraded to Win 10 from 8 the Scanner Functionality
 stopped and the HP driver software never worked well anyway. &nbsp;I found a stand alone program called
<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/naps2/?source=typ_redirect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
NAPS2</a>&nbsp;it bypassed the HP software and has more functionality. &nbsp;I was ready to buy a new scanner or all in one or buy Adobe suite and I am a cheapskate. I was worried about the software being free but after using it I would pay for it. &nbsp;

            <p>I saw this issue about a year ago -- when I used Scan with an older MFC 8860DN with letter sized pages under Windows 10.
</p>
<p>As I increased the dpi of the scan, the scanned pdf linear size increased in proportion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The workaround I use is to print to pdf from the Adobe Acrobat Reader, with the "Fit to Page Size" button selected. With my printer output set to 8.5"x11", both the linear dimensions, and the file size in MB returns to sanity. The scanning is slow, and it
 is a 2 step process, but it works.</p>

            I'm having this issue as well with the scan app in Windows 10. The scan to PDF is creating a file that is too large. The driver is current as I read that could be a problem. How do I fix this? Thanks.

<p>This is the correct "work around" - but there is something inherently defective in the Scanner App if it is set output a page that is letter size and it outputs a page that is ENORMOUS. With my Brother Scanner it works fine on flatbed and goes crazy when
 the Scan APP receives images from the feeder.</p>
<p>Microsoft - what's up??</p>
