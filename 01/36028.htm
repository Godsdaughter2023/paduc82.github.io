<h2>            Be a pro keeper problem with view&#47;camera angle</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all.</p>
<p>On FIFA 14 (360) there's camera setting in the options for be a pro keeper. The default view is behind the keeper as it has been with every fifa since you could play as the keeper. On my xbox one version I do not see this camera option and my view in game
 as the keeper (online be a pro) is quite high up and facing the keeper. I cannot change it, and don't know how to!! I have no keeper view option on this version.</p>

<p>Does anyone else play as a keeper on the xbox one? What's this view, how to I get the standard view back!! Whats going on? Any help would be great.</p>

<p>XB1 GK cam is regular to me.. a bit higher but i like to read the cross paths so i like it better than older Fifas... Delete and try Reinstalling Fifa14 to your hard drive cause the camera options should be there.. maby lost Data 1st time install.. look
 for scratches or warpage too on disk... i wish they slowed the game burn process a bit.. ive had a few new 360 games not work new from instant warpage on opening lol and waist gas money replaceing new games.. no 11v11 online teamplay with real teams in Fifa14:(
 but good luck fixing camera</p>

            Hi Ganesh,
<div>Thanks for the reply and the links. &nbsp;I've looked at both. &nbsp;My computer is compatible and normally should be able to upgrade. &nbsp;As I say, once I click on the download button, the download opens but doesn't begin, and I get the following message: &nbsp;"Something
 happened and Windows 8.1 couldn't be installed. &nbsp;Please try again. &nbsp;Error Code 0x80070083"</div>
<div>As I wrote earlier, not only could it not install, but it couldn't even be downloaded.</div>

            Hello again,
<div>I notice that you gave no response to my last message; maybe no response to give.</div>
<div>I was on the phone today for 4 hours with one technician, who failing to solve the problem, then tried updating Windows 8. &nbsp;That process cut off communication with him and ended up not solving the problem either.</div>
<div>I contacted yet another technician (for 2 more hours), who found my case file, but repeated many of the "fixes" that the earlier technicians I spoke with tried. &nbsp;The result: &nbsp;no resolution to the problem.</div>
<div>After spending more than 8 hours with four different technicians and finding no solution, I've given up and will have to stay with Windows 8, though I was eager to take advantage of the free upgrade.</div>
<div>One desperate customer.</div>
<div>Richard</div>

            Hi,  
<br /> 
<br />I'm Diego Rios, an Independent Advisor willing to help other Microsoft customers.  
<br />
<br />Please try the following procedures:
<br />
<br />To troubleshoot your concern, kindly follow these steps:
<br />
<br />1. Run the Playing Audio Troubleshooter. Go to Settings&gt; Update &amp; Security&gt; Troubleshoot&gt; Playing Audio&gt; Run the troubleshooter.
<br />
<br />2. Update your audio driver. If the issue persists, you may need to uninstall and reinstall the driver under Device Manager.
<br />
<br />3. If these steps didn't fix the issue, I suggest to Up Date the driver from the manufacture web site.
<br />
<br />In case didn't works follow the procedures below:
<br />
<br />1. Check your speaker settings:
<br />Right-click the sound icon at the bottom right corner of your desktop and click Playback devices.
<br />In the Playback tab, ensure there’s a green tick on Speakers. This indicates that your speakers are the default playback device. 
<br />If your Speakers are NOT already set as the default, this is doubtless your problem. To fix, just click them, click Set Default, then click OK and test whether you have sound.
<br />If your Speakers are set as the default playback device, and you’re still not hearing any sound, you should to do this &gt;&gt; click Speakers then Properties &gt;&gt; Go to the Advanced tab, and in the Default Format section, select a different sample rate and bit depth, then click Test. Repeat this process until you find a format that works, then click OK. 
<br />
<br />2, If the step above didn't work, I suggest to Uninstall your audio driver.
<br />On your keyboard, press the Windows logo key  and X (at the same time) to invoke the quick-access menu, then  Click Device Manager.
<br />In Device Manager, expand Sound, video and game controllers,
<br />right-click on your sound card, and click Uninstall.
<br />Restart your computer and check to see if the problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />Also, You can try the following procedures in the links below:

<br /> 
<br />Please let me know if this helped and works.  
<br />

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand your concern, I suggest you to try installing drivers in compatibility mode. Compatibility mode runs the program using settings from a previous version of Windows.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Right-click</strong> on the driver setup file and click on ‘<strong>Properties’</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on the ‘<strong>Compatibility’</strong> tab and check the box ‘<strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for’</strong> and select Windows 8/8.1 operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation. Once
 this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</p>
</li></ul>

            <p>Assuming the game is disk based...</p>
<p>Don't bother with Compatibility mode. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The game is fully compatible with Win10, but MS has built a malware into Win10 called
<em>DRM Blocking. </em></p>
<p>This malware tries to trick people into thinking there is a compatibility problem while it actively blocks you

            1. There is a possibility that some Add-in is causing the problem. To rule this out, start Outlook in safe mode. Hold CTRL key and click on Outlook icon. Don't leave CTRL key, till it asks for the confirmation about safe mode. 
<br />
<br />2. Login to Windows with a new profile to rule out problem in Windows profile.

<p>Hi Paula,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are things to consider should your system does not detect your second monitor. Aside from checking the power cables, it is also a good practice to
<strong>check the display cables</strong> <strong>(VGA, DVI, HDMI)</strong>. Given that all of the cables are working, it is possible that the second monitor became defective. Simply replace the primary monitor with your second monitor to test if its still
 working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you determined that both of your monitors are in working condition, we suggest that you
<strong>check for updated drivers for your graphics card</strong> to ensure that the latest features for your display are installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, make sure that both of your monitors are being detected by the system. To do this, simply right-click on your desktop and select
<strong>Display Settings</strong>. You should see <strong>two monitors on the screen</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While both monitors are connected to your computer, press the <strong>Windows key + P</strong> on your keyboard. With this, you can check if you can extend your display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have further questions, feel free to post them on this thread.</p>

<h2>            Still Able To Message While Still Showing &#34;Offline With Voice Messaging&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Good morning !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two nights ago I was messaging someone who went online and then offline again but then started to message me.&nbsp; Their status was "Offline" but said "Offline with Voice Messaging".</p>
<p>
</p><p>How were they able to message me and have a conversation with me if they were "Offline with Voice Messaging"? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had issues with Skype the last couple of months (as you can see from your records of me reaching out to you) as my case is still "Open" and my questions have not been answered yet from before. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, this new issue arose where someone was messaging me while their status was "Offline with Voice Messaging".&nbsp; They indicated that they did not know what was going on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that if you are in the "Invisible" mode that one can still message anyone and the rest of the world will think that they are offline.&nbsp; HOWEVER, their status indicated the other night "OFFLINE WITH VOICE MESSAGING".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my question is....Is this truly a glitch and if so, is it on my end or their end? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Supposedly, they were at the airport using the airport's WiFi so could that have had something to do with it?&nbsp; It was around midnight Phoenix, Arizona time when this happened two nights ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much in advance.&nbsp; I look forward to hearing from you today as I need to get this and my other Skype queries answered and figured out ASAP !</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers!</p>

            <p>Hi Ramesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The device might be not listed as Bluetooth adapter if the right drivers for the device is not installed.
 in the search box and select 'Find and fix issues with devices'. If the troubleshooter didn't detect any issues, then I would suggest you to visit the PC manufacturer's website to download and install the latest drivers. If you couldn't find any drivers for
 Windows 10, download the drivers for the latest Windows OS and install it in compatibility mode. Type 'Compatibility' in the search box and select 'run programs made for previous version' to run the compatibility troubleshooter.</span></p>

            Thanks for giving reply, but was not usable.There was no updated drivers available in manufacturer's website.I had this problem from the starting when I had bought this PC . When my PC was in win 8.1 I had updated drivers even though i couldn't see the
 bluetooth adapter at that time. I humbly request to solve this issue wirelessly or by any other tips. The manufacturer says that my pc supports bluetooth but they are no signs of bluetooth option.When i type bluetooth in search bar it shows bluetooth settings
 surrounded with grey colour.I had even tried Hardware and device troubleshooter but of no use.Please solve this issue.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a0761c47-c334-4390-8e5b-c728cf7900ca" />

            <p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The Windows 10 Update Assistant is only responsible for downloading and starting the Windows 10 Update setup.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can uninstall it to free up some same since it has nothing to do with the operation of your Windows 10.</span></p>
<p>

    <title>MSN Weather app update message - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> paul dormer  say:</h3>
<h2>            MSN Weather app update message</h2>
                    <p>In the last couple of days, whenever I open the MSN Weather app almost immediately a message comes up saying there is an update available. &nbsp;However, pressing the update button on the message goes to the app store where it says "No Update available". &nbsp;But
 the update message stays on the app screen hiding all the information and making it impossible to use the app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday afternoon, I uninstalled the app, did a reboot, and the app was OK for the rest of the day. &nbsp;This morning the message came back again.</p>

            <p>I have the same issue.&nbsp; I am using Windows 8.1 on a tablet.&nbsp; MSN Weather runs but is then interrupted with a bar across the screen that says updates are available.&nbsp; There is no option to proceed except to the update.&nbsp; The screen then reports there is no
 update.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>We are notified the above troubleshooter only works with Windows 10.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
We have also determined it is not possible to update this tablet computer to Windows 10.</p>

            <p>Yeah, this is a small Windows netbook/tablet with only about 1Gb free disc space, so there was not enough room to upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I've either been able to cure it, or the problem went away spontaneously.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I googled to find a version of the troubleshooter that would run under 8.1. &nbsp;I can't remember what the error message it found was, but googling that suggested that running SFC/SCANNOW might be a good idea. &nbsp;Afterwards, I uninstalled the app, rebooted and
 re-installed. &nbsp;Touch wood, it has been working since last night.</p>

            The current situation appears to be that I start the computer in the morning, go to the weather app, and about two minutes later the update message appears. &nbsp;I then uninstall the app, re-install it and it works for the rest of the day. &nbsp;I turn the computer
 off at night and the next day the cycle repeats itself.

            I'm not sure why my OS would matter in this situation, this seems to be a problem on Microsoft's end; the download link was working up until a few weeks ago.<br />
<br />
I'm using Windows 7 Professional 64-bit.<br />
<br />
The link you provided is an entire SDK kit, I was just looking for DirectMusic Producer specifically. Also, the link you provided doesn't seem to mention anything about including DirectMusic Producer within the kit.<br />

            I also cannot install the new feature update (1803). I have the same issue when installing the 1709 update. I had to reinstall my OS for 1709 to go through. The updater keeps on saying I need to uninstall Virtual PC 2007. Which I did not install, at all,
 since my last reformat for 1709. I'm not so sure, but this might be related to some HP/intel WiFi drivers updates. I do not want to reinstall my OS every time Windows have a new feature. Please give me some hints to proceed.

<p>Just a thought, it could be your router. I know my husband and I had the same issue and we finally decided to stick with the modem. Depending on how fast your internet speed is, sometimes the routers cannot handle it and do not last as long as they should.
 Another suggestion, maybe try to talk to your internet provider and see if they can do a full reset and explain to them the trouble you're having. Also, you can go online to research your specific router and sometimes their websites have a Troubleshoot page
 where you can try to access Technical Support for help with that router. Good luck! Come back if nothing else works and we'll try some more!</p>

<h2>            problem with backup on windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello Team,</p>
<p>on some computers I have problem with creating backup after upgrading to Windows 10 Pro. I tried to make backup with external solusion, built Windows backup and by command wbadmin. Everytime it creates .vbk file and backup stuck. It does not care if Im using
 exetnal NAS or external USB drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also saw that when Im using command vssadmin list writers none results are showing. In the past backups were working on Windows 7 but after moving to Windows 10 it stop working (last time I make cleaer install of Windows 10, make updates and backup is
 not working). Do you know this type of issue ? As I know this problem was also on Windows 8.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <pre>File History, System Image, Backup and Restore in Windows 10 are partially broken and they are not being actively maintained or developed. Microsoft is planning to remove them in a future release. You are seeing the effects of this. You should switch to a third party solution such as Macrium Reflect (Free).
Learn more: https://www.groovypost.com/howto/create-windows-10-system-image-best-free-alternatives/
Details:
Let’s start off with Macrium Reflect (Free) (https://www.macrium.com/reflectfree). Macrium provides a small click to run the installer, but I chose the offline installer, which required finding the download agent (http://updates.macrium.com/reflect/v5.0/reflectdl.exe); this downloads the full installer at around 800 MBs. Included are a collection of preinstallation environment tools based on Microsoft’s Windows Image deployment solutions.
Setup was quick and easy but needed a restart to complete changes made to the system.
The Macrium Reflect interface is a bit more jam-packed than what you would normally find in Windows 10. But this a powerful alternative offering a range of options for creating and managing backups. Macrium integrates heavily with Windows—examples include support for attaching and browsing backups; boot image backups in Hyper-V; generating PowerShell scripts to automate backups; creating batch files and of course, scheduling backups. You can also find handy options such as cloning and standard file and folder backup.
For these instructions, we are going to focus on image backups. Similar to the System Image backup (https://www.groovypost.com/howto/create-windows-10-system-image-backup/) feature in Windows 10 and previous versions, this lets you create a replica of your current installation state. You can be granular with your backups by choosing only the partitions you want to save as part of your image.
To create your first image, click the menu Create an image of the partition(s) required to backup and restore Windows.
Under Destination, click the Browse button, then point to your external drive where you want to store the backup, create a new folder, select it then click OK. Click Next to Continue.
 
This phase of the wizard lets you create a Backup plan if you want. It’s optional, but lets you choose different methods of backups which include full, incremental and differential. For now, I am going to choose a schedule just to make things simple. I recommend you review the retention rules to save on disk space. Users can retain a number of backups using any method; this can quickly eat up disk space over time, so I will reduce the amount for each to about two. Click Next to Continue.
What are Incremental and Differential Backups and which should you choose?
A full backup gives you one backup file that restores your entire system up to that point. Full backups are a comprehensive way to go, but they take a long time to create and if you have multiple backup images, you end up duplicating a lot of the same data. Incremental and differential backups are two ways to address this inefficiency.
Incremental Backup – This maintains a regular backup in addition to changes that have been made since the last full or incremental backup. Incremental backups are often preferred because they use less disk space; not to mention, they are faster, too. So, if you created new Word documents since your last backup, those are added to the backup.
So, let’s say Backup A is a full backup you made on Monday. On Wednesday, you can make an incremental Backup B which only includes the new data since Backup A. On Friday, you can make Backup C, which only includes the new data since Backup B. In this way, you are storing no duplicate data. The downside is that if you want to restore your image, you have to use all three backup files: Backup A, Backup B, and Backup C.
Differential Backup – This creates a backup of the differences made since the last full backup. So, if you made changes to a few Microsoft Word documents, those changes are applied to the backup. A disadvantage is that differential backups use more space, since you need to maintain a full backup in addition to changes since you created your last backup.
How is that different than an incremental backup? Let’s say you make a full Backup A on Monday. On Wednesday, Backup B contains the differences since Backup A was made. On Friday, Backup C contains the differences since Backup A.  In this way, if you want to do a restoration, you just need two files: the last full backup and the last differential backup. This means you only ever need two files, compared to the incremental backup method. The downside is that, as you can imagine, your differential backup image file gets bigger and bigger as the time since your last full backup increases. And after awhile, you end up with a quite a bit of duplicated data across your various differential backups.
So, which should you use? Either one is fine. It all depends on how much storage space and time you have. Incremental backups are faster and take less space during the backup phase. Differential backups take more time and space during the backup phase but are easier during the restoration phase.
Review the image summary to ensure you chose the right options. If you maintain a dual boot configuration, make sure each partition is checked as part of your backup. Click Finish to begin the backup.
Click OK to start the backup immediately.
As with all image backups, it will take some time, so, sit back and relax as your image is saved. Click Close after your image is created.
Restoring Your Macrium Image
There are multiple ways to restore a backup. You can start the restore process from within a running installation of Windows 10 with Macrium already installed. But in most cases, restoring an image would take place after booting into a recovery environment similar to System Image in Windows 10.
Create Rescue Media
One important task you should complete after creating your image is to create rescue media, which will facilitate restoration of the image. This is perfect for scenarios where your computer won’t boot or you installed a new empty hard disk. Click the Other Tasks menu then click Create Rescue Media.
This will start the create bootable rescue media wizard. Remember, as we mentioned earlier, Macrium downloads a full installer at around 800 MBs. This is where the preinstallation environment tools based on Microsoft’s Windows Image deployment solutions are used. Macrium adds its own recovery tools to facilitate restoration of the image when you boot from it. Click Next.
You can add drivers in advance for hardware that might not be supported by the restored image. Click the Update Driver button to do so then point to the source. This can minimize the chances of Windows 10 not booting on new hardware; especially if you are changing motherboards.
Depending on the architecture of your Windows 10 image, you can choose either a 32 or 64-bit (https://www.groovypost.com/howto/windows-10-edition-architecture-build-your-install/) recovery image. For this particular case, I am restoring a 64 bit Windows 10 installation, so I will choose that. Click Next to begin the creation.
Bootable media can be prepared using a blank DVD or USB drive or you can create a bootable ISO image instead. Choose your desired method, then click Finish.
Restore Image – Macrium Reflect
Configure your computer to boot from the installation media (https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/) on the target computer. Attach your external drive where the image is stored, then power it on.
Under the Restore tab in Macrium, click the menu, Browse for an image or backup file to restore.
Browse to the image file, select it then click Open.
Click Select a disk to restore to… then click the selected image that appears. Click Next to begin the restoration.
After the image is successfully restored, click File &gt; Exit to reboot.
That’s pretty much all that’s involved in preparing a system image of your Windows 10 installation using Macrium Reflect. Macrium feels a little complex and overwhelming at first, but once you familiarize yourself with it, you should feel comfortable using it in no time. If you still want something a bit more user-friendly, then check out EaseUS Todo Backup Free.

<p>
</p><p>3) when making backup next day and even few hours after point 2 (when it was working) - backup is not working I have to do things from point 2 one more time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Concordo, se ne parla da tempo ma non è mai stata fatta una modifica sostanziale per integrare a dovere i due sistemi o unificarli del tutto. Anche solo recuperare i giochi 360 delle promo games with gold a volte comporta passaggi per nulla intuitivi e soprattutto
 le prime volte non si è mai sicuri se si sta procedendo nel modo corretto. Personalmente mi piacerebbe che i giochi 360 retrocompatibili fossero aggiunti allo store della One come giochi "per la One"... con tutte le informazioni del caso per evitare fraintendimenti.
 Opinione personale ovviamente. </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>[Translation -&nbsp;I agree, it has been discussed for some time but there has never been a substantial change to properly integrate the two systems or unify them completely. Even just recovering the 360 games of promo games with gold sometimes involves
 steps that are not intuitive and especially the first few times you are never sure if you are proceeding in the right way. Personally I would like the 360 backward-compatible games to be added to the One's store as "one-on-one" games ... with all the appropriate
 information to avoid misunderstanding. Personal opinion of course.]</strong></p>

<p>Purtroppo il Marketplace della 360 è un elemento a sé stante per cui ci sono alcune limitazioni o particolarità di cui tenere conto per gli acquisti. Ti riporto l'articolo completo da cui estraggo il passaggio che potrebbe spiegare il tuo problema:</p>

</p><p>"The Xbox 360 Marketplace and the Xbox One Store websites use different architecture, so if you have credit but no payment option associated with your account, you won’t be able to use the&nbsp;credit to purchase Xbox 360 titles. You will have to add a payment

<p>Hi Jurasity,</p>
<p>I'm sorry to hear about your experience, however, bans carry over from console to console at it is account based. If you were banned from Black Ops multiplayer on Xbox 360, you will still be banned from Black Ops multiplayer on the Xbox One.

    <title>System tray icon balloon labels missing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lakusus  say:</h3>
<h2>            System tray icon balloon labels missing</h2>
                    I upgraded (through the free upgrade offer) from Windows 7 Home to Windows 10 Home a little over a month, ago. &nbsp;I've had a few problems/issues arise from this upgrade and I've been able to work through most of them. &nbsp;However, one issue that is very annoying
 is that I am no longer getting a balloon label/identifier to pop up when I hover over an icon in the system tray. &nbsp;This is frustrating to say the least as I now have to actually right-click (or left-click if I just want to see what it does) on each icon until
 I find the one I'm looking for. &nbsp;This wouldn't be such a big deal if I only had a few icons down there, but there are on average 25+ icons, some in the overflow. &nbsp;Ironically, when I hover over the chevron (that, when left-clicked, opens the overflow) I DO
 get a balloon label pop up for that telling me what it is. &nbsp;That's nice. &nbsp;It'd be nicer if the same happened for the rest of the icons down there! :( &nbsp; I am able to remember a good portio

            Tried methods 1 &amp; 2 to no avail. &nbsp;On reboot (static discharge around the house causes my system to randomly reboot - another issue for another day) I will get the balloon identifiers to pop up for a short period, but then they stop. &nbsp;It's like something
 gets activated near the end of system start-up and start programs initialization that takes it away. &nbsp;Is there any way to get gpedit.msc for Win 10 home 64bit? &nbsp;And why did MS leave it out, in the first place? &nbsp;Just another gimmick to make users want (or need)
 to spend more money to deal with frustrations?? &nbsp;SOOOO annoying! &nbsp;And I really liked, and have been a huge fan of, Microsoft for so long. &nbsp;What a shame. :(

            That would probably work but, as has already been stated a couple of times, gpedit.msc is NOT included in Windows 10 Home editions. &nbsp;Only if you have Windows 10 Pro or higher is gpedit.msc included and accessable.

            Okay, I created a new user account and, low and behold, the issue was NOT present, in that account! &nbsp;However, when I signed out of that account and back into my admin account, the same process occurs - get the popups for a little bit, then they stop. &nbsp;Is
 it possible this is an issue with how many different icons are down there? &nbsp;Currently there are so many background programs running (most of which I installed and would like to keep running) that there are, at the time of this writing, 25 icons (9 showing
 and 16 hidden), plus the chevron to view the hidden icons, plus the action center switch, plus the time and date. &nbsp;Before all that is the address toolbar and after all that is the "Show Desktop" bar. Next to my issue of static discharge randomly rebooting
 my system, this is the most perplexing problem I've come across in a long time. :|

            Well, I actually never got around to trying the DISM or System Update Readiness Tool. &nbsp;However, just on a whim, I thought I'd try something else. &nbsp;Instead of having most of my icons hide so that I'd have to click the ^ to see them, I made them all visible
 at all times. &nbsp;Problem solved. &nbsp;Now I get the popup balloon label every time when I hover over an icon telling me exactly what that icon's program is that it's associated with or, at the very least, I get a hint as to its purpose. &nbsp;Still don't know why this
 was happening, but now I know the culprit and have since dealt with him. &nbsp;Perhaps this is a glitch and Microsoft can look into what's causing it and send it out as a fix update for others who may have this issue, too. &nbsp;Thanks for all your help, everyone, and
 have a great day!

            For Windows 10, Method 1 is simpler than the process noted above.&nbsp; Once you find Windows Explorer in Task Manager, click on it and Windows will allow you to Restart (as opposed to quitting it and then restarting it from the Run command).

            I tried method 3 for Windows Pro users. At first, nothing changed. Then, later I could hover over the icons in the system tray and get the balloons with identifying information. Then it stopped working, again. Would appreciate suggestions.<br />

<h2>            Turn Off Lap Top Speaker But Leave Head Phone Speaker On</h2>
                    How do I do it? <br />
<br />
I have tried playing around with the settings but don't seem to be able to work the laptop speaker independently from the line out the the headphones.
<br />
<br />
TIA for any replies.

<p><strong><span>Which sound card are you using?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to run the dxdiag tool and check for the details being shown there. To use<br />
dxdiag tool follow the steps provided below -<br />
1. Click Start and then click on Run.<br />
2. In the Run window type <strong>dxdiag</strong> and press Enter.<br />
Now under the sound tab you will get all the details of the soundcard installed on your computer and the drivers installed.<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>You may also check if right clicking and enabling the option of
</span></strong><strong><span>Show Disabled Devices</span></strong><strong><span> in the
</span></strong><strong><span>playback devices</span></strong><strong><span> window assists you to view the headphones
 option separately or not. If it does you may follow the steps again to disable a device and check.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>But it seems that the sound system you are using is an integrated one which has all the jacks on one sound card only
 because of which you are not getting an option of headphones separately in the default devices. Also this is disabling the entire sound because if you select disable option for the speakers. If this is the case then you would not be having an option to use
 the internal speakers and headphones separately on your computer. It entirely depends on the sound card you are using.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this helps. Let us know the results.<br />

<h2>            Xbox one x shuts down playing fallout 76 beta</h2>
                    Hi does any one else have an issue when trying to load fallout 76 beta. Seen a video on youtube that exactly showes the issue i have. Game will start but when you press A to sign in the xbox shuts down. You have to manually Power the xbox back on and gives
 a warning about ventilation. Console is in a very well open area? Only does this with fallout76 beta not any other game?&nbsp;

            Be sure to use the "Report a problem" feature to log it. I noticed it as well, and reported the bug. You can submit it specifically for that title.
