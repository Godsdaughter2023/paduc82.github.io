<h2>            What windows update supplied drivers for the Renesas USB 3 chipset&#63; What is the KB------- designation&#63;</h2>
                    Been having trouble with the integrated Renesas chipset and a forum post I found elsewhere said that if the Renesas driver supplied by Windows update was installed it could be interfering when trying to install manufacturer USB 3 drivers. I just need to
 know what the KB------- update designation is, so I can uninstall that specific windows update.

    <title>Login Failure when using PIN without Hard Reset Windows 10 -- TOTALLY - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Login Failure when using PIN without Hard Reset Windows 10 -- TOTALLY UNPREDICTABLE&#33;  Sometimes error 0x8009002d</h2>
                    <p>I have listed more details about the issue here.&nbsp; Basically, I am frequently blocked from signing onto my computer with a PIN when it is first powered up.&nbsp; I have tried to sign on with a Password as well, but have the same issues of not being able to sign
 in.&nbsp; Every once in a while, and I have not been able to establish when this will happen, the PIN is accepted.&nbsp; I have never been able to sign in with the password since this problem started.&nbsp; Below are the data from the three screens associated with this problem&nbsp;
 (I could not do a screen, sorry.)&nbsp; This problem seems to have started after some type of major Window upgrade which loaded on Feb. 17, 2017 and involved many many files.&nbsp; I have not been able to figure out how to cancel this upgrade and revert to the old OS
 before this date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes I get the error "Something went wrong.&nbsp; (Code: 0x8009002d).&nbsp; This happens if the computer tries to restart itself, like after a software upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes I get a screen that says "Sign in options" and this shows a icon&nbsp; for password or numeric keypad.&nbsp; The two options do not appear to be grayed out, but selection of either does not improve the chances the computer will actually start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes after several on-off cycles, I get a light blue screen that says "It looks like Windows didn't load correctly."&nbsp; This screen then gives the options to "See advanced options" or "Restart my PC"&nbsp; These buttons work, but if I Restart, things don't
 happen any better than when I restart with the power button (see below).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Lenovo ideapad Y700, 64 bit.&nbsp; I have had it for over a year, and have not had any issues that were not minor and could not be fixed quickly.&nbsp; For the past two weeks or so,&nbsp; it has become more and more stubborn to restart.&nbsp; In the past, I have always
 used the PIN to restart.&nbsp; However, now if I enter the PIN I get a message to the effect that the PIN is incorrect.&nbsp; Once I get that message, I can try again and again and the computer PIN is never accepted.&nbsp; &nbsp;If I do a hard-start (Turn power off with button
 and hold until machine shuts down) it sometimes will permit the PIN to be used.&nbsp; If the login screen says "Login options" it never works.&nbsp; I never saw that message until this problem started.&nbsp; If the restart does not turn the keyboard lights off, it never
 works.&nbsp; Sometimes it takes two or three (or today about 5) attempts to get it to work.&nbsp; I am very careful to enter the PIN correctly, and use the view eyeball symbol to insure it is entered properly.&nbsp; I have tried to enter the PIN using the numbers above the
 letters on the keyboard, and also the ones in the numeric keypad, but this does not seem to make any difference.&nbsp; I have tried to push the &lt;Num Lock&gt; key on and off, &lt;Fn&gt; Key on and off, and various combinations of the &lt;Shift&gt; keys and &lt;CapsLK&gt; on and off
 in case one was hung up.&nbsp; This does not seem to be any help.&nbsp; Still, at least 3/4 of the time the PIN is not recognized.&nbsp; I can also tell when it will not work because when the pin will work, I do not have to press the &lt;Enter&gt; button after the last character
 of my 8 digit pin is entered, simply press the last number in the pin.&nbsp; If I need to use the &lt;Enter&gt; button it will not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attempted to assign a new PIN but do not have authorization to do so, even though I supposedly have Administration level on my main password.&nbsp; I do not have any other user accounts on this computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because of this, I have been leaving my computer on whenever I can.&nbsp; I keep it plugged in and have it set to never turn off.&nbsp; I even plug it in in the car.&nbsp; But there are times when I must turn it off, and I did have it crash once even after this problem
 started, and had to restart it then too.&nbsp; Then it can become very frustrating to get it started again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running Windows version 1607 (OS Build 14393.693)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run both Kaspersky and Malwarebytes and neither found any issues.&nbsp; I disabled (or unloaded or whatever they call it) the Microsoft automatic updates since the time this problem started,&nbsp; This did not make any difference.&nbsp; I do not use any other password
 manager software in this computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated!&nbsp; However, I am not in a position to turn my computer on and off to test right now.&nbsp; I need to get back to where I can do a full-backup first.&nbsp; This will not happen for at least two-weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps I am not cold-starting the computer right and advice on doing this&nbsp; would also be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please forgive me if I am not using all the correct terminologies, or am not fully familiar with this product or Windows 10 issues.&nbsp; I ran Window XP for years on other computers, but skipped from an older Windows XP SP3 computer to this one when the power
 supply in the old computer finally gave up and it wasn't worth fixing it.&nbsp; I had this so long I needed to replace the BIOS battery twice!</p>

            <p>I have tried several solutions to this now, and none work.&nbsp; However, I did go to msconfig, go to the Services menu, click on "Hide Microsoft Services", then click on "Disable All".&nbsp; Then APPLY and OK to exit.&nbsp; From what I understand, this procedure stops
 the non-Microsoft services from being run at start-up.&nbsp; With this change, the computer more often starts properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have noted that if the computer comes up asking for 'password' it will not work.&nbsp; If it come up asking for 'PIN' then it usually works -- but not always.</p>

            <p>I have been out-of-town and hope you have not given up on my issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tired to restore the system already and get a message to the effect that it has been too long since changes were made to do a restore.&nbsp; No restore points are visible either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had already updated to the latest build, and there have been additional automatic updates made more recently.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The latest cumulative&nbsp;update was KB 4013429 on&nbsp;03/15/2017 and was successful.&nbsp;&nbsp;The previous update (KB 3213986) was&nbsp; loaded on 03/02/2017 and
 was successful.&nbsp; However, this update tried unsuccessfully twice on 03/01/2017.&nbsp; All updates were done automatically.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each&nbsp; time an update like this happens,&nbsp;I am back to trying to get into my computer and past it's inability to accept the PIN number or PASSWORD, regardless of what I do.&nbsp; Upon start up, I must see that the keyboard back light turns off, but that the NUM
 LOCK key is lighted and the CAPS LK button must be off.&nbsp; The status of these buttons are shown by LEDs on my keyboard.&nbsp; I have even pushed these functions on and off several times before a login attempt with no changes in the results (Password and Pin does
 not work.)&nbsp; Today, after having power off when I was out of town, it took me the better part of 30 minutes with various messages described in my original post coming up.&nbsp; In the past, I thought it helped if I waited a while between applying power and actually
 putting in the pin, but this does not work any better, so I assume that the computer is not still loading things when I try to get into it with the PIN.&nbsp; As stated before, my PASSWORD never works, I can only use the PIN, however, once I get into the operating
 system, I am able to change the PIN but not erase it entirely (which does not help)..&nbsp; Again, I frequently was ask for PASSWORD instead of PIN and no matter what I put in under PASSWORD it never works.&nbsp; Under PIN, it sometimes works, but I have no idea why
 this happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the KB 4013429 upgrade, new updates/upgrades as follows were added:&nbsp; &nbsp;(KB4013418) on 03/15/2017, &nbsp;(KB890830) on 03/15/2017, and &nbsp;(KB3150513) on 03/16/2017.&nbsp; If there are any newer upgrades they have not autoloaded yet, probably because I had the computer
 shut-down while I was away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem started around the start of March 2017, but one or two restarts corrected the issue.&nbsp; Now it takes more and more tries to get things going after a power off.&nbsp; In the past, I always shut-down when not using the computer unless I was away from
 it for just a minute or two and never had any issues.&nbsp; The only other update was an Adobe Flash Player update &nbsp;(KB4010250) installed on 03/02/2017.&nbsp; I can fill you in on updates made in the later part of February too, if you think that might be of some help.</p>

<p>
</p><p>To further isolate the issue, could you tell us if you’re using a Microsoft account on your computer?</p>

<p>Meanwhile, we suggest that you check Vanessa Sohtun’s answer on this <strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hello/windows-10-pin-not-working/4eb7efe1-86d2-4904-90cd-47597dca1bae">thread</a></strong>

            <p>I do have a Microsoft Account which gives me access to some password related sites.&nbsp; I do not know exactly which passwords work on this, but I get a generic message saying something like "log in using Microsoft password".&nbsp;&nbsp; If I do this, the computer goes
 on the internet a while then comes back and lets me move forward without knowing the local password.&nbsp; Unfortunately, I can not use this to log in to the computer at start up or in place of the PIN requirement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am unable to complete the suggestion form Vanessa Sohtun since in order to create a new account, I need to login using a password, and I have never been able to get the password to work -- even though it used to work.&nbsp;&nbsp; I can use the Microsoft password
 and then it says something like "we must establish that this is your computer" and asks for the computer password.&nbsp; If I enter it, it is always rejected, and after a few trys I start to be sent to other screens where it says something like "it seems you are
 having trouble loging in" and then there are a number of options, but none are any help.&nbsp; It is a catch 22.&nbsp; I can not add an account or change the password (I can change the PIN) without the password.&nbsp; I need to have the password to change the password, so
 I can not do it.</p>

            <p>I really hate to think about reloading Windows 10.&nbsp; I was forced to do this under Windows XP (32 bit) and lost so much it took over a month to recover everything and get things working again!&nbsp; Even with a backup to CD Rom, it took well over 100 hours to
 get things working again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found a way that almost always seems to work to get the Windows 10 to start (I still have not been able to set up a new account with administer privilages or non-local account since I am still blocked from doing this.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Below is the start-up sequence that almost always works.&nbsp; (About 80-90% of the time, instead of maybe 5-10% of the time.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Unplug the computer and then press and hold the power button.&nbsp; From what I understand, this causes some type of a "clean" start.&nbsp; However, if I do not unplug, then I am back to&nbsp;very unpredictable startups.&nbsp; Failure to unplug the computer seems to prevent
 PIN request most of the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Wait for all lights and disk actions to stop.&nbsp; Usually a matter of 15-20 seconds.&nbsp; I hold the power button the entire time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; Press the power button again to start.&nbsp; The key backlighting normally blinks on then off a second or two later.&nbsp; If the backlight stays on, then I will be ask for PASSWORD, not PIN.&nbsp; Normally, the key backlight goes off when started in this way, however,
 if I get the "You seem to have problems signing on" screen, then I must go at least to the point where the PASSWORD is ask, then go through the stuff again, starting at step 2.&nbsp; This sometimes comes up if the computer turns itself off, like after a program
 upgrade or if the battery runs down.&nbsp; I assume that the keyboard backlight stays on if it was not a true clean start, and the keyboard backlight goes out if it is a clean start.&nbsp; If there is a software program that forces a clean startup, then this could be
 further checked if a clean start is needed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; The screen will show several displays, then once the circle indicting computer activity starts swirling around, I must start tapping the mouse left button, or press the keypad button which does the same thing.&nbsp; After a bit of time, the screen asking
 for PIN will appear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.&nbsp; I think I mentioned before that if the backlight stays on upon restart, I will always be ask for a PASSWORD.&nbsp; If it stays off, and&nbsp;the question to sign in comes, using this method&nbsp;will always make it come up asking for PIN, not PASSWORD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, my PIN always works.&nbsp; I have tried changing my PIN to something else, and the new PIN always works (and the old one quits working) but I still get the request for PASSWORD unless this procedure is followed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It may be important to note that occasionally, the PIN is requested even when started in different ways, but it has never been ask for if the keyboard backlights do not go out!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously, the software to start in PIN mode is someplace in the computer, and I doubt that the decision to use PASSWORD or PIN is totally random, but effected by other conditions, such as how the computer is stopped, if the power cord is connected, and/or
 how the start sequence is initiated.&nbsp; My suspicion is that there is some type of a race condition during start-up&nbsp;in the start up programs and services.&nbsp; Since more things are loaded during a clean start, there may be more time for whatever it is that is permitting
 it to start in PIN mode.&nbsp; One indicator of this is the keyboard backlight staying on or going off.&nbsp; If I do not start tapping on the Left mouse (or equal) key, but wait, it sometimes comes up in PASSWORD mode.&nbsp; This would indicate to me that perhaps by tapping
 on the key, the start up key is recognized before something else is loaded or starts running.&nbsp; If something else happens first, PASSWORD is ask for, but if it does not happen first, PIN is ask for.&nbsp; (It could the other way of course, reversing PASSWORD and
 PIN).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can post the default services if that would be any help.&nbsp; I can also post the non-default services and the Startup Programs list.&nbsp; I notice that some services have a start and others have a start with delay function.&nbsp; I think these services are suffering
 from too many anyway, and want to eliminate non-critical default and regular services that start automatically.&nbsp; I do not know if changing the services and start-up programs would make the PIN be more predictable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is not some issue with these services and startup programs, then I may be forced to reload Windows 10 on my computer, but as mentioned before, I am very concerned about this since I don't want to loose programs, program keys, and data which may
 have non-typical names and which the rebuilding process may not recognize.</p>

<p>Marby,</p>
<p>From your question about using or not a Microsoft account it seems that you think it makes a difference. Please, could you indicate where does Microsoft say that we must use a Microsoft account to use Hello features ? I have searched extensively and could
 not find any.</p>
<p>It is important to clarify this because your comment tends to blame the local accounts on this problems.

    <title>Instead of my username I get &#34;Other User&#34; during startup. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Instead of my username I get &#34;Other User&#34; during startup.</h2>
                    I have seen a couple of other posts with this problem, but the solutions do not seem to fit my situation.<br />
<br />
When I start up or restart Windows 8, the log on screen comes up with "Other User" instead of my Username. Beneath this is the message; "The username or password is incorrect.
<br />
<br />
I can then type in my Microsoft account name and password and Windows will open.<br />
<br />
I know more or less how this came about. About two weeks ago I installed Windows 8 on a brand new computer (I built it). While I was trying to set it up, I got the destination location for my documents files all messed up. (I tried to change the location and
 did it incorrectly.) I tried many things to fix this including some suggestions that I found elsewhere on this board. Nothing worked.<br />
<br />
Finally I opened a new user account and gave it administrative privileges and&nbsp; then deleted my original account. Then I opened another user account which was just exactly like the original account (Same name and password) The reason that I went to the original
 name and P/W is because it is my Microsoft account name so it makes sense to have it be the Win 8 account name.<br />
<br />
Doing this solved the problem of the file paths that I was having. Now all of my files are just the way that I want them but I have this crazy log on problem.<br />
<br />
There is a second&nbsp; related crazy thing. On my main drive under "user" my username is some kind of made up name. It has nothing to do with my account. It appears to be extracted from the account that I temporarily used before creating my current account. I have
 searched my system and as far as I can tell the only user account listed is the new one that I created. From reading elsewhere I get the impression that when someone deletes an account not everything related to that account is deleted from the system. If this
 is so then that might be what is causing my problem.<br />
<br />
I really want to get this sorted out before I start using this machine seriously. One of the big reasons I went with the new PC with an SSD and with Windows 8 was the fast start up time, but with this log on situation that is all wasted.<br />
<br />
Whatever I do, I also hope that I can keep all of my files etc. exactly like they are. I took me two weeks to get them set up the way I like them.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the long post but I wanted to get as much detail as possible.<br />
<br />

            <p>The 'wrong' name in the Users folder is the only one there?&nbsp; If so, it seems like these got cross somehow.&nbsp; It honesty sounds to me like your best solution is to repeat your exercise by creating a temporary user (or temporarily enabling and using the built-in
 Administrator account*) and then create your actual profile.&nbsp; That's what I did when I first installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*If you take this route, please only do this one action and then go back and disable the built-in admin account.&nbsp; You don't want it getting messed up, changed, touched, or even used other than this one case. It's here as a fallback and using it daily can
 result in a need to reinstall your PC.</p>

            Hi Shawn,<br />
<br />
Under the users folder on my C: drive are three entries&nbsp; 1. the convoluted user-name&nbsp; 2 a folder labelled "Public" and 3. a folder labelled "Updatus User"<br />
<br />
There is another&nbsp; user folder on my Desktop labelled with my name which I thought came over from my Win 7 machine, but I'm not sure. It is not included in the "Users" folder.<br />
<br />
BTW part of the convoluted username is taken from the temporary account that I used to transition to this new user account.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry to say that I'm not sure how to access the "built-in Admin account" but from your warning I'm not sure if I should go that route. So what you're describing is to basically duplicate the process that I followed before. I did this using the Windows
 8 user function available through the so-called Metro interface. I know that there are other ways to create new accounts. Is it possible that they would work better?
<br />
<br />
Also when I delete the transitional account, are there any steps that I should take to make sure that it is totally deleted?<br />
<br />
Finally are there any steps that I can take to make sure my data is all just like it is now. You may remember you helped me with my original problem which was related to the paths for my documents on my second drive. Creating the new account did solve that
 problem.<br />

            <p>Ah I didn't realize that was you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even the desktop classic Control Panel will pop open the metro interface for creating a new account, so you're good there.&nbsp; What I would do is make a local account (not linked to a MS account).&nbsp; I did this myself because I wanted my local account name to
 just be 'shawn', but the automatic generated one called it 'shawn_000').&nbsp; So once you create the local one, go delete every other user from the Control Panel.&nbsp; Then open the C:\users folder and delete their folders too, just to be sure.&nbsp; Then go link your
 online account to the new (and only remaining) profile.</p>

            <p>You know, another way to make it easy to relocate your shell folders would be this (just another option):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>Create folders on your extra drive for Docs, Pics, Video, Music (whatever else).&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
</li><li>Then, right-click each one and choose "include in library &gt; Documents".&nbsp; That way that location from the other drive will show up in your documents library, and you can even set it as the default storage place, without having to go edit all those location
 tabs.&nbsp; This is actually one of the reasons for Libraries.</li></ol>

            <p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is getting very frustrating. I have now created numerous new user accounts and deleted previous ones&nbsp;and nothing changes as far as signing in. I still get that "Other User" message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On top of that somehow along the way I lost all of the files. I know they are still there somewhere but I can't see them. My latest new account is basically a blank slate. I am reluctant to try to build any files or set anything up until I can solve the
 logon problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my C:\ drive under users, I have two other files in addition to one that I have currently created. One is the old name that I originally had and the other is the weird named on: miste_000 this name comes from part of the second user account that I created.
 I only used this account long enough to re-create my original account, but that name keeps sticking around.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;If I go into user accounts in the control panel or NETPLWIZ these other user names are not listed. The only place that I can see them is under C:\users</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have not been able to delete either of them. For the first one I get a message that the file names are too long to delete. That's a new one on me. On the second one (the weird named one)it tells me that it can't be deleted because other files or programs
 are being used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm hoping if I figure out how to get rid of these entries I will solve the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It took me 5 or 6 hours to put this computer together. It's all nice and new and as far as I can tell very fast, but it's been nearly two weeks and I still can't use it properly. In between creating new user accounts, I have to recreate my e-mail accounts
 because I have things that I need to do.</p>

            <p>And here is just a bit more on my problem......</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After much effort I have managed to get rid of the odd user account name. This account is named "Dan" (my first name) and it is either left over from my first user account or was brought forward with my Windows 7 stuff from the old PC. That was the name
 on my user account on the old machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This account is supposedly empty but if I try to delete it I get a message that there are files which are too long for the recycle bin. I didn't see it in my user folder yesterday. I moved it out of the user folder but that didn't help.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also I have noticed that when I get my message "Other User" and click on it, the name "Dan" is already in the box for the user name. It seems kind of phantomed in so I didn't notice it before. I tried leaving it there and using all of the passwords that
 I could think of but the only way to login is to use my current user account name.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note -- I also tried signing in as local account but that did nothing.</p>

            Here is a solution for the "Other User" problem that may work in some situations.<br />
<br />
If you have created a new user account and the previous account did not require a password to logon, the same option may be assigned to the new user account, but this account has never had administrative approval.<br />
<br />
So.... go to run and the the NETPLWIZ thing and where there is a checkbox that says: "users must enter a password to use this computer". If that box is unchecked. Check it and then uncheck it and click on "Apply". This will fool it into asking for the administrator
 permission and once you do that the "Other User" message might go away. <br />
<br />
This worked for me, but did not solve my major problem. I finally, after two weeks, reinstalled Windows 8. This took a bit more than 45 minutes and now my system seems to&nbsp; working great.<br />

<p>What is your computer make and model?</p>
<p>How much RAM?</p>
<p>Is your system free from error?</p>
<p>Event Viewer Reports</p>
<p>1. Normally when an error occurs on your computer looking in Event Viewer should be your starting point for finding a solution. Most system related errors are logged
 and getting an exact copy of the relevant report is important. Unfortunately understanding the reports is not easy and most computer users need help with their interpretation. I have more to say later on interpretation.</p>
<p>2. Event Viewer comprises three main Windows logs. These are Application, Security and System. For troubleshooting purposes System is by far the most important.</p>
<p>3. To access the System log select Start, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer, from the list in the left side of the window select Windows Logs and System.
 Place the cursor on System, right click and select Filter Current Log. Check the box before Error and click on OK and you see only Error reports. Click on the Date and Time Column Header to sort. You may need to click a second time to see the latest Report
 at the top. </p>
<p>4. A tip for posting copies of Error Reports! Run Event Viewer and double click on the error you want to copy. Click on the Copy button to place a copy on your Clipboard
 and close Event Viewer. Now start your message and paste into the body of the message. Make sure this is the first paste after exiting from Event Viewer.</p>
<p>5. There are three types of Report, being Information, Warning and Error reports. In most situations it is Error Reports that offer the best information but occasionally
 Warning Reports provide useful clues. </p>
<p>6. All reports have date and time stamps and when troubleshooting it is important to concentrate on more recent reports. Study reports since the point when the computer
 was last booted and then check whether a similar report appeared in the previous session. If errors do not repeat investigation as to why they occurred is wasted effort.</p>
<p>7. Within individual reports the more important information is Event ID and Source as these help when looking for help on the internet. The description is equally important
 and copying the exact text for use as the search criteria greatly helps getting better results when using Google. Do not paraphrase descriptions when asking others for help.</p>
<p><span>Type Device Manager in the Search box above the Start button and press
 ENTER. Are there any yellow question marks in Device Manager? If yes what is the Device Error code.
</span></p>
<p><span>To see Hidden Devices (Non Plug and Play Drivers) you need to select View, Show Hidden Devices. It is necessary to
 do this every time you open Device Manager if you need to see them.</span></p>
<p><span>A further complication can be Ghosted Devices –installed but not connected!</span><span><a href="http://www.lockergnome.com/windows/2005/04/29/display-hidden-devices-in-device-manager-xp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.lockergnome.com/windows/2005/04/29/display-hidden-devices-in-device-manager-xp/</a></span></p>

To see all that is loading bootup - wait a few minutes without doing anything - then Right Click<br />
TaskBar - Task Manager - take a look at Appplications - Processes - Services - this is a quick<br />

===========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

Windows 8 - How to Refresh your PC<br />
<a href="http://www.pagestart.com/win8refresh03011301.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pagestart.com/win8refresh03011301.html</a><br />
If you are unable to load Windows or if your PC isn't performing as well as it once did, and you don't know why, you can refresh your PC without deleting any of your personal files or changing your settings.</p>
<p><br />
=====================================================</p>
<p><br />
Refresh<br />
"The Refresh option reinstalls Windows, but keeps personalized settings and files. It does, however, reset PC settings to their defaults, but keeps apps downloaded from the Microsoft App Store and places a list of removed apps onto your desktop. A refresh does
 not require the Windows product key to be re-entered. Refresh is a good way to recover system performance, while keeping your data intact."</p>
<p><br />
Note: "Only Metro style apps when customers refresh their PCs, and require desktop apps that do not come with the PC to be reinstalled manually. We do this for two reasons. First, in many cases there is a single desktop app that is causing the problems that
 lead to a need to perform this sort of maintenance, but identifying this root cause is not usually possible. And second, we do not want to inadvertently reinstall “bad” apps that were installed unintentionally or that hitched a ride on something good but left
 no trace of how they were installed.</p>
<p><br />
Refreshing your PC goes like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PC boots into Windows RE.<br />

<p><br />
Activation State<br />
The only element of your configuration preserved by a Refresh is the Windows activation state. This is to help provide a better post-Reset experience. In most cases Windows should be activated automatically at the end of Reset without user action. One exception
 to this is on a PC where you used the Add features to install the Pro Pack or Media Pack to upgrade your Windows Edition.</p>
<p><br />
Push-Button Reset Overview:<br />
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj126997.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj126997.aspx</a></p>
<p><br />
Push-button reset features attempt to preserve the activation status and store, and migrate these settings in both a refresh and reset. If the migration succeeds, the system will remain in an activated state after the refresh operation.</p>
<p><br />
The activation status may not be able to be migrated for a few reasons:</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For both the refresh and reset scenarios, if no activation store or activation status information is available, or if the activation store is unreadable, the activation status will not be preserved. The user will have to activate again once the operation
 completes.</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the reset scenario only, if the user has upgraded the edition using the Windows Anytime Upgrade, none of the activation data is migrated. The user will be reset back to the edition included in the OEM image after the reset operation. The user will then
 have to activate, and go through the Windows Anytime Upgrade process again to get back to the upgraded edition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reset your PC to start over<br />
"Reset, reinstalls Windows and blows out everything, even allowing you to securely wipe your data, so you can donate or sell your machine. At the end of a Reset, you'll need to re-enter your Windows product key."</p>
<p><br />
"In some cases, you might just want to remove everything and start from scratch manually. But in other cases, you’re removing your data from a PC because you’re about to recycle or decommission it. For both of these situations, you can easily reset your Windows
 8 PC and put the software back into the same condition as it was when you started it for the very first time (such as when you purchased the PC).</p>
<p><br />
Resetting your Windows 8 PC goes like this:</p>
<p><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PC boots into the Windows Recovery Environment (Windows RE).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows RE erases and formats the hard drive partitions on which Windows and personal data reside.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Windows RE installs a fresh copy of Windows.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The PC restarts into the newly installed copy of Windows."</p>

<p><br />
This document pertains to HP and Compaq computers (should give you a general idea of what is involved)&nbsp;that came with Windows 8 installed. This document explains how to reset the computer to its original factory shipped state and is divided into sections based
 on the different ways of performing a system recovery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Use the PC's manufacture's recovery partition&nbsp;and instructions for your used computer to restore Windows 8 back to it's fresh out of the box factory state / condition.</p>

            What model computer--desktop or laptop? If the previous owner set a bios password that comes up before windows, you must get him to unlock it or you'll have to replace the motherboard. Everyone here is talking about account passwords. What you bought could
 be a stolen computer especially if you cannot contact or get the password from the seller. Return it or complain at the auction site. Ebay has protections for this--if that is where you got it.

<h2>            April Windows 10 update - desktop folder icons look empty</h2>
                    My computer did the Windows update today. I lost all of my desktop icons initially. After turning tablet mode off, they returned, but all of the file folder icons appear empty, and saved jpegs appear as broken orange flowers. How do I get my stuff back

<p>Open File Explorer and click the [View] ribbon. Click [Options] <em>( at the far right )</em>, then click the [View] tab. In the 'Advanced settings' list make sure that "Always show icons, never thumbnails" is NOT ticked. If it is ticked then un-tick it
 and press [OK]. If it is not ticked already, then tick it and press [OK], then repeat but un-tick it and press [OK].</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that does not help, then open Control Panel ( View by Icons NOT category ), Click [System]. click [Advanced System Settings], Click the [Advanced] tab, click [Settings] under the 'Performance' section. Check that 'Show Thumbnails instead of Icons' IS
 ticked. Similar to above, if it is un-ticked then tick it and press [OK], if it is already ticked, then un-tick it, press [OK] and repeat but this time tick it and press [OK].</p>

<p>Sou um grande admirador da série Halo.</p>
<p>Comprei meu x360 somente por Halo 3, ODST e Reach. Depois comecei a gostar do console mais até do que meu Ps3. Tanto que hj possuo um xone ao invés de um ps4.</p>
<p>Quando comprei Halo Masterchief Collection, na caixa diz que Halo CE é totalmente em Português, porém não acho a opção de áudio em português, alguém sabe como configurar ou se realmente fui enganado?</p>
<p>Tirando isso o game é perfeito! Tudo em 1! Varias horas de diversão! Já zebrei o HCE e agora indo pra cima do H2</p>

<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community forums!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I understand that that you receive an error message while you try to run the Aion game.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the game is not compatible with Windows 8, I would suggest you t<span>ry running the game setup file in compatibility mode.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a) Right click on the program’s<b> shortcut </b>(LNK file), <b>.EXE </b>
file,<b> BAT</b> file, <b>CMD</b> file, or <b>MSI</b> file.</span></p>

    <title>www.xbox.com gets stuck in a loop when I click the dropdown list for - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            www.xbox.com gets stuck in a loop when I click the dropdown list for my account, Friends item and others.</h2>
                    
<p>Somehow some server push or JavaScript loop is refreshing some pages in a loop that prevents my Canadian Xbox Live login from continuing properly.<br />
<br />
This started happening within the last month or so.</p>
<p>To reproduce the error, visit <a href="http://www.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.xbox.com</a>, when finally logged into my account with three letter gamer tag, I click on My Account dropdown list box, then click Friends--that's it...&nbsp; From that point onward, the website
 goes into an infinite loop that cycles from <br />
<a href="http://login.live.com/logout.srf?ct=1413651674&amp;rver=6.2.6289.0&amp;lc=1033&amp;id=292543&amp;ru=http:%2F%2Faccount.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fdefault.aspx&amp;lru=https%3a%2f%2faccount.xbox.com%2fen-CA%2fFriends%3fxr%3dmebarnav%26lc%3d1033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://login.live.com/logout.srf?ct=1413651674&amp;rver=6.2.6289.0&amp;lc=1033&amp;id=292543&amp;ru=http:%2F%2Faccount.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Fdefault.aspx&amp;lru=https%3a%2f%2faccount.xbox.com%2fen-CA%2fFriends%3fxr%3dmebarnav%26lc%3d1033</a>&nbsp;<br />
to something else and back.</p>
<p>The screen title is "Continue" and it constantly reloads.</p>
<p>2012 or so I was using&nbsp;<a href="http://www.Xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.Xbox.com</a>, Friends, People I've met recently, but that functionality got broken really badly when the entire functionality was excised due to getting broken by some site look and feel update back
 then. Whoever the manager for that&nbsp;update project was, they should not&nbsp;pushed code that would break a big chunk of functionality of
<a href="http://www.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.xbox.com</a> into production, and as a consequence, should have been fired immediately at the time more than a year ago.</p>
<p>The last time that I checked the People who I met online recently screen still has a "Sorry, this functionality is under development"-type message still on it and no recent players list ever materializes.</p>
<p>When a teammate player in Modern Warfare 3 does really poorly, I try to give them tips, even if they are from Spain, Brazil, Russia, etc, by using the web Xbox Live stuff, and Google translation tools and translating my tip from English to whatever target
 language the recent player is.&nbsp; If they respond, I take their message and translate it back from their language to English.</p>
<p>Because of this looping&nbsp;<a href="http://www.xbox.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.xbox.com</a> web site snafu, I cannot access practically anything in the My Account dropdown list having to do with Xbox Live.</p>
<p>Is this because my gamer tag is&nbsp;only 3 letters long and the code monkeys programming and testing the web site never test using that scenario?</p>

<p>my goodness is anyone on the live passport SSO team going to investigate/fix this. very annoying. I guess I can't use IE to browse a Microsoft site.</p>
<p>I've noticed it is also impossible to log out. When I do it, it just refreshes to xbox homepage and logged right back in.</p>

<p>I have got the same problem, for a while I thought I was the only one. Nice to know i'm not, but it's really annoying that I can't use the xbox.com website using Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>Maybe Microsoft wants us all to stop using IE and use another browser?</p>
<p>Because before I had this infinite logout loop I also had trouble buying stuff from xbox.com, whenever I wanted to purchase something it would always show me a blanc popup window/thingy instead of the window/thingy in which you can see the price and stuff
 and could finalise the purchase.</p>
<p>However if I used Chrome then everything would work just fine and I could purchase stuff, this also seems to be the case with the infinite Logout loop if I use Chrome it doesn't happen.</p>
<p>Hope some from Microsoft will work on this issue and fixit ASAP because it's becoming really really annyoing andit's starting to *** me off.</p>

<p>Well, I'm glad I'm not the only one; thought I had a virus/worm thing whatever. Anyhoo, this is something that needs to be fixed pronto. Remember a couple of years back when xbox.com was awesome to use? How can a software giant have a site that doesn't play
 well with it's own internet browser? I can barely do anything and that includes making impulsive purchases at the store. These problems started when they updated the look to match the feel of Xbox One. Please, someone solve this.</p>

<p>Regarding posting this issue to "actual" Microsoft Xbox Support forums...</p>
<p>When I use a popular search engine and enter keywords of<br />
Xbox support forums<br />
I land on a page that gets me to a page that "can" land me almost exactly here again on "these forums."</p>
<p>The page is:<br />
http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/default.aspx
</p>
<p>The section of the page that seems like Microsoft corporate stuff seems to have this verbiage:</p>

</li></ul>
<p>None of these topics listed seems to mention or cover <a href="http://www.xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.xbox.com/</a> web site issues.&nbsp; In fact when looking at this carefully I notice that all of the items are collected under the heading: "Community Support."&nbsp; Correct me if I am mistaken, but "Community Support" usually means a user-to-user area that
 has nothing to do with actual Microsoft employees formally addressing any issues raised.</p>
<p>Above this verbiage is a 3 heading drop-down menu that will land me one menu level above this very forum in which I'm entering this message.&nbsp; As far as I know, this issue could be concerning only Canadian users so should be posted right where it is now?&nbsp;
 It may concern users world-wide, but I'm not a frequent world traveler to be able to determine if this is the case, nor would I be willing to formally change my Xbox Live gamer tag account's country of origin each time to test for this.</p>
<p>Perhaps "someone" could provide a link to the "correct place" regarding which "they" have knowledge so that I could paste a link to this discussion so far that would have actual Microsoft employees formally addressing this raised issue?</p>
<p>If "anyone" is also able to do so, could "they" please provide a set of keywords for use in a search engine that would have "the web address" as one of the top search results.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<h3> serranoma  say:</h3>
<h2>            ClearQAM options&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey everyone!</p>

<p>I'm a student at a university that uses ClearQAM for their TV service. I get plenty of SD + HD channels, all unencrypted through a coaxial cable directly into my Samsung TV. I have seen online that the Hauppauge tuner and the Xbox One Digital TV tuner do
 not work with ClearQAM on Xbox One as the One software doesn't support it. Microsoft support also told me through twitter that the tuner actually should work with a ClearQAM signal.</p>
<p>I'd like to watch my TV through my Xbox One, but I'm unsure of what to do. Any ideas? I'd ideally like to have full Kinect functionality with it, too, e.g. changing channels.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>It would be nice for MS to at least comment that it will never happen, and make it CLEAR when you buy the tuner it is antenna ONLY. My cable company has a basic plan with 200 channels that my digital televisions can "see" without a cable box and my USB Tuner on PC sees them all just fine, but the Xbox doesnt have QAM ability so I have to rent a box for $20 a month which is why I bought the damn tuner for, since Amazon and Best Buy BOTH said it would work.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi CH.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />2) Try another monitor cable and monitor to compare.
<br />
<br />3) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />4) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi  CorgiHelp 
<br />
<br />First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>
<br />
<br />nVidia - <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />AMD ATI - Download Drivers - AMD Support
<br /><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>
<br />
<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options. 
<br />
<br />As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore or brightness functions missing. Recommendations include, rollback, block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC. 
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1809, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1809 again. See instructions how to block it:

            Hi,
<br />
<br />For the monitor try changing the Picture Mode to Standard which is for basic PC application.
<br />
<br />The monitor may be preset to a gaming mode.
<br />
<br />Here is a link to the User Manual if yours is not handy:

<p>I had a similar problem with Adobe Acrobat where the program was corrupted and I had to reinstall it. For some reason adding 4 times the icons to my all programs menu:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cbe99bb3-435c-4646-b423-9222df6c2623" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/cbe99bb3-435c-4646-b423-9222df6c2623" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I managed to fix this by going to:&nbsp;C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleting the shortcut from Adobe Acrobat DC and then manually pinning the icon again as after removing it from the programs list, I couldn't find it anymore in the search!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you want it back make sure to make a manual shortcut of your desktop to later replace it if you've removed the shortcut from the start menu programs directory!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps!</p>

<p>Windows 10 is becoming a&nbsp; huge flop not because we don't like it but because of the lack of competent technical support. I will be reverting back to Windows 7 soon as I need to use features not available in Mail 10.&nbsp; Huff!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could happen if those startup programs require elevation of access (Run as Administrator); in which case, Windows simply blocks them from running at Startup. When you have upgraded your Windows version, these programs might have lost their permission
 from running on startup. You might consider as well updating your programs if there are any available latest version. The workaround is to create a scheduled tasks for each of those programs and launch at startup. Provided on this response is a link on how
 to open services.msc, which contains the list of programs which can run on computer startup. Although the article is for Windows 7, it is still applicable for Windows 10:

    <title>Buzzing Noise Edge Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnpz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Buzzing Noise Edge Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I'd appreciate your help on this.<br />
</p>
<p>Whenever I open a new page in Edge I sistematically get a short buzz from my laptop (Asus N551VW with samsung pro SSD).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This noise doesn't usually occur when I navigate in Chrome, although I can hear it when I open videos and sometimes hear it at random occasions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The buzz lasts no longer than a second and It doesn't go through the headphones.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can exclude this is noise is due to fan or overheating, and I have also updated all my drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea please share it here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            Hi John,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</div>
<p>
</p><p>- Have you installed any third party software which initiates the sound for particular events ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the issue is random it will be difficult to diagnose it.&nbsp;We suggests you&nbsp;check with a new user account (Local).</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try these steps to create a new user account and check if it fixes the issue. Refer to the steps below to create a new User Account:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Go to <strong>Settings</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Choose <strong>Accounts </strong>and then select Other User Accounts&nbsp;towards the left.</span></p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Select <strong>Add an Account</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Enter a <strong>user name</strong> and hit Next.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click on <strong>Finish</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Sign out from the current account and Log into the new&nbsp;account.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Check if issue persists.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to&nbsp;the below article for further assistance&nbsp;on&nbsp;creating a new user account in Windows 10.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>I'll try the solution you've proposed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the buzz sounds more like a static electrical beep so I do not think that is related to app settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore the fact that happens constantly when I open a page in Edge is rather weird given that when I use Chrome I do not get the same buzz while loading pages.</p>

<h2>            DISM Errors, log files collect and unsure what to look for.</h2>
                    <p>Lately I've noticed my computer, a netbook so low in power, has been acting really slow. I learned of these commands DISM commands and tried them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>DISM /Online /Check-Image /ScanHealth said there was about 80 errors but it was repairable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>DISM /Online /Check-Image /CHeckHealth - said it was repairable</p>
<p>
</p><p>DISM /Online /Check-Image /RestoreHealth</p>
<p>This started and then took forever before throwing an error code:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error: 0x80240021</p>
<p>
</p><p>DISM repair failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the error with RestoreHealth I found a link that suggested using:</p>
<p>DISM /Online /Check-Image /StartComponentCleanup</p>
<p>This seemed to work but for a little while then I got the error: </p>
<p>
</p><p>Error: 6800</p>
<p>The function attempted to use a name that is reserved for use by another transaction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my research I found turning off all 3'rd party applications from starting and rebooting may fix this but it failed. I have the CBS and DISM logs but not completely sure how to read them or the best way to troubleshoot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If needed I can provide the logs but no really sure what I'm looking for.</p>
<p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
As stated in the links I posted&nbsp;a Refresh is designed to not touch the&nbsp; user data/files. However
<br />
redundant backups are always a very good idea, especially when working with a computer that
<br />
has some sort of performance issues.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>An outdated version of the game and the Windows 10 OS are possible reasons as to why you're encountering this issue. For us to have a better overview of your concern, may we know if you've made any changes to your device before encountering this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, we suggest running the Windows apps troubleshooter provided on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/69e76f90-d54c-44cf-9851-c2d1542790db/run-the-troubleshooter-for-windows-apps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a>. This can help resolve issues with games and apps downloaded from the Windows Store.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, we also recommend running the Windows troubleshooter for devices and hardware. This troubleshooter can help diagnose and detect hardware issues with the keyboard. See

<p>The next solution we suggest is to create a new user account. This can help determine if this is due to a corrupted user data. See

Create a local user or administrator account in Windows 10</a> for the steps. Play the game using the new account and check if the same issue occurs.</p>

            If you click the tiny blue icon in the upper-left corner of the RDP window, do you have Smart Sizing enabled? Or are you zoomed in/out at anything other than 100%?

<h2>            Why won&#39;t Simcity 4 run on my Windows 7 computer&#63;</h2>
                    I've tried loading it stock, with Rush Hour, and with the 638 patch and every time I go to play the screen flashes black once or twice, then acts like nothing happened. It displays a prompt each time asking me if I want to allow the unknown program to
 make changes to the computer and I hit run. It then briefly displays a message about switching to some basic mode (can't see it long enough to read), then gives up.
<br />
<br />
I changed the compatibility mode to every possible setting (XP, Vista, etc.) but have no luck. Any ideas on what I can do? I know the game works because I've played it on my old XP computer, but the game becomes too slow on there once I start adding in mods,
 so I want to play it on my faster Windows 7 comp.

<h2>            ROBOCOPY&#58; UNC paths for computers using ip address</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to initiate the transfer of data between two computers on the same network drive using Robocopy. The computers do not have access to network drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(For the example)</p>
<p>Computer A</p>
<p>ipv4 address: 1.2.3.4</p>
<p>Folder : C:\Source</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer B</p>
<p>ipv4 address: 5.6.7.8</p>
<p>Folder : C:\Receive</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would assume that the robocopy command is :</p>
<p>
</p><p>Robocopy "\\1.2.3.4\C:\Source" "\\5.6.7.8\C:\Receive" /mir /xx</p>
<p>
</p><p>But this does not work. Could someone help me out please?</p>
