<h2>            how do i appeal a communication ban when i didn&#39;t do anything to be banned</h2>
                    <p>I was banned on the 14th of December for violation of terms and service regarding xbox live communications but haven't messaged or contacted anyone with a few exception of party chat with friends and messaging them to ask if they would go on a games or join my party. Yet i have received a 2 week communication that ends on the 29th of December and was wondering on how i could appeal the ban.</p>

<h2>            Battery Life</h2>
                    <p>The battery life on the Surface Pro 4 is abysmal! &nbsp;Even when I use the Surface Pro without the keyboard attached, the battery life is at most between 3 to a maximum of 4 hours.</p>
<p>I have applied several hints from various websites to try to make battery life effective and useable but the most I am able to get is 4 hours.</p>
<p>Why can't Microsoft put out hardware the works effectively in the battery life department?</p>
<p>Othe manufacturers produce products that provide much better usability in battery life. &nbsp;Can't Microsoft implement&nbsp;those features in their products? &nbsp;It just doesn't make sense that those same advanced features can't be implemented.</p>
<p>For example, my iPad 3rd generation still gives me 8 to 10 hours of battery life and my Lenovo ThinkPad gives10 to 12 hours of use on the battery.</p>

<h3> shir frey  say:</h3>
<h2>            ProDuo Memory Stick not recognized in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I just recently downloaded the Windows 10 operating system on my Sony computer and it's no longer recognizing the Sony Memory Stick PRO HG Duo. One of the main reasons I purchased this computer in the first place was because it had a memory stick
 reader and it's always worked perfectly in the past so I don't want to have to resort to buying a USB cable for all my devices.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to force the computer to search or look for the memory stick?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer makes a noise when I plug it in as usual but the auto play window no longer pops up and it doesn't show up on the My Computer</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not that great with computers and the new Windows 10 has a big adjustment...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>

<h2>            Netflix not working with Windows 10</h2>
                    I just downloaded and installed Windows 10 a few days ago and I just noticed that my Netflix app will not load up movies anymore.&nbsp; The app itself will load up fine however when I try to play the movie I just get the "buffer clock" and then after about
 10 seconds I get an Error Code: H7361-1253-80010005..... I have tried several times but no luck.&nbsp; I never had any problems before I upgraded to Win. 10

            I searched Netflix support for error code H7361-1253-800706BE and it had the steps needed to fix the problem.&nbsp; I just downloaded Windows 10 so it's a little harder to get to where you want. The lower left of the screen has the Windows logo and there you
 find the gear icon. You go to Internet Options, Select the Security tab, select Trusted Sites button. UNCHECK "require server verification."&nbsp; Then, delete anything related to Netflix in the Websites field.&nbsp; Type" neflix.com" in the Add this website to the
 zone field. Finally, select the Add button and then the Close button. It worked, but only after I restarted my computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h3> cv8923  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bought a system builder copy of Windows 7 Pro off eBay....does this sound weird to you&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I like Windows 7 a lot more than Windows 8, so in order to get a copy of 7 Pro at a reasonable price I bought a copy eBay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Read this and see if anything sounds fishy to you...</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a $75 copy of Windows 7 Pro, this is what the eBay seller claims:</p>
<p>
<span>"These Disk have&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">NEVER</span>&nbsp;been out of their cases, the company I work for is required to purchase them so that we can attached a license (the actual sticker) to all PC's we sell with
<span>"These Disk have&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">NEVER</span>&nbsp;been out of their cases, the company I work for is required to purchase them so that we can attached a license (the actual sticker) to all PC's we sell with
 our systems.&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The original product key sticker has been removed&nbsp;</span>but you will get the a photo copy of the sticker that goes with your disk. All disk will come with their own unique key. The key&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">HAS
 NOT</span>&nbsp;been activated, we use cloning software to clone a copy of a already configured version, we just require the sticker to place on the computer per Microsoft. They normally just throw these disk away but i figured I would pass the savings on.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>These are not upgrade versions, they are FULL VERSIONS from Microsoft directly!"</span></p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>According to the packaging the disc came in, it is a Microsoft OEM System Builder License, not sure it that makes the seller more suspicious or not, what do you think?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Mac, so I installed this copy of Windows with bootcamp and it went fine. About 3 days later a message came up saying "Windows cannot activate this product key, try a different one." I emailed the seller and he sent me another key which didn't work
 either. I am currently waiting to hear back from him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">My main concern </span>is while running Windows through bootcamp you can view my Macintosh HD as a read only directory which has all my personal files on it. Is it possible the seller sold me a copy of Windows that
 he somehow altered and enabled himself to spy on my computer and view the files in my directories? When I saw "system builder license" I got kinda weirded out. Its not a nice feeling thinking that someone may have plotted to get all my personal files.&nbsp;I don't
 know too much in this area so I could be totally paranoid, what you guys think?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish there was a reasonably priced way to buy a reliable copy of Windows 7...after using it for a week it is such a breath of fresh air from OS X.</p>

            <p>Several points:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The contents of the disk, for any version of Windows 7, is available as an iso file, FREE from Digital River, as has been explained many times on this and other fora.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. The contents of all version disks are identical, except for one small text file that controls which version gets installed. This file is&nbsp;called ei.cfg and is located in the sources folder. If the file is missing or removed, then the Windows installer
 will present you with a menu of all versions, asking you which to install. If you use this option, you MUST have a corresponding product key for that version. Windows knows!</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. The salient point here is that you must have a valid product key to activate and validate your installation. From what I read, the seller is simply getting rid of unused disks (again, available free online as isos). He is likely using only one disk to
 do all of his installations, and using the COA label from the other disks on each machine. The problem you are going to run into, and it's a biggie, is that that product key has already been used and activated through Microsoft. They don't allow multiple concurrent
 activations of one product key. I suppose it's possible to reactivate the license by phone, but then you will have two computers claiming the same ID number which, again, Microsoft won't allow, and will likely shut down both systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Bottom line: they guy is robbing you and is a thief. A Xerox copy of a COA label IS NOT VALID! It will not be allowed or accepted&nbsp;by Microsoft. Also, he must be a small time vendor or he would have a distribution license from Microsoft which gets him
 a set of installation media and a bunch of COA labels.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Best bet: buy your own OEM copy of Windows from any of several reliable vendors such as Amazon, or Newegg, or Tiger Direct. DO NOT go for "bargains", especially not eBay. The price is what it is, and ranges from $89US for Home Premium, to $130US for Professional
 to $180US for Ultimate. Anything less is a rip off. Micorsoft has been in this racket far too long to allow any such shenanigans, and doesn't. Some vendors will have occasional "sales" where they knock off 10% or so. These sales are authorized by Microsoft
 and rarely exceed that 10%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. The nit pickers among you will pick up on two facts: A. there are actually TWO sets of files, one for 32-bit and one for 64-bit. They can be combined to allow one disk to install ALL editions of Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>B. There is one circumstance that allows multiple, concurrent activation of one product key: enterprise, but that's a separate license and distribution situation and not related to consumer or OEM setups.</p>

            <p>Recently there have been a few keys purchased from auction sites showing up here as non genuine, they appear to be connected to this HROnline code HrOnline: 0xC004C4A2. If you purchased a key from EBAY please realize that the seller may have sold that key
 to multiple people resulting in that key becoming blacklisted. These keys were never meant for resale, they were meant for software development or evaluation depending on the program they were obtained through. If you purchased one of these keys and it has
 become non-genuine with the above code you may need purchase a new license for windows 7. Attempt to validate by going to
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/geniune" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.microsoft.com/geniune</a> and follow the links provided to repair windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Added note. You only have a limited amount of time (45 days I believe) to file a claim with the auction sites. Stay away from these keys, if you purchased a key that has turned non-genuine and are within the 45 days of purchase file a claim. There are legitimate
 software vendors on auction sites but if it sounds to good to be true then don't buy it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;It seems you are running a license intended for a particular channel. Yes, you might have a perfectly looking hologram disk, but this doesn't mean the license is legitimate since its easy these days to make hologram disks. Persons who work at the factory
 can secretly create hologram disks they resell on the black market or purchase press machines to do the job.</p>

<p>
</p><p>My main concern is while running Windows through bootcamp you can view my Macintosh HD as a read only directory which has all my personal files on it. Is it possible the seller sold me a copy of Windows that he somehow altered and enabled himself to spy
 on my computer and view the files in my directories?</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, this is by design, you can ready either the boot camp or OS X partition within either operating system, you just can't write to either unless you have special software.
</p>
<p>OEM System Builder licenses are nothing to be alarmed about though, they are similar to retail licenses with one exception. Its possible the OEM System Builder license you bought off ebay was previously in use. If you must use an OEM System Builder license,
 it is recommended you purchase new off amazon.com as JW Stuart suggested. </p>
<p>OEM versions of Windows 7 are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:<br />
- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel<br />
- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on<br />
- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard<br />
- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are in possession ofthe original product key that came with the OEM System Builder license you bought, you could try phone activation. Its not guaranteed to work, but worth a try. If it is determined to be none-genuine especially with the subsequent
 keys you got (which by the way should not be distributed separately), then its best you purchase a genuine license off amazon.com for the edition you bought or a cheaper edition and update the product key or delete the boot camp partition and start over.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<span>
<p>Because Windows 7 is in limited stock because Microsoft ended sales in October 2013, this has created demand because of its scarcity. This means retail boxed copies demand a premium, while OEM System Builder copies remain affordable.</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>Full version (Retail):</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>

<p>Sorry to do this to you, but all of the Amazon links above are dead. All come up 404.</p>
<p>I have searched Amazon, and the software is, in fact, still available, although for grossly inflated prices in some cases (like $600 for Ultimate). Nonetheless, it still is available in retail and OEM editions.</p>

            <p>More then likely the retail versions listed on Amazon's site are not direct from Amazon but shipped&nbsp;from a 3rd party seller&nbsp;that advertises on Amazon's web site, which sometimes can be risky.</p>

<h2>            My current turtle beach headset with the xboxONE</h2>
                    Hi I was wondering if there is any news related to this? I have a pair of turtle beaches I currently use on my xbox360. I was wondering of anyone has heard of a jack or something that will allow me to plug into the XBOXONE and continue to use them? I'd
 really hate to kick out $100 for a new gaming headset after purchasing the new console. And feed back would be most appreciated. Thanks

<p>The problem is right now the connectors at the bottom of the new controllers are different, they have increased the frequency of the audio too (which equates to better audio quality).<br />
<br />
They are working on an adapter but there's no release date, but it's worth noting the Xbox One comes with a headset (even though it's a cheap one).<br />
<br />

<p>Here's a link for you to compare the audio codecs you might find useful: <a href="http://uk.gamespot.com/news/xbox-one-and-xbox-360-audio-compared-6413838" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

                    Hello. I'm being attacked by windows updates. I turned them off, never accepted any of them, turned them off in services, etc. it does not help. These intrusive updates still install themselves without my knowledge. Tonight, windows update turned my pc
 off while I had something important open and now it can't be restored. How to get rid of this useless feature?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
There are Windows 10 features which are turned on by default but this features and settings can be disabled also. To know those Windows 10 features that you can disable, you may check the list below:<br />
<br />
<strong>File-sharing updates</strong><br />
<br />
• This feature is turned on by default, but you can turn it off by going to Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Advanced options &gt; Choose how updates are delivered.<br />
<br />
<strong>Annoying notifications</strong><br />
<br />
• Get your notifications under control by going to Settings &gt; System &gt; Notifications &amp; actions and turning off things like Show me tips about Windows and individual app notifications.<br />
<br />
<strong>Start menu ads</strong><br />
<br />
• Turn off these pesky ads by going to Settings &gt; Personalization &gt; Start &gt; Occasionally show suggestions in Start.
<br />
<br />
<strong>Targeted ads from third-party </strong><strong>apps</strong><br />
<br />
• You can turn this off by going to Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; General &gt; Let my apps use my advertising ID for experiences across apps (turning this off will reset your ID)<br />
<br />
<strong>Getting to know</strong> <strong>you</strong><br />
<br />
• You can stop Cortana from getting to know you, and clear your information on your device, by going to Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Speech, inking, &amp; typing and clicking Stop getting to know me.<br />
<br />
<strong>Apps running in the</strong> <strong>background</strong><br />
<br />
• To do this, go to Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Background apps and toggle off each app individually.<br />
<br />
<strong>The lock </strong><strong>screen</strong><br />
<br />
• You can disable the lock screen and go straight to the log-in screen, but you'll need to head into the Windows Registry.<br />
<br />
<strong>All the</strong> <strong>syncing</strong><br />
<br />
• To turn off settings syncing (including themes and passwords), go to Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sync your settings. You can turn off all settings syncing, or you can selectively turn off specific settings.<br />
<br />
• To turn off search history syncing, open Cortana and go to Settings &gt; My device history and My search history.<br />
<br />
<strong>The pretty visual</strong> <strong>interface</strong><br />
<br />
•&nbsp; You can turn off most of Windows 10's visual effects by right-clicking the Start button and going to System &gt; Advanced system settings. Under the Advanced tab, go to Performance and click Settings, then uncheck all the visual effects you'd prefer not to
 see.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you need further help.<br />

    <title>NBA 2K14 Workaround to play MyCareer&#47;MyGM - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            NBA 2K14 Workaround to play MyCareer&#47;MyGM</h2>
                    <i>Note: there's a TL;DR version toward the end of this wall of text.</i> <br />
<br />
Dear fellow upset XB1 players being sent back to the main menu when trying to play MyCareer/MyGM-
<br />
<br />
I did several searches but could not find any threads dedicated to sharing this info, but I DID happen to come across multiple users who have posted this same workaround briefly in some of the 100+ page threads, only to be lost and buried shortly after (Source:
 NBA 2K14 forum on OperationSports.com)<br />
This being said, although I did find this on my own, I obviously am not the only one and therefore do not take sole credit - I just want to inform others.<br />
<br />
This 'temporary workaround' is directed to those of you who wish to play the game (all modes including MyCareer/MyGM), but don't want to lose your current (corrupt) game saves, VC, and all other data on the Xbox by resetting to factory defaults. Although it
 is uncertain when or even IF 2K can fix this Main Menu issue, I'm trying to stay optimistic that they will eventually fix the problem and I can keep the VC I paid for and keep all of the saves I have already put time into.<br />
<br />
To do this, you must create another profile/gamertag on your Xbox One. Luckily for us, this is not only free, but also a much quicker and simpler process given that there is already 1 Gamertag with an Xbox Live Gold Membership (ex. My main Gamertag with corrupt
 saves). For those of you who are unaware of this new feature, all profiles you create will have gamertags automatically generated and be able to access all features that the main account with Gold Membership can (aka everything).
<br />
<br />
Below I will post the steps to create and add a new Gamertag on the Xbox One. Good luck to you all, I hope this works for everyone. If I have overlooked a post regarding this same information, please say so and I will delete/edit this thread accordingly. Again,
 I take no credit in being the first to discover this method, I just want the information to be more easily accessible for EVERYONE to have an opportunity to play if they so choose.
<br />
<br />
<b><i>TL;DR-</i></b> Create a new profile on your Xbox One, open up NBA 2k14, and have fun.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading and happy gaming.<br />
iReinhardt<br />
<br />
<i>Steps to create and add the new profile to your console:</i><br />
1) From your Xbox One dashboard, Select on the profile icon in the top left corner.<br />
2) Select 'Add New'<br />
3) Close the on-screen keyboard by pressing B, then Select 'Get a new email'<br />
4) Follow the rest of the instructions to create your new profile<br />
5) Make sure you are signed into the new profile, then put in your NBA 2k14 disc or select 'My games &amp; apps' if you have the Cloud version.<br />
6) Once the game is up, it will ask you to create a 2K account. I recommend using your newly created outlook.com address.<br />
7) Post on this thread to confirm if it works or for some reason doesn't.<br />
8) Share this information with everyone that you can, since it has become apparent that 2K isn't going to tell us anything.<br />
<br />
Note: if you experience the black screen upon starting the game, I've read that some users have had luck going to the dashboard and Quitting out of the game until it works, and others have simply waited and eventually it starts the 2k14 Intro. I have not personally
 experienced the black screen issue either before or after creating a new profile to play.

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I bought a used XBOX 360, how do I remove the info from the previous owner? I want to get a LIVE account but I cannot enter any information or create a new Live account because I cannot access the internet to sign up without previous owners pass-code. How
 can I format all his info and reset or whatever,</p>
<p>is there a simple fix?</p>

    <title>How to escalate a refund issue &#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> samc6  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to escalate a refund issue &#63;</h2>
                    <p>i am trying to figure out how to escalate a refund issue. &nbsp;Microsoft support declined a refund request that was made within the 14 day time frame for a game that was purchased. &nbsp;I have made repeated failed attempts to communicate with them and via chat,
 email and phone. &nbsp;Over the phone i have successfully reached two people - neither of which could help to process the refund but did comment that an error was made in their initial response and i should have an email soon with the approval. Then i just get
 &nbsp;another decline. &nbsp;They are obviously not reading the email where i provide confirmation of the purchase details along with the initital refund request. &nbsp;They are an absolute nightmare to deal with and continually decline with no reason stated and then close
 the case. &nbsp; I am beyond fruatrated with them and with the barriers they place to delivering respectable level of customer service.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Sam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for coming to the forums with your question. You will need to reply to the email that stated you were declined. There are many different factors when it comes to refunds not just within 14 days, like if you had any previous refunds. As stated in the
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/servicesagreement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft agreement</a>under refund policy first line states all are non refundable:</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(82, 77, 82, 1)">Refund Policy.</span></strong><span> Unless otherwise provided by law or by a particular Service offer, all purchases are final and non-refundable. If you believe that Microsoft has charged you
 in error, you must contact us within 90 days of such charge. No refunds will be given for any charges more than 90 days old. We reserve the right to issue refunds or credits at our sole discretion. If we issue a refund or credit, we are under no obligation
 to issue the same or similar refund in the future. This refund policy does not affect any statutory rights that may apply. For more refund information, please visit our
</span><a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=618283" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">help
 topic</a><span>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Definitely try to reply to the email that said you was declined and go from there.</span></p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>​Hi Michael,</p>
<p>This issue may have caused due to updated Network Adapter driver not present on the computer or may be due to incompatible drivers as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like to know some information about the Network connection issue so that we could assist you better.<br />
1. Are you facing this issue while using any specific program/app?<br />
2. Did the issue start recently?<br />
3. Do you get any error code or error message?<br />
4. What is the make and model number of the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if it works for you.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
Run the Network Adapter troubleshooter and check if the issue persists.</p>
<div><span>Follow the steps to run the troubleshooter:</span></div>
<div><span><span><font>a.</font><span>
</span></span></span><span><font>Press <b>Windows key + C</b> on your keyboard to show the Charms bar.</font></span></div>
<div><span><span><font>b.</font><span>
</span></span></span><span><font>Type <b>Troubleshooting</b> and click
<b>Troubleshooting</b> under <b>Settings</b>.</font></span></div>
<div><span><span><font>c.</font><span>
</span></span></span><span><font>Now type <b>Troubleshooter</b> in the
<b>search</b> option.</font></span></div>
<div><span><span><font>d.</font><span>
</span></span></span><span><font>In the search option in the new windows, type Network and click on Network Adapter troubleshooter and follow the prompts.</font></span></div>
<div><span><font>&nbsp;</font></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
Disable security software temporarily and check.
<p><font><b><span>Disclaimer</span></b><span>: If you have to temporarily disable security software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus
 software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3:</strong><br />
Try reinstalling the Network Adapter in compatibility mode and check if it helps.</p>
<p><strong>Make older programs compatible with this version of Windows</strong>:<br />

<p>My sound card has worked fine for several years. i have Broadband telephone and skype and all these work fine, even together and have done so for a long time.</p>
<p>Since a week or so, the sound suddenly drops to 0. I have checked the volume mixer and I can move the volume back up to a decent level, and the sound returns. but then it drops down to nothing again for no apparent reason. What can I do, please?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p><strong>Reference to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
</strong><br />
Check Control Panel - Mouse and Keyboard to see if anything is set to Volume Control such as a middle<br />
wheel, side button, or a key is "Stuck". Does it do it in all programs? If not check those that do to see if<br />
they have programmable "hotkey" or "mouse" activated volume controls.<br />
<br />
There was an issue in XP where older drivers allowed that so Update your drivers (XP or Vista).<br />
<br />
Right Click Speaker Icon - Playback Devices<br />
<br />
Highlight Speakers - Properties (lower right same page) - Enhancements&nbsp; Tab - Check Disable all Sound<br />
Effects - Apply - OK<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>After the above : (</strong><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.)</strong></p>
<p>Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - look for HD Audio - Mine says RealTek High<br />
Definition Audio&nbsp;(that is an example and yours may have an entirely different name/maker).<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version.<br />
Now Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers.<br />
Then RIGHT CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
1st go to system maker's site and look for latest driver Download - SAVE - go to right click on<br />
and RUN AS ADMIN (This is your fallback.) REBOOT after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE : Sound drivers often rollback so check the version after installation and the<br />
reboot to see if the version you installed is there, if not repeat the install&nbsp;- reboot<br />
until it is. It can take several tries depending on how many rollbacks it does.</strong><br />
<br />
Then do same for Device Maker's site.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
</span></span></span><br />
Installing and updating drivers in 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is preferred<br />
to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />

<br />
<strong>Also Right Click Speaker near clock - Playback Devices - right click in the box area -<br />
check Show disable and disconnected devices. Highlight speaker and on the&nbsp;lower<br />
Right click Properties check settings for Device Usage enabled and so on. Also do<br />
same for Configure on Lower Left of that box.<br />

In Control Panel you can also look for an Audio Manager along with the Sound Settings.<br />

    <title>computer running windows 8.1 won&#39;t recognize camera - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> celesta sargent  say:</h3>
<h2>            computer running windows 8.1 won&#39;t recognize camera</h2>
                    <p>I have an old camera (Sony DSC-N1) and a new computer. I would love to be able to continue to use my camera and download pictures but- so far- I have been unable to do so.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My previous computer was a Satellite running Windows 7. I could download pictures without any issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday, I got an HP 15-g029WM that is running Windows 8.1 I plugged my camera into the USB port and nothing happened. When I would do this on the old computer, a windows explorer dialog box would come up and ask me if I wanted to Import the pictures (along
 with several other options) and then gave me the option to erase them after they were downloaded.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is what happens when I plug my camera into the USB port on the new computer: The little hardware icon comes up in my taskbar. I click on the icon and am given the option of going to devices... I do this and my Sony DSC is recognized but as an unspecified
 device. Then I go to windows explorer and it isn't there. I then downloaded Play Memories (ultimately from Sony). I plugged in the camera again and this time a device driver downloaded (automatically). I thought this would fix it! Alas, my camera was again
 recognized as an unspecified device by the control panel and not at all by windows explorer. Then I opened Play Memories and clicked on import media. A new screen came up that asked me to plug in and turn on the camera (it was already plugged in and turned
 on.)&nbsp; I waited several minutes (about 10 or 15) and nothing else happened. I switched ports and repeated the process. Still couldn't download the pictures. I had one more port (my computer has three). I tried it and still nothing happened.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(BTW, I found the driver that came with the camera and tried to install it and got a message that it had compatibility issues and that I would have to down load a new driver. This lead to the downloading of Play Memories.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really like my old camera and would hate to have to get a new one just because I got a new computer. I have every confidence that the technology exists to let me do this but I have no clue what it might be. Does anyone out there know what else I can do?</p>
