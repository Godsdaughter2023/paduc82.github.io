    <title>KB3081424 Breaks Specific Touch Edge Gestures on Surface Pro 3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> conor evans  say:</h3>
<h2>            KB3081424 Breaks Specific Touch Edge Gestures on Surface Pro 3</h2>
                    <p>When Windows 10 auto-updated to KB3081424, my Surface Pro 3 lost the ability to carry out touch edge gestures. Specifically,&nbsp;I could no longer "swipe" in from the right to reveal action center, swipe from the left to show task view, or in from the top to
 affect apps. Task View and Action Center could be triggered via their taskbar buttons, and all other touch functions worked without issue. Only the edge gestures were lost.&nbsp; Uninstalling KB3081424 fixed the problem completely with no other side effects.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, Windows automatically installed the update, and the same problem occurred again. What in the world is going on? I use my Surface in tablet mode 50% of the time, and need these gestures to work. I uninstalled the update again, and everything is working
 normally once again.</p>

&nbsp;=======================================================<br />
<br />
More&nbsp;troubleshooting if needed :<br />
<br />
Are you using a 3rd party antivirus/antispyware/security program? If so many of those<br />
can cause&nbsp;problems with&nbsp;performance and Apps.<br />
<br />
Check with the System Maker Support (Motherboard Maker for custom systems), their<br />
on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums about any known issues.<br />
Update the<strong> BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate
<br />
device drivers</strong> (all of those can have a definite impact on boot speed and performance).<br />
<br />
Note&nbsp;using <strong>Win Key + X</strong> and <strong>Win Key + W</strong> (to get to Control Panel, Run, and Settings
<br />
as needed). <strong>Win Key + D</strong> calls the desktop and the using <strong>
Win Key</strong> toggles Desktop and <br />
Start Screen.<br />
<br />
Check&nbsp;Startup Programs.<br />
<br />
Right Click in the lower&nbsp;left hand corner - Task Manager<br />
Or WinKEY + X - Task Manager<br />
Or Right Click the Taskbar - Task Manager<br />
<br />
Check the StartUp tab.<br />

=======================================================<br />
<br />
If needed :&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Try doing a "Refresh your PC without affecting your files"&nbsp;(or changing your personal<br />
settings)&nbsp;or even a Restore. Be prepared to&nbsp;re-install the&nbsp;programs,&nbsp;Apps will remain.<br />
And having redundant&nbsp;backups of&nbsp;your files&nbsp;off&nbsp;of the main hard drive is always a<br />
good idea.<br />
<br />
Windows 8 includes special methods to Refresh (keep files and settings)&nbsp;&nbsp;or a&nbsp;Reset
<br />
(new install removing all).<br />

<p>
</p><p>The above header refers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to win 10 from 8.1 recently and everything has been going fine ever since apart from some minor problems including inability to carry out some updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, yesterday I restarted my laptop (Lenovo Thinkpad T60 4GB Ram 64bit 500GB HDD) and I have been unable to boot successfully to the desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>after the initial windows 10 logo, there's a long period (over 2hrs) of disk activity and at the end of the day, the desktop refuses to show.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have a repair disk. I downloaded and didn't create one.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you proceed with the troubleshooting steps, you will have to turn off the computer manually by pressing the Power button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once after turning off the computer, I suggest you to download the ISO file from Microsoft website and then perform Automatic Repair using the Installation Media and check if it helps. This Repair tool will help you fix certain problems, such as missing
 or damaged system files.</p>

</p><p>I have downloaded the Win 10 Installer. However, Startup repair was unable to resolve the issue. This is the content of the srttrail.txt file, below.</p>

</p><p>How do I fix the partition table error? (I have successfully tried out the following bootrec cmds in command prompt: fixmbr, fixboot and rebuildbcd and the situation persists) I tried refreshing which is my last resort becuause I don't want to lose my current
 apps and settings, it gave an error about the disk being locked and I should unlock it. It might have something to do with the partition table error. I have also tried chkdsk, which repaired some errors.)</p>

            <p>Hi Chris,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1</b>:</p>
<p><b>Important</b>: This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these
 steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps. If you aren't logged in as an administrator, you can
 only change settings that apply to your user account:</p>
<p>a. Press <b>Windows key + R</b> and then type “<b>regedit</b>” without quotes and press
<b>ENTER</b>.</p>
<p>If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p>b. Locate and click the key or subkey that you want to back up.</p>
<p>c. Click the <b>File</b> menu, and then click <b>
Export</b>.</p>
<p>d. In the <b>Save</b> <b>in</b> box, select the location where you want to save the backup copy to, and then type a name for the backup file in the File name box.</p>
<p>e. Click <b>Save</b>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow these steps and check if it helps:</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Press <b>Windows key + R</b> and then type “<b>regedit</b>” without quotes and press
<b>ENTER</b>.</p>
<p>If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Go to the location <b>HKEY_Local_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa</b></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Locate <b>everyoneIncludesanonymous</b> on the right pane and double click it.</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Change the <b>Value data</b> from 0 to 1</p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Now go to the location <b>HKEY_Local_Machine\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\LanManServer\Parameters</b></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Locate <b>restrictnullsessaccess </b>on the right pane and double click it.</p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Change the <b>Value data</b> from 1 to 0.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2</b>:</p>
<p>I would suggest you to disable or uninstall third party anti-virus software and then check if the issue persists. Follow these steps to uninstall any third party anti-virus software:</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap <b>
Search</b>.</p>
<p>(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click
<b>Search</b>.)</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Enter “<b>appwiz.cpl</b>” without quotes in the search box, tap or click
<b>Apps</b>, and then tap or click <b>appwiz.cpl</b>. </p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Uninstall any third party anti-virus software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may refer to the article to turn off Windows Firewall:</p>
<p><b>Windows Firewall from start to finish</b></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/windows-firewall-from-start-to-finish" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/windows-firewall-from-start-to-finish</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Note</b>: Running the computer without firewall or the anti-virus software is a potential threat to the computer; make sure to enable the security software after completing the troubleshooting steps and after identifying the
 issue.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 MEMORY MANAGEMENT ERROR WON&#39;T FIX&#33;&#33;&#33; PLEASE - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matthew lee reynolds  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 MEMORY MANAGEMENT ERROR WON&#39;T FIX&#33;&#33;&#33; PLEASE HELP&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Ok, so before I begin I just want to clarify that before I made this post I have researched so many solutions for this problem to try and fix it, but nothing has worked and I'm 99% sure I know the source of the issue but just don't know how to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You see, I recently finished my first ever PC build which has two storage drives (a HDD and a SSD). I want to install windows 10 on it so I bought a Installation Disc and installed the OS on the SSD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So about a mouth and 1/2 later, I noticed that my SSD was almost filled (The SSD's 250gb and the HDD is 1TB) so I decided to move default folders locations onto the HHD (folders such as "My Documents", "My Videos", etc.).</p>
<p>
</p><p>That did work to an extent (I accidently moved the "My Desktop" and "My Documents" onto the HDD and now all those files will show up on the desktop) but after a few days, windows started to 'play up', like screen freezing for a while, the taskbar wouldn't
 respond at all and had a slower startup time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About a week or two later I encountered my first BLUE SCREEN OF DEATH! (BSOD). It was a MEMORY_MANAGEMENT error.</p>
<p>Being me, I assumed that it was a 'one off' thing and thought that windows would have dealt with the error. As the days went by, I received more and more BSODs and started to see a pop-up message telling me that I need to start a file history backup process
 (Even though I already did) and it give me two options to start now or remind me later; however either option would not do anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I realised that I need to do something about it fast! It was also at this point where I need to complete some updates and needed to download Trend Micro software onto my PC; this is where I discovered another issue.</p>
<p>Ever since this point, if I downloaded something or delete a file on my computer then shut the PC down when I'm done for the day, the next time I start it up nothing would have changed; I wouldn't have the updates/downloads and the files I deleted would
 return back to where they once were, as if the computer "Forgot" to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I began my research and found a lot of solutions. One was to open the command prompt and ran the SFC scanner but nothing responded. I tried the Memory Diagnostic test but when the PC restarts, it doesn't open the test but instead resumes to the windows
 sign in as normal and I still get the same errors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it's not the RAM chips themselves because my mother can't run the computer with just one chip so if one was faulty the computer won't run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I eventually came across information stating that sometime when you move data from one storage drive to another, that it will cause the memory management error and a simple uninstall and reinstall should do the fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And that's where my problem lies, because of this error, I cannot simply unistall windows 10 via the OS itself no matter what I try and I do believe that this may be the solution I'm after so if there is anyone out who does know how to uninstall windows
 via the PC BIOS (I have Gigabyte Motherboard) or knows another solution,</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE HELP ME!</p>

            <p>Thank you Sarkar, but I'm afraid that none of those solutions has helped at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter which solution I've tried, whenever I restarted my PC there will be absolutely no change at all :(.</p>
<p>For example when I tried the automatic repair solution, after I chose system restore and the PC restarts, when it starts up it would not have completed any repairs whatsoever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried to reset the PC in the settings and chose to remove all files, after the restart the PC simply resumed back to it's previous state before I made the restart, as if it "<em>forgot</em>" to reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So at this point, I feel that my best hope is to completely remove windows 10 from my PC and reinstall it with the installation disc I have, but I just don't know how else to remove windows 10.</p>

            <p>Okey, so I got the media creation tool and placed it on a USB. After some trial and error, I managed to open the setup from The USB at startup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I get to the setup, I'll select 'Install now' and after I type my activation code I'm given the choice to install windows and keep the files or to install windows only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I choose the 2nd option, I then can choose which hard drive to install windows on and which drives to format. I have a HDD and a SSD; the SSD is the drive that initially had windows 10 installed. When I try to format the SSD, I receive a popup &nbsp;telling
 me that I cannot I cannot and the error code is 0x80070057.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I chose the HDD to put windows on, it'll install but SSD will still be used to launch windows and I still have the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I choose the first option, I'm shown a 'Compatibility Report', telling me to remover the installation media and restart the computer so windows could start normally but when I tried not her was fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I choose to repair this pc, I'm sent to a screen asking me to either Troubleshoot or turn off the pc.</p>
<p>In the Troubleshoot option, I'm asked to either reset the pc or go into advance options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the reset op, I can choose to keep my file or remove everything; Selecting &nbsp;keep leads to a scene telling me that the drive windows is on is lock and asks to unlock the drivery and try again. When is choose remove everything, I'm &nbsp;told unable to reset
 your PC, a required drive partition is missing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'very also tried the advance options to but so far none of them have helped.</p>
<p>😭</p>

<h2>            Cannot use windows hello on new account.</h2>
                    <p>I recently deleted an account off of my computer, and then downloaded the account again. When I had the account on the pc the first time, I was using Windows Hello to sign in. I didn't delete my face before I removed the account, so now whenever I go to
 set up face recognition on my new version of that account, I get an error telling me that another account is already using windows hello, and now that the old version of the account does not exist, I cannot delete the face.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway to fix this? I've tried everything I can but I don't know how to fix it.</p>

            Hi Jonathan.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Test your RAM overnight to stress it with a more reliable bootable test, following these steps which test both the sticks and the slots:  <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram-test-memtest86.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/105647-ram...</a>
<br />
<br />Test the hard drive with diagnostics:  <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testin...</a>.  Best is Seatools bootable Long Test which works on all models: <a href="http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seatools-off-of-a-usb-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seat...</a>.
<br />
<br />Follow that up with a full Disk Check, from the Command Prompt if necessary:   <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-drive-fix-failures-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/check-hard-dri...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />If you recently upgraded to a new version of Windows 10, there might be a compatibility issue.
<br />
<br />As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore. Recommendations include, rollback, block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC. 
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

<h2>            Unable to sign in on Minecraft for iPad</h2>
                    <p>I was trying to login to my Xbox account on my iPad in Minecraft&nbsp;but everytime the green part of signing in after I have entered the correct credentials (Xbox-like UI), it instantly says that something went wrong. I gave it another many tried but it still keeps me from logging in but when I logged into my Android phone, it works normally. I was able to sign in on my phone but not on iPad.</p>

            Hi David
<br />
<br />The minidump files indicate your Nvidia graphics card device driver as the root cause of your system crashes. Perhaps an older version of that driver may be more compatible with your system . . 
<br />
<br />Go to the support page for your device on the manufacturers website, then download and install the video driver they recommend, it may well be an older version to the one you are currently running

            Hi David,
<br />
<br />
<br />*** WARNING: Unable to verify timestamp for nvlddmkm.sys
<br />*** ERROR: Module load completed but symbols could not be loaded for nvlddmkm.sys
<br />
<br />
<br />Rolling back to the older driver should resolve this as certain drivers are incompatible.
<br />
<br />Please see the below options:
<br />
<br />Option 1.Try Rolling back if you have an option:
<br />Go to Device Manager by typing in Devmgmt.msc in Run dialog box. 
<br />Navigate to Display devices and right click ATI Radeon HD or Similar device you have. Choose Properties. 
<br />On the Driver tab, hit rollback Driver to go back to the previous version. 
<br />
<br />Option 2. Remove drivers completely and Install the the newest ones available from the OEM or the maker.
<br />What you need to do:
<br />1. Uninstall everything of Display driver using DDU
<br /><a href="http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-driver-uninstaller-download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.guru3d.com/files-details/display-dri...</a>
<br />2. Reboot.
<br />3. Make sure your device manager shows Microsoft Basic Display adapter.
<br />4. Download the driver from the OEM or the maker like AMD
<br />5.Run the Setup and you should be good to go.

            Should do, If you can. It eliminates all possibilities of a driver fault.

<p><span>I performed a normal boot after disabling unnecessary start up items in MSCONFIG and immediately after booting, I checked the task manager and it showed the following:</span></p>
<p><span>CPU usage: 6%, Memory Graph: 1.28GB, Physical Memory Usage History flat at 1.28GB, Physical Memory (MB)&nbsp;Total: 5116, Cached: 1015 and Free: 3106.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Safe Mode was as follows:</span></p>
<p><span>CPU usage: 4%, Memory Graph: 507MB, Physical Memory Usage History flat at 500MB, Physical Memory (MB)&nbsp;Total: 5116, Cached:&nbsp;207 and Free: 4494.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After going into MSCONFIG, I hid all Microsoft Services except the Services for the Intel Storage Matrix Manage, my Aunt-Virus and display adapters I rebooted and checked the Task
 manager and here's the following under the performance </span></p>
<p><span>CPU usage: 8%, Memory Graph: 1.29 GB, Physical Memory Usage History flat at 1.29GB, Physical Memory (MB)&nbsp;Total: 5116, Cached:&nbsp;1679 and Free: 2446.</span></p>
<p><span>It seems that I get the best Memory Management when I have all my service running.<span>&nbsp;</span>Is it normal for windows to cache all the memory in the Physical Memory
 (MB) section of the Task Manager?<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>With the system running idle I am ok with the memory, but when I start to open applications and start working on the system, that's when I get the Yellow Triangle with the exclamation
 point icon down in the systray.<span>&nbsp; </span>Usually a reboot will clear the icon from the Systray.<span>&nbsp;</span>But after a while working, the error icon comes back.</span></p>
<p><span>Since I can't work in safe mode, i have removed a few start up items in MSCONFIG and gone back and<span>&nbsp;</span>enabling most of the services since there wasn't much of
 a difference when i disabled the services</span></p>
<p><span>It seems like I don't have problems with memory management until I start to multi-tasking, normally, i usually run iTunes, Excel, Word, Outlook and 3 tabs in one IE7 Window while
 listing items on eBay.</span></p>
<p><span>This same system when it was running a 32-bit XP PRO SP3 would only see 3.3gb of my memory, but it also never cashed more than 2GB of my RAM.&nbsp;</span><span>I
 upgraded to this&nbsp;Vista Home Premium 64bit version to gain speed and utilize more of my&nbsp;memory.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I am wondering if I should change from this Vista Home Premium 64-bit to Windows 7 Ultimate 32-bit.&nbsp; But a 32-Bit OS won't utilize more than 3.3GB of my 5GB RAM.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I am also running 3 monitors and 2 Video Cards,&nbsp; Both NVIDIA 1 Quadro NVS 285 with dual monitor support and a GeForce FX 5500 with an addtional dual monitor support.&nbsp; I have physical
 connections for 4 monitors total on this tower. </span></p>

<p>I don't think the error indication is related to memory. Is there anything in the Event Logs?</p>

<p><span>I checked all the logs,&nbsp; i get a few errors, warnings and audit failures, which are occurring at boot.&nbsp;&nbsp; But I am not getting the Yellow Triangle icon in the Systray at boot,
 it appears&nbsp; periodically during the day,&nbsp; I have to reboot to get rid of it.&nbsp; Here is a summary of my logged issues:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Security Log:&nbsp; I get 4 Audit Failures in a row during boot, the Event ID is 5038 "Code integrity determined that the image hash of a file is not valid.&nbsp; The file could be corrupt
 due to unauthorized modification or the invalid hash could indicate a potential disk device error.<br />
File Name:&nbsp;\Device\HarddiskVolume1\Windows\System32\drivers\tcpip.sys"</span></li><li><span>Application Log:<span>&nbsp;</span>1 Error During Boot; Event ID 10, "Event filter with query "SELECT * FROM __InstanceModificationEvent WITHIN 60 WHERE TargetInstance ISA
 "Win32_Processor" AND TargetInstance.LoadPercentage &gt; 99" could not be reactivated in namespace "//./root/CIMV2" because of error 0x80041003. Events cannot be delivered through this filter until the problem is corrected."</span></li><li><span><span>System Log: 1 Error at boot; Event ID 15016, "Unable to initialize the security package Kerberos for server side authentication.<span>&nbsp;</span>The data field
 contains the error number.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span></li><li><span><span>System Log: 1 Warning, the Warning icon in the Event Viewer is exactly as the icon that shows in the Systray.<span>&nbsp;</span>Event ID 4101, "Display driver
 nvlddmkm stopped responding and has successfully recovered."<span>&nbsp;</span>There are a total of 4 of these warnings; the dates and times of these warning do not correspond with the icon appearing in the Systray.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>I am getting close to formatting the drive and going back to the 32-bit Windows XP Pro or maybe try a copy of Windows 7 Professional 32-bit version.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>I am also noticing my monitor # 3 is dropping its desktop background and going black,<span>&nbsp;</span>when i open applications and drag them onto display #3, they don't
 look correct and have lines and like video static.<span>&nbsp;</span>it is a single monitor connected to the NVIDA GeForce FX 5500 with 128MB RAM.<span>&nbsp;</span>I have removed it, reinstalled it, updated the drivers,<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Maybe
 my 5GB of RAM isn't enough for this 64-bit vista,<span>&nbsp;</span>i never had this issue with less ram and a 32-bit OS...
</span></p>
<p><span><span>Does anyone have any thoughts on this issue?<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>Thanks in advance for your replies...</span></p>

<p><em>It's been a while but I have resolved the issue.&nbsp; I added a 4th Monitor and now I am using both VGA Ports on the GeForce FX5500 and the video on monitors 3 &amp; 4 is great!</em></p>
<p><em>After adding the additional monitor, the problem stopped.&nbsp; I don't get the yellow triangle icon as much.&nbsp; The only time it occurs now is when i get out of control and try running video with audio, word, excel, 10&nbsp;multi-tab IE 7 windows, Safari, iTunes

<p><em>i also started using windows sidebar with the CPU Meter which i moved from the Sidebar to my desktop and I found an Intel CPU Usage gadget that i also have open at all times.&nbsp; I am finding that under my "typical working enviroment" which runs about 40%

            The same thing occurs when I attempt to load two adobe pdf's at the same time.&nbsp; I think it has something to do with memory, and whether memory is being accessed in true 64bit mode.

            I m having the same issue. I don't have the knowledge to explain in detail as MikiJon did but I started having this issue since I converted to Window's 10 (should have stayed with Window's 8). I know for a fact is not a memory issue. I have tried some
 fixes that people post but if I stop working on my computer for a while the triangle comes back. I have to shut down my computer a couple of times for me to be able to get rid of the triangle. I m very frustrated...its very time consuming. Appreciate any feedback
 to the matter.

            <p>For me this problem was caused by the Driver Booster 2 program.&nbsp; It occurs mainly when you have more</p>
<p>than one version of Driver Booster 2 installed.&nbsp; When you do an initial scan for outdated drivers, Driver</p>
<p>Booster 2 marks your outdated drivers with exclamation points.&nbsp; It may also change the program shortcut</p>
<p>on the desktop to include an exclamation point.&nbsp; The way to remove it is to do scans with all of the installed</p>
<p>versions of the program and update the drivers.&nbsp; Otherwise, the programs should be uninstalled.</p>
<p>Either way the exclamation point will go away after the scans have been updated with all installed versions</p>
<p>or the programs have been uninstalled.&nbsp; This triangle is caused specifically by the Driver Booster 2 program</p>
<p>and has nothing to do with the Windows operating system itself.</p>

<h2>            Thanks for stopping by to chat&#33; Thank you for contacting Xbox Customer Support and for being a valued member of the Xbox Community. I hope you have a great day&#33; &#40;what a lie&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Below is two out of three transcripts. showing just what kind of top notch quality service that is provided to consumers of microsoft xbox. Apparently there is no repercussions for what a representative says. I am posting this so that others may see it and
 think twice before trusting the support group provided by microsoft. there are minor edits only to block email address and an expletive.
<br />
<br />
I understand the spelling punctuation and things of that nature are far from perfect and trolls may feed on that if they want. They may also pick about other aspects of what is going on in however. if you look at the transcripts and the quality of service provided
 you will see the real issue. &nbsp;</p>

<p>One would think everything is good and set to go. However I never received my what i was told id receive. on 12/12 I contact support again. After speaking with me we left off with the idea that they would look into the issue and ensure that its followed
 up on.. never happened. I failed to enable to transcript mode on that chat thinking i could do so after it was over. i was wrong. you must do so before you end the conversation or you are sol.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Andy quickly cut off the chat at the point. I wish i had the missing transcript. the one that backs up even more proof that the original transcript is still in the system the rep at that point referenced. &nbsp;Someone somewhere needs to be held accountable.
 I can just imagine what other kind of shady tactics have been used on others. Even if I never receive the agreed upon service I hope that these transcripts will help others in seeing just what kind of company they are paying into.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">Argontheos: Yeah, you see, we avoided all that because I'm not gonna read through reams of old customer service chats at your behest. But anyway... If you could give me the name of the CS agent who promised you the Live extension
 we can get on that and ensure he understands that that isn't our policy.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 102, 255, 1)">Trippen: But he offered it so you're liable and you have to give me it.</span></p>

 can however offer you a month of Live. How's that sound me old mucker?</span></p>

<p><br />
Just FYI though. Did you try keeping the sticks on your Elite controllers centred [centered] as you powered up you Hex Box? If a stick is off-centre when you power up, that can becomes the default position and cause drift. D'ya try that? Did ya? If that doesn't
 work I can offer you a lifetime of Gold. Least I can do. Sending it to you now. *shifty eyes*</p>

<p>The bit I have read (as I am always curious with complaints like this, because when I contact them they are always very good), it shows good customer support, they have offer you what the company says it offers in all its documentation and has done it well,
 and you got a replacement.</p>
<p>I am not sure how they haven't done their job well?</p>

<p>Clearly there was no personal information that needed to be removed. &nbsp;Other then where the reps clearly offered something stated they had sent something and never did. &nbsp;I guess Microsoft covers its rear on all areas. can't even show other consumers just
 how bad there service truely is. </p>

<p>I'm sure the guy just told you what you wanted to hear so he could "pass the buck" onto the next guy. Sad, but that's how Xbox support generally works. Once they run out of answers, they'll tell you what you want to hear or make up whatever they think might
 get you to go away. It's a tactic they've used for many years.</p>

<p>Hello galo2171,</p>
<p>Please see the <a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7programs/thread/b94cbe1a-ec08-47b1-92c3-f34956620eb0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
post listed here</a> as they essentially have the same question. A 64-bit program should not be installed in the C:\Program Files (x86) as that is only for 32-bit programs. If you have C:\Program Files(x86) and C:\Program Files, then you have a 64-bit computer.&nbsp;
 A 32-bit computer will only show <br />
C:\Program Files.</p>
<p>So the "not allowed in the C:\Program Files (X86) is not an error.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you are having problems installing AutoCad 2011, then please post the the AutoCad Forums. I have included a<a href="http://forums.autodesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link here</a>.</p>
<p>Hope this helps to answer your questions.</p>
