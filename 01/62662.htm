    <title>Audio Volume constantly lowering - Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Audio Volume constantly lowering - Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>As stated in the title, the volume on my Dell Inspiron laptop is in a constant state of lowering. I run on windows 10, my audio drivers are up to date,</p>
<p>and my function keys are disabled. I've also tried uninstalling and reinstalling the drivers, and changing over to windows' default audio drivers with no luck. I'm able to increase the volume, but it lowers back down to zero as soon as I let go of the volume
 button.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Besides the obvious irritation of not being able to get audio out of my laptop, I also have the volume slider stuck in the top left of my screen. It never goes away. I primarily use my laptop for video editing, so you can imagine it's frustrating to have
 no audio, and have a portion of the screen permanently obscured. I've been searching for a week and have yet to find a working solution to my problem. I'm beginning to suspect a hardware issue, but i'm hoping someone out there knows what's going on so that
 I don't have to get it repaired.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for any help answering my question!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue can be related to system sound auto-leveling problem and corrupted system files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes, Windows will automatically adjust the volume if it believes that it has detected some "communication activity". To isolate this issue, try the following steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click on the sound/speaker icon in the taskbar.</li><li>Select <strong>Playback devices</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Communications</strong> tab.</li><li>Select <strong>Do Nothing</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Apply</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We also recommend running the<strong> </strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>System File Checker tool</strong></a>

The scroll wheel on my mouse very easily triggers a back function in any internet browser as well as in windows folders. &nbsp;It is a nightmare. &nbsp;In windows 10, it seems I cannot even disable the vertical (or horizontal) functions of the scroll wheel. &nbsp; Does anyone
 know how to adjust this setting? &nbsp;The # of lines that scroll can be adjusted, but this has no relevance, as soon as you do a '`quick' or `significantly large' scroll the mouse triggers the back function of whatever you are working on and jumps back to the
 previous windows folder or website or email, etc that you were looking at. &nbsp;It is extremely frustrating. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to clarify, what can you see under <strong>Roll the mouse wheel to scroll</strong>? Is it One screen at a time option? If yes, try selecting Multiple lines at a time and see if it makes any difference. See the image below:</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi, thanks for your response.&nbsp;<br />
Yes, I have tried both options in great detail. &nbsp;The settings do indeed change the scrolling ability, but have no implication on the 'back' clicking when you make a large scroll, or click the scroll wheel itself. &nbsp;In my older computers and mice - clicking on
 the scroll wheel triggers a scroll-lock option or a magnifying glass option. &nbsp;On my new computer/mouse it triggers a 'back' click.... which really causes problems when filling in internet form fields, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks again for any advice</p>

<h2>            Windows phone not recognized by my Windows 10 pc</h2>
                    <p>I'm writing because for some reason my pc (Windows 10) doesn't recognize anymore my Windows Phone (Lumia 630 with Windows 8.1).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already tried everything that is suggested here:&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2749484</p>
<p>I had no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While following the instructions in that link for updating the drivers (section 4 at that link) I noticed what I think is an anomaly in the Device Manager. My phone is listed both under the portable devices (with the
<span>yellow exclamation mark</span>) and the USB devices: in the latter section it is listed three times. I don't know if this is a problem, but it sounds strange to me.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a9b9d287-977c-47c5-b10a-852140234169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a9b9d287-977c-47c5-b10a-852140234169" /></a></p>

I don't know if this is a problem, but it sounds strange to me.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a9b9d287-977c-47c5-b10a-852140234169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a9b9d287-977c-47c5-b10a-852140234169" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>While trying to update the drivers (following the procedure described in the link above), if I browsed to the location&nbsp;<span>C:\Windows\Inf\ folder an error message appeared saying that the driver had been detected, but the
 INF file contained a not valid section relating to the installation of a service (I'm not sure if this is correct, I'm translating right now from Italian).</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/49acab25-2076-4209-820e-22e617b041f0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/49acab25-2076-4209-820e-22e617b041f0" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since this didn't work, I tried to&nbsp;</span><span>manually download and install the Windows Phone driver. Again no luck: after downloading the file and extracting it to desktop, I repeated
 the procedure to update the drivers specifying desktop instead of&nbsp;</span><span>C:\Windows\Inf\ folder and another error message appeared, saying that it was impossible to find the software driver for the device.</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/751b592b-bfea-4cf2-911b-411d4cdd38cd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/751b592b-bfea-4cf2-911b-411d4cdd38cd" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now I really don't know what to do anymore.&nbsp;</span><span>Has anyone something else to suggest?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you in advance for your answers,</span></p>
<p><span>Sara</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>P.S. I edited the post adding screenshots of what I found strange and of the error messages for clarity.</span></p>

                    <p>I have tried to load my program Phoenix R.C. by Horizon [a flight simulator program] and it will not run. I have heard that there may be an issue with Directx 9 [included with the program] and Directx 11 on windows 10. Is there anyway around this, I have
 also tried to get it to run in compatibility mode but this does not work either. The only other thing to do is partition the drive and load windows 7 so I can run this and other programs that fall fowl with windows 10. Is there such thing as a patch for this
 issue????</p>

            Hi Bob,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Welcome to Microsoft community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>We understand that, you are unable to play Phoenix R.C.[a flight simulator program]&nbsp; game installed on your system. We&nbsp;will assist you to fix the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Before we proceed, I need more information to help you better.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. What is the version of Phoenix R.C. game installed on your system?&nbsp;</div>
<div>2. Do you get any error code or error message, while opening or playing Phoenix R.C. game on your system?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
I like to inform you that, Windows 10 supports Direct X 12 version.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>To check which version of Direct X is installed on the computer,&nbsp;let's follow the steps given below.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Press Windows +R keys on the keyboard.</div>
<div><br />
2. In the Run box, type dxdiag.</div>
<div><br />
3. Press Enter.</div>
<div><br />
4. You will get the version of Direct X in the computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Let's know if there are any patches or updates provided by the Game Developer so that you can use the program in Windows 10.</div>
<div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>I like to&nbsp;inform you&nbsp;to update the display drivers&nbsp;and check if you are able to use the program as outdated display drivers&nbsp;also results in DirectX not working as it should be.
</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You may update the Display adaptor drivers&nbsp;from Device Manager manually and check, if this helps.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">1. Press (Windows key + X key) and click on “Device Manager”.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">2. Expand “Display adaptor”.</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">3. Right click on the display adaptor driver and select “Update Driver Software”. Once this is done, restart the computer and check, if it works.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Also I&nbsp;suggest&nbsp;you to check with the game&nbsp;developer if this game indeed works with Windows 10 and DirectX 12.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope the above information helps. Reply with necessary information and the result to help you further.</div>

    <title>System time always drops back 2 hours - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peter&#38;gabi  say:</h3>
<h2>            System time always drops back 2 hours</h2>
                    <p>I have seen several users have time changing or corruption issues but my problem adds another 'weird' happening to them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife uses Windows 10 on a ThinkPad T420. Even after repeatedly setting the correct time (date, time-zone and time-server settings remain unchanged and set correctly) a few days later the displayed time always drops back&nbsp; 'exactly' two hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is some more appropriate information: My wife uses German Windows 10 (she is German and we live in Germany) and she has always had this time problem even some years ago when she was using German Windows XP Home Edition running in a dual-core desktop
 PC. I upgraded her machine to a Dell Inspiron laptop freshly installing her XP Home OS and moving all her data across to it. Exactly the same time problem appeared. The ThinkPad T420 is her latest hardware which came with Windows 7 and was upgraded to Windows
 10. The same time problem remains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the next strange behaviour: I still have my old Windows XP Professional (English) on a four-core desktop PC. I also have Windows XP Professional (English) on an old Lenovo N3000 laptop. Neither have ever had any time changing problems. However, impressed
 with the wife's T420, I also bought one and it came with German Windows 7 which was also upgraded to Windows 10. This too has the same time changing problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a Linux user and on all of my hardware (therefore multi-OS) under Linux or Windows I have never had any time changing problems. It seems that if the Windows is a German problem then the time is puched back two hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked all timer and time-server settings being the same used on my English Windows XP systems. I have followed an article regarding recommended Min-/Max- Pos-/Neg- offset settings in the registry for WTime32 config values. I discovered an article
 suggesting a BIOS update had repaired someone's dissimilar time problem. I have just applied an update for our T420s BIOS (ver. 1.46 raised to 1.48). Bear in mind the older XP hardware would have been completely different.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone any ideas as this is driving me nuts!</p>

            <p>Hi Meghana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for your quick response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am logging in via my Microsoft [live] account. It is my first time using a Microsoft account and using this forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try switching to manual but I would like to wait a couple of days before checking Windows time as I have only just updated the BIOS as a possible remedy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing I have not yet determined is if the BIOS time is changed too. I will note BIOS time first before booting into Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I do correct the Windows time I do this in my administrator account and then via the time-date settings available under the control panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not expecting any change to the problem from the BIOS update and a pattern appears to be that the Windows left totally shut down for a few days. This seems to be the case for both my wife's and my hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I largely use Linux (Ubuntu) in between the rare occasions when I would need Windows. Whether I use Linux or not in the meantime appears to have no effect on the Windows time problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Get back to you again soon.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today (15th Aug), I booted my T420 into Windows 10 but before doing so I checked the BIOS time. The BIOS time had again fallen back exactly 2 hours. Without making any change to the BIOS I re-booted to bring up Windows 10. Its system time was 2 hours behind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is multi-OS (Linux/Windows) using Grub2 as the boot manager. Grub2 had shown the correct local time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I selected new start under Windows 10 without making time changes and re-booted. The BIOS time still showed 2 hours behind.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I restarted again from within the BIOS by selecting 'discard changes' (therefore not by powering of then on) and booted into Linux (default under Grub2 for my machine). Linux showed the correct local time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I chose re-start under Linux and checked BIOS time and it was still left at 2 hours behind. I presume Linux therefore does not alter the BIOS time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I may answer here to Lihitha's reply about BIOS settings:</p>
<p>
</p><p>My ThinkPad T420 BIOS is UEFI BIOS 83ET78WW (1.48) of date 2016-01-21 and which I had updated just 5 days ago. This update has no effect on the time changing problem.</p>
<p>The BIOS Date-Time settings has its 'own tab' in the BIOS settings and offers adjustment to time and date only. No other options or features appear available with anything to do with time settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From my experience with Windows and Linux, the former also sets the BIOS time and date when timer settings under Windows are made and under Linux perhaps no changes to the BIOS time and date settings are made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please consider that this strange time-change behaviour has occurred with three entirely different hardware platforms: a 'hybrid' (self-built desktop running Windows Home XP; a Dell Inspiron laptop running German Windows XP and an IBM ThinkPad T420 laptop
 running German Windows 10 (upgraded from Windows 7). All had an entirely different BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In further reply to Meghana's suggestion:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that it is established that the BIOS update has made no effect I can now set the Windows time-setting to 'manual' as requested. Tie will then be checked again but in some days time.</p>
<p>(PS. I am assuming 'manual' means disable (uncheck) the 'sync with time-server' box?)</p>
<p>I will report on the 'manual test' in a few days time!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am astonished that having had the machine of for a few days and before booting the OS the BIOS time when checked shows 2 hours back - how??? Have all three entirely different platforms had the 'same' fault across the three different BIOSs??? Crazy!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks for everyone's patience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Peter</p>

            <p>Hi Meghana,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In reply to point 2 your post August 11, 2016: All our devices using Windows were enabled to automatically synchronise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per your suggestion I disabled the auto-sync setting of time on my ThinkPad T420 but after forcing a synchronisation to ensure the correct time (local for me is time-zone Berlin, GMT+1) After a few days I checked the time. On checking BIOS time first
 (before booting any OS) it had again become exactly 2 hours behind. On re-booting into German Windows 10 the time was the same as per the BIOS time. The 'manual' (non-sync) time setting remained in force.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot explain why the BIOS time should change (without booting into Windows??) but up until now I had believed this time-change behaviour was not appearing on my old English Windows XP desktop system. However, the other day when booting up the Windows
 XP system and automatically logging into my own admin' account I just managed to see the time leap up by 2 hours I guess due to the time auto-sync. Given previous experience on my wife's previous German Windows XP Home systems and her current Windows 10 laptop
 my immediate thought is the German Windows is not actually performing time auto-sync when set to do so(?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact that I might now have had three entirely different hardware platforms running mixed language and versions of Windows that seem to have their BIOS times turned back 2 hours apparently even when they are turned off (powered down) is utterly puzzling!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>All these system connect via LAN cable either directly to the router-modem or via a switcher. I will disconnect the LAN cable to my T420 and see what happens to the BIOS time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Peter</p>

            <p>Sorry for my delayed update - it's summer time and that means holidays, travel, visiting families etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay, after searching around the web on similar problems I have reached the conclusion that by having a dual-boot (Linux and Windows) system then one meets the different ways in how BIOS time is managed. Windows uses BIOS time to hold 'local' time (UTC+offset+daylight
 savings according to the time zone used) and Linux uses BIOS time to hold Universal Time (UTC).This for me explains why I get this exact 2-hour difference which will no doubt become 1-hour when clocks move back again in October.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My wife's PC is purely a Windows 10 machine but I do sometimes use to boot up from a Linux external drive. This must be the explanation of 'why' she suffers from time to time with this '2-hour' shift!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following various arguments and suggestions elsewhere on the internet I modified Windows 10 Registry to tell Windows to use BIOS time for Universal Time. (Danger: an installed Windows OS can be catastrophically made inoperable if specific content in its
 registry is wrongly modified in any way).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can now run one OS then re-boot into the other and irrespective of the boot-up order both OSs now show the same 'local time' (both being set of course to the same time zone/location/daylight savings info etc.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that both our both German Windows 10 for some reason were not and possibly never were (even before the above said registry mod) auto synchronising! Yet my two English XP systems do?? This, I guess, was why I momentarily observed my desktop XP quickly
 changing from 2-hours behind to correct local time because autsync had correct it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some people elsewhere have also had problems with time-synchronising not running so I followed a suggestion to add a scheduled task (only applied to our German Windows 10 systems) that calls an time-autosync at start-up. These machines now behave like my
 English XP boxes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As my time difference problem is resolved I would like to consider this thread as solved but remain open to receiving any further posts for a short term.</p>

<p>Subscriptions automatically renew as long as the payment method is valid/billable and the subscription/service is still offered. I have had several subscriptions automatically renew for over a decade. The only time, it did not one year,&nbsp; is when I forgot
 to update my credit card. Some grandfathered subscriptions or services over time are terminated, due to the service being no longer offered or an equivalent/current subscription needing to be repurchased. If you require a receipt or invoice, you can follow
 the guidance in this and connected FAQs:</p>

                    <p>Original Title: I can see files on my camera but cannot transfer them to desktop</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>recently bought PC with windows 8. before that had windows XP and was able to transfer pictures without problems. Now when I plug camera, I can see camera registering on my computer and even see the folders and pictures in the camera but when I try too copy
 those pictures to my desktop I get message that "device is not functioning', which does not seem to be true as I can see the files in the camera through my PC windows explorer. I tried to grab and move pictures to desktop; tried copy/paste of pix and entire
 folder etc but to no avail. Please advise. Thanks. </p>

            Using Windows 10&nbsp;Operating System I am unable to transfer pictures from my Sony Camera DSC-W800 to my PC. I had no difficulty with Windows 7. I suspect there is a glitch in Windows 10 that is causing my problem. Help!! David Pace

Hi, Rumail <br />
The Windows Vista system icons are stored in 'C:\Windows\system32\imageres.dll'. HOWEVER, since they are stored in a .dll file you cannot access them except through the programs they were made for.(in other words, you can't copy them)

<p>I then rerun the windows 10 setup from the USB stick.</p>

            Hi gdfarkas, I am Rob a volunteer and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. 
<br />
<br />Does seem that update is causing issues for some, had the problem on one computer here.
<br />
<br />1709 the Fall Creators Update is now the latest version.
<br />
<br />You can try to get the update to load with A. use Windows Update or use the B.. "Even better methods" or C. "Best methods" below (which is what I would do). 
<br />
<br />A. Try to use Windows Update
<br />
<br />1. What I would first do is update the BIOS and chipset drivers at the System/Motherboard Maker's site. 
<br />
<br />2. Uninstall ALL 3rd party antivirus/security programs and then run its maker's removal tool to prevent trouble causing remnants. Use Windows Defender which in Windows 10 is a full antivirus.
<br />
<br />List of anti-malware program cleanup/uninstall tools
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/wiki/mse-protect_start/list-of-anti-malware-product-removal-tools/2bcb53f7-7ab4-4ef9-ab3a-6aebfa322f75">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/protect/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Uninstallers (removal tools) for common antivirus software 
<br /><a href="http://kb.eset.com/esetkb/index?page=content&amp;id=SOLN146" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://kb.eset.com/esetkb/index?page=content&amp;am...</a> 
<br />
<br />3. Reduce the system down to as simple as possible by removing all the unnecessary devices possible such as USB drives.
<br />
<br />4. Uninstall any 3rd party programs Windows suggests.
<br />
<br />Now try updating again.
<br />
<br />-----
<br />
<br />B. Even better methods : (please do 1 - 4 above first) :
<br />
<br />Be sure to have updated the BIOS as indicated above.
<br />
<br />Or use the MCT to update to Windows 10 1709.
<br />
<br />MCT - Update now
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />-----
<br />
<br />C. Or best method would be to do a Clean Install of 1709 to start with a Clean Slate. You should still first update the BIOS. 
<br />
<br />If you do a Clean Install then it would be activated with the Digital Entitlement.

            There are reports of the patch saying its failed, but its actually installed.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: appwiz.cpl
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click View installed updates
<br />
<br />See if KB4056892 is installed or not. 
<br />
<br />You can try installing it manually if its not installed.

<br />
<br />If you still experience problems installing it.
<br />
<br />
<br />I recommend you block it until the next cumulative update is released. Many are reporting the same problem too and it looks like this update is buggy.
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>

<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes.
<br />
<br />If your system fails to boot after installation of KB4056892
<br />
<br />
<br />Only antiviruses that have specific REGKEY settings are eligible for this update. "If you have not been offered the security update, you may be using incompatible antivirus software and need to follow up with your software vendor," said the Redmond firm. "Microsoft has been working closely with antivirus partners to ensure that all customers receive January's Windows security updates as soon as possible. "

<p>As I said, a MS chat session (that took about two hours plus another few after the support person left) reinstalled the 1709 version (less this update). Did not help. I think MS should fix this "fix" for the much-publicized CPU problem and should not release
 a half-baked fix that seems not to work for so many.</p>

            Yes, I totally agree it is too complex a process though as volunteers all we can do is try to use the methods available to us to help you correct the problems the update process causes.
<br />
<br />So they re-installed you back to Windows 1703?  Check by Start - Settings - System - About - Windows Specifications?
<br />
<br />If so then they are saying your computer will not likely run 1709 at this time (probably incompatibility issues).
<br />
<br />You can Hide the update :

<h2>            Licence Rights and transferring from device to device</h2>
                    As already known in windows 7 that the retail licence can be transferred to any device but the OEM licence is not transferable. So, my question is that,<strong>
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">is it same for windows 10 also that OEM licence cannot be transferred to other devices or after device upgrades (motherboard change, etc) and also about the retail version of windows 10</span>?</strong>&nbsp;<em><strong>And
 Please confirm the licencing rights and transferring of licences after free upgrade from windows 10 and also after buying retail windows 10.</strong></em>&nbsp;

            <p>Hi William,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the description, it appears that you would like to create a shortcut of the webcam installed on the computer. I will be happy to help you with this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) What is the make and model of the laptop?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you upgraded to Windows 7 Pro, the desktop shortcut might be deleted. So, I would suggest you to follow the steps to create a desktop shortcut of webcam and check.</p>
<p>a) Click on <strong>Start</strong> and select <strong>All Programs.</strong></p>
<p>b) Check for the <strong>webcam</strong> software, right click and select <strong>
Send to Desktop.</strong></p>
<p>c) Check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I hope it helps. If you have any issues regarding Windows in future please let us know. We will be happy to help you.</span></p>

    <title>How can I get windows 7 to recognize partitions on my SD cards&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kii masaki  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I get windows 7 to recognize partitions on my SD cards&#63;</h2>
                    I have an SD that that I used between a Macbook at work and my PC that I prefer to use at home.&nbsp; The SD card is in 3 partitions, but only 1 of the 3 are recognized by my Windows 7 64bit Ultimate OS.&nbsp; The Disk Management does "see" the other 2 but does
 not assign a drive letter to them and hence I cannot access the files in them.&nbsp; When right clicking the other 2 partitions the options Open, Explore, Mark Partition as Active, Extend Volume, Shrink Volume, Add Mirror are Delete Volume are all greyed out.&nbsp;
 Attempting to Format the partitions that I cannot access gives an error "An unexpected error has occurred....."<br />
<br />
Things I have tried:&nbsp; Note when applicable, all are run as admin<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; Going into Disk Management to assign a drive letter does not work.&nbsp; I get the "The operation failed to complete because the Disk Management console view is not up-to-date........"<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; Going to device manager and removing the drivers, and plugging the SD card back in and selecting scan for new hardware.&nbsp; Drivers got reinstalled but only one partition is still available.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; Going to device manager, View and selecting Show Hidden Devices.&nbsp; Nothing was considered unknown but rather Generic Volumes x5.&nbsp; Only the first partition device was listed under Portable Devices.<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp; Typing Diskpart in command prompt, typing Select Volume and unfortunately that's where I stop because the other partitions are not listed.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
5.&nbsp; Restarting the comp and praying..<br />
<br />
Any help on getting the other partitions to show would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; Hopefully this is in the right section.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hey Kii,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This usually happens because the computer created a new volume, but due to some issues, all the appropriate registry entries for the newly created volume device are not successfully written to disk.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have seen some posts where people says that&nbsp;this issue can be resolved by uninstalling the drivers for this device completely from the device manager and then reinstalling it again and then you will be able to delete and create a new partition and will
 be able to assign the letter to it..</p>

            Greetings TriHund<br />
<br />
I've read it as well and that was the second thing I did as listed above on things I have tried (#2).&nbsp; Did Both disabling and re-enabling drivers as well as completely removing them and having windows reinstall it after I plug the SD card back in.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thanks though.<br />

<p><span>Hi Gabrielle,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Recent changes in the network settings of a <strong>HomeGroup</strong> may affect the connection of a device like a network printer. Those examples of changes are: If you are not aware of the recent changes in passwords, changes in the limitation in
 the total number of computers in a group, or if there is new restriction made on the network.
</span></p>
<p>

 how you can setup this network printer again.</span></p>

<p>Hi Johann Eva,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your reply but it didnt help my situation! I am pulling my hair out trying to sort this out its taking far too long and have never had these problems in the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe I shoud delete the printer again (I do not have install disk) and reinstall it and the driver from HP again! It is just showing the printer offline and unavailable ........</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other suggestions would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<h2>            Problem Changing Desktop Background with Server 2003 gpedit.msc</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I have a small network of computers in which I want to apply a group policy to change their current background.</p>
<p>&nbsp;however after following tips from previous questions and sites etc I have found no correct solution from certain policies not appearing such as /Administrative Templates/ Desktop,</p>
<p>I'm not familiar with networking having only ever dealt with wireless networking on small networks with no admin setting policies so laymens terms would be helpful - Thanks</p>

    <title>Windows 10&#58; Night light toggled on anytime a Microsoft application - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joshpettway  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10&#58; Night light toggled on anytime a Microsoft application is launched.</h2>
                    <p>Currently, I have the Night light feature turned off. The schedule is also set to the "Off" position. Whenever I launch a Microsoft application such as Notepad, Word, Excel, Outlook etc., the Night light feature engages. This can be fixed by:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Closing the application.</p>
<p>2. Opening "Night light settings" and toggling the "Turn on now" button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some notes about option 2:</p>
<p>
</p><p>When opening&nbsp;<span>"Night light settings", the setting will still show the feature as "off" with the "Turn on now" button. Clicking this button the turn it on actually turns it off.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If option 2 is used and the system locks the screen, returning to the desktop will engage the Night light again necessitating the toggle to be flipped.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>No other applications cause this issue.</span></p>

            Hi JOSHPETTWAY<br /> This maybe an issue with a system file being corrupt.<br />You can try a couple things.<br /><br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.<br />In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter.<br />Restart the computer.<br /><br />If that doesn't work then try this, <br /><br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.<br /><br />In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. <br />Press Enter key after each command:<br /><br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth<br /><br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth<br /><br />Important: When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.<br />To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter. <br />Restart your computer.

<div>Both downloads failed everytime I attempted to add these drivers over the past week. A total of over twelve [12] times now!</div>
<div>So you can see it is getting beyond the joke, as it were.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried <u><i><b>ALL</b></i></u> the suggestions on the forums as well as using a variety of M/soft Fixit tool suggestions via searches for similar issues that other people are having, as well as using links to hotfixes to attempt to resolve any/all
 issues surrounding the windows update issue as well as the driver issues.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><u><i><b>ALL</b></i></u> efforts have failed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've even been on the phone to a Microsoft approved phone assistance/help website and had an online engineer &nbsp;attempting to resolve my issue surrounding the driver issue - no luck there either as they couldn't even fix it. So short of going direct to M/soft
 and paying for an online engineer to resolve this issue I can't see what I can do.&nbsp;</div>
<div>From what I understand there is an issue with the Windows Update centre and it appears to be "failing" as it were and all efforts to download the drivers fail.</div>
<div>I've even been out and bought a brand new gaming controller that has the drivers on a disc and they will not load either and they will not load from the website as well as any installation fails each time I attempt it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried system restore points.. only so many on a brand new PC and now due to the amount of installations attempted each time I download/install these drivers. Restore points get erased/removed and the issue still remains. Unable to install the required
 drivers.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The company that built the PC for me <i><u><b>will only resolve HARDWARE issues</b></u></i> under the warranty agreement and will not have anything to do with Windows related issues as that is outside their remit.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Below are the issues that have dogged me todate.</div>
