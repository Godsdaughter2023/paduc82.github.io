<h2>            BSOD &#34;Unmountable boot volume&#34; and can&#39;t boot to the bootable USB</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><em>note: this is a content copy from my post in other forum site.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">So I receive an update for "Windows 10 Creators" before doing the update I decided to create a recovery disc to a USB but only to find out I can't create one with error "Missing important files" so I
 googled and found a thread that suggest a steps... one of the step is to supply a command (in administrator level) a "reagentc /disable" this freezed my laptop and then windows crashes and restart. During the restart just after the Asus loading logo the BSOD
 with "unmountable boot volume" error code occurred I tried many restarts but same error being display.&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">With the "unmountable boot volume" error, I googled and found that I have to use a bootable USB to fix it (I don't have installation CD when I bought the laptop). I grabbed other laptop (with windows 10
 installed) and create a windows 10 bootable in USB. Go back to my damaged laptop I changed the boot sequence to boot in my USB but after the Asus loading logo the screen goes black and stuck there the installation which usually popups didn't displayed. I tried
 on the other laptop where I created the bootable USB to check if the USB is damaged but to my surprise the bootable USB actually works on the other laptop no black screen displayed.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I created the Windows 10 bootable USB using Rufus, then when the black screen is being displayed I tried to create again with the Windows Media Creation Tool which also display black screen.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">At this point I'm not sure what to do to fix this... any idea is appreciated...</span></p>

<p>Hi Jomel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the suggested solutions in the link instructing me to use a media installation which I can't because when I boot to the installation media (USB) it only display black/blank screen and nothing else. No cursor or windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I tried to download an Ubunto image and create a bootable USB from it. plugged it to my unfunctional laptop and boot into it. It works fine the Ubunto installation is displayed as it should be. So I'm not sure why the windows 10 installation on my bootable
 USB won't works?</p>

<p>Hi Jomel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes I did read the second link, the instructions there assume that I can sign-in into the windows which I can't because I have a "Unmountable boot volume".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's what I did so far:</p>
<ol>
<li>I did tried 3 different brand of USB devices and 1 of these USB devices is new.
<strong>All didn't work</strong>&nbsp;</li><li>I tried using a Windows 8 ISO in one of the USB devices <strong>same result a black screen no "Installation Setup" occurred</strong></li><li>I tried connecting to external monitor as some threads says that windows sometimes thinks I have multiple screen but the external monitor says "No Signal" when I boot to
<strong>ANY</strong> <strong>Windows Installation Media</strong>&nbsp;and the built-in monitor still show a black screen.</li><li>I tried removing my 2nd RAM chip (I can't remove the 1st chip as it's built-in) and boot to any Windows 10, 8 installation but same result black screen</li><li>As suggested by others, I tried <em>force shutdown</em>&nbsp;when the loading screen occurs during boot but still no good result</li><li>I tried with Ubuntu installation media and the installation setup for ubuntu displayed. This means other OS other than Windows works.</li><li>No, I didn't tried on windows 7 as I need a license key to download an legal ISO</li><li>I went to repair shop and they suggested to wipe out my HD and try to install a new Windows. The problem with this is I have to pay for the new OS that they will install which I can't afford for now. My OLD OS came with the laptop which is legit and has
 license key which I don't have a copy.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe I'll install Ubuntu for now until I can buy a new Windows license key. Or is there a way to acquire the license/activation key of my old OS?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is normal to have a Black Screen for awhile when booting Installation Media on a Flash Drive... or even a DVD... But that doesn't mean your's is working properly though..</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason your Flash Drives may not be working is the way they were created...</p>
<p>
</p><p>For Instance... If your machine is using Legacy Bios the Flash Drive needs to be Formatted as NTFS...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your machine is using UEFI Bios the Flash Drive needs to be Initialized as a GPT drive, and Formatted FAT32...
</p>
<p>If you don't have the right combination, either nothing happens or you get an error about having the wrong type of HDD...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also need to select the Flash Drive as a boot device properly...</p>
<p>If your machine uses UEFI Bios the Flash Drive will appear in Boot Options twice...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once as a "USB Flash Drive", and again as a "UEFI USB Flash Drive"...</p>

<p>Hi Slance,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I created the Flash Drives using Windows 10 ( also tried 8) Media Creation Tool and application called Rufus (seems popular).</p>
<p>I have UEFI BIOS so my Flash Drives are formatted in FAT32 (I know that because if my flash drives are in NTFS it won't be detected by the BIOS, it won't show up in the boot selection. So I always see to it that it's FAT32).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed the boot order in the BIOS to make the USB as the "first" option - didn't work</p>
<p>I did tried to boot in the USB by selecting manually when I turned on the laptop. - didn't work as well</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried leaving the laptop overnight (approximately 6-8hrs) on the "Black Screen" and nothing appears or changed when I check the next morning. Is that normal? I'm sure its not. I have experience installing different OS (including windows) in numbers of
 PC/laptop before and all won't take 6-8hrs to setup.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess I have to give up on this and swipe out my HD as suggested by the technician and install a different OS for this laptop to be usable until I procure a new windows activation key and try to install new windows.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wouldn't replace the HDD just yet... But that is your option...</p>
<p>I'm thinking you would possibly have the same problem, but maybe not...</p>
<p>
</p><p>No... what you are describing is not the way it should work...</p>
<p>I was trying to clarify your situation a little...</p>
<p>Did your machine come with Win 10, or was it upgraded from something else...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should not need a new license... Do you ever get to the screen where it asks for one ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use RUFUS myself, and it works well... Especially the newer versions...</p>
<p>In addition to the FAT32, the flash drive needs to be a GPT type drive...</p>
<p>Rufus should indicate this in one of the dropdown menus...</p>
<p>
</p><p>My experience with Rufus is that once you have made all of your selections as to the type of drive, and then browse to the ISO you want to use... is that some of the dropdown selections change and require being reset...</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as the actual booting goes... When you select the flash drive as the boot option...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should be seeing the Flash Drive appear twice... Once as a Flash Drive, and again as a "UEFI Flash Drive"... which is what you need to select...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some machines have BIOS settings that prevent booting from a USB Flash Drive or device... One is "Secure Boot" and another is "Fast Boot"...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might try disabling them in your Bios until you get your installation to proceed..</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW... To boot from your HDD you would select "Windows Boot Manager" as the boot device... Not the actual HDD...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing I should mention... creating the media on another machine can be a problem... At least when it concerns the ISO...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The create media tool determines what is on the machine that is creating the media and uses that as default for the ISO and\or flash drive...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This may not be compatible with the machine you are trying to use it on...</p>
<p>Home or Pro... 32 or 64 bit..&nbsp;&nbsp; UEFI or Legacy Bios...</p>

<p>Hi Slance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I was hopeless and can't use my laptop so I decided to wipe out everything I don't have important files in it anyway. And install Ubuntu in my laptop. The laptop is in full ubuntu when I received your response. And you've mention I don't need new activation
 key... So thinking that I may not needed a new activation key and maybe windows can retrieve the activation key of my previous Windows I decided to try again my bootable USB which contains windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I boot to the USB the installation setup was displayed no more black screen!!! so I guess the issue is something about my HD. Then i went ahead and install windows 10 which I thought would be in trial but no screen asking for activation key so I thought
 that's good sign. When the installation is done I logged in and check my computer properties. And shocked! the windows is already activated! that mean I don't need new activation key! I don't know how but it's activated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the help and time guys!!!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you're Win 10 was preinstalled the key is stored in your Bios...</p>
<p>Win 10 then detects it during the install, or shortly after...</p>

</p><p>If you installed Win 10 yourself, or upgraded to Win 10, your activation is stored on Microsoft's servers, and will activate once it has time to check...</p>

<p>It could have been something on the HDD...</p>

    <title>How to I permanently block Windows 10 updates of all types&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elliander eldridge  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to I permanently block Windows 10 updates of all types&#63;</h2>
                    <p>For my work, I need there to be no changes to the operating system. None. Updates frequently make small changes that impact usability and I really don't care how critical Microsoft thinks the update is to them.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Yesterday, windows filled my C drive trying to update which halted all work. It thankfully didn't finish, but I had to clear data to resume working. Since the machine is frequently remote accessed it's a real pain to deal with that. Afterwards, I set all connections
 to metered within the registry (including ethernet) here:<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\NetworkList\DefaultMediaCost<br />
<br />
Then I went into the parental control settings of my router and blocked all of the Microsoft domains that are used for updates.<br />
<br />
I thought that was sufficient, but then I went to work today and caught it 88% done installing an update! So I closed the process, deleted the Windows10Upgrade folder again, and the $getcurrent folder, and also the $sysreset folder and then added a new registry
 value here:<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\WindowsUpdate\AU<br />
<br />
Called "NoAutoUpdate" of type REG_DWORD with a value set to 1, hoping that will stop it, but I don't know yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tested the firewall settings though and while my test case of bing is properly blocked, neither download.microsoft.com nor&nbsp;<span>windowsupdate.microsoft.com
 is actually being blocked. Somehow computers on my network are able to ignore firewall settings, but only in regards to domains related to windows updates. To me, any software that bypasses firewall rules is automatically untrusted.</span><br />
<br />
So far, the update keeps failing because I catch it in time, but I can't afford to deal with having to reformat and reinstall my work machine all because Microsoft doesn't respect the wishes of it's customers. I get that when a carrier leases a phone they can
 push updates whenever they like, but even with phones when I physically own the phone I get to decide if and when Android is updated. With Microsoft? They seem to think that they own my computer. Additionally, as I said, the connection is metered which means
 that microsoft is stealing my bandwidth. I checked and it's downloaded 40 GB over the last 2 days so far.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know of a sure fire way to permanently kill my computer's ability to undergo any kind of update whatsoever? Ideally, I'd prefer to be able to review update options personally to decide which updates I'd prefer having, but if I had to choose between
 no updates and all updates I'd pick no updates every time. I am a registered .NET developer (on a different username), but experiences like this (combined with other annoyances with recent Microsoft decisions) has made me less and less interested in windows
 development.<br />
<br />
If I could find where the windows update files are located I could probably remove it directly the way I removed Edge and Internet Explorer. Does anyone know where those files are at least?<br />
</p>

            The situation is even worse now. I went to class, then checked my computer afterwards and it ran the updater again, and this time it succeeded! SERIOUSLY, what the furk Microsoft? They STOLE another 40 GB of bandwidth today! on a metered connection! I
 have too much work to deal with all this!<br />
<br />
Now it wants me to restart to complete an installation. I deleted the install files, but it created the backup files already and I don't know what it managed to do already.<br />
<br />
For the time being I am using a task blocker to try and block the windows update assistant, but I'm going to have to restart my computer with a disconnected ethernet cable to make sure it's not able to download anything again and then manually clean everything.
 I reallllly want to stop this.

<p>I would suggest you switch to Linux. Seriously, it's a very good, proven operating system, and it's the only major operating system that doesn't require that you install updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10, MacOS and ChromeOS all require that you install updates sooner or later. That's how modern operating systems work. (And not just operating systems; Office works the same way, as well as Creative Cloud and lots of other application software.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Linux has updates too, and to be honest, you'd be smart to install them. But Linux doesn't enforce a timetable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You probably know that there are many varieties of Linux, known as <em>distros</em>. Right now Mint is particularly easy to learn.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The updates are part of Windows 10. They're not optional add-ons that you can choose or refuse like it's a buffet. That's why there's no mechanism to stop them, short of interfering with the operating system, and Windows will try hard to keep sending them.
 With the Professional edition you can delay updates, for a long time, but you can't stop them ... not without consequences.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Success with updates depends, to a large extent, on the quality of the pre-existing installation. If you're good about setting up and maintaining your computer, updates don't usually cause problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't want updates, frankly, Linux is your best choice.</p>

<p>I am familiar with Linux, but I have to use Windows for work and school. I also need to keep specific features and I explicitly do not want the changes that these updates will cause to my work environment. Although in the future I'll probably only install
 windows within a virtual machine going forward.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Only an idiot buys into the idea that you have to give up control to Microsoft to use Windows. I know perfectly well they don't like people stopping updates, but there HAS to be a way to stop it. I just need to know more about the processes at work here.
 I had no problem removing Edge and IE because I understood the processes at work, even though it's not supposed to be possible.<br />
<br />
For example, I successfully blocked the windows10upgraderapp.exe process. Every time it tries to run itself (despite being delayed in groups and disabled in scheduler) it is immediately closed, but somehow the files are still redownloaded. What processes is
 Microsoft using to steal me METERED bandwidth? It's downloading more than 20 gigs a shot, repeatedly. They've nearly eaten through my monthly quota today alone, so if this goes on much longer I will have to pay through the nose for Microsoft's use of my network
 or cease working entirely. Neither option is acceptable to me.</p>
<p><br />
I need to know exactly how it's doing what it's doing so I can stop it. It's as simple as that. I know that it's not like past versions of window that lets me pick and choose the updates I want hence why I want to kill it all. As far as I am concerned, Microsoft
 updates are now as malicious and disruptive to my work as a virus. I am tired of having to stop working every other hour to deal with this.</p>

<p>I have just acquired a new computer w/Windows on it. It is now totally out of control, 3 automatic updates a day, 4 hours of my valuable time lost, no ability to control when it happens. The "metered" setting has now disappeared. Other restrictive settings
 disappear or become inactivated as soon as I see them on a Settings window. It's like a conspiracy, and I'm on the verge of taking the new computer back to the shop. How on earth do I stop this? Can I get Linux and do it myself?? Incidentally, I've been using

<p>I think I found my solution: In order to stop windows from downloading files and eating up my bandwidth (even on a metered connection) I had to remove
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">windows/system32/qmgr.dll</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>which was as simple as as adding .bak to the end to disable it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
http://www.shouldiblockit.com/qmgr.dll-20265.aspx<br />
<br />
and to stop the installation of the files I similarly disabled:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">windows/system32/wuaueng.dll<br />
windows/system32/wuaueng.dll.mui</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">windows/system32/wuauclt.exe</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>(as a side note, windows store apps can be disables by renaming this one as well: )</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">windows/system32/wuautoappupdate.dll<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">windows/system32/wuautoappupdate.dll.mui</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Of course, you have to change ownerships from "TrustedInstaller" to "Administrators" and then set admin to have full control to rename them. Same procedure for getting rid of internet explorer and edge. You can also remove the read/write permissions of TrustedInstaller,
 but I didn't because if I ever choose to run the software all I'd have to do is rename to remove .BAK<br />
<br />
The only step that otherwise worked for me was to use a task blocker to block windows10upgraderapp.exe , which weirdly doesn't stop windows from downloading files, it just stopped windows from being able to do anything with them. These steps above SHOULD permanently
 solve my problem. So far so good, but will update if it doesn't work.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Nope, that doesn't fully work either. A Windows10Upgrade folder is still somehow generated, but now it's only less than 20 megs rather than more than 20 gigs. The task blocker effectively catches it still. Microsoft must have some stupid little file somewhere
 that's downloading files without my permission. I just wish I knew where it was. At least for now it won't be killing my data plan anymore.<br />
<br />
EDIT 2: I found a more permanent solution, though still not perfect. Instead of deleting the Windows10Upgrade folder that it keeps creating I deleted all it's contents, then removed system from having any permissions to it, and set the permissions for admin
 and users to read only. I waited a while and it worked.&nbsp;It's no longer able to create files in Windows10Upgrade. The only downside is that I have to keep that folder around (annoying) and every time it tries to download files there an error saying "...Please
 check if you have permission to write to the installation folder." (even more annoying) but at least my computer and bandwidth is safe from this intrusion until I can figure out HOW it's even trying to download stuff.<br />
<br />
I would absolutely love it if I could either disable that error so I don't get bothered every few hours, or better yet find the virus like file that Microsoft is using to invade my computer.</p>

<p>You can set the metered option in the registry like I did by going here:<br />
<br />
<span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\NetworkList\DefaultMediaCost<br />
<br />
and setting the value of each entry to 2.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
However, Microsoft even states in it's documentation that it outright ignores metered status for whatever they decide is critical. That's the problem I am having.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Back when I used to let windows update, one of the most persistent&nbsp;consequence of updating was that Microsoft would change all of my personalized settings to defaults.
 So instead of using my preferred eBook reader it would use Edge (even though I removed edge, meaning I can't open PDF files) or it would change the default admin settings so that I can't even run the Calculator because I can't use apps at all. Media players
 would change, as would default image viewing software. Everything would get configured to whatever Microsoft decided on without any consideration for what I, the owner, wants. That's one reason why I am working so hard to prevent updates (others being that
 I have read about what the latest updates do and I explicitly don't want them).<br />
<br />
Another issue I had was that having a Microsoft Account (to be able to purchase apps) means that child accounts are not longer able to be created without registering personal information with Microsoft, which is a violation of Federal law regarding the privacy
 and safety of children. You have to use command line input to get around it. It was so creepy that I decided to never use the Microsoft app store. The price is too high. Incidentally, this wasn't something I signed up for. An update changed things to use Microsoft
 accounts and they had to be rolled back.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Other updates forced users to use bing with it's search assistant - an update I have so far avoided. I hate bing so much my parental controls block it. Again, Microsoft is forcing it's customers to use software they don't want.<br />
<br />
In a way, this is a conspiracy. Well, in the legal definition that is.&nbsp;<br />

<p>
</p><p>Microsoft made plans to take away the ability of the end-user to have any reasonable control over their own computers, to destroy or impair access to software that is in competition with Microsoft, and without any consideration for the harm it causes. That's
 a conspiracy. Unfortunately, it won't stop unless and until Microsoft loses sufficient market share to a company that acts differently.<br />
<br />
On the contrary, Microsoft lost market share to google, and Android does have forced updates, which is probably where Microsoft got the idea that it could get away with it. What they failed to notice, however, is that Android never forces updates for unbranded
 phones and users always have a way to avoid updates if it is important enough to them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft does have a feature to roll back updates, but only ones that they don't consider to be critical, so anything that metering doesn't stop you literally are given no choice over.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as your alternatives: I personally use Ubuntu on my Unix machine. It's great in that the user experience is very similar to what you'd expect from windows, minus the headaches. WINE can be installed to run some windows programs as well. Alternatively,
 you can buy a program called "<a href="http://www.faronics.com/assets/DeepFreeze.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Deep Freeze</a>" which will not prevent updates from happening, but when you restart any changes to protected areas of the partition are
 undone. Since I want to stop being interrupted alltogether that isn't a viable option for me.&nbsp;</p>

            Windows is a marketing channel, not just an operating system and it's thrown into cheap OEM machines. That's why people without tech savvy and money are trapped. By the way, any idea how many people were trapped into buying Yugos, Trabants, Ladas, and
 Corvairs? Lots of idiots.&nbsp;

<p>I'd also take the additional steps that I took. Take control of, and add .BAK to the end of, the following files:<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><span>windows/system32/qmgr.dll</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>windows/system32/wuaueng.dll<br />
windows/system32/wuaueng.dll.mui</span></p>
<p><span>windows/system32/wuauclt.exe</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>and then for good measure create a folder in the C drive (or leave it there if it is already there) named "Windows10Upgrade" and right-click &gt; Properties &gt; Security then in permissions remove all permissions for system and change the permissions for Admin
 and Users to read only. If you do this, and windows try to start an update anyway, it will be unable to install anything and you will just get an occasional popup error telling you that it can't write to the selected folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You can also get a task blocker like <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/taskblocker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this one</a>&nbsp;and add any process you want that you don't want running. Having Windows10upgraderapp.exe added to the list means that it can't complete updates, and I also use it to block other annoying self updating programs like officeclicktorun.exe and it
 keeps a log to tell you how many times it stopped the process which is how I know that since removing write permissions from that folder the update hasn't been able to start at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
The benefit of this approach is that you can undo it all very easily if you ever decide that you want to update, but you'll need to white list .bak files with ccleaner if you use it.<br />
<br />
As soon as I find out what the process is that is actually downloading these updates I'll report back so others can benefit.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
As far as apple goes they can be worse in many ways. I know people whose phones were crippled because they never bothered to use proper versioning info to even determine if the phones can handle an upgrade AND the updates were pushed without their consent.
 I'm actually a bit of an apple fan in regards to video editing, because they were big on that before anyone else, but these days I used windows even for that work because apple just never got the whole "full screen video" thing for some reason.<br />
<br />
EDIT: You also need to rename the contents of&nbsp;C:\Windows\UpdateAssistant\ and change the folder permissions there to read only as well after taking ownership in order to stop updates. After doing this it won't even try downloading the files anymore.<br />

<h2>            Speakers aren&#39;t working</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>I am using Windows 10 now for more than a year now. So far, so good.</span><span> For over half a year I have Trust Vigor Subwoofer speakers (</span><a href="https://www.alza.co.uk/trust-vigor-2-1-subwoofer-speaker-set-brown-d2906071.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.alza.co.uk/trust-vigor-2...n-d2906071.htm</a><span>)
 with a wired remote control.</span></p>
<p><span><span>Yesterday<span> I switched on my computer and it didn't make a sound. I have tried everything from checking the cables to controlling the drivers, but nothing comes out.&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>aI
 literally tried it all adviced in diferent fora: checked the cables, controlled if my sound settings wouldn't be muted, I also uninstalled and re-installed the drivers, tried to use my computer's drivers and then again found on the internet, unplugged and
 replugged everything. The only thing häppening is the following</span><span> - when I unplug the powercord and plug it in again after at least a minut or a longer periood of time, the speakers do for a very short time a silent unstable and crackling
 sound for couple of seconds. After that: silence.</span></p>
<p><span>What functions is this wired remote though. It has an earplug jack. Needless to say - the remote functions also when the speakers are switched off, so the problem really lies in the speakers, but I am unable to define when and how.</span></p>

<p>Thank You for a quick reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. A. Running the Audio troubleshooter gives me always the same outcome since yesterday: troubleshooter discovers something and says, for those changes to take action I have to restart the computer. I'll restart it - nothing happens. I did it once more now
 again - the same.</p>
<p>1. B. H&amp;D troubleshooter started, ran into something and announced it's impossible to continue.</p>
<p>Maybe here is something?</p>
<p>So I didn't continue doing anything more for now. Especially as I have uninstalled and let the computer reinstall the driver already twice yesterday.</p>
<p>And I think I should have also mentioned, that when I try to play f.e. some music and check at the same time at the audio võlume control box, then the volume bars are moving as if there would be sound, but nothing comes out of the boxes.</p>
<p>The motherboard I have is an MSI Mortar Z270M, if that's any help.</p>

<h2>            Your PC runs into a problem and needs to be restart because some error info needs to be collected&#33;</h2>
                    After starting Windows 8 for a certain time, sometimes a couple of minutes, sometimes half an hour, the following remarks occur: "Your PC runs into a problem and needs to restart, we are just collecting some error info, and then we'll restart for you (0
 - 100%).&nbsp; But the restart does not happen and the remarks remains with a blue background.&nbsp;&nbsp; The computer may work again for resting for a few hours and same problem occurs again.&nbsp; How can I solve this problem?

<h2>            -LOCKED-problemi con la modalita&#39; multiplayer cod4</h2>
                    
<p>Ciao a tutti , mi e' successa una cosa stranissima mentre giocavo a cod4 in multiplayer. In pratica sono entrato in una partita dove le munizioni erano illimitate e si sparava ad una velocita' impressionante , in pratica era un casino . Fin qui , niente
 ho pensato che forse il server non funzionasse bene , ma poi la fregatura in pratica quando uccidevi i tuoi nemici anziche' darti punti te li toglieva .Ho capito che c'era qualcosa di strano e volevo uscire ma non mi faceva lasciare la partita .Alla fine della
 partita mi sono ritrovato la modalita prestigio bloccata al numero 1 e con &nbsp; &nbsp;-2.300.000 e non si ripristina piu' .Se qualcuno sa' come ripristinarla potrebbe dirmelo ? grazie a tutti</p>

<h2>            KB976902 uninstall problem</h2>
                    
<p>Does anyone have a suggestion on how I can uninstall KB976902? It self-installed when I powered off yesterday and corrupted my profile. It then created (or something created) a password to prevent me making any changes to the hard drive, so trying to set
 up or change profiles won't work. Nor will system restore, for the same reason.</p>
<p>I can see it listed in 'installed updates' but when I select it, the option to uninstall disappears.</p>

<h2>            BitLocker locked my external harddrive by itself&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I connected my external harddrive to my PC and it popped-up this message saying the drive is locked by bitlocker.</p>
<p>This has&nbsp;<strong>never</strong> happend before on the same PC. </p>
<p>I had no clue wat bitlocker was, so I looked it up and I start to believe that I will never be able to acces my drive again because:</p>
<p><strong>I have no recovery key or password because I have never been in contact with bitlocker in my life untill now.
</strong></p>
<p>I searched on every drive inside and outside my PC for it and my microsoft account tells me I have 0 keys stored.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what can I do? This disk contains data I need, so formatting is <strong>not</strong> an option.
</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Communities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I understand that you are unable to access your external hard disc and you get a message stating “The drive is locked by bit locker”.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>BitLocker Drive Encryption will lock an encrypted drive and require recovery in these situations:</p>
<ol>
<li>BitLocker has detected a possible security risk during startup.</li><li>BitLocker startup key or PIN is lost, or the startup key is damaged.</li></ol>
<p>Note 1: if a drive is locked using Bit Locker there is no way you can unlock it without the key. if you
<strong>don’t have the key you cannot access the Drive</strong>. The key or the Recovery drive is the only way to access your drive back.
</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>I face the same problem. My drive was locked by itself, as i connected it on another computer. I never used bitlocker in the first place.
</p>
<p>This is a serious bug that microsoft has to fix immediately</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear about the inconvenience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By default Bit locker will not &nbsp;lock any drives unless it is locked by user.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you still have any issues with Bit locker please do let us know and thank you for sharing this information.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I am afraid your information is not correct. &nbsp;This same problem has now happened to me twice.</p>
<p>Whilst transferring files from my 8.1 machine to a seagate hdd, when I attempted to read that drive on my windows 7 machine it said it was locked by bitlocker. &nbsp;I too hadn't heard of bitlockr and never locked the drive in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could still access the drive on the 8.1 machine however so I bought another drive and was able to copy my stuff from one drive to the other on the 8.1 machinE. &nbsp;This time the new drive wan't locked.<span>&nbsp; The old drive is still
 inaccessible except on the 8.1 machine.</span></p>
<p>The same thing has now happened again on the new drive. &nbsp;It too is bit locked without me requesting it. &nbsp;This is a serious bug and I am surprised you guys don't know about it. &nbsp;I think it might have been caused by me unplugging the the drive without using
 the remove drive option on the task bar but whatever, it shouldn't have locked my drive. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think it is actually encrypted because it doesn't even ask me for a key, but it is still unavailable on another computer. &nbsp;It has probably just been corrupted by 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>This really is a serious issue and needs to be sorted quickly. &nbsp;Thanks</p>

            <p>Thanks Mohammed, for your reply, but it doesn't help me very much. &nbsp;No point you referring me to the Microsoft help on Bitlocker, (I have read it), this is a BUG. &nbsp;It is not due to me doing anything wrong. &nbsp;Bitlocker locked my drive without me requesting
 it. &nbsp;(Contrary to your assertion that Bitlocker only locks drives when requested).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will post on the Tech forum as you suggest, but with no great hope of solution. &nbsp;This needs to be reported to the relevant operating system support team, and it should be solved by Microsoft, who should get back to me with their solution. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One final point. &nbsp;If I try to do a Dir on the drive in the command prompt it says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The bitlocker metadata for the encrypted drive is not valid", further indicating that some sort of system error has occurred. &nbsp;A question. &nbsp;Since the drive can still be viewed on the 8.1 machine, if I reformat it from that machine, will it then remove the
 corrupted bitlocker metadata?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

<h2>            When I unpin an icon from the taskbar, blanks space is left behind.</h2>
                    I upgraded from windows 8.1 to windows 10 today, and when I removed a few pinned programs from my taskbar, they left behind a blank space between programs. I can drag and right click the blank spaces as if the programs were still pinned there, but left
 clicking them does nothing. How do I get these things to go?

    <title>No TV Audio from Xbox One Passthrough&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> banditob1  say:</h3>
<h2>            No TV Audio from Xbox One Passthrough&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have the HDMI out of my Yamaha RX-567 receiver going into my Xbox One and then the HDMI out from the Xbox One to the television as it is shown in the setup guide.&nbsp; I then connected an optical cable from the Xbox One back to the receiver.&nbsp; With this setup,
 I can see my DirecTV video through the Xbox one, but I get no TV audio.&nbsp; I am getting Xbox audio, but no TV sound.&nbsp; On the receiver, I can change the audio input on the receiver for the HDMI port to receive audio from either the HDMI cable or the optical input.&nbsp;
 When set to the HDMI cable, I get DirecTV sound as expected, but no Xbox sound..&nbsp; Went set to the optical input, I get Xbox sound, but no DirecTV audio.</p>
<p>I would assume (and we should all know what that means) that the Xbox would receive the DirecTV audio via HDMI and then rebroadcast it over the optical port, but this seems not to be the case.&nbsp; I'll do a bit of testing by removing the receiver from the HDMI
 path to see what happens, but this seems like a pretty big shortcoming of the passthrough on the Xbox.&nbsp; One begins to wonder what kind of real-world testing they did with the Xbox one during development to have overlooked something as fundamental as this.</p>
<p>The only thing that I can see that might be causing this issue is the receiver itself.&nbsp; If changing the HDMI port audio input to optical is disabling the HDMI audio passthrough, that would cause these symptoms.&nbsp; I guess that I should also give Yamaha a call
 to see what they can tell me.</p>
<p>If anyone else has some other ideas, I'm all ears or, in this case, eyes!</p>

<p>RWBill,</p>
<p>Thanks for your words of support!</p>
<p>I did call Yamaha and they confirmed that when switching the audio input to the optical port, it disables the HDMI audio pass through as this would normally create a loop that would, of course, cause problems.</p>
<p>So, as a result of this, I had to connect my DirecTV receiver directly to the Xbox One and bypass the Yamaha receiver entirely. &nbsp;I then moved the HDMI output from the receiver to another input on the TV and all is working well now. &nbsp;It's not my ideal setup
 as I would still prefer to switch everything via the Yamaha, but it's a workable solution.</p>

<p>Can you explain this a bit more? I have a slightly different setup and trying to get it to work.</p>
<p>I have the following:</p>
<p>- Comcast Settop box</p>
<p>- Xbox one</p>
<p>- Yamaha receiver</p>
<p>- LG TV</p>
<p>I have connected: </p>
<p>Settop to Xbox, through HDMI </p>
<p>Xbox to Yamaha, through HDMI</p>
<p>LG TV was already connected to Yamaha, and I have been switching everything thorough Yamaha already.</p>
<p>Everything works fine except one thing - audio for Live TV. I have audio for games, video, etc, everything that comes from Xbox directly. Live TV video works, but no audio. I have gone through the Live TV setup and Xbox correctly controls the settop box
 (channels up/down). </p>
<p>Previously the settop box was connected directly to Yamaha, &nbsp;through the same HDMI, and everything worked.
</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>seicam,</p>
<p>Sorry to be so slow to respond, but with the holidays and all, I hope you understand.</p>
<p>I believe that the only audio out from the Xbox One is over the optical link. &nbsp;Therefore, you have to connect the optical out of the Xbox to one of the optical inputs on your receiver and then select that audio input to get the Xbox and Live TV audio. &nbsp;For
 the video, you may have to bypass the receiver altogether. &nbsp;Here is how my setup is configured (the Yamaha gets audio only from the Xbox One):</p>
<p>DirecTV receiver --&gt; Xbox One --&gt; TV</p>
<p>Yamaha A/V receiver &lt;---'</p>
<p>I never thought about taking the HDMI out from the Xbox and through the A/V receiver. &nbsp;This may work, but you will still have to associate the audio with the optical input from the Xbox. &nbsp;This is done through the menus on your Yamaha system. &nbsp;You need to
 select the HDMI input for the Xbox and then there should be setup options for the audio to use. &nbsp;You then select the optical input that the Xbox is connected to as the default audio input for that particular HDMI input. &nbsp;If you're not sure how to do this,
 Yamaha support can walk you through the process.</p>

<p>Hi <strong>Galipogean,</strong></p>
<p>a) Are you able to boot in safe mode?<br />
b) Do you have security program installed on your computer?</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> you need to Disable automatic restart on system failure on your computer and note the error message you are receiving in the event viewer and you need to post back to us.</p>
<p>Follow the steps given below:<br />
Right click Computer&gt;&gt;properties&gt;&gt;Advanced System Settings&gt;&gt;Advanced Tab&gt;&gt;Startup and Recovery Settings&gt;&gt; Uncheck Automatically restart.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Also try booting the computer in the safe mode and check if you are able to boot to the desktop or not.</p>

<h2>            No updates installing &#40;including Apps &#43; Windows 8.1&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am running Windows 8, 64-bit and ever since I have had my laptop (for about 6 months), I have had numerous problems regarding updates. No Windows Updates are installed (under Settings-&gt; PC Settings). I click on Install and the "wheel of death" keeps spinning
 and nothing happens. No updates install in Windows Store. I tried to update a few apps in the store, and same issue as above, the wheel spins and nothing happens. When I click on "update to windows 8.1 for free), nothing happens at all. It is as if I didn't
 even press the button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried "Fix Problems with Windows Update" in control panel, and the program just keeps running for hours and no changes occur. I have reset Windows Store Cache and nothing. The problems mentioned above reoccur.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried refreshing/bringing laptop back to factory settings, shutting down, restarting..and absolutely nothing. For a laptop that cost me over $1,000 and I consider quite new, disappointed is an understatement.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help me fix this!!</p>

    <title>Party Chat not working on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> saraoui  say:</h3>
<h2>            Party Chat not working on Windows 10</h2>
                    
<p>Well, the Xbox App has been a huge disappointment. It's slow, buggy, and now, party chat also doesn't work. Here is an insight on what happened / what I did to try to solve it:</p>
<p>- Since Windows 10 came out, I've not had a single problem with party chat. I did move and get a new router, but all was fine up until around a month ago, where suddenly whenever I joined a party, I would get the error code: "Your network settings are blocking
 party chat. Error Code: 0x89231806"</p>
<p>I have tried:</p>
<p>- Changing my NAT type from Strict to Open</p>
<p>- Enabling / Disabling UPNP</p>
<p>- Resetting the router</p>
<p>- Validating that my teredo address is obtained</p>
<p>And yet still, nothing seems to work. Xbox Live Chat support told me that if enabling my UPNP didn't work, I should come here and request help. So can anyone give me a hand?</p>

<p>So I ran into this problem and I ran into it again. It is quite annoying. This is caused by your windows firewall settings basically the ones that are set in the windows settings. This is can also be caused by your antivirus software, and it can also be
 caused by VPN services. Change the xbox app to being trusted and figure out which inbound or outbound connection your PC is blocking and that will fix the problem asap. Otherwise start here!</p>
<p>Solution 6: Windows services required for Xbox Live multiplayer and party chat have been changed from their default values</p>
<p>There are four key services that are required for Xbox Live multiplayer and party chat to function on Windows 10. If any of these services have been disabled, you will need to re-enable them in order to use Xbox Live party chat and multiplayer systems.</p>
<p>Check to make sure the required Windows services are enabled:</p>
<p>Enter Services in the search field on your toolbar (Cortana).</p>
<p>Select Services from the search results.</p>
<p>In the Services application, check the Startup Type for the following services to ensure they are set to their default values:</p>
<p>IKE and AuthIP IPsec Keying Modules, Startup Type: Automatic (Trigger Start) </p>
<p>IP Helper, Startup Type: Automatic </p>
<p>Xbox Live Auth Manager, Startup Type: Manual </p>
<p>Xbox Live Networking Service, Startup Type: Manual</p>
<p>If any of the services have been altered from their default values, you can configure them back to their default values:</p>
<p>In the Services application, double-click the service name that has been altered.</p>
<p>In the Service properties window, select the Startup type drop-down list and select the default value for the service.</p>
<p>For example: If the service startup type’s default value is Automatic and the startup type has been changed to Disabled, you will need to change it back to Automatic, and then start the service. To start the service, under Service Status, select Start.</p>
<p>There are some applications that reconfigure PC settings in order to try to optimize PC performance. Some of these applications will disable Windows services as part of their optimization processes, and in doing so may reconfigure one or more of the four
 services listed above to be disabled. If you use one of these PC optimization applications, make note of any service configuration changes it makes, as you may need to revert those settings in order to use Xbox Live party chat and multiplayer systems.</p>
<p>Solution 7: Teredo server name is set to an invalid value</p>
<p>In order for Teredo to function normally, it needs to be configured to use a valid Teredo server. If the Teredo client on your PC has been configured to use an invalid server name, it will need to be reconfigured to a valid Teredo server name to function
 correctly.</p>
<p>Check to see what Teredo uses as a server name:</p>
<p>Right-click the Start icon, and then select Command Prompt (Admin).</p>
<p>To check the server name Teredo is using, run the following command from the Admin command prompt:</p>
<p>netsh interface Teredo show state</p>
<p>The default value for the server name parameter on Windows 10 is win10.ipv6.microsoft.com.</p>
<p>If a different value is displayed and Teredo is unable to obtain an IP address, you may need to revert the setting back to the default value. Run the following command in the Admin command prompt:</p>
<p>netsh interface Teredo set state servername=win10.ipv6.microsoft.com</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>The teredo address is obtained and works fine, however after checking all the firewall startup settings and making sure they were set to what you told me, party chat still does not work. I receive the same error. No, I do not have a VPN, and the only Antivirus
 software I have is Windows Defender which doesn't affect the Xbox app whatsoever. I even tried the Xbox Beta app for W10, and that doesn't seem to work either. Could this be something on Microsoft's end or is it certain that this is caused by my network?</p>

<p>I trust you are doing splendidly and enjoying the season.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This Blue Screen is getting extremely annoying, since I have tried everything and nothing fixed the problem.</p>
<p>Without any reason, I get a Blue Screen with VIDEO_TDR_FAILURE atikmpag.sys</p>
<p>The display driver was installed and updated correctly minutes ago, immediately after windows re-install. And it wasn't long and the BSOD occurred.</p>
<p>I see on google several solutions, but that includes finding this file</p>
<p>
</p><p>atikmpag.sy_</p>
<p>
</p><p>which is not in my PC (it should be in C: amd - win 10 64 bit etc - packages - drivers - display - WT etc - B etc, but it IS NOT there; instead, I have atikmap.sys</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, the cmd prompt solution won't work.</p>
<p>Google and youtube aren't getting me anywhere, nor do AMD or Windows 10 clean install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would very much appreciate if you could help me solve this annoying and persistent problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have a nice day and please do take care!</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>

<h2>            A problem with my MSI &#34;engine&#34; &#40;InstallShield&#63;&#41; - can&#39;t install Adobe Air&#63;</h2>
                    When I try to uninstall e.g. Google Sketchup 8, Balsamiq Mockups for Desktop or MS DHTML Editing component I get an
<b>error 2203</b>.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Initially, the trouble started as I tried to upgrade <b>Adobe Air</b>. Now, regrettably, I can't use Air programs - and I really need to able to do that.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried the (no longer officially supported)&nbsp;<b>Windows Installer CleanUp Utility</b>, but as I try to install it, I get
<b>Internal Error 2753, 1632</b>.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've turned on MSI-logging to see what is happening as I try to install Adobe Air. I may look like this:</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By selecting Properties of my C drive with the Win 7 install,&nbsp; and then the Quota tab, I found out (with the help of some colleagues) that the disk space was limited to only 10 GB for some reason. By removing this limitation, everything worked again!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your input! </p>

<h2>            My recycle bin didn&#39;t delete my files but it made them disappear from its directory</h2>
                    Today I tried to delete my entire Camera Roll folder which contains a huge number of screenshots (about 55 GB). &nbsp;After the first attempt the recycling process froze after discovering all the files within the folder and wouldn't go away even though I tried
 to cancel it. &nbsp;After the second attempt it moved to my recycle bin in less than a second. &nbsp;Unfortunately, when I tried to delete the folder it came into conflict with the frozen recycling attempt, and said that I couldn't delete it because it was being used
 with another different program. &nbsp;I cancelled it but for some reason the Camera Roll folder disappeared from my recycle bin and I couldn't find it in my Pictures folder either. &nbsp;The folder is still somewhere on my hard drive but I can't find it. &nbsp;I know that
 55 GB is a lot and I let it get out of hand, but that doesn't explain why it just disappeared from my recycle bin. &nbsp;Is there any way I could find it??

            <p>Hi Cody,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Usually when you delete a folder from your computer it gets moved to the recycle bin, however if you would have permanently deleted it, it will be wiped off directly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately if the item is deleted from Recycle Bin or if it’s permanently deleted using Shift + Delete, you cannot recover it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However there are some 3<sup>rd</sup> party application which claim to recover such files which are deleted from Recycle Bin. You may use your favorite search engine to find and install such application to help you in recovering these files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can
 be solved. Using Third Party Software is at your own risk.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Hope this information helps, do let us know if you need further assistance with Windows.</p>
