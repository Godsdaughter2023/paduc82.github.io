<div>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with my HP Pavilion dv2000, I upgraded it to Windows 10 64 bit and the sounds are gone. I tried several methods such as:</p>
<p>
</p><p>*disabling all the enhancements</p>
<p>
</p><p>*uninstalling audio driver conexant&nbsp; smart audio high definition 221 and scan hardware changes, a pop up message says " a digitally signed drivers is required "</p>
<p>
</p><p>*updating audio driver but it says i have the updated driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried to disable the signed drivers enforcement, it worked but when i restart my pc there it goes again, I tried disabling the signed drivers permanently by using the
<span>bcdedit /set loadoptions DISABLE_INTEGRITY_CHECKS<em>&nbsp;</em>and bcdedit /set testsigning on but my pc still dont have a sound.</span></p>
<span>bcdedit /set loadoptions DISABLE_INTEGRITY_CHECKS<em>&nbsp;</em>and bcdedit /set testsigning on but my pc still dont have a sound.</span></p>

            To bad you dont even grasp that it is not a program but the Operating System, the thing that runs the programs. &nbsp;Maybe when you figure out what an OS is and how complex it truly is you can have some real appreciation for the hard work these people put
 into it instead of being disrespectful of others and their hard work.

            What are you, the online manners police? Just the fact that you assume that the guy doesn't know the difference between an OS and a stand alone program, only makes you look pompous. Who gives a **** about the developer's "hard work"? They didn't do it for charity. It's their job, which they get paid a lot of money for.  Windows 8 is a piece of ****. It has no redeeming values, just stupid flash. It's a pretty regular for Microsoft to shoot themselves in the foot with every other version of the OS. 85 was good, 98 was a piece of ****. 2000 was good, ME was a piece of ****. XP was good, Vista was a piece of ****. 7 was good and now 8 is a piece of ****. So get over yourself.  Regards, Me2

            Hi Jake, <br /><br />I’ve never dealt with this issue first hand, but I did find an article with more than a few fixes. Check them out. <br /><br /><a href="http://troubleshooter.xyz/wiki/fix-task-scheduler-service-is-not-available-error/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://troubleshooter.xyz/wiki/fix-task-schedul...</a><br /><br />If those don’t work, you try a 3rd party app I like. <br /> Download and install Ccleaner - <a href="https://www.ccleaner.com/ccleaner/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.ccleaner.com/ccleaner/download</a><br /><br />After installing, run the cleaner, and then the registry tool. Run the registry tool until there are no more fixes to be made. Reboot, and see if task scheduler will run. <br /><br />3rd - we could attempt a system restore <br /><br />Good luck and let me know!<br /><br />- C

            Darnit. Would you be opposed to a reset of windows? <br /><br />I’m sure you have apps/data on your machine. You could back them up using <a href="https://www.easeus.com/backup-recovery/backup-and-restore-installed-applications-windows-10.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.easeus.com/backup-recovery/backup-a...</a><br /><br />After you have backup, I’d try a windows reset.

<h2>            Apps not downloading from store</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with the store, none of the app updates found is downloading.</p>
<p>After upgrading to W10 I've opened the store app and searched for updates.</p>
<p>I've found 33 of them but none of them seems to be working, I've tried to pause all of them and start them one by one but the download doesn't start. The bar tells me the total MB of the download but the donwloaded amount is stuck to 0,0. I've tried also
 the "wsreset" command a couple of times but it still not working.</p>
<p>Does anyone have the same problem?</p>

<p>Hello dear Microsoft&nbsp;community</p>
<p><span>here's the actual problem that maybe someone here can solve it&nbsp;<a href="http://img237.yfrog.com/i/photohn.jpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://img237.yfrog.com/i/photohn.jpg/</a></span></p>
<p>It's the third time the bluescreen appear</p>
<p>What should I do to prevent it?</p>
<p>I posted on intel forums, I thought it's some processor/chip problem and one user from there told me:&nbsp;<span><strong>101 = CLOCK</strong>_<strong>WATCHDOG</strong>_<strong>TIMEOUT</strong></span></p>
<span>
<span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>It's a sync issue between the mutiple cores, if your overclocking then it could be due to that.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>There seems to be some issues with virtualisation and getting this BSOD, you can get a hot fix from microsoft that could help.</strong></p>

<p>I went to that page but the hotfix is only compatible with windows vista and windows server 2008, but I have windows 7</p>
<p>I didn't do any overcloacking</p>

This error is generally caused because of OVERHEATING! Make sure you have NOT overclocked!

Keep in touch with Intel guys! <br />

    <title>Windows Speech Recognition not working but Cortana Speech Recognition - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Speech Recognition not working but Cortana Speech Recognition is working.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently installed Windows 10 on my desktop computer and have been setting it up since.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to setup speech recognition but am encountering problems with it not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The speech recognition app is open at the top of my screen and I can see the microphone is picking up the sound as the meter is moving with the sound but it will not pick up when I say "Start listening".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strange thing is Cortana speech recognition is working, albeit getting some words wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought I would try the option in Control Panel/Speech Recognition caled "Train your computer to understand you better" but it seems like it is not picking up any microphone input. I tried reading the first sentence many times and it doesn't move from
 there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have 2 problems.</p>
<p>1) The Windows Speech Recognition is not recognising the "Start listening" command so I can't test it any further</p>
<p>2) The Control Panel option of "Train your computer to understand you better" is not responsive at all</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Flavio,<br />
<br />
<br />
It is really strange that your <strong>Cortana</strong> can catch up with the speech recognition, but Windows cannot.<br />
<br />
That being said, please provide the answers to the following for us to be able to learn more about your concern:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have you checked if you have the latest updates for Windows? Keeping your PC up-to-date repairs bugs and issue with the system.<br />
</li><li>Are your drivers up-to-date? If not, you can follow the steps found on this <strong>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/instantanswers/ad5a063e-5f57-c715-2566-b983195752c1/update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> on how to update your drivers in Windows 10.<br />
</li><li>We understand that your microphone works perfectly with other Windows applications, but can you consider using a different one to make sure that it's not a compatibility issue? An earphones with mic perhaps?<br />
</li><li>Did you use the media creation tool to install Windows 10?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, let's run the <strong>Speech Troubleshooter</strong> to get your microphone ready and repair problems that prevents Windows from hearing you.</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the <strong>Start</strong> icon, then select <strong>Control Panel</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Choose the <strong>Large icons</strong> option from the <strong>View by</strong> drop down list found on the upper-right part of the Control Panel window.<br />
</li><li>Locate then select<strong> Troubleshooting</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click <strong>View all </strong>from the left pane.<br />
</li><li>Locate and click <strong>Speech</strong> to run the troubleshooter then follow the next steps.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Can you also observe if the same issue occurs when your PC is in<strong> Safe Mode</strong>?</p>
<p><br />
Starting your PC in <strong>Safe Mode</strong> can help you troubleshoot problems on your PC while using a limited set of files and drivers. Here's how to set your PC in
<strong>Safe Mode</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows</strong> +<strong> I </strong>key from the keyboard to launch
<strong>Settings</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Select <strong>Update &amp; Security</strong>, then <strong>Recovery</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click the <strong>Restart now</strong> button under <strong>Advanced startup</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> when you get into the <strong>Choose an option</strong> screen.<br />
</li><li>Select <strong>Advanced options</strong>, then <strong>Startup Settings</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Click<strong> Restart</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Select <strong>4</strong> or press the<strong> F4 </strong>key from the keyboard after your PC restarts to start your PC now in
<strong>Safe Mode</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>To make sure that you're not experiencing an account specific issue, kindly <strong>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/instantanswers/5de907f1-f8ba-4fd9-a89d-efd23fee918c/create-a-local-user-or-administrator-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">create another administrator account</a></strong> and observe if the
 issue will still be present.<br />
<br />
We'll be waiting for your update.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards.</p>

<h2>            How to download free apps without the payment method&#63;</h2>
                    I just bought a tablet with Windows 8.1 and it is already pissing me off. Before I can download anything from the store I need to set the payment method. I dont have any card or paypal nor I intend to use any payment, I just want to download free apps
 and I cant because I have to fill that payment info that I dont have. It has been just an hour since I bought it and If I dont find&nbsp;a way to upgrade or download free apps, Im going to return it and buy Android or iOS device that doesnt force you to input payment
 info for free apps. Apple has the same thing but at least it has an option where you select that you dont have any card and you want just free apps. Help me before my nerves go to **** and I smash the tablet.

            <div>Windows 8.1 Update&nbsp;continues Microsoft’s refinement of its current version of Windows, presenting even greater accessibility to functionality such as Power and Search once hidden in hot corners and menus. Other
 noticeable changes include title bars, minimize and close buttons now available in modern apps. Another great feature includes the ability to pin your favourite modern apps to the Windows Taskbar. Lets take a quick look at getting it up and running on a Windows
 8.1 install.</div>
Details
<div>
<p>Please note, before you can install this update, you need to first ensure you Windows 8.1 installed. If you have Windows 8 which was launched in October 2012, this update will not apply to you. If you want to take advantage of the improvements offered in
 the Windows 8.1 Update, see instructions at the following link how to upgrade from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1:</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Backup:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Just as a precaution, you should backup your computer.</p>
<p>See the following How To Geek article about how to do so:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/167984/how-to-create-and-restore-system-image-backups-on-windows-8.1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/167984/how-to-create-and-restore-system-image-backups-on-windows-8.1/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note, this is standalone Windows Update installers I am using which requires installation in a specific order. On April 8th, Windows Update will take care of this, but for this article sake, I will describe the experience. Depended on your system,
 Windows 8.1 Update 1 is provided as 6 updates, in my case, I only needed to apply 5, since
<em>KB2919442</em> was already installed. </p>

<p>The biggest one of them all is KB2919355, which took quite a while to install. In fact, I did this on my work computer around 3:30 PM and I leave work at 4:30, KB2919355 took about 30 minutes be completed and required a reboot. I recommend you do this at
 a convenient time. </p>

<p>The other updates like KB2932046 <em>called Feature Updates</em>, took less time, but each required a reboot. I stopped after the 3rd and finished up the next day, this means, you don't have install all of them right away. After KB2919355, the unique features
 started to show up, such as Power and Search options appearing on the Start Screen. I understand that boot to desktop is automatically enabled on mouse and keyboard only systems. I already had this enabled.

<p>The other feature updates completed quickly and I was ready to utilize the improvements in Windows 8.1.</p>

            <p>Hi James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error code 0x80070057 signifies that there are some damaged/corrupt System Files which is preventing the installation of the Update. The best thing to do when we see this error message is to use the DISM tool to scan the System and then repair it. In
 order to to that, you should follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>First, open and Admin Command Prompt:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows</strong> and <strong>X</strong> keys together on your Keyboard.</li><li>Click on the <strong>Command Prompt(Admin)</strong> option</li><li>If there is a User Account Control prompt, click <strong>Yes</strong> or <strong>
Continue</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Then, run these commands one by one and let them scan and repair the system:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</strong><br />
</li><li><strong>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</strong></li></ul>
<p><em>Please note,</em> depending on the size of the system, these commands could take long time to complete. Please let them run and finish their job.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have run these commands, please restart the computer and try installing the Update once again. Let us know if this helps or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>[More information on these commands is available in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>The following actions fixed it for me:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try going to: "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\System Tools"</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this folder does not exist (because you changed a few folders around to make the start screen look better for example)</p>
<p>
</p><p>You just go to: "C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs"</p>
<p>and add a new folder "System Tools"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The update installed flawlessly after that.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows 8x you need to be very careful when changing system fonts. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Many of the 'icons' that you see in Windows 8x are actually Font Symbols (Segoe UI Symbol Font). Changing fonts can corrupt the display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example: This link describes what can happen when you change certain system fonts.</p>

<h2>            Slow Windows, getting error 0xC0EA00A in Windows store.</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>I've recently got a laptop. Everything was fine for the first time, but when I started to install things like antivirus (Eset Smart Security), system started to be slow, also wi-fi was slow (propably not problem of laptop, but my router...) After that Windows
 started to crash. I did factory reset. Crashing stopped, but computer was still slow, it took me long time to load and few default apps stopped working.</p>
<p>But that's not main problem.</p>
<p>Today I wanted to download some apps from Windows store, but I got <strong>error&nbsp;</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>0xC0EA00A</strong>. I've already tried running the windows app
<strong>troubleshooter</strong> and resseting windows store with <strong>w</strong></span><strong>sreset.exe</strong>, sadly nothing helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've thought about factory resseting system again, because this is annoying, but I don't know if it's a good idea.<br />
</p>
<p><em>I will be really happy if you help me.</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you.</em><br />

            Has this issue always occurred or just with KB973688 and KB954430 ?<br />
Have you tried manually downloading and installing the updates ?<br />
Did you read the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/954430" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Known issues with this security update section of KB954430</a> and try the Recommended steps ?<br />
<br />
Suggest you download and <strong>save</strong> KB954430 <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>first</strong> </span>. Since you have not specified if the system is 32 or 64 bit.<br />
If you're not sure which architecture the system is, open <strong>System</strong> in Control Panel.
<br />
Look next to <strong>System type </strong>in the right frame to see which architecture the system is.<br />
<br />
<strong>KB954430 for Windows 7</strong> <br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=96a4413c-5261-4f69-83d0-932c430abd14" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 7 for 32-bit Systems</a>

<br />
<br />
Once the download completes <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">read this and configure the system to clean boot</a> .<br />
Booting to what's known as a clean state will ensure that Sophos and printing software (<em><strong>especially HP</strong>
</em>printing software) do <strong><em>not </em></strong>interfere with the update's successful installation.<br />
Once you've clean booted the system, <strong>right click</strong> the saved update and choose
<strong>'Run as administrator'</strong> . <br />
Agree to the UAC prompts to allow the update to install.<br />
<strong>Restart</strong> the system after it's installed. <br />
<br />
Is it still being reoffered or is just KB973688 being reoffered now ?<br />
If KB973688 is the only being reoffered, install it now while the system is still in the
<strong>clean boot </strong>state.<br />
Did that get them both installed ?<br />
<br />
Undo the clean boot steps as laid out in the <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
KB article</a> whether they have or they haven't and please post back with your results.<br />

            It seams to be a virus, scan your computer with updated anti virus and remove the virus or else you can get a free virus removal tool at this link http://www.freedrweb.com/cureit/&nbsp; just download this tool and run it and remove the virus.

<p>It may be malware that MSE can't handle (or it may be a legitimate system file of some sort that has become corrupt and MSE can't get past it).&nbsp; Let's try some other anti-malware&nbsp;software to see if we can get past this problem.&nbsp;
<span>
Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:
</span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and
</span><span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span><span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a></span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span><span>You may also want to try the free Avira at:
</span></span><span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a></span><span>
 and Avast at: </span><span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a></span><span>.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Reboot after completing all the scans.<span>&nbsp; </span>
You may also want to try the free OneCare at </span><span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></span></a></span><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></p>
<p><span>BTW, what is the EXACT spelling of the filename - you spell it different in your header and in the body of your post.&nbsp; I'm especially interested to see how
 malwarebytes treats this file.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

<p>Another thing you can try is to scan your system for general corruption or corrupt system files (which may include this file if it isn't malware).&nbsp; In the process of repairing the corruption,&nbsp;it may repair whatever is causing MSE to freeze when it comes
 to that file.&nbsp; It may not be able to repair all corruption without the Vista Installation Disk but some it can repair without it (and hopefully that will be the case here).</p>
<div>
<p><span>Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator
 (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning mscoree.dll (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools
 / Event Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:

</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps (or that the anti-malware programs help).</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!<br />

<p>malwarebytes found trojan.vundo, then it did the same, it froze up, all i can see is my background image, can't get back to explorer or even the taskmanager, i am going to follow up on your instructions, ... i'll let you know</p>

<p>Good.&nbsp; Maybe we'll discover the problem with those scans.&nbsp; I've quire frankly never heard of a file freezing anti-malware software (let alone two different ones).&nbsp; There's something definitely strange going on with that file but I don't know what it is (perhaps
 corruption or perhaps a new malware that the anti-malware vendors haven't yet included in their updates).</p>
<p>I await the results of your efforts.&nbsp; BTW, do you have a genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk or only a Recovery Disk or Recovery Partition from the manufacturer?</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>well so far windows resource protection did not find any integrity violations.</p>
<p>malwarebytes still freezes, but now on a different file, i must run it again to see what file that is , as i was just having a bite to eat as my system froze up.</p>
<p>unfortunatly its an acer aspire 5920 that comes with a recovery partition from the manufacturer.</p>
<p>this is my first time using the event viewer, here are some warnings and errors that might tell us somthing, i really have no idea...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in the eventviewer it is clear that updates, and scans cause the system to crash several times</p>
<p>HERE IS A LIST OF EVENTS AND ERRORS STARTING AT THE DATE THAT I FIRST EXPERIENCED PROBLEMS, IT THE OLDEST IS AT THE BOTTOM, SO READ YOUR WAY UP !</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>: The embedded controller (EC) did not respond within the specified timeout period. This may indicate that there is an error in the EC hardware or firmware or that the BIOS is accessing the EC incorrectly. You should check with your computer manufacturer
 for an upgraded BIOS. In some situations, this error may cause the computer to function incorrectly.</p>
<p>: The Parallel port driver service failed to start due to the following error:
<br />
The service cannot be started, either because it is disabled or because it has no enabled devices associated with it.</p>
<p>: The description for Event ID 1003 from source Microsoft-Windows-Dhcp-Client cannot be found. Either the component that raises this event is not installed on your local computer or the installation is corrupted. You can install or repair the component on
 the local computer.<br />

<p>It it has happened with three well-known and respected anti-malware programs, then there is definitely something going on in your system.</p>
<p>There are a lot of errors in the Event Log, but I could find nothing that relates to this problem (though there may be something there - I'm only marginally familiar with analyzing Event Viewer reports and I look for patterns or repetitions or indications
 of bad or missing/corrupted files.&nbsp; The message about the BIOS concerns me - but though it should be addressed, I don't believe it is the cause of this problem.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the options we're left with will hopefully resolve all those errors as well as the
 error that is the subject of this thread.</p>
<p>It looks like <span>
we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work.&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install
 (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>If you don't have the disk and can't get your hands on one (it would be really best if you could),
<span>
then I'm afraid the only option is a clean install.&nbsp; You can use Knoppix </span><a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;with
 a good ISO copier like: </span><a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with a blank CD.&nbsp; This should give you enough access to the system (if you can't get in any other way but I don't think that's a problem for you) to backup your important data.&nbsp; Once done, you can do a clean install either using the genuine Windows Vista Installation
 Disk or the Recovery Disk or the Recovery Partition (whatever process is dictated by your computer manufacturer – you may need to contact them for the procedure and perhaps to get recovery disks).&nbsp; To do a clean install proceed as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_install_03.asp</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;(adapted
 as necessary by the procedures of your computer manufacturer).&nbsp; Then you will need to re-install all your programs, reset all your preferences, reconfigure your network and email settings, restore your backed up data, run Windows Update with possibly nearly
 100 updates pending,...</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>NOTE: Once you've completed the backup if you're doing a clean
 install and since you have nothing to lose, try deleting the mscoree.dll file.&nbsp; If normal delete doesn't work, r<span>ry using one of the following free products to
 delete the file/folder.&nbsp; Unlocker at: </span><span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/System-Miscellaneous/Unlocker.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/System-Miscellaneous/Unlocker.shtml</span></span></a></span><span>
 or File Assassin </span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/fileassassin.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/fileassassin.php</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;(with
 or without Force Delete: </span><span><a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2008/12/27/force-delete-cannot-delete-locked-or-in-used-files-or-folders-with-fileassassin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.mydigitallife.info/2008/12/27/force-delete-cannot-delete-locked-or-in-used-files-or-folders-with-fileassassin/</span></span></a></span><span>).
 These programs often work when normal Vista delete functions fail to operate properly.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may need to revise the permissions and ownership to allow
 this deletion.&nbsp; Here's how to do that.</span></span></p>
<span><span>
<p><span>To see your permissions, right click the folder/file, click on properties, and check out the security tab.&nbsp; Check to see what permissions
 you have by clicking on your username (or user group).&nbsp; Here are&nbsp;the types of permissions you can have:
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-are-permissions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-are-permissions</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 You need to be an administrator or the&nbsp;owner to change permissions (and sometimes being an administrator or even an owner isn't enough - there are ways to block even them from access (though a smart administrator knows these ways and can get around them -
 but usually shouldn't because they were denied access usually for a very good reason).&nbsp; Here's how to change folder permissions in Vista:
</span><a href="http://www.online-tech-tips.com/windows-vista/set-file-folder-permissions-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.online-tech-tips.com/windows-vista/set-file-folder-permissions-vista/</span></span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To add take and grant full right permissions and ownership to the right click menu (which will make it faster to get in once it is set up), check out the following article:
</span><a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/05/21/take-and-grant-full-control-permissions-and-ownership-in-windows-7-or-vista-right-click-menu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.mydigitallife.info/2009/05/21/take-and-grant-full-control-permissions-and-ownership-in-windows-7-or-vista-right-click-menu/</span></span></a><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span><span>.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span>To fix this problem with the folders, take
 Owner tab.&nbsp; Click edit and then click the name of the person you want to give ownership to (you may need to add it if it isn't there - or it may be yourself). If you want it to apply to sub-folders and files within that folder/drive, then check the box for
 replace owner on sub-containers and objects and click OK.&nbsp; Back out and now there's a new owner for the folders/drive and files who can change permissions as needed.&nbsp; You can now change them from read-only (even if the main folder says they still are read
 only - you can have access yourself as the owner).&nbsp; You can keep them as read-only for other users and guests and even administrators (though they can take ownership themselves and gain access if they so desire and there really isn't much you can do to stop
 this except protect the folder with a password using a 3rd party product.&nbsp; Here's more information on taking ownership of a file or folder:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67717-take-ownership-file.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67717-take-ownership-file.html</span></span></a></span><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To add take ownership to the right click menu (which will make it faster to get in once it is set up), check out the following article:
</span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/add-take-ownership-to-explorer-right-click-menu-in-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/add-take-ownership-to-explorer-right-click-menu-in-vista/</span></span></a></span><span><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>.</span></span></span></span><span><br />
<br />
I realize this is a lot of effort (and we're not sure it will work or that it will help or if it will cause even more problems), but if we can remove the file and the system still functions normally (and the anti-malware scans can complete properly) then that's
 probably better than a clean re-installation if that's the only remaining option and you've decided to do it.&nbsp; But the choice is yours.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with Sony&nbsp;Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their<br />
forums about any known issues. Update BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major<br />
on-board device drivers. If no Windows 8 versions exist try the latest Windows 7 versions.<br />
Be sure to ASK Sony Support and in their forums because there are likely to be known<br />
issues.<br />

Translate the Windows 7 methods to Windows 8 (there is little difference) :<br />
<br />
Troubleshoot camera connection problems<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Troubleshoot-camera-connection-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Troubleshoot-camera-connection-problems</a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You probably need to reload the camera drivers&nbsp;and any camera control software (usually
<br />
included with the drivers and&nbsp;installed at the same time).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Logon as Admin.<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your
<br />
system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address
<br />
of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and
<br />
more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most
<br />
current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and
<br />
complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the
<br />
version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind
<br />
certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver
<br />
stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if <br />
3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you
<br />
have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then
<br />
Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions.
<br />
(Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT <br />
after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing
<br />
actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed
<br />
(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is
<br />
installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

            <p>Which programs and services start with Windows is a Windows function, so you'd have to tell us which version you're using to be able to help. Windows Live Mail doesn't have a setting to start automatically, so the support tech must have arranged this for
 you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On Windows 10, Task Manager provides a simple utility to enable or disable automatic start-ups. Press Ctrl-Shift-Escape to start Task Manager, then look on the
<em>Start-up</em> tab.</p>

<p>Windows Live Messenger is a different program from Windows Live Mail. It was discontinued more than three years ago.
