<h2>            Can&#39;t finish multiplayer tests &#40;0x0000000000000000&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I am unable to get my console fully online. When connection to my house's internet, my console says it is connected to the internet, but then I&nbsp;go to the home screen and it still says I'm not on xbox live. Then when I&nbsp;go to do a multiplayer test, an error keeps coming up where it says "can't finish multiplayer tests". Ive tried reseting my router, and have done multiple hard resets on my console (hold the power button for eight seconds, unplug, wait 5 mins, plug back in and power on and try again). I just tried to do a hard reset plus removing my account from my console, but now my console isn't letting me log into my account because it still thinks its not connected to internet/xbox live even tho it is showing that I am connected to the internet on my network settings page. I now have no way of getting my account back on my console.&nbsp;NAT type is also showing up as unavailable. What can I do to fix this issue?</p>

            Latest I have been told is that the access point could have a badly configured mtu setting. Of course the Tech I was talking to couldn't access the settings so I am now waiting on someone else to look at it . Live in an apartment with free wifi so I can
 not access it directly.

    <title>Moving UK to Canada - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> suicide perkies  say:</h3>
<h2>            Moving UK to Canada</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm preparing to move from the UK to Canada. I have a LOT of games as well as my PAL 360 that I've had since 2006.</p>
<p>I am well aware of the various region-coding issues I will face.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What is the best option for me? As it stands, my PAL 360 and a voltage convertor seems most practical, as the 360 is nearing the end of its lifespan and I can continue to import PAL games until the end of this generation. If I were to buy a second, NTSC
 console (or indeed, just bring my hard drive with me and then recover my gamertag onto an NTSC 360) I would be saying goodbye to a lot of games that were never released in the NTSC region.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I've seen elsewhere in similar posts that the official advice is to just 'create another gamertag' which I absolutely will
<strong>not</strong> do. &nbsp;I haven't played for six years to just throw it all away.</p>

<p>Any input is welcomed.</p>

<p>well you could just use a converter for the Xbox and order all of your games either region free or in PAL format.</p>
<p>If you just &nbsp;use a converter for Xbox 360 you could play all of your games</p>

<p><span>If you don't end up creating a new account then you will not be able to do a lot of things this includes:</span><br />
<br />
<span>Purchasing Microsoft Points</span><br />
<span>Renewing your membership</span><br />
<span>Purchasing certain games using existing points on the account due to regional restrictions<br />
</span>If you delete something off of your hard drive, once your in Canada you won't be able to re-download certain content that is region locked (no way to know which content is or isn't)<br />
<br />
<span>These are just a few of the reasons why they actually ask that you make a new account.</span><br />
<br />
<span>As far as your XBOX 360 you will need to get a new power supply as your UK power supply will not work in Canada they are totally different voltages and that can cause problems for the console and the power supply if you try to use a converter.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
And you've got the games portion already covered if you intend on getting games imported (mind you, you may have issues with DLC content for those games)&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Do North American Live/Points card codes really not work on a European system? What if I just redeem them through the Live website instead?
</p>
<p>It's ridiculous they want people to make a new account. You don't encourage people to become really attached to their account with achievements and avatar stuff and then expect them to just throw it all away, especially in a system that actively encourages
 you to play with people from all over the world.</p>
<p>Voltage stuff I have no problem with. As I said above, I know how they work and have one here for my childhood Genesis to let it run on 220v UK power.</p>
<p>Would love an answer from an Xbox representative.</p>

<p>The XBOX isn't the issue (only an issue with the games that you've already said you'd import)<br />
<br />
The issue is that you have an account that was originally created in the UK and won't be in the same region that you are now moving to (Canada), so if you switch credit cards and billing information you won't be able to buy points from XBOX.com or the console
 because you will not be able to complete a transaction as the billing information won't match because you cannot switch the country on an XBOX Live account once it's been created.<br />
<br />
The only way you'd be able to get Microsoft Points would be if you purchased them from an online retailer or had someone purchase them for you in the UK so you could use them on the account, same with XBOX Live renewal.<br />
<br />
There are different point values for Canada and the United Kingdom in terms of XBOX Live points and if there is a region mismatch on the account (UK point cards will not work on Canadian accounts and visa versa)<br />
<br />
You can take a look at the different point values for each region where cards are sold
<strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Points" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong> as Microsoft Points and XBOX Live Subscription cards are region locked.<br />
<br />
But again, you will have issues with certain DLC and content downloads as your region will not match.</p>

<p>And so, you're right. The whole thing is compete BS. Whether I take my old console with me or not, my current account will still exist with everything that I've paid for on it, and if the Xbox 720 comes out and I want to use my account on that... I won't
 be able to! It'll still be a UK account on a Canadian 720 and I'll still be screwed.</p>
<p>MS could easily allow you to change whichever region you're in on the proviso that you might lose access to some downloaded content, that would almost be fine compared to the current situation. Six years membership and over one hundred games, down the drain.
 Lovely.</p>
<p>(oh, and I don't have any credit card details entered on my account any more... several friends got hacked in further testament to MS' incompetence)</p>
<p>Thanks for the info, Hassassinade.</p>

<h2>            Windows Update &#38; BitLocker Recovery Key Problems</h2>
                    <p>Date: 17 Aug 2018</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently purchased a Surface Book 2 with Windows 10. Today I was prompted to restart my computer in order to install a windows update. However, after the updates finished, I turned on my computer and found that I needer to enter my Bitlocker Recovery Key
 because&nbsp;secure boot policy has unexpectedly changed windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having entered the key 20+ times, every single option (from resetting windows to a previous version, to command prompt, to factory resetting my computer) ultimately does nothing and returns me to the 'Enter Recovery Key' page, hence trapping me in this never
 ending cycle of having to enter this code again and again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise. Laptop barely 2 weeks old with few personal files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            Unknown programs in Programs and features&#47;search can&#39;t find the clipboard</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Frustrated and confused&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope I did this right. Your email said to copy and paste an address to my browser if my laptop was running Windows, so I did,&nbsp;but I was confused on how to post at that point because that was not a visible option, so I just followed other options. I don't
 remember having to join the community last time, I think I simply fell in. Just add this to the confusion list. OK, so here I am. I've thought about this really hard and tried to stop my mind from spinning out of control. The best way I can describe my situation
 is this:<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;Imagine that you bought a laptop from your friend. It is your first computer ever and you are aware that it may have issues like viruses and whatnot, but you are hopeful that anything can be fixed if you put some effort into it. Well, for weeks and weeks
 you battle with the problems, but it is never ending with problems and you just&nbsp;can't handle the stress of it anymore,&nbsp;so you sadly and angrily give up and lay it to rest in storage. That was your first computer ever. 4 years later, you finally have the money
 to buy a brand new one and although your first experience was horrible, you're sure that a brand new one will be different. So you go and purchase your second computer/laptop ever and you're very excited of course. You get home, open it up, read the plastic
 bag message says if you don't want it don't break open this bag, yada yada. There's no manual, but it has a quickstart guide. You read it with the intent to follow all the instructions, because you DON'T want anything to go wrong. You don't even get online
 right away, for fear of catching something before you can make recovery media. You are as careful as ever. You make your recovery disks just as it stated in your quickstart guide, then you connect to your router.&nbsp;Somewhere in there you&nbsp;get confused when you
 are forced to create a Microsoft account, because you already have an email address older than dirt, but you make one with Microsoft cause you can't get to the next step without making one. You don't really pay attention to the email you made up, cause you
 already have an email and you figure you won't need the Microsoft&nbsp;one. You just want to use your brand new laptop and check stuff out. Well, things are going fine for about a week or so, until you can't find something, so you open your programs and features
 to take a look at what's going on and you see an exact duplicate of your old laptop's programs. You remember them well, because it was one of the worst experiences of your life. The installation dates on them range from the year before to many years before.
 Horrified, you begin to right click each one to check "properties" and your fears&nbsp;escalate with each driver dated as old as 1996 and&nbsp;of course the "Unknown application"&nbsp;ones. Franticly you erase the entire hard disk,. You're sure the recovery media will fix
 the problem anyhow, but when you've completed the recovery process and click on "programs and features" the same old programs are right back again.&nbsp;So you uninstall, erase, delete, change your laptop's name and your user name, but they come back. You are now
 faced with the same situation you were hoping to avoid. You also realize that if this is happening again,&nbsp;what's to stop it from attaching to the next laptop you bring back, should you exchange&nbsp;this one? So, the battle continues daily for over a month and
 sadly when you give up, you're one week too late to exchange it. So the battle continues every day for another month etc..... You erase, change passwords,&nbsp;change user names, laptop names, change email addresses, etc.... everything and anything you can think
 of to make it go away. In all this confusion and frustration, you realize that Microsoft is wondering what the hell is going on too! You also realize that you were supposed to confirm your email addresses and whatnot, but you didn't know any of that, but now
 you do, but the battle continues and you are exhausted, your mouse pointer moves on it's own sometimes and occasionally clicks things you didn't want. You become suspicious of every agent who offers help, even Microsoft. You don't know what's going on at all.
 Some are telling you that you're in a whole other country..... scary stuff. Microsoft is asking you what passwords you used previously which gets you suspicious, cause why would they ask that? It's just a big jumbled mess of "I don't know what happened, but
 something isn't right." For some reason your laptop was being changed into a tablet (that was more toward the beginning). You even pay Toshiba techs to come in remotely even though you're not even sure if they're legit. Costs you 160.00 and the problem still
 persists.&nbsp; A virus has never been found, malware has, but it was supposedly removed. Your issue still persists. That sums it up a little...... I guess the new name for things is "device". I don't know this stuff. I call it a laptop, that's what it is. Syncing
 confuses me and apparently my "device" somehow synced with my other "device" aka "cell phone", but I was unaware of that. It didn't ask me if it could go online.... I would've said no. Anyhow,&nbsp;it seems that the start screen thinks it's a cell phone and the&nbsp;desktop&nbsp;area&nbsp;thinks
 it's the dead Toshiba laptop from 4 years ago........ I need help here. I am exhausted.&nbsp; I also think it has&nbsp;multiplied&nbsp;this dead laptop/cell phone image of itself for some reason unknown to me, cause the task manager runs tasks that&nbsp;expand now. I'm not sure
 if it ran other tasks within a task before. I disabled the internal&nbsp;(something) 3 controller and disabled the built in LAN (which I still don't know what that is exactly), but I disabled both to see if that helps.... so far&nbsp;it doesn't. In the device manager,
 it has so much stuff there and so many bridges I could probably build several cities with the stuff there. The router is for FIOS here. We have no family/group/home network group action. If this thing tells me I need administrator approval one more time, I
 think I'm gonna blow. I have great patience, but it's hard to fight something you don't understand. Nothing should be telling me I need approval though. I don't know what this "Administrator" stuff is, but it really chaps my hide. And what's with the sea of
 names in the security tab section off of the properties thing? At one point I made myself the owner of everything&nbsp;I could&nbsp;past C:/&nbsp;&nbsp; cause it's all so irritating. That did help&nbsp;things run a bit smoother, but I'd like it to just be the way it's supposed to
 be. There's lots more and if I had the energy I'd write a book. Hopefully you can help me, I'm stumped. Please don't ask for screen shots to help you see what I'm talking about, cause I've already tried. Nothing happens and&nbsp;search can't find the clipboard,
 so I can't show anyone anything regarding what I'm talking about. Here's something funny that I'll end on though...... Our neighbor came over and he&nbsp;immediately started dogging me.&nbsp;I was gonna say something wonderful and uplifting about how far humans have
 advanced compared to other animals since the iceage, but the moment I said the word evolution or evolved, (which was&nbsp;about the 5th word into my story),&nbsp;he immediately freight trained me and told me I was wrong and that human beings have&nbsp;not evolved at all
 from the time of the ice age to now. So after&nbsp;several of these freight train attacks,&nbsp;I said, "fine," and asked if he would accept the word "adapt." He agreed (but&nbsp;I had lost the desire to share&nbsp;my beautiful thought with him ), so I asked him to look up the
 definition for adapt, to be sure I understood the word I was going to use.&nbsp;He pulled out his huge smartphone and began typing the word. I giggled to myself, smiled&nbsp;and said, "Microsoft likes to play around here."&nbsp;&nbsp;With great confidence and so full of himself,&nbsp;he
 beamed as he said, "Adapt.........the ability to adapt......adaptation..........." then I watched as his&nbsp;look changed&nbsp;to confusion. I&nbsp;wanted to bust out laughing.&nbsp;I said..... "That's the definition?"&nbsp;He&nbsp;didn't answer, cause he was still looking for a definition
 LOL!&nbsp;It felt wonderful to have someone else experience what I've been going through, but it was even more gratifying that it happened to him.<br />

            <p>Thanks Mike.</p>
<p>The laptop I just bought "is" Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>The reason I know that for a fact is because&nbsp;it's printed on&nbsp;the small, metal ID&nbsp;label&nbsp;on&nbsp;the underside of the chassis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;And if it is impossible for a new laptop to be possessed by&nbsp;it's dead predecessor, then I am witness to the impossible.&nbsp; All of the refreshing and whatnot I have done for the last 3 months did help in making the installation dates change to the year&nbsp;2014
 though, so it is getting better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;As for screwing&nbsp;it up, I did everything according to the quick guide,(more like a&nbsp;pamphlet),&nbsp;which was all I had to begin with and&nbsp;I was very careful, but you already know that I was extremely careful because you read my story. (I love the Metro front end
 part that you said, it makes no sense to me, but&nbsp;it reminds me of Vegas :)).</p>
<p>&nbsp;I am registered with Toshiba&nbsp;both with this laptop and the old one&nbsp;and have been to their support site countless times. I registered this one&nbsp;on its birthday, on&nbsp;the registration screen&nbsp;that comes after&nbsp;you put in your country and time zone and agree&nbsp;to
 rules screen. I was very careful&nbsp;to make sure everything went right.&nbsp;I even&nbsp;made my own recovery media (3 disks) by following the instructions in the quick start pamphlet.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I am willing to try your&nbsp;Toshiba support site link.&nbsp;Maybe your Toshiba support site&nbsp;link goes to a different Toshiba support site than my Toshiba support site link goes to. Seems impossible, but.........</p>
<p>&nbsp;I hope your&nbsp;link doesn't screw up&nbsp;the progress I've made on my laptop&nbsp;LOL!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;Oh, I remember customizing instead of using the express/recommended settings, because I didn't want to go online or connect with anything before I could make the recovery media. That's how careful I was. However, I did say yes to connect with other devices
 later,&nbsp;after creating the recovery media, because I felt safe at that point and besides,&nbsp;it would be impossible for a tv or vcr or stb box to do any harm, right? Well, that's when stuff started downloading like crazy and well, you know the story....</p>
<p>&nbsp;I did forget about my dad's laptop though, but his is a Dell.&nbsp; Is it impossible to assume one of these devices may be the culprit? And if so, how can I warn others&nbsp;before they go following directions and trusting their&nbsp;TVs?&nbsp;No one should ever have to go
 through the torture I'm going through with this. I'm even extra cautious because I've already been a victim of identity theft and&nbsp;horrified at the thought of it ever happening again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I&nbsp;have been&nbsp;terrified to tears nearly every day since this started, but I try to keep a Metro type front ;)&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Your initial post did not mention any progress at all. The Toshiba link I gave will result in everything being wiped out and started over, so don't go there unless that is what you want to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other links I gave were to set you up so you didn't have to use the Metro tiles, a far more reliable way of&nbsp;working than the tiles will ever probably be.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unless you are specific re the problems, I can't help you. I need more problem detail and less of the descriptions re previous owners of the computers etc..&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Windows 8 is initially set up, there is NO WAY that any other computer can affect it.. :-)</p>

            <p>ok....I think you're going faster than me, which wouldn't surprise me one bit.</p>
<p>I'll explain in a shorter way.</p>
<p>I just bought this laptop in late August this year from Best Buy. I am an elite member&nbsp;there. This laptop is brand new. It has never had a previous owner nor another user but me. When I&nbsp;right clicked the windows icon in the lower left corner of the screen
 and clicked on programs and features,&nbsp;all of the programs were dated from years ago and some&nbsp;were even named "unknown" when I&nbsp;looked at&nbsp;their properties.</p>
<p>When I clicked to check their drivers, some of them had drivers dated as far back as 1996.</p>
<p>This is alarming to me.</p>
<p>I remember these programs being on my old laptop. Some of them I downloaded myself from the Toshiba support site in desperate attempts to help that poor&nbsp;machine....... I failed.</p>
<p>Now, whether or not they are exact replicas of the old laptop, I am still confused as to why and how old programs are on this new laptop and how do I stop this from happening to me or anyone else?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The rest below is&nbsp;more detailed about&nbsp;the&nbsp;old laptop story, you don't have to read it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They are a mirror image of the programs that were on my old laptop 4 years ago.</p>
<p>My old laptop was used.</p>
<p>I bought it from my friend, who had&nbsp;bought it from her friend, who's mother had owned&nbsp;it before she died.</p>
<p>I don't know if the original owner ever&nbsp;made or had a recovery disk and I will never know.</p>
<p>The friend I bought it from was using a Microsoft disk that a completely different friend gave to her to use, cause she was having trouble and needed a disk for it.&nbsp;Whatever disk he gave her to use,&nbsp;was the same disk she gave to me to use with it.&nbsp;That was
 all she had. Whether it was the proper OS for that particular laptop, I don't know, but&nbsp;it worked&nbsp;to boot the system up.</p>
<p>I think that anything can be fixed, so I bought it from her knowing it had problems.</p>
<p>I experimented with it as best I could and tried to help it, but it just got worse and the disk seemed to no longer help much either.</p>
<p>I remember being so frustrated about it. There were programs I downloaded from the Toshiba site in desperate attempts to help it, but nothing seemed to work. It got to the point where it seemed that many users were trying to operate it, which **** me off
 because I owned it and no one else had the right to remote it or whatever&nbsp;they were doing&nbsp;to it. I became so angry and frustrated.&nbsp;It seemed many people were abusing that poor laptop via malware/viruses, whatever. It was horrible.&nbsp;It became too much for me
 and I put it away. I think I tried again later, but same thing, so it is now miles away in storage.</p>
<p>Someone made a comment to me about my new laptop&nbsp;being nothing more than a mindless drone...... ridiculous as this may sound, I take offense to comments like that.&nbsp;Machine or not, they should be respected. I respect the&nbsp;Human Machine too.</p>

            Thank you&nbsp;for your time and information :) Ok, I'll wait a bit then and see if these programs change their&nbsp;dates&nbsp;and hopefully the "unknown" programs will get a manufacturer's name too. I'm still open for more suggestions while I wait though.

            <p>Thank you. You may be right about the delving too deeply. I grew up hard and learned early to fix things on my own cause no one will/can help or they know less than you lol. The world is changing though and I'm finding help. It is relieving to say the least.
 I'm not sure why screenshot doesn't work. Maybe I'm not doing it right. It's easier when other's can see what you're talking about. The laptop is functioning and fast too, so it seems alright. The old programs do creep me out though. So far it seems happy
 and healthy, so....I'm relaxing more about it. It's not being attacked that I can see and neither am I. Safety is important to me. I'm always on guard.&nbsp; Thank you for responding :)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. When I'm uncertain of things, I explore, so I can learn and reassure myself things are fine&nbsp;or find&nbsp;the problem (if any) and fix it. I'm thinking now,&nbsp;that my Google account may have been corrupted or something messed up, but I'm uncertain, so I'm still
 exploring a bit, but I'm not as frightened as I was earlier and that's mostly thanks to Microsoft's team.&nbsp;They've been a great relief to me and invaluable in their patience and&nbsp;help. I know I can be confusing when I'm confused. Anyhow, I may have to start
 another discussion regarding my Google, though even these discussion rooms are new to me. In all my confusion I forgot my Google password (I have sooooo many changed passwords from being frightened) so I entered my email and it told me the email didn't exist,
 so I tried opening a new account and after I finished down to proving I'm not a robot, it said that email already existed, so...... what do you do? I just X'd out and left instead of getting frustrated. At some point I will have to figure it all out though,
 cause I can't view certain videos unless I am over 18 with an account and I am 44 lol. I have been with Google for like 10 yrs, but I closed my account when all this stuff was happening.&nbsp;There's more to it, but only writing a book can explain it unfortunately&nbsp;lol...
 cause, there's&nbsp;a lot of stuff I'm questioning and/or curious about.</p>

<h2>            Forza Horizon 3 doesn&#39;t Start</h2>
                    <p>I'm having trouble playing forza horizon 3 on my PC. I played the demo, to test if I could run it, and I can. I purchased the game via Microsoft Store and installed it. Every time I try to start the game, the initial window comes up but crashes after a milisecond.
 I've tried everything I've seen in forums, reseting the game, unninstalling it, I upated all my .DLL files just in case, updated my drives and even so the game does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 10 Home N, Intel I5-6500 @ 3.20 Ghz. 64 bit operanting system. 8GB of Ram and a GTX960 GPU.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please help me? I spent a lot of money and now I have no money and no game!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            Hi again. Nothing you suggested fixed the problem. If I can play the demo why cant Í play the full game? I'm really disapointed, 50€ for a game that does not have a refund option and doesn't even work. I need help please. Simeone.

<p>Thank you for your response. If you are still unable to launch or play the game, we recommend that you follow the suggested solutions below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Solution 1</strong>. Update the graphics card drivers.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Select the <strong>Start</strong> button, type<strong> Device Manager</strong>, and select it from the list of results.
</span></li><li><span>Expand one of the categories to find the name of your device, then right-click (or tap and hold) it, and select
<strong>Update Driver</strong>. For graphics cards, expand the <strong>Display adapters</strong> category, right-click your graphics card and select
<strong>Update Driver</strong>. </span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Search automatically for updated driver software</strong>.
</span></li><li><span>If Windows doesn't find a new driver, you can try looking for one on the device manufacturer's website and follow their instructions.
</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>If these steps don't work, try reinstalling the driver: </span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Open the <strong>Device Manager.</strong></span></li><li><span>Right-click (or tap and hold) the name of the device.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Uninstall</strong>. </span></li><li><span>Restart your PC and Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Solution 2</strong>. Reset the </span><span>Windows Store to clear the Store cache</span><span>.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press&nbsp;<strong>Windows key + X</strong>&nbsp;on your keyboard.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
</span></li><li><span>Click on&nbsp;<strong>Command prompt (Admin)</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></li><li><span>Type&nbsp;<strong>wsreset.exe</strong>, and then hit Enter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Solution 3</strong>. <span>Reset the game from the Settings menu. This process can help restore corrupted game installation files.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press the <strong>Windows key</strong> on your keyboard, and then click
<strong>Settings</strong>.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></li><li><span>Select <strong>System</strong>, and then select <strong>Apps &amp; features</strong>.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></li><li><span>Find the game, and then click on <strong>Advanced</strong> options.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></li><li><span>Click <strong>Reset</strong>.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></li><li><span>Restart your computer for the changes to take effect.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Solution 4</strong>. <span>Remove temporary files.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span>Temporary files are automatically deleted after exiting an application or a game. However, restarting your computer without exiting an active Windows session won't delete temporary files. These files may cause issues running games on Windows 10.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Press the <strong>Windows key</strong> on your keyboard, and then click the Settings icon.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></li><li><span>Select <strong>System</strong>, and then select <strong>Storage</strong>.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Hi. Tried everything but nothing Works. It's unnacceptable buying a game for 50€ And not be playing it because it does not work on your own platform and OS. Worse than that is being accompanied by a BOT. Need help urgently

<p>Hi Erwin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to hold just the surface screen in my hand while doing a beamer presentation ?</p>
<p>Audio is not important, just showing the content and making remarks with the pen on the surface screen and duplicated on the beamer projection.</p>
<p>It was told to me in the shop, that was possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i think its only possible having a wireless connection to a beamer ?</p>

Nginx is NOT A VIRUS! It’s an open source web server and a reverse proxy server. When you get the
<strong>“Welcome to Nginx!”</strong> (that’s pronounced ‘engine x’) message, something may have gone awry on the server side.<span style="font-weight: bold">
</span><a href="http://123seminarsonly.com/Blog/is-the-nginx-virus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Here’s what you can try…</a><br />
<br />
<br />
1: Empty your browser cache by deleting all temp files and (possibly defective) <span>
cookies</span>, then re-start your machine. <span>Problem solved</span>? Fine, if not, read on…
<p>2: Reboot your <span>router</span> – unplug it, wait about a minute, and then <span>
plug</span> <span>it back</span> in. This could also work…</p>

<h2>            Ripping music with windows 10</h2>
                    Help! &nbsp;I've just got a new laptop and am still getting used to windows 10. It came with Windows Media Player, but when I try to 'rip' a cd I noticed there was no 'Rip' Button to click, I've tried 'dragging and dropping' then syncing, but it still doesn't
 work. &nbsp;I tried the 'manage libraries' but there is only the one library on there, which is the default one. Can anyone help please??

                    I recently purchased a Netgear WNR854T. I have contacted Netgear a trouble shooted the router which everything works, the only problem is when I connect my computer to the router there is no response from the computer or the router. The cables are fine,
 when I connect the modem directly to the computer I have internet. For some reason there is no receognition between the router and the computer.<br />

            Hi Oscarphish,<br />
<br />
It sounds like the router and pc are not talking, either because of an error in the setup or conncetions.&nbsp;You need to make sure that the IP address for your computer is in the same range as your router (eg 192.168.1.xxx) and make sure that the cable from your
 pc is in&nbsp;a 'LAN' slot on the router and the cable from the modem plugs into the 'WAN' port on the router&nbsp;. Here is a link to a how-to Microsoft article on hooking up a home network:<br />
<br />

<p>Bit of a bump up the forums - I see others who claim they want this to be a community have joined the unofficial January gamerscore challenge thus proving that they didn't really want to be a community they were just saying they did.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said we still have the most competitors including a&nbsp;multi time gamerscore challenge winner from last year, so if you want to see how you match up against the rest of the community - join now!</p>

<p>Hey Scozz, Thanks for posting - I wonder why you felt the need to set up a second challenge when I had already set this one up as a natural successor to the annual monthly ones usually ran on here? Are you seeking to divide the community when it was informally
 agreed by others to try and draw a line under previous arguments?</p>

<p>Wonderfulwest - Your actions spoke louder then your words as it appeared you tried to shun this challenge when I was reaching out the hand of friendship as you suggested I should. I apologise!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I invite you again to join this challenge in the interests of&nbsp;drawing a line under it all for the new year and to unite the community, you can leave the challenge you are in or asked to be removed and join this one if you were commited to that.</p>

<h2>            Halo 5 Forge PC Issues - AMD</h2>
                    <p>So I was finally able to download Halo 5 Forge for Windows over the weekend. To my dismay, it won't launch. getting two errors 8x80000001 and 8x80000003. Here is my setup:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Processor: AMD A10-6800K</p>
<p>GPU: Radeon HD6950</p>
<p>RAM: 8 Gb</p>
<p>OS: Windows 10 Anniversary&nbsp;</p>
<p>dxdiag shows Directx 12 (just updated to all of the latest drivers as well)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 doesn't seem to want to recognize that my CPU has 4 cores, it only finds 2 when looking at cpu graph.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else ran into this? Any fix been discovered yet? Or is this M$' way of telling people to go buy some intel hardware?<br />

            The first error, 8x80000001, is letting you know that your cpu is not supported by the game. You will need at least an fx 6100 or intel equivalent to run Halo 5: Forge, and the A-seried apus have nowhere near the performance necessary. THe A10s are the
 closest, as they're pretty much on par with the athlons, but it's still not going to suffice for the minimum requirement check. Second, your graphics card does not support DX12. The drivers may be causing it to show up as dx12 compatible, but the 6950 is not
 on the list of supported cards. Even if it was, your cpu will not be enough to get by the minimum spec, and in my experience, even the supposedly supported fx 6xxx series don't work (for some odd reason). The only way you're going to be able to play is by
 either spending 400+ US dollars to upgrade your cpu, gpu, and motherboard, or by hoping that eventually there will be a workaround or exploit to get past the requirement check (which I still wouldn't recommend).

<p><span><b>Method 1</b>: If a Windows Resource Protection (WRP) file is missing or is corrupted, Windows may not behave as expected. Run System File Checker

    <title>My documents folder shortcut keeps reverting to a public document - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            My documents folder shortcut keeps reverting to a public document folder</h2>
                    My documents folder shortcut keeps reverting to a public document shortcut.&nbsp; THis do not just happen on the desktop, but when saving files, the shortcut changes to public documents folder, instead of staying as my main documents folder.&nbsp; I do not have
 public sharing enabled, so do not know why this is happening.&nbsp; All I do know is that I want it to stop.&nbsp; How do I do this please?&nbsp; The location of the desktop shortcut changes from C:\Users\C\Documents to C:\Users\Public\Documents.&nbsp; I have tried deleting the
 public documents folder, but Vista keeps putting it back.<br />
<br />
Also, in the start menu on the right hand pane, the documents folder there has lost the location.&nbsp; It will not allow me to type in C:\Users\C\Documents.&nbsp; How do I fix that?<br />
<br />

            It should be C:\Users\&lt;username&gt;\Documents and not C:\Users\C\Documents or C:\Users\Public\Documents. I'm just not sure how to correct the problem.&nbsp; It could be a corrupted user profile.&nbsp;
<p><span>To fix this use
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-AU/windows-vista/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 If that is the only available Administrator Profile (you need to be an administrator to fix this), enable the Hidden Administrator Account (HAA) using
</span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/en-us/default.aspx?&amp;lang=en&amp;cr=US&amp;guid=&amp;sloc=en-us&amp;dg=microsoft.public.windows.vista.administration_accounts_passwords&amp;p=1&amp;tid=d20f9db4-7b2c-48be-a087-7835dc2a9055&amp;mid=d20f9db4-7b2c-48be-a087-7835dc2a9055" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.microsoft.com/communities/newsgroups/en-us/default.aspx?&amp;lang=en&amp;cr=US&amp;guid=&amp;sloc=en-us&amp;dg=microsoft.public.windows.vista.administration_accounts_passwords&amp;p=1&amp;tid=d20f9db4-7b2c-48be-a087-7835dc2a9055&amp;mid=d20f9db4-7b2c-48be-a087-7835dc2a9055</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 If you can't remember the password, try nothing as that's probably what you (or the vendor) did during installation.&nbsp; Once done, be sure to deactivate the HAA to save it in case it's needed again and for security purposes (since people often try to hack into
 systems using this account).&nbsp; Do NOT use the HAA as your administrator account because if you lose the only administrator account on the system or it becomes corrupt again then you are hosed.&nbsp; This,, when done, may fix the problem set forth by this thread
 - but it does not resolve all your problems.<br />
<br />
The problem revealed by SFC means you need to run a system repair/upgrade to recovrer the corrupted files (it's the only way other than doing them one by one from the disk) using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow
 from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure: <span>
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work.&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install
 (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This
 is the case whether or not you want to live with this small problem because there's no telling what other problems exist if the system files are so corrupted that SFC can''t repair them.&nbsp; Sorry, but that's just the way it is.&nbsp; Hopefully you have a genuine
 Windows Vista installation Disk or can borrow one from ANYONE at all.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps and isn't too much for you.&nbsp; If you take it slowly and one step at a time I'm sure you can do it.<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

            <span>Are you sure you're using Vista? "My Documents" applies to XP whereas "Documents" applies to Vista.&nbsp; The suggestions that follow are for Vista.&nbsp; These solutions
 should apply to both probems though you may need to do two to get both of them - not all problems are resolved the same way.<br />
<br />
Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
System Restore</span> to a point in time <strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates. <span>&nbsp;</span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work.&nbsp; Y<span>ou can make a bootable Recovery Disk using
</span><span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.&nbsp; <span>
To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work, and
 exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
</span></span><br />
<div>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with
 networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
 It may take some time (a bit less than an hour).&nbsp; </span>Try to post any corrupted files here (from the CBS.Log from the link) so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></p>
<span><br />
If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning documents (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a></span><span>.
<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;

<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span><br />

<p>Trying to repair an 0xc000000e error is frustrating.&nbsp; Finally, I had to reinstall a cloned hard drive with a old copy of Win 10. This time the upgrade doesn't seem to&nbsp;cause a problem.&nbsp; Wish Microsoft would allow the choice of automatic update or not in Win
 10 Home. Interestingly, the clean copy of Win 10 appears to allow that choice.</p>

<h2>            windows  7 canon iP 2600 driver installs unknown driver</h2>
                    <p>I uninstalled the printer driver canon iP2600 by accident. &nbsp;When I plug it in it updates with unknown driver. &nbsp;I would just go to canon to get another driver. &nbsp;Wrong, you must have the mini driver that updates first for canon's driver to work.</p>
<p>I looked at the code on the unknown driver and it said code 43. &nbsp;Which simply means device failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help, I like this printer and still have ink for it. &nbsp;Canon had me try a few things that didn't work and then sent me to microsoft.</p>

            <p>Hi Tootsiekay2,</p>
<p>In most cases, a Code 39 error is caused by either a missing driver for that particular piece of hardware or by a Windows Registry issue. While less common, a Code 39 error can also be caused by a corrupt driver or driver related file.</p>
<p>I would suggest you to delete the USB Upper Filter &amp; Lower Filter Entry and check if that help.</p>
<p>Before we go any further, please first backup the Registry. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Important:</b> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection,
 back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:</p>
<p><b>How to back up and restore the registry in Windows</b></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click <b>Start</b>, type <b>regedit</b> in the
<b>Start</b> search bar and press Enter to open Registry Editor.</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Locate the <b>UpperFilters</b> value under the following key in the registry:
</p>
<p><b>HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E96C-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}</b></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>&nbsp;</span>On the <b>Edit</b> menu, click
<b>Delete</b>, and then click <b>OK</b>.</p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Locate the LowerFilters value under the same key in the registry:
</p>
<p><b>HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E96C-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}</b></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>&nbsp;</span>On the <b>Edit</b> menu, click
<b>Delete</b>, and then click <b>OK</b>.</p>
<p><span><span>6.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Quit Registry Editor and restart the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now try installing the realtek drivers from the manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would also suggest you to refer the article for resolving no sound issue on your computer.</p>

                    I have 64bit Win 7 installed through bootcamp on my 2013 iMac.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Everything works perfectly except for the internet. I have a 20/5 Mbit connection, and I only get 4-5 down and 2 up on Windows half the time. If I restart Windows or restart my modem and router (Airport Extreme) it will occasionally fix it and bring Windows
 back to normal speeds, but often it does not help.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can run Speedtest side by side on Windows and on a Mac on my same network and they get completely different results.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have Googled everywhere and I am usually pretty good about fixing issues like this, but I can't figure this one out.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please help.</div>

                    <p><strong>Original Title:</strong> Smart TV interference with Windows Media Center Recordings</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since installing a new Samsung Smart TV (Model UN46ES8000F) I have been getting random stoppages with my recordings on WMC.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Since there are plenty of tuners and memory available at the time the recordings are stopped,
<strong><u>these are not recording "conflicts" in the traditional WMC sense</u></strong>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The recordings are simply stopped manually at random times during the planned recording by another component on my home networked system. To date, I have tried reloading WMC, a complete reload of Windows 7, running&nbsp;full diagnostics on all equipment &amp;
 swapping some components; but as of today, I not been able to specifically identify the component that is stopping the recordings, however, I am beginning to suspect the Smart Hub on the new TV.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I have pictures available of the History showing the partial recordings should anyone want to review them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>System Description: I use hardwired (Cat5E) Linksys DMA 2000 media extenders to distribute TV recorded on my HDHomeRun Prime to 4 different rooms in my home from my Dell XPS420 computer (running Windows 7 Ultimate) via a D-link DGS-2205 gigabit switch.<span>&nbsp;
</span>The Smart TV is connected to the internet via my D-link DIR-655 Wireless-N router.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has anyone else experienced this issue, and does anyone know a way to resolve it?&nbsp; Feel free to contact me directly at *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.

            <p>I too started seeing problems with my Windows 7 Media Center after buying a "smart tv".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've been using one HDHomerun Prime with 2 pc's for over a year and practically no problems.&nbsp; Now, I'm using it with a Ceton Extender as well...no problems.&nbsp; But when I got my first smart tv (a 55" LG LED 120MHz&nbsp;model), the problems started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenver my new flatscreen is connected to my network (cat6, 1000Mbps), I noticed a ton of problems with my 3 tuners.&nbsp; All three tuners would "disappear" and whatever program I was watching would freeze.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I haven't recorded anything while my smart tv is hardwired to my network, so I can't say I'm having the same issue&nbsp;you are experiencing...but I truly believe we are experiencing the same thing.&nbsp; For arguments sake, if I was recording something, it probably
 would have stopped.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agree with you 100%.&nbsp; I think the smart tv's are the culprit.&nbsp; I think the problem is our tv's are accessing the hdhomerun prime and treating it as a DLNA product.&nbsp; Under my smart tv's application menu, I can see shared folders from various pc's on my
 network (music, videos, etc.)...as well as three folders for each hdhomerun prime tuner!&nbsp; When I click on one of the tuner icon's, my TV resets.&nbsp; My gut tells me that when the smart tv is connected to my home network, it is somehow attempting to communicate
 with the three tuners and that is causing the tuners to freeze.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Silicondust could somehow provide a patch or firmware upgrade to keep the prime from appearing as a DLNA product, that may solve our issues.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think Silicondust would be able to help you with this problem.&nbsp; I doubt the microsoft techs will have any clue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The silicondust techies will be of more help, especially since they are trying to certify our hdhomerun prime tuners as DLNA certified products as we speak.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you do a web search for hdhomerun prime and DLNA, you'll see an article/news update about their
 progress.</p>
