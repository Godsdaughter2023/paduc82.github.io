<h2>            Skype App in iPhone does not work with external USB audio</h2>
                    <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running Skype version 8.32.0.44 on iOS 12.0.1. iPhone 6. I am using a lightning to USB adapter, and an external USB audio adapter (that has audio input and output). If I plugin an audio cable to the audio input of the USB adapter (as if it were an external
 USB microphone) and play an audio file, Skype cannot pickup audio from there, only from the builtin microphone in the iPhone. My setup works with the Zoom app (others in the Zoom call can hear the audio file I'm playing). Is there a way to make it work with
 Skype?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Andrew</p>

<h2>            &#34;A required component was not found...&#34; with error 8, &#91; &#40;5, 0, 0&#41; &#93; --Windows 7 Home Premium</h2>
                    <p>I am receiving an&nbsp;error code here with the HP Officejet 6500 E709n series printer and Windows 7. The printer prints, but I cannot scan from HP's Solution Center software. The rest of the error message is as follows: "A required component was not found or
 was improperly installed. Reinstall the HP Photosmart software that came with the device, and try scanning again. Error 8, [ (5, 0, 0) ]" I have done this numerous times, even using HP's scrubber software to make sure absolutely every bit of the software is
 removed before reinstalling. This is a tedious process because it needs to be run 4 times with the requisite reboots between each run.</p>

<p>All help available for this exact same error both here on Microsoft's site and HP's site&nbsp;is for Windows XP, so doesn't apply in my case.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interestingly, if I go into Devices and Printers from the start menu, the printer is there with the green check mark, however, there is a yellow exclamation point on my PC icon. When I troubleshoot it, it says no printer drivers are installed (despite installing
 them), yet I can print, which obviously means there are print drivers. There seems to be some kind of disconnect between the drivers that are, in fact, installed and Windows 7.</p>

    <title>KB3139940 breaks VB6 application with error about MSCOMCTL.ocx - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brian.gale  say:</h3>
<h2>            KB3139940 breaks VB6 application with error about MSCOMCTL.ocx</h2>
                    <p>We recently installed KB3139940 on some of our Windows 7 x64 systems and ran into a strange issue.</p>
<p>One of our VB6 application suddenly stopped working with the following error:</p>
<p>Failed to load control 'ImageList' from MSCOMCTL.OCX. &nbsp;your version of MSCOMCTL.OCX may be outdated. &nbsp;Make sure yo uare using the version of the control that was provided with your application.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have compared the file version from a known good system and the version matches (6.01.9846) so I don't think it is a problem with the OCX file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Removing this update allows the program to work again. &nbsp;I have looked online and found instructions about unregistering it before copying it over and about removing a registry entry ([HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\TypeLib\{831FDD16-0C5C-11D2-A9FC-0000F8754DA1}\2.0])
 and neither seemed to have any positive effect. &nbsp;I tried removing that key completely (2.0, 2.1 and 2.2) and then re-registering the OCX file and same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts on what I can try next?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, sorry if I posted this in the wrong location, I thought it fell under windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Brian</p>

<p>
</p><p>We found a potential solution but I am not sure it is a good permanent solution:</p>
<p>we upgraded one of our developer boxes to have that KB installed and then recompiled the code afterwards. &nbsp;After we did this, the program appears to function properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I am not sure if this is a good permanent solution is VB6 IDE is not supported in windows 7 and that update applies to windows 7 but not XP and older. &nbsp;So we are working in an unsupported setup right now.</p>

            <p>Dear Microsoft Support Engineer,</p>
<p>You seem to have ignored Brian's comment about re-compiling NOT being a permanent solution. Because these VB6 applications are old, not all organisations will be in a position where they are able to re-compile, or even have access to the source code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is still an issue and will become more apparent when more people install KB3139940.</p>

            <p>We have adopted the same solution Brian but I agree it is not a proper fix. See my remarks in reply to Mayank's dismissive comments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have several legacy VB6 apps in the field and the ones which have this problem seem to be the ones which have image list components on forms.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, MS Support did phone me today but the only thing they have suggested so far is to increase the colour depth on the machines with the problem. We had already checked this, so no progress on this front so far. In my view this problem still needs
 addressing by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your input.</p>

            <p>We have a similar issue. However we don't have any error message, the window simply doesn't show.</p>
<p>It happens inside one of our Autodesk AutoCAD based application. This is an old and very expensive application which is not supported anymore from our software supplier, if anyone has a solution we would greatly appreciate as it is affecting our business
 and I don't want to restrict this update through WSUS as it causes a real threat.</p>

            <p>I've the same exact problem with one of our VB6 application, the problem is that I can't manage to recompile it under windows 7 due to problem in compiling with the external components that we're using and, anyway, it can't be an official solution to recompile
 under Windows 7 that is not supported for VB6 IDE.</p>
<p>

            <p>I agree with the comments people are posting below: recompiling on windows 7 x64 is not a "solution". &nbsp;VB6 IDE in Windows 7 x64 is not a supported setup and you do not offer any support through that setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since VB6 IDE is at best a valid installation method for windows XP but this KB isn't available for XP, we need a better solution. &nbsp;And others have pointed out that they have old, expensive software that they do not have access to the source code that this
 KB breaks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also found that recompiling caused some unexpected problems. &nbsp;We were using Office 2003 common controls and those broke (as our windows 7 machines have office 2016 or 2010 so the Office 2003 OWC is no good). &nbsp;We needed to install an MSDN office 2003 after
 removing office 2016 just to compile the code. &nbsp;Plus several cosmetic changes occurred that should not have happened. &nbsp;We are still in the process of testing the application and we keep finding things that break due to compiling on Windows 7. &nbsp;Therefore we
 likely have a good week or more of testing that will be required before we can go live with our VB6 app and this critical windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide us with a better solution.</p>

            <p>I have a similar issue with KB3139940 on Win7 Computer.<br />
My VB6 application crashes with error 50003 after opening of one specific form in the application. Other forms open normally.<br />
I have access to sourcecode in the VB6 IDE on an old XP computer. <br />
This root-cause<br />
The command buttons in the form have the "graphical" property. The pictures on the Controls are symbols and sourced from .ICO Files.<br />
after deleting a Picture of the commandbutton, or when I replace the picture with a .BMP, recompile the application,&nbsp;it works under Win7.<br />
It looks like that the graphic types, in the Controls, this problem gives</p>

    <title>Updating W 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grynk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Updating W 7</h2>
                    
<p>I have been trying to update W7 using the W Update feature, but it will not install KB2454826 or KB 2487426. I have tried running the System Update Readiness Tool, then running W Update again with the same results. I get an error message of 800B0100 on one
 of the programs and 80073712 on the other. I'm running W7 64bit.</p>
<p>Thanks. Nick</p>

<p>Please answer all of the following diagnostic questions by number in your very next reply (no need to quote this post):</p>
<p>1. Did you upgrade to Win7, was Win7 preinstalled when you bought the computer, or did you do a clean install?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; • Is my PC running the 32-bit or 64-bit version of Windows?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/find-out-32-or-64-bit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/find-out-32-or-64-bit</a></p>
<p>2. Is it a Win7 64-bit computer?</p>
<p>3. What anti-virus application or security suite is installed and is your subscription current?&nbsp; What anti-spyware applications (other than Defender)?&nbsp; What third-party firewall (if any)?</p>
<p>4. Has a(nother) Norton application or a McAfee application ever been installed on the computer?</p>
<p>5. Did a Norton free-trial or a McAfee free-trial come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you never used or Activated it.)</p>

<p>W update won't tell me which update triggers which error message, but KB2454826 is listed first as is error 800B0100, and of course KB2487426 is listed second along with 80073712. However, the files and the error messages are listed on seperate pages, so
 I dunno.</p>
<p>W7 64bit was preinstalled on this computer (Gateway DX4300) when I bought it new. I've never had any problem with W7 or any updates until now. I'm also running Norton Security Suite which I update daily, and once a week I run the registry cleaner.</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply, and sorry it took me so long to get back but I was trying to reply to the email and that didn't work!</p>

<p>1) W7 64bit was installed on this computer (Gateway DX4300) when I bought it.</p>
<p>2) I assume so since it was preinstalled</p>
<p>3) Norton, which comes free from Comcast and I update every day. I also use IE 7 Pro as an ad and flash blocker. No other firewalls that I'm aware of, but I do not use IE Pro's firewall. Once a week I do run the registry cleaner in Norton.</p>
<p>4) No</p>
<p>5) There was a Norton trial on the computer, but since Norton Suite comes free from Comcast I never opened that and it was supposedly deleted when Security Suite installed.</p>
<p>I have not had any problems with W7 or any updates until now.</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply, sorry it took so long for me to get back but I thought I was supposed to reply to the email and that hasn't been working!</p>

<p>[Norton strikes again!]</p>
<p>Norton (and McAfee) applications are <em>notorious</em> for not upgrading (or uninstalling) cleanly.</p>
<p><strong>[You will want to print these instructions for offline reference. If a Step says to reboot, reboot.]</strong><br />
<br />
1. Download the Norton Removal Tool, saving it to your desktop:&nbsp; 
<span>ftp://ftp.symantec.com/public/english_us_canada/removal_tools/Norton_Removal_Tool.exe</span></p>
<p>2. Close any open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar).</p>
<p>3. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">After making certain you have a copy of your Product Key handy</span>, uninstall all Norton software (including&nbsp;<strong>LiveUpdate</strong> and any&nbsp;<strong>Norton Add-ons)</strong> via<strong>Control Panel | Programs
 | Uninstall a program</strong> (or&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel | Programs and Features</strong>, if using Classic view).</p>
<p>4. IMPORTANT! =&gt; Enable the Windows Firewall immediately after rebooting.<br />
<br />
<strong>NB: You're "working without a net" now: Don't to ANYTHING else online (e.g., browsing; reading email; chatting) until you've completed&nbsp;Step #7&nbsp;below!</strong></p>
<p>5. Right-click on the file you saved in Step #1 above and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong>.&nbsp; Don't TOUCH your keyboard until the run completes, then reboot.</p>
<p>Note: You should have uninstalled the Norton free-trial and then run the Norton Removal Tool before you installed the Norton freebie!</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;Do a clean install of&nbsp;the&nbsp;Norton freebie:&nbsp; <a href="http://security.comcast.net/norton/resi/migrate/default.htm?cid=33_232" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://security.comcast.net/norton/resi/migrate/default.htm?cid=33_232</a><br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE: Do&nbsp;NOT enable or install any Norton Add-ons (e.g., Norton Anti-Phishing) just yet.</strong></p>
<p>OPTIONAL ALTERNATIVE: Install Microsoft Security Essentials (free) =&gt; &nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>NOTE: Do NOT install both of them!<br />
<br />
</strong>7. Manually and repeatedly update Norton Security Center (or Microsoft Security Essentials)&nbsp;until you get a "no more updates" or similar prompt.</p>
<p>8. Reset IE Advanced settings&nbsp;per &nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Reset-Internet-Explorer-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Reset-Internet-Explorer-settings</a></p>
<p>9. Open IE8&nbsp;(32-bit only)&nbsp;to <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058</a> [ignore APPLIES TO section] &amp; run the Fix It in DEFAULT and then AGGRESSIVE modes.&nbsp;[1]</p>
<p>10. Reboot one more time &amp; test.</p>
<p>TIP: <strong>Programs and Features | Turn Windows features on or off</strong>: If&nbsp;<strong>Media Features</strong> is currently turned-off (disabled), turning it on may allow KB2454826 to install. YMMV</p>
<p>TIP: If you ever think your Registry needs to be cleaned, repaired, boosted, tuned-up, cured, tweaked, fixed, or optimized (it doesn't), read&nbsp;<a href="http://aumha.net/viewtopic.php?t=28099" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://aumha.net/viewtopic.php?t=28099</a> and draw your own conclusions.&nbsp;

<p>The first thing most experienced users do when they buy a new laptop is to remove Norton orMcAfee . They do this based on past experience knowing&nbsp;that using an alternative will help system performance. Norton also has an unenviable reputation for interfering
 and as a result causing system errors. There are plenty of good freeware alternative available for the home computer.</p>
<p>What registry cleaner? Why do you think you need to use one? It is a common misunderstanding that cleaning the registry helps with system performance. It makes little or no difference and frequently introduces unresolvable system errors. My adfvIce is that
 you dump it.</p>
<p>I will leave Bear to sort out your Windows Update problem.</p>

<p>OK guys, here's what happened. Things started off badly because I couldn't dnld Norton Removal Tool. When I clicked on the link above I got the page that says the internet connection was bad, which it wasn't. Clicking on repair connection did no good. I
 then went to Symantic's website and tried to dnld the program, but when I clicked on the dnld button I had the same result.</p>
<p>So, I got on line with Norton help center and the guy ended up remoting control of my computer and, after I showed him your list, he went thru the whole thing as I think he was very curious about the problem.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the end result of all this work is that nothing has changed. I still cannot install those updates, although there was another one for Silverlight that installed just fine today. It just seems to be those two. I ran the System Update Recovery
 Tool again, but nothing has changed.</p>
<p>I'm really not sure that these two updates are worth the trouble to tell you the truth, I've been at it several hours with no change. The Norton guy even tried to run the updates when Norton was Uninstalled with no success.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the help, and if you have any other ideas I'll be glad to hear them, but I really don't know if it's worth the time and effort.</p>
<p>Oh, there is one other thing. I just tried again and the link above did work to get Norton Removal Tool so something changed.</p>
<p>Thanks again.</p>

<p>1a. Have you completed all 10 steps in my previous reply? [yes/no]</p>
<p>1b. Assuming you have, did you reinstall the Norton freebie or Microsoft Security Essentials in Step #6?</p>
<p>2. Are ALL of the following updates listed in Installed Updates (not Update History)?...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; KB2482017, KB2485376, KB2393802, KB2479628 &amp; KB2475792</p>
<p>3. The previous Comcast freebie was called McAfee Security Center: Was it ever installed on the computer?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Have you looked in Event Viewer? Please only post errors since the last boot.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To access the System log select Start, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer, from the list in the left side of the window select Windows Logs and System.
 Place the cursor on System, right click and select Filter Current Log. Check the box before Error and click on OK and you see only Error reports. Click on the Date and Time Header to sort. You may need to click a second time to see the latest Report at the
 top. </span></p>

<p><span>A tip for posting copies of Error Reports! Run Event Viewer and double click on the error you want to copy. Click on the Copy button to place a copy on your Clipboard
 and close Event Viewer. Now start your message and paste into the body of the message. Make sure this is the first paste after exiting from Event Viewer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Type Device Manager in the Search box above the Start button and press ENTER. Are there any yellow question marks in Device Manager? If yes what is the Device Error

<p><span>To see Hidden Devices (Non Plug and Play Drivers) you need to select View, Show Hidden Devices. It is necessary to do this every time you open Device Manager if you

<p>As you can see there are four total. I don't see any yellow marks in Device Manager except for devices that are not installed such as PS2 mouse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>answering the other questions:</p>
<p>1a) yes, in fact, while after running the uninstall and Norton removal, we tried running W Update Recovery Tool, then updating. Didn't work.</p>
<p>1b) Norton freebie</p>
<p>2) all four of those updates show as installed</p>
<p>3) No, Comcast switched to Norton before I bought this computer.</p>
<p>Thanks again, guys, I do appreciate all the time and effort!</p>

<p>Everything that I have found won't do me any good, as I can't get past the password prompt. Either normal</p>

    <title>Selecting multiple files&#47;fotos after latest W10 upgrade&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> beachbengal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Selecting multiple files&#47;fotos after latest W10 upgrade&#63;</h2>
                    <p>This is unbelievable. Something so easy before is now wasting so much time! When my phone sucked in the last upgrade, I could no longer just plug it into the computer and move files around the phone's folders, or between the phone and computer. I spent almost
 2 hours downloading the app they are forcing on us and figuring out how to simply move a couple of files around. Jeez, like
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">this</span></strong> multiple&nbsp;selection&nbsp;of pictures, something once so easy has now become such a waste of time. I thought I was going crazy trying to select multiple&nbsp;pictures.&nbsp;EZ PZ: After I pushed the W10 update
 through and waited the hour or so for it do what it had to do, I can now no longer select multiple pictures in Windows Explorer to move around?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the life of an IS person is very detail oriented and we all appreciate you very much, but, this is something so basic that I would think everyone would discover it within&nbsp;a&nbsp;cpl&nbsp;hours&nbsp;of the upgrade. It's happened on all of my computers, so what's
 going on?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 BSOD Memory Management - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> devilscowboy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 BSOD Memory Management</h2>
                    <p>Hey,</p>
<p>So I have run into a bit of a problem. My windows 10 seems to get a BSOD of memory management, but I can't seem to replicate when it happens. It seems random. I turned on driver verifier, which got me another BSOD at bootup of "Driver Verifier Detected Violation".
 Before getting into safe mode, it booted a few times with "IRQL not less or equal". I booted into safe mode and have attached the minidump file. Can you help me out?</p>

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I use an automatic configuration script (.pac file) to enter 2 different websites. Yesterday I was pushed updates of Windows 10, after which the version was updated to 1803, and after that I can only get into one of the 2 websites. The other can not be contacted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since IE is not supporting automatic configuration scripts anymore, I have been using Firefox and Chrome for quite some time for these websites.</p>
<p>Message in chrome:&nbsp;</p>
There is no Internet connection
<p style="color: rgba(100, 100, 100, 1)">There is something wrong with the proxy server, or the address is incorrect.</p>
<div style="color: rgba(100, 100, 100, 1)">
<p>Try:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contacting the system admin</li><li>Checking the proxy address</li><li>Running Windows Network Diagnostics</li></ul>
</div>
<div style="color: rgba(100, 100, 100, 1)">ERR_PROXY_CONNECTION_FAILED</div>
<p>
</p><p>Message in Firefox:</p>
The connection has timed out<br />
The server at "name of the website" is taking too long to respond.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; The site could be temporarily unavailable or too busy. Try again in a few moments.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; If you are unable to load any pages, check your computer’s network connection.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; If your computer or network is protected by a firewall or proxy, make sure that Firefox is permitted to access the Web.
<p>
</p><p>I can connect to every single website, except this one. It is not down, because others have no problems connecting, as was I just before this Windows update. Cleared cache and all, no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>
<p />

<p>Hi&nbsp;MoniqueVollenga,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are a few causes on what might be the cause of your proxy connection not being able to run on your computer, like security, configuration or settings on the computer, or programs running on the background. In order for me to better assist you, I would
 like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Have you tested if the issue is happening on other user profiles?</li><li>Are you getting the same issue when running your <strong>Windows 10</strong> with the proxy settings turned off from the settings?</li><li>Are your computers connected on a domain server?</li><li>What is the build of your <strong>Windows 10</strong>?</li><li>Are these computer workstations that you're working with the proxy.pac file?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I recommend that you try manually entering the proxy settings manually on your
<strong>Windows 10</strong> for isolation. If your computers are connected on a domain, then I suggest that you post your concern to our
<strong><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=win10itpronetworking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">TechNet Forums for Windows 10 IT Pro</a></strong>. This way, other
<strong>IT Professionals &amp; Specialists</strong> would be able to suggest what settings or script to better use in getting your proxy.pac file to work. If your computer is managed by your organization or company, then the best course of action would be contacting
 your company admin as they might have placed some setting your network that might restrict the file from running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, if your using this on your private network at home, then you might want to
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">perform a clean boot</a></strong> to isolate the issue further. This way, you'd be able to ensure that there are no other
 programs could hinder the file from running.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please don't hesitate to keep in touch with me for further assistance.</p>

<p>Hi ErwinJames, thanks for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The build is:&nbsp;July 16, 2018—KB4345421 (OS Build 17134.167)</p>
<p>I've tried with manual proxy configuration, but no luck. The proxy.pac is not the problem, since one of the websites defined in it gives no issues. This website is inside our companies domain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The website I can no longer reach since the latest windows10 update is in another companies' domain. My colleagues are still able to connect, they have not received the latest Windows10 update on their laptop yet.</p>
<p>Seems to me as an issue in&nbsp;KB4345421.</p>
<p>I can uninstall it and see if the functionality restores, but you might want to have some logs or so for troubleshooting?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Monique</p>
<br />

    <title>UNable to reconnect a Skype Account to my Microsoft ID - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ed mahoney_1  say:</h3>
<h2>            UNable to reconnect a Skype Account to my Microsoft ID</h2>
                    <p>Several Years ago, I connected an existing Skype Account to my Microsoft ID.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few weeks ago, I received an e-mail from Skype support telling me that my Skype password had been changed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I check my Microsoft ID, and all other services worked well, but I get a message when I log into Skype that the account is locked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I completed the Reset form, with as much information as I could remember, and they tell me they cannot validate me and therefore cannot unlock the account.&nbsp; I have tried several times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the dilemma:</p>
<ol>
<li>The link to a Microsoft ID is from within the Skype Account, if you cannot log in, you cannot disconnect the link.</li><li>Microsoft Account Support says they have no way to break the link.</li><li>Even though the account has been locked for a month, Skype continues to have the link in place.</li><li>I have a new Skype account, but cannot link it to my Microsoft ID, since as soon as I start Skype it goes to the locked account.</li><li>With the above situation, I cannot use my included Skype Minutes.</li></ol>
<p>Bottom line, if I could talk to a person at Skype, I am sure I could get this fixed.&nbsp; The Microsoft Account team has tried to help, but i appears their hands are tied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p />

            <p>Actually, it is a combined problem.&nbsp; As part of my Office 365 subscription, I buy from Microsoft, I am supposed to get&nbsp;Skype Minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Due to a problem Skype introduced, my account is blocked, and I cannot connect another account to my Microsoft ID and claim those minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype is refusing to provide support, because they claim they cannot validate me,&nbsp;but a valid and validated Microsoft ID should be&nbsp;plenty.&nbsp; After multiple requests they have not&nbsp;contacted me with anything but a canned response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the problem is really a Office 365 team problem since you are who I purchase the service from, and due to their poor performance, you are unable to p[provide.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am more than willing to work with Skype, but they are currently useless, and I went all over the community seeking response only to be told the community cannot help I need to fill out the Skype form.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you please get me a direct contact at Skype?</p>

<h2>            My household network was changed and now I have 2 but the one that I am supposed to use doesn&#39;t work. Help&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>The title says part of it but here is the thing. We were having internet issues with the router so my father called the company and they made a new network so he has one for him and my mom and me and my sisters use the guest one. The problem is that when
 I test the connection it passes the first part but it fails to connect to the internet. I also checked on the info of the internet and it said that it is unsecured. It shows it on my computer as well but when I connect it tells me that I need additional info
 to log in and when I go to some website it sends me to the site where I am supposed to put my password. It works perfectly with my computer; on the other hand, it doesn't for the xbox. I am not sure if I am supposed to put the password in the PPPoE part but
 I did and then it says that I cannot connect to the network which is the first part. Can we use xbox live on a guest network like cisco? And how do I get it to work?</p>

<p>As the Xbox 360 does not currently have a browser you will not be able to log in to a guest network that requires visiting a website to access the internet. The Xbox should be connected to the main network and not the guest network.</p>

<p>If you own a computer relatively close to the xbox you are using then I know how to fix your problem. It is not pretty but it works. First of all you will need an ethernet cable. This needs to be plugged from xbox into your computer's ethernet port, located
 on the back of the tower or on the side if you are using a laptop. Next you need to follow this path Start button -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Network and Internet -&gt; Network and Sharing Center. From the Network and Sharing Center you will see a column on the left
 that has other paths. Click on Change adapter settings. At this point there are two ways to go about this. Either make your Wireless Network Connection shared (Right click on, go to properties-&gt;sharing, share with local area connection) or bridge the LAN adater
 to the Wireless Adapter. The latter search youtube how to do. &nbsp; </p>

<div>Windows update were not happening so i checked the windows update section of the control panel. It was set to 'Automatically install updates' but when i checked for updates i was getting an error.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I used the Windows update troubleshooter and it did some fixes and then when i checked the Windows update section it asked me to restart the system. I did the restart but nothing happened.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I checked the Windows update service and it was in stopped mode, when i tried to start the service it crashed. It keeps crashing whenever i try to start it.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I checked and BITS was in 'running' state.</div>

            Hi Anshul,
<div><br />
<div>Sorry for a delayed response.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Firstly i am not facing issues in installing updates. The issue i am facing is that Windows update service is not starting up at all. When i try to start it from services.msc, i get an error.</div>
<div><br />
<div>"<b>Error 1076: The process terminated unexpectedly</b>"</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have already pasted the event viewer log.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Secondly the 2 methods you have mentioned above are of no use as i have already tried them multiple time even before writing in this forum.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The reason i was asking about svchost.exe is that, once i manually stopped/disabled some of such processes from Task manager as they were eating up a lot of network bandwidth.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Is there anyway to find out which svchost.exe is used for Windows update in Windows 8?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Just to add i have also tried windows restore but restoring my system to 1-May-2013 also did not work. I don't when exactly windows update stopped working but as per update history last successful update was installed on 24-April-2013. But there was no
 restore point of 24-April or earlier.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please suggest what can be done as this is really frustrating as i do not want to do a System refresh or reset.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, is there any link to check windows updates online?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regards,</div>
<div>Pranshu Agarwal</div>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>I had the same issue with Windows 8.1 updates. In my case the load updates automatically option was set but it didn't report any updates had been found. &nbsp;Whenever I attempted a manual update, updates would be found and downloaded after several hours; however,
 the installation always failed with different error messages each time. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After running their diagnostic tools to no avail on my laptop <strong>Microsoft Support</strong> finally fixed the issue for me by running two free third party scripts/tools they downloaded and installed on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They first tool downloaded was&nbsp;<strong>MalwareBytes</strong> from&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 33, 1)"><em>www.</em></span><em><strong>malwarebytes</strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 33, 1)">.org/mwb-</span></em><strong><em>download</em>&nbsp;</strong>that
 found and fixed 3 minor issues. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The second tool was&nbsp;<strong>Repair_Windows</strong>&nbsp;<strong>All in One</strong> from&nbsp;<em>www.tweaking.com&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>This was installed at:</p>
<p><em>"C:\Program Files (x86)\Tweaking.com\Windows Repair (All in One)\Repair_Windows.exe"</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately MS Support would not offer this solution to me until I paid for MS Support (between $100 and $140) because they argued the problem wasn't a MS issue but was a Registry problem caused by a virus. I have good anti virus software so I found that
 hard to accept. However they did spend 6 hour trying to find a solution with their own tools before using the Tweaking tool so I guess it was worth it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try it out yourself and save some money.</p>

    <title>HELP&#33;&#33; Corrupted games saves after transfer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            HELP&#33;&#33; Corrupted games saves after transfer</h2>
                    
<p>My girl friend recently bought a 120GB hard drive to replace my 10 GB hard drive and was told that I could use a USB to transfer my files. Parts of my games transferred but the majority of my saved data did not transfer (including themes that were bought
 on the marketplace and games saves). Is there any way for me to recover any of this? There are no items showing on the old hard drive and the new hard drive is showing all my game saves with corruption signs next to them. Please help I had a lot done in all
 of those games .</p>

<p>[quote user="Konsento"]There are no items showing on the old hard drive and the new hard drive is showing all my game saves with corruption signs next to them[/quote]You're sure that's the save game files and not the game folders? If you used the CD that
 came with a 120GB HDD, the transfer process will have moved any games you had installed. Those installs won't be usable and may show as&nbsp;corrupted.</p>

<p>If the game saves are corrupted, there's not much you can do, you can try transferring back but I doubt that'll matter. For future references, make a copy of the data then transfer said data, this way you have a back-up.</p>

    <title>Why does descktop PC take Critical Battery Action when UPS battery is - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dkaleita  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does descktop PC take Critical Battery Action when UPS battery is at 100&#37; capacity&#63;</h2>
                    This PC is intended for a mission-critical application that must remain on 24/7. So it has been connected to a&nbsp; APC Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS)&nbsp;with a USB connection to inform Windows if/when power has been interrupted and the backup battery has
 reached a critically low level. Windows Power options are set to "High Performance".&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The problem is that most (but not every) time&nbsp;the PC has several hours of inactivity, it goes into hybrid sleep mode (I guess, or maybe full hibernate- I'm not quite sure)&nbsp;even though there were no power interruptions and the UPS battery remained at 100% during
 that period.&nbsp;Upon resuming, Windows reports that critical battery level was reached (which is not correct).<br />
<br />
This problem was present on this particular PC under Windows Vista 64, and now continues after Windows 7 Professional 64 upgrade.<br />
<br />
What the heck is going on?

            &nbsp; I had a similar problem with the APC UPS on this dual boot PC.&nbsp; It worked OK with Win XP Pro, but was unstable on the Win 7 RC version.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; I upgraded the APC PowerChute Personal Edition on their web site to the Vista version.&nbsp; Apparently this version is close enough to Win 7, and it has been fine now for several weeks.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; I have not made any changes to the default power mode, so you might consider that also.<br />
<br />
<br />
Good Luck

<h2>            Gamertag is missing&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>I have been on chat with tech support and they can't help me. I'm extremely frustrated that I am being instructed to post on a forum in order to figure out what is going on. Tech support should be better equipped to handle these issues.</p><p><br /></p><p>I just went to sign on to my old account and was assigned a new gamertag. My old gamertag with all of my dlc and games associated with it are missing. I got on with tech support and they told me that they can't access my old gamertag without the email associated with it, but I gave them all of my emails, including the one associated with it and they can't get into the account. Nor can they see the email on the account,. Said something about it being locked. It makes NO&nbsp;SENSE. It could have been stolen and the email changed, but I shouldn't have to be posting on a forum to figure that out. Please can someone help me resolve this issue? I have hundreds if not thousands of dollars in games and downloadable content that is missing her

    <title>USB not working after Windows 10 upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> saajansoni  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB not working after Windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Hello people</p>
<p>I know that the problem i am going to discuss here has already been discussed &nbsp;a lot of times here , but i was not able to solve my problem with the solutions given.</p>
<p>So here it goes.</p>
<p>I was recently trying to upgrade my Dell Optiplex 990 Windows 7 Professional to Windows 10 Pro using Windows 10 upgrade advisor app. The download was fine but it gave an error while installing after restart. So i initiated the setup from the $getcurrent
 hidden folder in C: which contained the setup files for the windows 10. The upgrade was done &amp; everything was working fine. But then i decided to reset the windows using the inbuilt recovery mode to make a clean install of windows 10. I chose the option erase
 everything &amp; the process started &amp; the windows 10 installed fine. But as soon as the configuration page appeared after the install i noticed that there was no cursor on the screen. I checked my mouse &amp; it was working but there was no sensor light. Somehow
 i continued with the installation process with the help of keyboard. Then after checking for sometime i noticed that there was no usb driver in device manager. There were 2 identities but everytime i tried to update them whether directly or through the automatic
 updates, it failed. Intel 6 Series chipset usb enhanced controller 1C26 &amp; 1C2D are the names of the drivers&nbsp;which are failing to install. I have tried so many solutions available on the internet but nothing seems to solve my problem. Please help me out with
 my problem as i am not able to install printer drivers &amp; none of my usb ports are working. Everything else is fine.</p>

<h2>            &#33; Downloads with win10 held my laptop hostage for almost 20 hrs to do a MS Office download&#47;update.</h2>
                    <p>Why is win10 releasing such massive downloads that it holds my computer hostage for almost 20 hrs?&nbsp;&nbsp; And only for MS Office what is going on?? Sucked every resource so much couldn't even operate windows screens properly. Ridiculous &nbsp;&nbsp; As a consumer wish
 I had far more control over what&nbsp; MS down loads into my computer.... getting fed up.&nbsp; MS your options are NOT good on this, please fix this. &nbsp;&nbsp; And with every down load so far - glitches and problems with apps, ie loosing Bluetooth-constantly fixing that device
 driver, initially laptop defaulting to airplane mode on it's own!&nbsp; </p>
<p>Then wifi issues - just kept 'losing it' while a second laptop with xp was staying connected same network just fine.&nbsp;&nbsp; Craziness that's making me think for the first time another operating system might be better for me/us.&nbsp; I've spend so much more time in
 DOS with this win version I may as well learn that method more and get away from getting being forced to down-load commercial 'stuff' than I don't want or need.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have had a MS certified IT guy working on this laptop in last year - he's a friend - so thankfully
 didn't cost too much but still have spent $200 for his time on fixing win10 issues&nbsp; whereas never had to do that with other win versions.</p>
<p>Like when I play music now - I don't like groove - so I use media player which win10 HAS to hang before running, lol.&nbsp; I am tired of commercial crap constantly being pushed - I WANT TO RELAX with listening to music NOT being sold MS products constantly.&nbsp;&nbsp;
 As far as the cloud stuff - we just don't need or want this feature at all... why can't we have what WE want instead of what YOU determine is for us?&nbsp; Have a second laptop with XP which until late was getting updates but never got issues like newer laptop
 with win10 newly installed on win7Pro system.&nbsp; It's wrong that MS doesn't support products they sold without an expected expiry date. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>What's the expiry for win10?&nbsp; </p>
<p>I'm not a mechanic and not expected to be so to own operate a vehicle properly... try to model windows on that at bit more.</p>
<p>Sincerely a rather, </p>
<p>Frustrated Win10 customer.</p>

            <p>OK, I do see two (2) questions in your first post but both appear to be rhetorical. That being said...</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>Why is win10 releasing such massive downloads...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Have you heard of "<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/itpro/windows/manage/waas-overview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows as a Service</a>?"&nbsp; Most updates for Win10 are cumulative and include many fixes - some security-related, some not - all rolled into one (1) update
 (vs. the 5-15 separate updates which used to be offered monthly to, e.g., Windows 7).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very generally speaking, if the most recent cumulative update is already installed, the next one will be smaller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then there's the fact that the Conventional Wisdom in&nbsp;Redmond for the past decade or more has been that everyone in the world has unlimited, high-speed&nbsp;broadband internet access 24/7.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>[...which hold] my computer hostage for almost 20 hrs?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>No idea, as I don't know&nbsp;anything about your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>And only for MS Office what is going on?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How have you determined that MS Office "downloads" (updates) are holding your computer hostage? Are you running Office 2011 or...?</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>What's the expiry for win10?&nbsp; </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Assuming what Microsoft calls the Current Branch for Business (CBB) is installed, Win10 will be supported&nbsp;through October of 2025.</p>

<strong>Clean Boot</strong></span></p>
