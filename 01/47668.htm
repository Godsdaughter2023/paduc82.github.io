            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Files that were used in your previous version of Windows are stored in the <strong>
Windows.old</strong> folder. In short, whenever you upgrade your Windows to a later version, you will see a new folder called Windows.old created on your disk. But if you wish, you can also remove the Windows.old folder manually.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note:&nbsp;You will not be able to roll back to&nbsp;the previous operating system during the 30 days grace period after installing Windows 10 if you delete the Windows.old folder.
</p>
<p><br />
Hope this helps. Get back to us for further&nbsp;queries. We are happy to help!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>While all of these are helpful. I already know about the basic stuff. and i do disk checkup weekly and got rid of the old files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My main question is under settings/system/storage there is a temporary files area that says to be holding 69gb. this seems ridiculous and was wondering if it was ok to delete</p>

    <title>Windows Store Won&#39;t Install App Unless I Switch VSS&#47;Volume - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Store Won&#39;t Install App Unless I Switch VSS&#47;Volume Shadow Copy To Automatic&#47;Also, Desktop Icon&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>TL;DR - How to keep VSS on manual, without having Microsoft Store conflict with it and how do I create a desktop shortcut of Forza Horizon 4? None of the ways I tried worked. I feel like I have a camera on my face for some funny show, because it can't be
 that I'm not being messed with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So... I bought Forza Horizon 4 Ultimate Edition and I finally got it to start downloading before I left to go to work, but at first it kept stopping the download about 1 second after starting it. I Googled the error code and eventually got to a fix: go to
 the Services and switch VSS to automatic. By default it's on manual.<br />
</p>
<p>I'm wondering what this has to do with the Windows Store and with Apps not downloading. I read that VSS is basically a system that creates backups of your system automatically, when set to automatic. I don't really need that, as I manually tell Windows to
 create Restore Points when it needs to and I have 2 big external HDD's that I write images and backups to. So I think that to stop my system from bloating too much, I should switch VSS back to Manual. But then I wonder, would that perhaps conflict with Forza
 once it's installed? Or if I need to install any updates?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's extremely strange to me that this VSS setting could have anything at all to do with Windows Store downloads. It's the very first time I use it for as far as I remember, so I really have no experience with it, but it just seems like it should have nothing
 to do with each other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does someone know how to fix the conflict while setting back VSS to manual? I did remove PowerISO from my system as that was listed as a possible fix as well, but that did not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, another question and feel rather silly for this one, but, how do I create a desktop shortcut of Forza Horizon 4 once it's downloaded? I installed the demo before (truth be told, the VSS problem started with the demo, not the game itself, but once the
 demo was there and I couldnt make a shortcut, I deleted it and bought the full game) and I really could not figure out how to do it. It did not ask me by default (which honestly, is user unfriendly to begin with), hitting the Windows key and then typing Forza,
 finding it within the list and right-clicking it only gave me options to pin to start or taskbar and trying to drag it to my desktop to try and create a shortcut that way did not work, either. And despite being the Admin, Windows did not let me into the install
 folder, so I could not find the executable to make a shortcut of it that way, either. And finally, going into the Windows Store, I cannot for the life of me find a list of downloaded apps/app history, let alone settings I can change, like adding a desktop
 shortcut. Why... exactly does this have to be so difficult and user unfriendly?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be really, really grateful if you lovely people could help shed some light on these two issues. Thank you very much in advance,</p>
<p>
</p><p>R. Jansen.</p>

<p><span>Hi Jansen,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Actually, the VSS should be set as automatic. The reason is to get the system restore to automatically create system restore points. If VSS is set to automatic, a restore point will be created automatically after
 installing an application or an update. So, if something goes wrong after an application/update installation, we can restore the system back to the previous state, when it was working fine.</span></p>
<p><span>As you said, you often take backup on external HDD’s, you can set it to manual.<span>&nbsp;
</span>This shouldn’t conflict with the Store apps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To create shortcuts for any Modern apps:</span></p>
<p><code><span><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span></span></code><span>Open File explorer and paste the following in the address bar:
</span><code><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">%windir%\explorer.exe shell:::{4234d49b-0245-4df3-b780-3893943456e1} and press enter.</span></span></code></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right click on the app that you want to create a shortcut, and select ‘Create shortcut’.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope it helps.</span></p>

<p>Thank you very much for your response. I was finally able to create a shortcut.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However I am confused still, how can vss conflict then? With it set to manual Microsoft store downloads stop almost instantly. Every time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Do you know of a way to fix that?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Jansen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Glad to know that the information provided was helpful. </p>
<p>
</p><p>VSS is to create an automatic restore point after installing an update or an application. You can download and install Store apps by keeping the&nbsp; VSS as manual. It shouldn't conflict with the Windows Store downloads. Check and let us know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it helps.</p>

<h2>            Win 7 Ultimate German --&#62; MUI English - Extenders still in German</h2>
                    Hi all,<br />
<br />
I bought a laptop in Germany that came pre-installed with German Windows 7 Ultimate.<br />
The store clerk told me that i easily could get the english MUI from windows update and that i did not need to buy a separate english version of Windows 7.<br />
<br />
So I did. Got the English MUI installed and all changed from German to English. Well not all.&nbsp; Log on screen is still in German. Welcome and "Good bye" message is still in german.&nbsp; Administration tools come up in german, but the most annoying of all and this
 is what i need help with - my WMC XBOX 360 Extender refuses to change language and its all in German.<br />
<br />
When i start WMC in my Xbox 360 its all in german. Even though WMC on the windows 7 computer is all in english.<br />
Its kind of fun.&nbsp; I installed several "extras" for WMC 7 - "shoutcast" newsreaders and so on. On the Windows 7 computer they all show up in English from WMC, but on the extender they all change to German - The extender it self is in full German.<br />
<br />
So how can i really really change my entire Windows 7 german up to English - what is most important is the extender. I dont have any problem with german my self, but the rest of the family who uses the xbox 360 really need english :)

<p>I managed to find the solution :)&nbsp; Its an easy one, well when you know what do to.<br />
Took me 10 sec to fix it - when i got the solution in my hands.<br />
<br />
In short:<br />
1. Open "Region and Languages"<br />
2. Go to the "Administrative" tab<br />
3. Click on "Copy Settings"<br />
4. Tick the boxes under "Copy your current settings to"<br />
5. Click OK<br />
<br />
Win7 will now also change all the system properties (including welcome, log on/off, admin tools and all extenders ) to your new language<br />
All new user accounts will be created with the new language.<br />

    <title>Dec 14 Update &#34;Uninstalled&#34; Internet Explorer, caused issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 437825947  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dec 14 Update &#34;Uninstalled&#34; Internet Explorer, caused issues with installer</h2>
                    
<p>I have Windows 7 64-bit set to update automatically (original OS on a new computer). &nbsp;On December 14 it successfully (according to Windows Update) did 14 updates, including some for Internet Explorer (I was running IE8, which has been automatically updating):
 &nbsp;Cumulative Security update for Internet Explorer 8 KB2416400&nbsp;and KB2467659 for Internet Explorer. The previous update (other than definitions for Windows Defender) was 11/25, and that was also for Internet Explorer (KB2447568). &nbsp;But when I restarted my computer
 later, it had uninstalled Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>I tried using my previously installed version of Chrome to download IE8 again, and I can't. &nbsp;Not IE8, not IE9, not Chrome, not Firefox, not Opera, not any software at all. &nbsp;(I just tried Adobe Air just to test it. &nbsp;No luck.) &nbsp;Every time I try to download,
 I get an execution error that Windows can't find the file (the browsers) or that there was an error (Adobe). &nbsp;Example: &nbsp;I downloaded Firefox setup 3.6.13. &nbsp;Try to run it, it loads 95% and then I get an error message "Windows can't find C:\Users\writer\AppData\Local\Temp\7zS510E.tmp\setup.exe</p>
<p>FWIW, I also have Norton IS (which says all is OK) and BCWipe (which is now not working because of the missing IE files) installed.</p>
<p>How do I get my IE -- and my ability to download software -- back?</p>
<p>Thank you all in advance.</p>

<p>Have you checked that IE8 has not just been accidently 'Turned Off' as opposed to Uninstalled? Try:</p>
<p>1. Go to &nbsp;<strong>Control Panel-&gt;Programs &amp; Features-&gt;Turn Windows features on and off</strong>.</p>
<p>2. Tick Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>3. Reboot.</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick and helpful response. &nbsp;I hadn't tried that, but just did. &nbsp;I got an error, rebooted, and just now got the same error again: &nbsp;Windows can't find &nbsp;C:\Windows\system32\OptionalFeatures.exe</p>
<p>The reasons I suspected IE was actually uninstalled are that:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;The first sign of trouble was a popup asking me if I wanted to delete the shortcut from my desktop since the file it referred to wasn't there.</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;I did check All Programs from the Start menu and can't find it.</p>
<p>3) &nbsp;I searched from the Start menu for "internet" and "internet explorer" and couldn't find it that way, either.</p>
<p>4) &nbsp;When I search for "internet" I do find my attempt to download IE9, and when I click on the program I get the error message "Windows cannot find C:\Users\writer\Downloads\IE0-Windows7-x64-enu.exe"</p>
<p>So I can't find it on my system. &nbsp;Which doesn't mean it's not still there and hiding someplace, but I haven't been able to find it.</p>
<p>Also fyi, when I try to set Chrome as my default browser (it was IE8 until this happened), I get the error message Windows can't find Users\writer\AppData\local\Google\Chrome\applicaton\8.0552.224\Installer\setup.exe</p>
<p>Also, just got a new piece of info: &nbsp;I just received an email a moment ago (Outlook is being very slow, too, I see another poster has the same problem, I'm having it as well, just not quite as seriously, mine is still usable just very slow) that had a link
 to a website and when I click on the link I get the error message: &nbsp;"General failure: the URL was (URL here) The system cannot find the file specified." &nbsp;Don't know if that's because I lost IE or because there's something wrong with the file search.</p>
<p>But I'm getting so many different errors involving file search in so many different applications I'm starting to wonder if the problem isn't IE at all but the file search. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>The executable file for IE is <strong>&nbsp;iexplore.exe</strong> and should be located in the folder:</p>
<p><strong>C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\</strong></p>
<p>It probably won't help, but a check of your system files for corruption/incorrect versions won't do any harm:</p>
<p><span>1. Click on<strong>Start-&gt;All Programs-&gt;Accessories</strong>, then right click on Command Prompt.<br />
2. Select 'Run as Administrator'.<br />
3. <strong>Type SFC /SCANNOW</strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>(note space after SFC)<br />
4. A scan that will take a few minutes to complete will now start. If possible SFC will auto-fix any problem files.</span></p>

<p>Thank you! &nbsp;This is getting interesting...</p>
<p>I forgot to mention I had searched for iexplore.exe and hadn't found it. &nbsp;(I spent a while on this last night and forgot all the dozens of things I tried.) &nbsp;But I hadn't searched for corrupted versions, great idea, thank you. &nbsp;So I just tried to. &nbsp;When I
 right click on "Run as administrator" I get the error: &nbsp;Windows cannot find C:\Windows\system32\cmd.exe"</p>
<p>Also, since I'm having the same slow Outlook problem as another poster, I tried the solution proposed for that: uninstall KB2412171. &nbsp;Can't uninstall it -- the system says there was an error in the uninstall, it may already have been uninstalled. &nbsp;Unless
 Microsoft automatically uninstalled it for me (not betting on that), it's still there but the system can't find it.</p>
<p>Starting to sound like a problem with the file search?</p>

            <p><span>As Susan said, IE8 cannot be uninstalled in Win7.</span></p>
<p><span>If it's a Win7 64-bit computer, you have two versions of IE8: IE8 64-bit (the default) and IE8 32-bit.</span></p>
<p><span>The executable for IE8 64-bit is located here:</span></p>
<p><span>C:\<b>Program Files</b>\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe</span></p>
<p><span>The executable for IE8 32-bit is located here:</span></p>
<p><span>C:\<b>Program Files (x86)</b>\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe</span></p>
<p><span>See this "sticky" for more details &amp; info about IE8 64-bit vs. IE8 32-bit on a Win7 64-bit computer:

<p><span>That being said, please answer all of the following diagnostic questions by number in your very next reply (no need to quote

<p><span>2. Are you running NIS 2010 or NIS 2011 &amp; when does your current subscription expire?</span></p>
<p><span>3. Has another Norton application or a McAfee application ever been installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>4. Did a Norton free-trial or a McAfee free-trial come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it? (Doesn't matter if you

<p>Thank you very much for the informative and helpful reply. &nbsp;This is getting very odd:</p>
<p>1) &nbsp;I went to C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer and no iexplore.exe. &nbsp;However, C:\Program Files\Internet Explorer\en-US\iexplore.exe.mui is there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) &nbsp;I went to C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer and no iexplore.exe. &nbsp;However, C:\Program Files (x86)\Internet Explorer\en-US\iexplore.exe.mui is there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I looked half a dozen times because I'm having trouble believing my eyes. &nbsp;But that's what it says. &nbsp;If IE can't be deleted -- and I'm sure you guys know your stuff -- then I have no idea what happened to it. &nbsp;But it doesn't show up in the list, anywhere
 that I can find. &nbsp;(And thank you for the sticky on 64/32, that was very helpful.)</p>
<p>To answer your spec questions:</p>
<p>1) The computer is running Win7Pro 64, original install, it's a new-ish computer.</p>
<p>2) NIS version 16.8.0.41 with LiveUpdate and it expires in 414 days. &nbsp;It was installed late November 2009 (when I bought the computer) but it would be getting continual updates.</p>
<p>3) No other Norton/McAfee applications that I can think of (or find, I browsed). &nbsp;But it is running BCWipe4 (installed about 6 weeks ago, give or take).</p>
<p>4) I don't recall if a Norton/McAfee free trial came with the system or not. &nbsp;However, given that my subscription expires in 414 days, and the computer is slightly more than 365 days old, I'm presuming I had a free 60-day trial from Norton and got a 2-year
 subscription when it expired.</p>
<p>FWIW, the new laptop is set up to sync automatically via LiveMesh with an older (backup) laptop. &nbsp;I'm getting a blue screen towards the end of the startup sequence on that one now, it's not usable at all because I can't get through the startup sequence.
 But I don't know if that's related to this issue, I hadn't touched it in months before this. &nbsp;There could have been an intervening problem.</p>
<p>For a while, all these problems with .exe files made me afraid I'd been hacked, but since it looks like there's a problem with the updates from yesterday, I appreciate the info on Microsoft support. &nbsp;Thank you.</p>
<p>And thank you very much for your help! &nbsp;If we can fix this, great, that would be ideal. &nbsp;If not, I'll try Microsoft support.</p>
<p>Thank you everyone!</p>
PS -- I've done a bit of browsing since then, and can't find any .exe files. Am I doing something wrong?

<p>Norton (and McAfee) applications are <em>notorious</em> for not upgrading (or uninstalling) cleanly. Assuming any pre-installed Norton&nbsp;free-trial had NOT expired...</p>
<p><strong>[You will want to print these instructions for offline reference. If a Step says to reboot, reboot.]</strong><br />
<br />
1. Download the Norton Removal Tool, saving it to your desktop:&nbsp; 
<span>ftp://ftp.symantec.com/public/english_us_canada/removal_tools/Norton_Removal_Tool.exe</span></p>
<p>2. Close any open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar).</p>
<p>3. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">After making certain you have a copy of your Product Key handy</span>, uninstall all Norton software (including&nbsp;<strong>LiveUpdate</strong> and any&nbsp;<strong>Norton Add-ons)</strong> via
<strong>Control Panel | Programs | Uninstall a program</strong> (or&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel | Programs and Features</strong>, if using Classic view).</p>
<p>4. IMPORTANT! =&gt; Enable the Windows Firewall immediately after rebooting.<br />
<br />
<strong>NB: You're "working without a net" now: Don't to ANYTHING else online (e.g., browsing; reading email; chatting) until you've completed&nbsp;Step #7&nbsp;below!</strong></p>
<p>5. Right-click on the file you saved in Step #1 above and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong>.&nbsp; Don't TOUCH your keyboard until the run completes, then reboot.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;Do a clean install of&nbsp;NIS 2011&nbsp;(using your Product ID, if need be)&nbsp;&amp; reboot;&nbsp;cf.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.symantec.com/norton/support/kb/web_view.jsp?wv_type=public_web&amp;docurl=20080514162318EN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.symantec.com/norton/support/kb/web_view.jsp?wv_type=public_web&amp;docurl=20080514162318EN</a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE: Do&nbsp;NOT enable or install any Norton Add-ons or toolbars (e.g., Norton Anti-Phishing) just yet.<br />
</strong><br />
7. Manually and repeatedly run (Norton) LiveUpdate until you get a "no more updates" prompt.</p>
<p>8. Reset IE Advanced settings&nbsp;per &nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Reset-Internet-Explorer-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Reset-Internet-Explorer-settings</a></p>
<p>9. IMPORTANT! Open&nbsp;IE8 32-bit (only)&nbsp;to <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058</a> [ignore APPLIES TO section] &amp; run the Fix It in DEFAULT and then AGGRESSIVE modes. [2]</p>
<p>10. Reboot one last time&nbsp;&amp; test.</p>
<p>NOTE =&gt;&nbsp;Since you've installed Chrome, you may need to take care of the following now, too:</p>
<p>11. Please make sure that access to IE8 (32-bit &amp; 64-bit) is enabled (turned on):<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Turn-Windows-features-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Turn-Windows-features-on-or-off</a></p>
<p>12. Now make sure that IE8 is&nbsp;set it as your default&nbsp;Browser in the CUSTOM&nbsp;(<strong>&lt;=important!</strong>) section of&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Change-default-programs-using-Set-Program-Access-and-Computer-Defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Set
 Program Access and Computer Defaults</span></a> and then restart your computer again &amp; test.</p>
<p>Note: If &amp; when you recheck this setting, "Use my current browser" will be selected &amp; it will be pointing to IE8.<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
[1] Full Disclosure: Running the Fix It in AGGRESSIVE mode will delete your Update History but not the list of Installed Updates.</p>

<h2>            I am unable to install .net framework update &#40;KB 982670&#41;.</h2>
                    <p>I have windows 7 x64 on an Emachine. I have downloaded and ran the update fixit I have cleared the data folder for windows update rolled the machine back to 6 months before. I also downloaded and burned the standalone.iso. The update is sticking on the .net
 4.XX update so i then went and attemped to uninstall and reinstall (in admin) the .net update and the hot fix. and the same result. I have uninstalled all VS and firewall is turned off. I have uninstalled all programs not needed to run windows (games etc.)
 Please help. I am also using on board graphics by intel. Today will be days 3. There must be a work around to get the .net to install that doesnt include having to install fresh copy of windows.</p>

            Thank you for the reply. I downloaded it and installed then rebooted ran the Windows update and still the same thing. I rebooted again re-ran the fixit tool and then ran the ISO for sp1 and same thing. I have also ran the scandisck and checkdisk at startup
 and ran defrag.

            <p>&nbsp;I have to ask if you've run a registry cleaner or made any changes to the registry.&nbsp; If so, that's likely the cause of your problem.&nbsp; Registry cleaners do no noticable good and can cause problems.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;In any case it sounds like it's definitely time to back up any data you want to keep, if you haven't done so already.&nbsp; And unless someone comes up with a fix (which I doubt) it's probably time to prepare to restore your computer to factory settings because
 something is definitely corrupted in your system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Good luck.</p>

            <p>yes sp1 has been introduced through the windows updater. No i have not used any reg.edits or reg cleaners. only vs i have used was is microsoft security essentials. everything security wise is microsoft made or engineered.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>there must be somthing i can do without having to restore to original install. the thing has ran peacfully since last summer when i purchased win7 home premium. and it is the first time this piece of junk emachine has ran flawlessly except for the .net framework.
 which is what is prohibiting sp1 from installing. </p>

            <p>Wel i am mistaken then. so how do i get the framework to install. Because the frame work is what is making sp1 fail. not sure how many times i need to state this. and yes all of the required updates to sp1 are installed except for .net 4.&nbsp; when sp1 errors
 out it takes me to the fixit wizard page. As I have stated earlier. everything you have read in this thread is what i saw and are still seeing.

<p>And this would be the first time in almost a year that i have had a problem. </p>

<h2>            USB 3.0 ports&#47;devices work fine&#59; 2.0 ports&#47;devices not working. Some integrated devices show error code 45</h2>
                    <p>Apologies for the length of this, but I have attempted a number of different troubleshooting "fixes" and none of them have worked...so here I am, humbled in my inability to fix this on my own :(<br />
<br />
I've had this problem since the mid part of June. &nbsp;I was running Windows 10, part of the Insiders program as well. I received an update to the build number 14367 (if i recall correctly). The installation went fine, without any errors etc. &nbsp;The system rebooted
 as normal, &nbsp;and I was able to login &nbsp;without any problems. The system seems stable however within a few minutes, there was some sort of system crash.. &nbsp;If I recall correctly I was using &nbsp;the accessibility function, specifically narration, and was surfing the
 web &nbsp;on my Chrome browser. I was using narrator to read an article on a webpage when all of the sudden the sound dropped out and I heard a very high-pitched &nbsp;tone (almost like a feedback loop).. The screen &nbsp;also froze, and the mouse/keyboard input was not
 being recognized (my laptop's touchpad and built-in keyboard also was not working). &nbsp;Without any other options available, I pressed my power button and held it down for a few seconds until the laptop shut off.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Since the volume on my attached sound system was very loud at the time, my cat &nbsp;was rather traumatised and I spent the next hour or so &nbsp;playing with him and the number of furry mouse toys.. Beside the point of course :) &nbsp;After that hour I turn on my &nbsp;laptop,
 &nbsp;and immediately got the boot screen and a message from the Toshiba Bios screen &nbsp;saying something to the effect of "diagnosing / repairing your PC." &nbsp;it worked after a couple of minutes and my windows login screen appeared. The external mouse or keyboard were
 not working so I use the built-in keyboard and punched in my password. My desktop screen loaded without incident however the external devices still did not work.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I brought up the device manager, and &nbsp;could only find the built-in touchpad / keyboard. &nbsp;I took a look at the hidden devices and found that my HID devices &nbsp;we're showing an error code 45. I tried to:&nbsp;<br />
- remove and reinsert the USBs devices<br />
- update the drivers (automatically find)<br />
- unchecked the power management option&nbsp;<br />
Since none of these fixes worked, I uninstalled the drivers and rebooted the laptop with every intention to reinstall them. However upon rebooting received a BSOD.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I was unable to boot into safe mode. All of the startup/recovery options simply returned to the BSOD. I didn't have the foresight of making a win10 repair disc before this whole kerfuffle, but I had my 8.1 recovery discs from the Toshiba Recovery Creator that
 I burned before upgrading to Win10. These discs allowed me to boot into DOS mode, however the automatic repair options would not work. It was unable to find the restore points i had created in Win10. &nbsp;It's worth noting that when I put it into DOS mode, I was
 relieved to see that my external USB 3.0 HDD was being recognized, and my Windows user files were still present.<br />
<br />
At this point I called the Microsoft tech support and was taken through the steps I had already tried. &nbsp;The representative told me that the Windows 8.1 recovery disks &nbsp;would be incapable of performing a proper recovery with the current Win10 operating system.
 &nbsp;She referred me to a Microsoft store to have them look at the laptop. She also sent me the link to the media creation tool for Windows 10 via email. Up on attending the store, the tech almost immediately diagnosed it as my motherboard and chipset drivers
 being "out of whack" from the bsod error message. &nbsp;He advised me on the steps he could take to recover the system. He suggested that he could make a copy of my user files, wipe everything on the hard disk and reinstall Windows 10. &nbsp;Although this had always
 been a option available to me, the whole reason I went into the store was to avoid doing this. &nbsp;With a turnaround time of one week, I declined. Since the tech realized I was fairly computer savvy, &nbsp;he outlined the steps in order to save the user files burn
 an image using the media creation tool. &nbsp;He warned me that I would have to mount my USB Drive in DOS. However I never actually had to do this since it was being recognized automatically.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;So I followed those guidelines and using the Windows 10 image, I actually was able to get into my PC without wiping and reinstalling. The bsod was no longer &nbsp;an issue. However my external mouse and keyboard were still not working. &nbsp;I tried those devices and
 other computers and my Android devices via an OTG cable, &nbsp;and they were working fine. I further figured out that the USB 3.0 ports were working fine so long as I had a 3.0 device plugged in. &nbsp;Any USB 2.0 or lower device that I plugged into any of the ports
 we're not being recognized, were not even giving error message that the device was damaged or anything of the sort. &nbsp;Device manager did not &nbsp;have an indication that those devices were plugged in. They were still getting power, since my 2.0 thumb drives were
 lit up and other peripherals were able to charge.<br />
<br />
I decided to restore stock 8.1 operating system. &nbsp;I selected the option to wipe everything and reinstall Windows 8.1, basically a factory reset. (I have my doubts that the Toshiba restore discs formatted my C: drive, because the "wiping" process seemed to be
 completed rather quickly (for a 1TB HDD). After the OS installation was &nbsp;complete, the problem was still present. &nbsp;In the process of updating my drivers from the Toshiba support website, I realized that other hardware drivers was also missing. My laptops internal
 webcam, Bluetooth and micro-usb reader &nbsp;we're not being detected but was able to see them after clicking on "show hidden devices"<br />
<br />
&nbsp;The steps I've taken thus far:<br />
- Hardware troubleshooter (actually I used every individual troubleshooter)<br />
- Windows recovery options (Refresh/Restore/Repair)<br />
- Manufacturer recovery option (Wipe/re-install)<br />
- Manufacturer driver updates and software (both the up-to-date and older versions)<br />
- Windows updates (with the signed hardware drivers and without)<br />
- Chipset Drivers from manufacturer; Chipset drivers from Intel<br />
- Switched to Windows generic drivers in place of manufacturers downloaded ones<br />
- BIOS only allows the option for disable/enable USB 3.0 controller. Tried to see if disabling it helped to recognize 2.0 devices...nope.<br />
- BIOS disabled/enabled Webcam option...still not working<br />
- Re-install manufacture Bluetooth and USB micro-card reader software packages...no cigar<br />
- USB hubs: uninstalled/rebooted/reinstalled. Power management: disabled ability for PC to turn off device...no cigar<br />
<br />
The USB controllers are always being recognized in device manager. But only the 'Generic USB xHCI Host Controller' is able to recognize external USB devices (but only with my 3.0 HDDs/flashdrive). The 2 USB EHCI controllers are present, but don't register any
 external USB device changes. I can only use them to charge my phone or tablet since they still provide a power source to the devices.<br />
<br />
I have tried uninstalling the hidden devices (ie: webcam, micro-card reader) in the hopes that it would be re-install upon reboot. They don't reinstall, and I am unable to manually re-install the drivers since the device is now completely gone from device manager.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
My BIOS is up to date.<br />
<br />
I was told by the Microsoft &nbsp; technician that if I was to update to Windows 10 without first solving this problem, this problem with simply transfer to the new operating system. So I really really really would like to get back to the Windows 10 OS because it
 was amazingly awesome (kudos to you guys BTW).. But I cannot for the life of me figure out how to fix this. Toshiba support has been less than helpful and suggested it was a problem with the chipset drivers. The Intel support team seems to be taking it a little
 bit more seriously, &nbsp;in that they requested logs to review (dxdiag).<br />
<br />
I have booted up with a Linux Live CD, &nbsp;and the external mouse and keyboard work fine. This tells me it &nbsp;may not be a hardware &nbsp;problem. &nbsp;I have avoided seeking support from forums such as this one as my past experiences have always resulted in the same incorrect
 diagnosis "your hardware is faulty" But that was a number of years ago, and from reading a number of user posts, the quality of support has dramatically improved... I'm hoping &nbsp;you guys would be able to give me a better idea of what is going wrong with my
 system..<br />

            <p>Hi Nick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We&nbsp;appreciate the time and effort that you have invested in to fix the issue. We understand you concern and we will provide the assistance required to help resolve the above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To begin with, I would like to inform that your USB drivers are a part of the motherboard/chipset drivers that has been&nbsp;assembled by the computer's manufacturer (Toshiba). As per the error code provided, it states that the device needs to be reconnected,
 which in your case suggest that your USB might not be recognized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you have tried almost all the troubleshooting steps&nbsp;to&nbsp;fix the issue. I&nbsp;suggest that you try updating the latest chipset drivers from the computer's manufacturer website and check if it helps. You can also refer to the article provided below for more
 information on the same.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, then I suspect that the&nbsp;issue is related to hardware malfunction and Toshiba will be better equipped to help you resolve the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps</p>
<p>Regards&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks for your quick reply Vanessa. Much appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do agree that many of the symptoms indicate a possible hardware malfunction, however some of the fixes/tests I have done seem to indicate otherwise. One thing I forgot to mention was that this problem was also affecting the internal optical DVD drive.
 &nbsp;I managed to correct this by reverting to a different driver from the drive manufacturer.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Also since the devices in question seem to function without issue when I boot into Ubuntu, &nbsp;I begin to question &nbsp;whether my Hardware was indeed at fault. It seems to be only &nbsp;affecting the Windows installation.<br />
<br />
I have another question about the media creation tool recovery option that I had been referred to previously. By selecting the option to remove all my personal files, does that actually perform a complete format of my HDD?
</p>
<p><br />
The reason I ask is that when I had previously done this, and all was said and done with the "fresh" Windows installation, I noticed that some of the drivers being detected by the device manager were not the default/factory/signed versions. &nbsp;They were using
 versions that I had manually installed in my earlier attempts at correcting the problem?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am curious to know whether the Windows recovery method retains the drivers used in the earlier windows installation. And is there a recovery method you would suggest I use to ensure that all data is wiped so that artifacts such as previous driver versions
 are not reused in the re-installation process?<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance,<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi Nick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the&nbsp;added information, I would agree that it is not a hardware malfunction, as you were able to use the USB when you reverted to the older driver version.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also like to inform that Windows OS and Ubuntu&nbsp;require their own drivers update and installation. Once you install the updates in one OS, it will not indicate that the same will work on the other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the information you require with Resetting of the OS, I suggest that you refer to the&nbsp;link below</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 does not upgrade due to Windows 10 makes a false detection that I am running windows from USB drive</h2>
                    <p>On my laptop I have windows 10 installed but I can not upgrade it into windows 10 pro Nov update version since windows 10 by mistake detects that I am running Windows from USB drive so it will not apply updates and shows following error
<br />
"You can't install windows on a USB flash drive setup"<br />
<br />
In fact I am booting and running windows from <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
internal HDD</span> and there is no USB drive or any other types of drives plugged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Explorer is showing only drive C:\ and there is no other drive there, I have asked for aat least three times "MS Support HelpDesk Technicians" to solve this issue, but I do not know why no one from &nbsp;&nbsp;"MICROSOFT HELP DESK TECHNICIANS" could fix this issue
 for me.<br />
All of them suggested following approach and my blunt answer is:&nbsp;<br />
<em>Do not suggest me to</em> <strong>USE MEDIA CREATION TOOLS COMBINED WITH WIN10 ISO FILE&nbsp;</strong><strong>and Upgrade either from
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">bootable usb drive </span>or EXTRACTING ISO FILE ON DESKTOP AND EXECUTING SETUP FROM THE EXTRACTED ISO FOLDER SINCE I GET THE INFAMOUS ERROR&nbsp;</strong>"You can't install windows on a USB flash drive setup"
<strong>&nbsp; AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN. I am really &nbsp;tired of it.<br />
<br />
My applications are gradually stop functioning and I can not upgrade my Windows10 pro to NOV version.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
IN ADDITION&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">I AM NOT GOING TO REINSTALL WINDOWS AT ALL</span>.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>I HAVE TRIED IT A COUPLE OF TIMES AND THESE METHODS DO NOT WORK AT ALL.</strong></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>The help desk technician took control of my laptop and changed the drive permissions setting on my whole drive and promised me nothing will go wrong.<br />
In the middle of changing the file &amp; folders access permission it got couple of errors and&nbsp;that procedure got stopped I am worried what kind of future errors I will get because of him.<br />
<br />
Now nothing has changed and I am wondering if MICROSOFT IS GOING TO SOLVE THIS ISSUE FOR ME OR NOT.<br />
<br />
It is very simple for developers working at MS to prepare a FixIt file and <strong>
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">reset </span></em></strong>what ever flag either resides in the HardDisk or Registry that is written that I am running windows from HDD or USB.<br />
<br />
AGAIN I AM NOT GOING TO REINSTALL WINDOWS AGAIN AND <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
&nbsp;I EXPECT MS HAS TO FIX ITS ISSUE FOR ME WHICH IS VERY SIMPLE</span> FOR THEM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to hearing from a responsible person from MS.</p>

                    <p>As I was attempting to find ways to change file location of Game DVR, I was puzzled for a while because I felt like something was missing. I paid more attention and realized, I don't even have the Game DVR setting on my Xbox app on Windows!&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(74, 74, 74, 1)">https://gyazo.com/9a4b017430eada71d8345cddfdea5054</span>Is
 there any way to update the app or get the setting on the application?<br />

<p>I have the same issue. No Game DVR and also no Captures folder. The url listed in my captures settings is to my temp folder. and there appears to be no way to add a captures folder and have it be recognized by the gaming settings for captures.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone out there replies with something constructive. I mean, seriously. Don't bother giving instructions on where it should be. We KNOW that. If we are on here posting something, we have already searched and tried the easy stuff. Sorry to complain
 but I find it kind of insulting when people reply with things that are so obvious. Trying to be helpful here.</p>

<h2>            windows 10 killed my computer and itself</h2>
                    &nbsp;upgraded to windows 10&nbsp;from windows 8.1. I am so sick&nbsp;and&nbsp;tired of windows in general, 8.1 wasn't even as bad. crashes as usual throughout the week, as usual meaning just as bad as windows 8. every other day i'd be plunged into a crash loop and couldn't
 do anything about it, i've tried dozens of solutions with no success. apparently this most recent boot loop was caused by the retarded forced windows update which has caused three computer-breaking issues since the release of windows 10 (not for me, for other
 people, I'm just a victim of one of these errors I think) I managed to fix&nbsp;that loop&nbsp;by chance when I eventually got to the recovery console a hundred crashes later by deleting registry keys, but at the same time that&nbsp;loop was going on, this login&nbsp;crash has
 me unable to do anything.&nbsp;I've been spending all day watching windows 10 blue screen over and over again, whether it's complaining about something missing or corrupted, a driver-relat

            <p>Enter the bios via del key or f8 ect&nbsp;at boot. Reset bios to default.&nbsp; Set boot order to boot cd-rom 1st..save and exit bios.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either the bios or Master Boot Record is confused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reset to bios factory default should fix the bios.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since boot order is cd-rom 1st.. put a Microsoft Install disk (or factory recovery disk) in the cd rom and use it to do a Windows repair. It the repair works..right click&nbsp; c drive/properties and select check drive for errors and fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if unable to do a repair then reinstall old operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reinstall 10 upgrade via Media Creation Tool..just reinstall..dont create media for now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you cant get into bios at boot you may have to disconnect/reconnect cmos battery to get bios to use factory bios defaults.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Heat my be causing problems. Consider OpenHardware Monitor (free) for realtime temps to see if heat is the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When inside of bios look at voltages..they must be within 5% of spec..ie 5% of 12v ..5% of 3v ect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use new Video Drivers for Win 10 or Microsoft Drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have to you may have to put the hard drive in another computer to repair it..then put it back in once repaired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Set screen resolution to 1024x768.&nbsp; 1600x1200 is to high for right now, till video card mfgs get 10 drivers.

            That warning about a full mailbox is not coming from Windows Live Mail, it is coming from the service provider for the mail server.&nbsp; Who is your mail service provider?&nbsp; If you don't know, you can get a clue from the part of your email address that comes
 after the @ symbol.&nbsp; Go to their webmail site and clean out the mailbox on the server.

<h2>            Sharing encrypted files over network</h2>
                    I've just bought a Vista Ultimate laptop and am using SyncToy to synchronise my files and folders from my desktop PC (Vista home premium). I would like to use EFS to encrypt my documents on my laptop, but when I enable encryption on the documents folder
 I can no longer access files from my desktop over the network. I get an 'Access Denied' message.<br />
<br />
I have exported the security certificate from my laptop onto my desktop using instructions on the help and how to website, but this doesn't seem to make a difference. Is there anything else I need to do?

            Hello Mbowles198,<br />
<br />
Thank you for your post.&nbsp; What version of SyncToy are you currently using?&nbsp; The ability to sync EFS files was added in version 2.0.&nbsp; This ability was not included in previous versions.&nbsp; Please take a look at the following link (download if you wish) and let
 us know if this did or didn't resolve your problem.<br />

<h3> tlhf  say:</h3>
<h2>            My PC Will Not Play Any Video or Audio Files</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>I just upgraded my PC to build 14393.10 (Current Insider Preview build), and have found that playing any video, be it on my device or YouTube, will not play. Along with that, audio files will not play, and my PC will not output any audio whatsoever. I have
 never had this issue before, so I have no idea of what to do. If you need any info about my PC or anything, feel free to ask. Here are some screenshots of what happens when I attempt to play video or audio files.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8e004f72-5bf2-48a8-b984-da7d2f55daf3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8e004f72-5bf2-48a8-b984-da7d2f55daf3" /></a></p>
<p>This is what happens when I attempt to play YouTube videos. I have tried on multiple different videos, but get the same result.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7bcc7370-1cf4-45e6-86a9-c20d00de1974" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7bcc7370-1cf4-45e6-86a9-c20d00de1974" /></a>I
 can't play music in Spotify either, even local files. When I try to play music in the Groove app, it just simply fails to play.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>-Adam</p>

    <title>windows 8.1 black screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mwillmott  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows 8.1 black screen</h2>
                    <p>Okay, so yesterday I installed uktrauxthemepatcheruktrauxthemepatcher ( to install non stock themes) and then restarted windows to install updates. I am now stuck on a flashing black screen. How do I fix this? I am unable to enter safe mode because windows
 8.1 appears to have removed the f8 feature that allowed this. Some extra points: time is of the essence as I need it for school, if possible please make any solution simple to follow as I have no PC knowledge. I am fairly certain after googling this that the
 ultrauxthemepatcher is to blame. Also I literally only got the full Microsoft office package today so I do not want to system restore and lose this. Much thanks - Matt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Edit: after a solid 2 hours worrying I just decided to restore to &nbsp;a point before the problems, all worked out fine, common sense ftw! thanks for the help anyway and for anyone who is interested it was the Ultra UXtheme patcher, don't install it!</p>

<p><span>Hello Robbie,<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft answers forums!<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Make sure that the default sound device is set correctly for the sound device that you are using. To set the default device, follow these
 steps:</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Click and type Sound in the Start Search box.</span>
</li><li><span>Click Sound in the search results at the top of the Start menu.</span>
</li><li><span>Click the Playback tab. Notice the check mark next to the default device. For most users, the default device is Speakers. Make sure
 that your audio settings are configured as expected. Follow these steps:</span> </li></ol>
<ol>
<li><span>On the Playback tab, select the playback device, click Properties, click the Advanced tab, and make sure that the Default Format
 is set to the value that you expect. When you finish, close this window to return to the previous window.
</span></li><li><span>On the Playback tab, select the playback device, click Configure, and then make sure the configurations are set correctly.
</span></li></ol>
<p><span>If the sound settings are set correctly, you are using speakers as the sound device, and your speakers are already set as the default device,
 go to method 5 now. </span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Select the sound device that you want as the default sound device, and then click Set Default.
</span></li><li><span>Click OK to save your settings and to close the Sound dialog box.
</span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>Are you able to get the sound via headphones?<br />
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Please check in device manager to see if the drivers for sound card device up to date. [To go to device manager, click on start. In the search bar type, devmgmt.msc
 and hit enter.]<br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If not, please try updating the drivers for the same by right clicking on the device.</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If this does not work, please try uninstalling and reinstalling the drivers.<br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Also try running Fixit tool to troubleshoot sound problems.<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>Follow the below article to download Fixit tool:<br />
