            <p>Hello Onnoden,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apology for the delay in response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you see Code 28 error, it indicates that device drivers for that particular&nbsp;device have not yet been installed. I mean the problem is appearing with the incompatible&nbsp;drivers. Since you tried install the latest drivers, but the problem still appearing.
 Suggest you to check installing the legacy drivers (I.e. Windows 7 or Windows 8.1) to see if it makes any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case problem still appears, then try to install them in compatibility mode.

<h2>            avatar spinning, unable to make it stop</h2>
                    
<p>I recently got an xbox one and have been trying to play CoD Advanced Warfare and am stuck in a constant counter-clockwise spin. I have tried everything including removing the batteries from my controller, unsyncing and resyncing the controller, nothing is
 working. Anyone else having this problem?</p>

<p>Hey mate,</p>
<p>Firstly, have you tried plugging your controller in to your xbox VIA the charging cable to see if there is an update for the controller?
</p>
<p>Link explaining how to update controller: <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-AU/xbox-one/accessories/update-controller-for-stereo-headset-adapter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../update-controller-for-stereo-headset-adapter</a></p>
<p>If you have, then try it with another controller if you can, which will tell you if you have a faulty controller or not</p>
<p>Let me know how you go :)</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

    <title>xhunter1.sys and event viewer error - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            xhunter1.sys and event viewer error</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>Sorry If I am posting this in the wrong place, hopefully someone may redirect me to a better page that suits my needs if this has been posted to the wrong place!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my problem is regarding a game I play (Blade and Soul) and a folder that is no longer working or even there (for that matter) in my windows directory anymore after I did a re-installation of Windows 10 (due to some other error I was experiencing). I chose
 the keep my private files (but it still deletes all my downloaded programs).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So after I re-installed windows 10, I re-downloaded Blade and Soul once again, except this time after my full installation and trying to play the game I noticed event viewer kept giving me an error regarding one certain folder: xhunter1.sys&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message I'd receive comes with information posted at the exact same time:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Information (Event ID: 26):&nbsp;</p>
<p>The description for Event ID 26 from source Application Popup cannot be found. Either the component that raises this event is not installed on your local computer or the installation is corrupted. You can install or repair the component on the local computer.<br />
<br />
If the event originated on another computer, the display information had to be saved with the event.<br />
<br />
The following information was included with the event:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
\??\C:\WINDOWS\xhunter1.sys failed to load<br />
<br />
The message resource is present but the message was not found in the message table</p>
<p>
</p><p>And Error (Event ID: 7000):&nbsp;</p>
<p>The xhunter1 service failed to start due to the following error:&nbsp;<br />
Windows cannot verify the digital signature for this file. A recent hardware or software change might have installed a file that is signed incorrectly or damaged, or that might be malicious software from an unknown source.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this pains me because after I log out once (the game still runs the first time but shows that error), I can never run my application and it will give application errors on every next instance I try to run my game (unless I do another full reinstall of
 the game)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I end up getting (Error: Event id: 1000):&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Which I presume has to do with the first xigncode error due to the fact it cannot run correctly somewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried a few things to get that xhunter1.sys to work. I've tried to use my game's file repair after I deleted xigncode folders within the bns game, I've deleted xhunter1 from my computer's registry, in hoping that when it restored this it'd also apply
 the correct xhunter1.sys file I need...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even went to my windows.old folder and tried to drag over the xhunter1.sys file I had from before I did a re-install of windows 10, but it still gave me the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also notice that even though whenever I put an xhunter1.sys file in my windows directory, everytime that error occurs... if there is an xhunter1.sys in there, it gets removed or if there isn't one I guess it cannot locate it which gives me the same event
 7000 ID.&nbsp; I tried to contact Blade and Soul support but they're less than helpful and I do not know how to resolve this issue. I'd hope to resolve it without having to do a complete re-install of windows 10 and not keeping private files...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point, I cannot even get xigncode to download a working version of xhunter1.sys into my windows directory anymore. After every file repair, I don't even see xhunter1.sys anymore. This was all working fine a few days ago (before I did the re-installation)
 and I had many more applications downloaded so I don't believe its a conflict of applications. (The only apps I have now are all ones that I had previous to the re-installation). I just don't know if there is some other registry place I should have deleted?
 Also, I deleted the xhunter1.sys from my windows.old folder because I thought maybe its detecting I already have one... so now I don't even have another xhunter1.sys to insert again, (but not that it matters too much as when I already tried that it didn't
 work...)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully someone may help and sorry for the long wall of text.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />

<p>Hi xS0uth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It seems that the issue you're having right now is something that has to do with the game developers. I just like to ask if this is a game protection software or somewhat a "game guard"? There's a possibility that the current version of the game guard is
 compatible with OS of your Windows 10. I suggest that you check or visit your game support or forums and see if they have an update or most probably a new version compatible with your system. You can also post your issue there and ask assistance on this matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please respond to this thread to let me know how the issue progresses. Similarly, if you have more questions, please inform me by replying to this post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Hi Leviozar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for responding! Yeah this is kind of like"Game guard" or game protection software. There are a few problems and strange things here. The thing is before I did the re-install of windows 10, I was already on win ver. 1803 and it ran perfectly fine.
 Also, the game's forums or website never has any updates directly for xigncode unfortunately, nor does xigncode's website. I think it is supposed to automatically update on its own whenever I run the game and it scans through my files, as I've played the game
 for over a year and never once had to manually update xigncode myself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The biggest issue seems to be the lack of it installing into my windows directory and when it does install, windows doesn't recognize it or thinks something is wrong with it so it automatically gets removed(My windows.old had it in there), but in the newly
 installed win.10, it wasn't there anymore in my windows directory and hence I received those errors posted above. I tried to drag my old one there, but whenever I ran the game, the error popped up in event viewer, and windows removed it from windows directory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess a question would be, would the new win ver. 1803 somehow not allow new changes to be added into my directory...? Or I'm just completely confused as to why its not allowing a xhunter1.sys file to stay, despite the fact that I previously already had
 ver 1803 before I did the windows 10 re-install (only re-installed because I had some other issues with windows)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could it also be that since xigncode wasn't on my list of uninstalled applications provided after the re-install, a new installation of the game conflicts with the old xigncode files left somewhere on the computer? I just feel confused is all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for any insights you may provide!&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />

</p><p>I am not too sure how to read these, but I presume it has to do with the game protection software not working correctly so my game ceases to even open now. Would I have to re-install windows 10 again to try and resolve this? It just puzzles me that everything
 regarding this game protection software and the game itself worked fine before the re-install.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, is it strange that my windows.old folder has more files than my windows folder, would that mean its lacking something and the xhunter1.sys needs something else along to verify it or make it work within the windows directory folders ... (or at least
 that was the case when I last checked, now that I just checked again, it would seem in my windows.old --&gt; windows, it removed everything that wasn't a file and freed up a lot of gigs on my c drive).&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Thanks for any help you can provide, your response has already been more helpful than my game's support...&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
Edit: I think I will try and re-install windows 10 again (while keeping my files) and hope that it does something.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So I have just finished re-installing windows 10 again, and I don't know if I have made matters worse. The only downloads I have done are of google chrome, and the installation of my game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So before, my game would at least load up once and let me login and then notify me of the system error first.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I don't see any system error anymore, but it straight up jumps to the application error.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I previously had an issue that wasn't really resolved :&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-files/xhunter1sys-and-event-viewer-error/edbca9d5-bb36-4ae1-8e4f-e612bd1c9270</p>
<p>But I also noticed I typed a ton of information there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just want to update I do feel like I am slowly getting closer to the issue, but I am not 100% sure about an error message. I don't understand how to read this application error very well:&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>My main question here is regarding the ntdll.dll&nbsp; and the version 10.0.17134.137,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To me, I looked it up and it seems that 17134.137 was the most recent KB up for windows 10 on version 1803. Is this error message saying that this is the reason that my application is having some issues? Or is it the ntdll having issues? Any help would be
 appreciated! I also looked up that ntdll module name error and on a previous post it was suggested by a moderator to uninstall and reinstall that ntdll, but I am returned with this error message:&nbsp;http://prntscr.com/k1vdbi that message was presented when I
 both tried to uninstall and install.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Also on the off chance if anyone knows any more about xhunter1), it would seem a friend's xhunter1 who was working... in their windows registry for xhunter1 they had a WOW64 line more than mine, and it had a value of 1. I don't know why my registry for
 xhunter1 would be missing that, and any explanation if possible would be greatly appreciated!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: Here is also the information that is presented at the same time as the error message:&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thank you for your response. I appreciate all the details you have provided. Well, I did some research on the forums of Blade and Soul just to check on something. Since you're having the "<span>Faulting application path: C:\Program Files (x86)\NCSOFT\BnS\bin64\Client.exe"
 that collides with the "</span><span>Faulting module path: C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\ntdll.dll" that leads on crashing. One of the forum members got the same issue as yours and was able to resolve it by reinstalling the Nvidia drivers. For reference about
 the thread, you can check and review it on this <a href="https://forums.bladeandsoul.com/topic/240126-solved-bns-wont-start-after-pressing-play-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi again,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for taking the time to look into my issue and try and find a fix for me! You have already been more helpful than Blade and Soul support as you actually seem to read what I say, so thank you very much for that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, I have tried the latest 3 drivers for nvidia, but all of them have no success. At the moment, I'm on the 3rd nvidia driver now (may may 24th's) and have already tried the june 5th and june 26th drivers and I still get the same error&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I do have a few questions though (of course I'm not positive you can answer since you're not a xigncode rep) but you are certainly more knowledge on windows than me so it is worth asking hopefully!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But there are a few issues here: I only get that application error when xigncode itself doesn't run (normally an icon shows up in bottom right to indicate xigncode is loading), but since it doesn't load up it results in this application
 error.&nbsp; (I did somethings, below, in which now xigncode doesn't really load and it only returns the error, but only did these because something was strange with my registry vs a friend's registry of xhunter1 that ran it fine)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, I also don't know if that faulting module name ntdll.dll's version has anything to do with it? I guess the 10.0 = windows 10, and 17134.137 = the latest KB windows update that I had, and also it seems I don't even have ntdll
 installed on my computer (?) as when I searched it up, another windows post had said&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>regsvr32.exe /u ntdll.dll and press Enter key&nbsp;<span>(this will uninstall the file)</span></li><li>regsvr32.exe ntdll.dll and press Enter key&nbsp;<span>(this will reinstall the file)</span>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>but instead I get returned "The module "ntdll.dll" was loaded but the entry-point DllUnregisterServer was not found. Make sure that "ntdll.dll" is a valid DLL or OCX file and then try again. That message appears for both those command
 lines. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Could it be that I don't have ntdll installed correctly so I am receiving errors? or is it my windows version that leads to errors (less likely I think)?&nbsp;Edit: Also did the sfc scan now and it didn't find any violations</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next, I also noticed something strange regarding how xhunter1.sys file would never install in my windows directory before, it would give me that first initial error. This error occurs when the game actually ran up and xigncode loaded
 in the bottom right, but told me xhunter1.sys is missing, and If I tried to put another temporary xhunter1.sys (downloaded from a friend) into the C:\windows folder, as soon as xigncode ran windows deleted it. It is digitally signed so I am confused, until
 I asked my friend what their xhunter1 registry looked like. Ours were almost identical (his version is the working version) except mine was missing one line from the xhunter1 registry. I am unsure of what the "WOW64" REG_DWORD with a value of (1) is supposed
 to do, but mine was certainly missing and my friend's had that line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've deleted and let xhunter1 be reinstalled by xigncode multiple times but it never contains that line. So I gave it a shot and typed it in manually, with REG_DWORD option select and gave it a value of 1 as well. Then I copied a
 copy a my friend's xhunter1.sys file into my windows directory, unblocked it, and hope that now since they "look to be matching" it'd all run correctly. Except now it only returns application errors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Could it be that just typing something in that looks the same doesn't have the same effect as when the application installs it itself? This missing registry piece has me puzzled and makes me feel like could that be a possible reason
 as to why my xigncode is installing funny or weirdly and leading to file errors into my windows directory?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for all the text,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you again for all the help you may provide!&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's my pleasure to be of help and I would love to see this issue get resolve. Alright, let's try to check the&nbsp;<span>ntdll that you tried to uninstalled and reinstalled but still in the it was not found. There's a possbility
 that it's not what file is really looking for, let try several workaround for now and see if there will be any changes in the end. Try to uninstall the game and make sure that there's nothing left. We go basic by&nbsp;</span><span><span>using
 the&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>System File Checker</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;tool
 to scan your system files and to repair missing or corrupted system files. The&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>sfc</span><span>/</span><span>scannow</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;command
 (System File Check) scans the integrity of all protected operating system files and replaces incorrect, corrupted, changed or damaged versions with the correct versions possible. You may refer to this&nbsp;</span></span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span><strong>link&nbsp;</strong></span></span></a><span><span>for
 more information.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing the SFC, let's install the latest supported <strong>Visual C++</strong>and look for
<strong>Visual studio 2017&nbsp;</strong>that can be found from our support site on this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>link</strong></a>. Then try to reinstall the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know how it goes.</p>

<p>Thanks again for a response,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've already done the SFC twice, but it never found any corrupt files either times. (However I never did run the extra lines that link told me to run, so I will try a 3rd time while running this first:&nbsp;<span>DISM.exe /Online
 /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth)&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Also, I already have the latest visual studio 2017 downloads (Both x86 and x64) because I did install a lot of C++ back after my windows re-install since it mentioned a lot were removed on the list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for a full clean uninstall of the game, well that is where I have a bit of trouble. I have "full reinstalled" it a bit, but I feel like I am doing it wrong. The problem is that the game itself doesn't provide any great tools to uninstall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The game comes in 2 folders, NCSOFT and NCWest in Programs x86. NCWest Contains the launcher of the game... and when you go to run the uninstall application, it only uninstalls the launcher and deletes everything in NCWest (but it only ever contained a launcher
 and launcher files). The game's data and everything else resides in NCSOFT... with no uninstall exe in any folders. So all I can think of to do is completely delete everything in it by pressing SHIFT + Delete.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem here now is... I believe doing just this, deleting the 2 folders associated with it isn't a clean uninstall of the game. Is there any way to make sure there is nothing left of the game besides this? My biggest worry is it will leave left over
 folders within the registry, but I'm not that great with windows and its registry and I don't wish to randomly mess something up.</p>
<p>Also, since my problem involves xigncode... and the xhunter1.sys file that should be in the windows directory, should I delete xhunter1 within my registry? But also I am not too sure what to do regarding blade and soul registry folders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now all I can do is just delete the 2 blade and soul folders... (deletes all the downloaded data and launcher)... and then reinstall, but I'm worried left over registry folders will make it not a full clean uninstall? The 2 xigncode folders reside within
 NCSOFT folder so they both get deleted, but their registries aren't touched for now... Is there any better way to uninstall the game cleanly? And xigncode clean uninstall too?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will update when the command prompt is finished, and I have already deleted blade and soul's 2 files for now and deleted "Blade and Soul" from programs and applications under control panel...&nbsp; but the reason this doesn't feel like full blade and soul either
 is its only 93mb while the data folders had 20gb+ Haven't touched registry yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: It stills says Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit2: Supposedly after "reinstalling" (in quotes because i felt it still has files in registry making it not full or clean?) (downloading and letting it download all the files again) Xigncode still ceases to run and just returns the application error back
 in event viewer after hitting play game(Event ID 1000)</p>

<p>Another update... So I just finished doing "Reset the PC" with the remove all files option this time. It completely wiped out any and all applications installed on my computer... Came back to pretty much a fully cleaned laptop. I downloaded Blade and Soul
 again and installed it and somehow the issue still persists. At this point I really am not sure what to do at all. I suppose I could try calling Microsoft support tomorrow, but I feel like I mostly won't find an answer I need there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any more possible ideas what could be causing these issues for me? I made sure to install all my windows updates so all windows updates are checked and up to date, yet when I run the application it still returns&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>I have absolutely no idea what to do now as I thought removing all my files and letting it completely reinstall windows with everything removed should finally resolve my issues but it still persists.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Edit: I even tried the NVIDIA driver reinstall again... as that's the only source of similarity that I could go off of...&nbsp;</p>
<p>I uninstalled the nvidia driver from control panel, restarted, downloaded the latest nvidia driver, installed it, restarted again, and ran the game hoping it'd have fix the issue. Still an application error. Then I tried yet another file repair, and another
 application error.....&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit2: For some reason the 64 bit version of the game only keeps returning application errors to me. However, when I run the 32 bit version of the game... it starts up again, but returns the xhunter1.sys error... (still at least I can login), but there's
 some reason my game won't install xhunter1.sys in my windows, is this a permissions thing? Is somehow my computer blocking it from installing it into my windows folder? Also I'm fairly certain now that the reason my 64 bit client cannot even run is I am missing
 a WOW64 line in the registry folder of the game's software guard or w/e, some of my friends all have of it and they can run 64bit...</p>
<p>
</p><p>So something noteworthy is it comes with EventName FaultTolerantHeap and APPCRASH , not that I know what either of them do.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> hydrochloric  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 update issue - explorer.exe class not registered</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>After updating from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 I've developed the issue in which File Explorer is no longer functional.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The install of the update went fine however after rebooting the desktop displayed nothing but black and File Explorer cannot be opened. Attempting to open explorer.exe from the run menu or through command prompt results in nothing and attempting to open
 C:\ through a run command gives:</p>
<p>
</p><p>C:\</p>
<p>
</p><p>Class not registered</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am able to open chrome and any other program not on the C:\ drive and can open through opening a file associated with it through a browser. Is there any way to fix this besides a fresh install?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand the inconvenience you are facing. Let me help you in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When you say Web Credentials Folder, is it the Credential manager or in any other applications?</li><li>Are you getting any error messages?</li><li>Are you trying to access it to make changes or to add anything?</li></ul>
<p>Follow the below steps and check if that helps.</p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In the Credential Manager, under Web Credentials, you will be able to see all your stored web passwords. To see the passwords behind the asterisks mark, you can click on Show. Windows will ask you for your login password to verify
 your identity.</span></li><li>
<p style="text-align: justify; color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Once done, the password will be exposed. If you want, you can also remove the stored password/s by clicking on Remove.</span></p>
</li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">While you can add, backup, restore Windows Credentials, there is no way to add or edit Web Credentials. Microsoft recently enumerated the changes it incorporated in Password Policy and Autocomplete Forms in Internet Explorer 11,
 to reduce the confusion in users about their passwords being recalled on one site but not another. Check this post to see how Internet Explorer 11 now stores Passwords.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Go here if your Credential Manager is not working properly in Windows 8 and here if you are looking for free password managers for Windows.</span></li></ol>

</p><p>Ha-ha-ha!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>If we still having any issues!!!</p>
<p>Yeas there is bunch of issues - it never happened in windows live mail...</p>
<p>and accounts didn't reappeared so we need to set it AGAIN!!! manually,</p>
<p>each and every account and settings to each and every folder!!!!</p>
<p>After that stupid creators update.</p>
<p>then again I always could move messages by just dragging em from one account to another</p>
<p>in windows live mail but here it doesn't work,</p>
<p>same thing that microsoft did with new skype for android - destroyed great app with good functionality,</p>
<p>same thing microsoft did to good and well adjustable e-mail program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems that when we go to "modern" times with microsoft they make programs less and less user-friendly,</p>
<p>I could adjust programs and menus much better in windows 98 then now!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So issues are still there and fix it!!!! instead of asking if we have still issue,</p>
<p>it didn't fix itself.</p>

<p>As everything with microsoft now - the questions answered</p>
<p>briefly, with no real understanding of a problem,</p>
<p>and in most cases not at all helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically seems that the developer team is a bunch of under-aged teenagers with no experience</p>
<p>what so ever in programming,</p>
<p>thou they make all programs look like toys for kids,</p>
<p>
</p><p>they destroy well working programs like Skype, like Windows Live Mail,</p>
<p>and instead bringing us crap with no functionality and honestly </p>
<p>it even doesn't looks good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now their so called "support" coming up with solution to reset program</p>
<p>and all settings or even fresh installation of windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even windows 98 wasn't so buggy as windows 10 now.</p>
<p>After every creators update something stopped working,</p>
<p>so I should be PC software specialist to use my pc,</p>
<p>and I wonder how normal folk should do?!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then pack windows with bunch of unnecessary preinstalled apps as 3d viewer and so on</p>
<p>that most people will NEVER use, thou they don't care to fix such important programs</p>
<p>as mail program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shame on you - so called "developers".</p>

<h2>            Sony Self Extracting Packager glitch</h2>
                    After deleting the 90,000+ fonts that were installed and reinstalling the&nbsp;default Windows 7 fonts, I found that the plugin windows for Vegas Pro 8 was too large to display properly. I thought that reinstalling Vegas could fix this, but the setup program
 was&nbsp;suffering&nbsp;from the same problem.

            <p>Does anyone have an answer to the question above? &nbsp;Looks like a lot of people have this issue. &nbsp;Right now my Google Earth Pro doesn't work - it shows in 2 - 3 different layers each in a different color (pink, blue, etc.) with each layer not aligned (1/2
 inch apart) -so it is unreadable. &nbsp;I tried the compatibility checker &nbsp;and it did not help.</p>
<p>Sadly I did not want to switch to Windows 10 and somehow they snuck the download in on me when I know I did not click that I wanted it.</p>

<p>oh gee....its 2017 and I just received a brand spanking new Dell Inspiron 13 7000 series laptop with Windows 10 and all the updates applied and GE Pro installs but is not useable. Most of the time, it starts with an error saying something about my resolution
 is lower than 1024x768 when in fact, my resolution is 1920x1080. It then loads in low resolution mode and then freezes when I turn off Border Labels or turn on Roads.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I didn't do anything other than turn on the laptop, register my wifi password and download GE Pro. I just tried to use that compatibility fixit tool but no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have a fix for this yet?</p>

            I installed and re-installed and found Google Earth Pro to be a Dismal failure. I had excellent results with there prior version, and was forced into using the Pro Version. So much for freedom of choice...........I'm a business owner and found Google Earth
 to be a helpful aid in conducting my business. Who knows someone else will come along and see the benefit to starting a new Earth program we have a choice in using. The old version was easy to use and a helpful tool................Guess I'll have to do without..............

<h2>            Could I still get a refund for Hitman 2&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I accidentily bought it and I played a few hours on the game's trial before (which is just mostly a port of levels from the previous game and one prologue level from the new game), I haven't started downloading or started the full game's content.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already asked twice but I believe it's an automated response because I got the exact same both times. They said I couldn't get a refund because I apparantly refunded a $9 game 5 months ago. I just believe this is unfair because I've already spent $200
 on Xbox this month and the full game purchase is still within that 2 week, 14 hour period. &nbsp;</p>

            Hi Shawn, I am Rob a volunteer and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. 
<br />
<br />The drive might not be bad though that or other hardware issues are certainly possible (see last section below for methods to test drive).
<br /> 
<br />Be sure the BIOS is set to the hard drive as the first boot device.
<br />
<br />How to make a Windows 10 Installation/Repair DVD or USB driver in last section below.
<br />
<br />Boot with a Installation or Repair disc or USB drive - issue these from the Command Prompt and hit ENTER after each.
<br />
<br />C:
<br />
<br />bootrec /fixmbr
<br />
<br />bootrec /fixboot
<br />
<br />bootrec /scanos
<br />
<br />bootrec /rebuildbcd
<br />
<br />After the above you may need to run StartUp Repair (even 2 or 3 times)
<br /><a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/27649-startup-repair-run-windows-10-a.html?ltr=S" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/27649-startu...</a>
<br />
<br />---------------------
<br />
<br />Using EasyBCD often works when other methods do not. &lt;-- if Bootrec did not help use this.
<br />
<br />Translate the Windows 8/8.1 methods to Windows 10.

            Hi LaShawn.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />It may have also changed the hard drive set first to boot to the wrong one, since it's saying that Disk3 is what's trying to boot which is strange.  
<br />
<br />Enter BIOS setup to check if the Windows hard drive is set first to boot, or if it's even detected.  If not you need to either get it to be detected by reinstalling it, changing cables, etc.  or will need to replace it.
<br />
<br />I'd replace it with an SSD which is the best Upgrade one can have - lightning fast, faster than a new higher-end PC without one, especially if you do the gold standard Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If it is presently set first to boot then unplug all other drives and peripherals, try again.  If that fails run a Startup Repair from Advanced Startup Options accessed by one of these methods:   <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />If necessary for repairs or reinstall you can  create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC by installing the Media Creation tool, choosing to Create Media, then choosing the matching version.    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Then try Startup Repair, System Restore, a Reset or do the Clean Install.  
<br />
<br />All other repairs are here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/troubleshooting-windows-8-and-10-failure-to-start/bcf8503c-1b39-4827-9734-a64fef725d0f?tm=1461970966687">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Power on and off your computer three times
<br />On the third time, your computer will boot into the Advanced Recovery environment
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Reset this PC
<br />Click Keep my files
<br />Choose your account
<br />Enter your password
<br />Click Continue
<br />Click Reset
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.

<h2>            I cannot perform a system restore&#33; Help Please&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Everytime I attampt to execute a system restore, the execution is unsuccessful and a message appears reading:</p>
<p>An exception occurred while trying to run "C:\Windows\system32\shell32.dll,control_RunDLL "C:\Windows\system32\systemdm.cpl,"System</p>
<p>Can someone please tell me what's going on with my system? How can I fix it?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Also, I've noticed that when I start up my computer it now prompts me to select "home", which I never had to do before and the first thing that pops up on my desktop is the "Found New Hardware" wizard...when there is no new hardware. Other than these issues&nbsp;I
 don't notice any other problems.</p>
<p>I have already attempted to resolve the problem in Safe Mode, but the same error message appears when i attampt a System Restore.<br />
<br />

Thanks in advance!</p>

    <title>Where do archived emails go&#63; Windows 10 Mail version 17.x - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bwahahahaha  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where do archived emails go&#63; Windows 10 Mail version 17.x</h2>
                    <p>Of all the things to wonder about in Windows Mail for Windows 10 is; where do the emails go that are archived?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I mean?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The setup:</p>
<p>* The account is connected to gmail.</p>
<p>* When I go to&nbsp;Mail and&nbsp;choose Gmail&nbsp;then right click an email and choose Archive it is removed from the Inbox; the list then moves about a bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This begs the question, where do the archived emails go? I went to Help, and that's not very helpful Microsoft. If I go to Hellp https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Mail-and-Calendar-for-Windows-10-FAQ-4ebe0864-260f-4d3a-a607-7b9899a98edc?ui=en-US&amp;rs=en-US&amp;ad=US
 is where I end up at. Not very helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a bit of googling, or maybe I was binging, I found the following - http://www.tenforums.com/browsers-email/47217-where-archive-mail-app.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if I understand correctly Archive really doesn't do anything for Gmail like it would for Microsoft's own services? Ugh! If that's the case then it is unacceptable. Archive needs to work the same for all systems that Mail chooses to connect with.</p>

            <p>Nope,&nbsp; no folder for Gmail that is labeled Archived. Strangely enough I can, in Gmail using Chrome, right click an email and it says Archive. Sooooo, I am going to click that and see what happens. Ah, here it is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I did that there was a notation that said the email had been archived, then it had a "Learn more" link that directs you to a page that explains what Archive does within Gmail.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6576?hl=en</p>
<p>
</p><p>It gets moved to a label called "All Mail." It will return to the Inbox on its own should somebody replay back to the email. It is still searchable and such as well. And, I found the "All Mail" on Windows 10 Mail; with a star even.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went in to Gmail and looked at Settings then Labels and saw that "All Mail" is checked to show in IMAP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So there's my answer. :) Next time I'll remember to click the "Learn More" link when I can't figure out why an email client is or isn't doing something that the web site might do naturally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Ugh! Hello Microsoft, I solved my own problem! Let me mark it as Solved My Problem.&nbsp; Seriously, I can't even mark my own thing with "Report abuse?" Wow. And by the way, I was very helpful in solving my own problem. Come on.</p>

<p>I appreciate the advice I received. But my problem is not resolved. I cannot access the Redeem code. First,I do not have an xbox. I purchaseed the Call of Duty season pass for my grandson for Christmas.. Could I log on to his xbox360 and receive the redeem
 code.. then he'll be able to have the season pass.? My son-in-law said that if I load the pass on my grandson's xbox using my logon, he will lose the games that he has already loaded. I know this is confusing, but I'm at my wit's end. I've tried Chatline with
 MS and was never connected. Thank you for your help.</p>

<p>There is no code. When you purchase content from Xbox it is tied to the account you purchase it with. So the season pass would be tied to your account. In order to purchase it for your grandson you would need to sign into his account and then make the purchase.
</p>
<p>You would need to try contacting support to see if they can refund the purchase so you can purchase it on his account.

            Hi Barb.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />No, Android is a different platform that won't run it's apps in Windows.  You'd have to install an Android emulator to run Android apps in Windows 10 - an example is Blue Stacks:  <a href="https://www.bluestacks.com/?utm_campaign=aw-ded-androidemulator-en-us-s-1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQjw4fHkBRDcARIsACV58_G5za-APbRUUZT1uc2LF2uflIqSvTQngpysNXeKPnP9gMHXKyQS3AoaAqHUEALw_wcB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.bluestacks.com/?utm_campaign=aw-ded...</a>
<br />
<br />Check the game or app's website to see if they have a Windows version.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            <p>I looked at the listing for the Windows Movie Maker "App" which is definitely listed as not being from Microsoft but instead from ShivaStudioz, so that should have been a red flag. The icon also shows it as a "guide" rather than the app. And the majority
 of the reviews call it a scam and give it a rating of 1 or 2 stars.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I understand it, the Windows Store does rely on people reporting bad apps, so you should at least do that and hopefully that will get it reviewed and possibly revoked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what the process is for getting a refund in a situation like this. The terms &amp; conditions mentions that purchases are final, but I wonder if there is some recourse in a situation like this.</p>

=================================<br />
Do you mean change the photos into line drawings?<br />
<br />
Some image editing programs have options for outlining photos.<br />
<br />
Here's something to experiment with.<br />
<br />
The freeware IrfanView may be worth a try.<br />
<br />
IrfanView <br />
<a href="http://www.software.com/irfanview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.software.com/irfanview</a><br />
(get the plug-ins too)<br />
<a href="http://www.software.com/irfanview-plugin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.software.com/irfanview-plugin</a><br />
<br />
After you download and install IrfanView...<br />
open a photo in IrfanView and go to...<br />
<br />
Image / Convert To Grayscale<br />
<br />
Image / Effects / Edge Detection<br />
<br />
Image / Negative<br />
<br />
Image / Auto Adjust Colors<br />
<br />
Now...go to...File / Save As...<br />
<br />
Choose a folder<br />
<br />
Enter a name<br />
<br />
Choose a format<br />
<br />
Save<br />
<br />
FWIW...if you go to...Image / Effects / Effects Browser...<br />
you'll find more options to experiment with.<br />
<br />
<br />

    <title>Cyclic redundancy error when saving playlist in WMP 12 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> runngdog213  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cyclic redundancy error when saving playlist in WMP 12</h2>
                    For the past 2 days, I have been unable to rip CDs or save playlists in WMP 12 on Windows 7.&nbsp; Up to that time, I had ripped many CDs and created many playlists over the past year or so without any problems.<br />
<br />
When I try to save a new playlist, I get the message "Windows Media Player encountered a problem while creating or saving the playlist." &nbsp; However, if I then try to close WMP or but a CD in the burner, I get a question as to whether I want to save myunsaved
 playlist.&nbsp; If I say yes, my playlist folder opens in a Save As window, but when I put in a file name and hit save, I get (after 5-10 seconds delay) an error message "Data Error (cyclic redundancy check)."<br />
<br />
Anybody have a clue what this is about?<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Problems seem to be getting worse and worse.&nbsp; In addition to not being able to rip CDs or make/save playlists, the following new symptoms have emerged in the past couple of days:<br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>In the Organize/Options/Rip Music tab in WMP, there is no file at all showing in "Rip music to this location" and if I click on "Change," nothing at all happens.</li><li>In that same tab, the format for ripping has changed from MP3 to WMA and if I try to switch back, I get an error message "The settings for ripping music cannot be applied."</li><li>When I click on Organize/Manage Libraries, nothing happens.&nbsp; This is the case for all the 4 libraries shown under "Manage Libraries."</li></ol>
At this point, I've tried pretty much everything anyone has suggested.&nbsp; I've turned WMP off and on in the "Turn Windows Features Off and On" (with restarts in between).&nbsp; I've deleted files from the Media Player folder to rebuild those, and I've deleted the
 entire Media Player folder to rebuild that.&nbsp; I've don the scannow/sfc and detected no problems.&nbsp; I've run both the WMP Settings and WMP Library troubleshooters multiple times.<br />
<br />
I have not yet tried the specific uninstall/reinstall routine outlined above -- is this any different than just the switching on and off from "Turn Windows Features"?<br />
<br />
One additional point worth mentioning.&nbsp; I created a new user profile in Windows and was able to run WMP fine from there, ripping CDs to the default folder (on my C internal drive rather than the external drive where my main library is stored).<br />
