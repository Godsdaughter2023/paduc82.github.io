<h2>            Storage Space Warning</h2>
                    <p>I have a message relating to my Two-way mirror 6.00 &nbsp;TB using 2 GB pool capacity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The warning message reads "Reduced resiliency; check the physical drives section.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I fix the problem and do i need Two-way mirror; if not how do I remove it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have an external physical drive (WD My Passport) that has a warning; Retired add a drive then remove this drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What does this mean and how do I fix it?</p>
<p>

    <title>After Free install of Windows 10, Internet connection no longer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sebastian molin  say:</h3>
<h2>            After Free install of Windows 10, Internet connection no longer works&#33; PLEASE HELP&#33;&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Today July 29th at 10:00 Am Eastern Time, I installed my reservation free copy of Windows 10, on my Windows 7 Ultimate PC. After the upgrade, for some reason It only has limited connection (but nothing internet related works) via Ethernet cable. I ran troubleshoot
 to see what the problem is and to see if I could fix it. The troubleshoot gives me the error message:&nbsp;</p>
<p>"There might be a problem with the driver for the Local Area Connection adapter."....</p>
<p>But even after trying to fix these problems as administrator, the problem was not fixed.</p>
<p>I looked online for some fixes, and some said that the firewall might not let it go through. It was working perfectly fine before the update today and I am sure it is not my internet because all my laptops and another windows Vista PC is running just fine.&nbsp;<br />
I have uploaded a video via YouTube so that anyone who want's to *see the problem* can,</p>
<p>Thank you so much, and I really need this problem fixed.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>the only thing that worked for me was uninstalling all my antivirus's and VPN(HMA). It may only be the VPN thats the problem so try that first. I guess the version i have is not compatible with windows 10</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I had upgraded from Win8.1 to Win10.</p>
<p>I had a similar problem with Win10 and Edge not working, yet IE working fine. Also all the Win10 apps were not able to connect at all!</p>
<p>I had also tried many attempts to reset the TCP/IP and all without luck.</p>
<p>Finally I realised that I wasn't able to Flush my DNS and discovered that the cause was that I had disabled my DNS Client (under services.msc) to tweak some settings in Win8.1. After enabling it everything worked perfectly fine again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>Best regards, Visti Larsen</p>

            <p>EVERYONE! The problem was that I had AVG taking over and blocking my Network Driver connection! Although I have went back to windows 7 (in which for some reason my product key was deleted... but had that fixed easily as well) and now I'm back and running
 windows 10 on the pc!</p>
<p>If only Microsoft would improve Windows Defender, people wouldn't need to get third party Internet Security programs, anyway the problem was fixed so the solution was simple. Uncheck the boxes that say AVG or any other third party internet security program
 from the Internet Driver... :)</p>

<h2>            Complaint about Microsoft Technical Support &#40;Level 1, Level 2 &#38; Level 3&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Some months ago my PC started failing updates, and shutting down.&nbsp; At first I wasn't really bothered, but then the shut downs got more and more frequent.&nbsp; I contacted MS Tech Support live chat.&nbsp; I was advised by the very first tech support agent that I spoke
 to, and did remote access to my PC, that my motherboard was not compatible with the new build of Windows 10 (1709).&nbsp; I accepted that, and advised that as a disabled person I wasn't in a position to purchase a new motherboard just like that.&nbsp; The tech support
 agent fiddled with something in my setting and said that that would solve the issue.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the weeks went by the shut downs started yet again, then got worse and worse, happening more and more frequent.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then contacted MS Tech Support live chat yet again, who then had remote access to my PC, and I was advised that the issue would be stopped and not to worry.&nbsp; Whatever was done was completely different to the first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This matter has gone on and on, with many instances of contact with L1, L2 and even L3 MS Tech Support, through live chat and on the telephone..&nbsp; Some 12 agents have now had remote access to my PC and STILL not one of them had managed to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to log a complaint and was advised by yet another MS Tech Support agent, "definitely don't worry I have taken down the concerns for you", and to this day I am still waiting for someone to contact me in regards to the complaint, that clearly wasn't
 logged, even after trying to log one 3 times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I even contacted MS via Facebook, and am still actually waiting for someone to read and bother to respond to some messages, some have been read and not responded to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I had rise to contact MS Tech Support live chat yet again as my PC would shut down every time I stopped using it, for the shortest period of time.&nbsp; In fact it shut down 18 times since Monday early hours (01.35).&nbsp; I was concerned with effect these shutdown
 would be having on my Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An MS Tech Support agent, yet again had remote access to my PC.&nbsp; He assured me that he would be able to solve this problem.&nbsp; He assured me that my motherboard was just fine and would not be an issue.&nbsp; I was very apprehensive.&nbsp; He then continued to download
 the .iso file for Windows 10 (1703) as this was the next update that my PC needed to continue to the new 1709 build.&nbsp; I was happy that he was doing this and I accepted that he knew what he was doing, as how could an MS Tech Support agent not know how to do
 this.&nbsp; I was so so wrong.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As on this moment, 00.42 in the morning, I am sat here on a pc that is basically new.&nbsp; The agent I trusted would atleast know how to do a simply Windows update got it very wrong, and wiped out all my files, folders, settings, and program files.&nbsp; I know it
 should have been backed up and I thought I was safe as the agent assured me that there would not be a problem as this is just a simply Windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called MS Tech Support telephone number some 4 times, and was continually cut off.&nbsp; I then contacted MS Tech Support chat yet again and a nice guy assisted me as much as he could to find where the disappeared folders etc had gone, he couldn't assist me
 as he was confused as to what the previous agent had actually done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now waiting for a call from the agent that ruined my PC to see if he can actual resolve this issue, which I am holding no hope out for as I have lost what very little faith I had in Microsoft.&nbsp; They have completely ruined my experience of using Windows.

Reference: https://www.howtogeek.com/245445/how-to-use-slmgr-to-change-remove-or-extend-your-windows-license/</p>
<p>
</p><p>Slmgr also allows you to perform an offline activation. To get an installation ID for offline activation, run the following command:</p>
<p>slmgr.vbs /dti</p>
<p>
</p><p>You’ll now need to get a a confirmation ID you can use to activate the system over the phone. Call the Microsoft Product Activation Center, provide the installation ID you received above, and you’ll be given an activation ID if everything checks out. This
 allows you to activate Windows systems without Internet connections.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To enter the confirmation ID you’ve received for offline activation, run the following command. Replace “ACTIVATIONID” with the activation ID you’ve received.</p>
<p>slmgr.vbs /atp ACTIVATIONID</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you’re done, you can use the slmgr.vbs /dli or slmgr.vbs /dlv commands to confirm you’re activated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This can generally be done from the Activation screen in the Settings app if your PC isn’t activated–you don’t have to use the command if you’d rather use the graphical interface.</p>

                    <p>I having a major issue since installing the recent Fall Creators Update and Intel 620 Graphics driver update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Config is&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Surface Pro 2017 i5/256GB</li><li>Surface Dock&nbsp;</li><li>2 x 4K monitors connected to dock via display port</li><li>Windows 10 Pro 1709&nbsp;</li><li>Intel HD Graphics 620 Driver&nbsp;22.20.16.4749&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Worked perfectly fine up until yesterday but now when I plug in the dock all screens go black and system is completely unresponsive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Disconnecting dock does not work</li><li>Win-Ctrl-Shift-B does not work</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Only way to get the system working again is a a hard restart - (power button pressed for 10 -15 seconds).</p>

                    <p>HI,</p>
<p>I need to install the driver of my HL-5070N printer on my new Windows 10 computer but the driver is not in the list at Windows Update (I took a picture) but the people at Brother can see it in their lists (sent me a picture). I am in Luxembourg, they are
 in Belgium, not the same country but I don't think that could be the reason (it is an European model). Can anyone send me that f....&nbsp; driver, please?</p>

<h2>            XBox one controller stopped working in games</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Up until recently my XBox One controller was working fine. Last time I player for about 30 minutes with it in Destiny 2, I think it was around a month ago or so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I wanted to play a games entirely on XBox One, and had plans with my wife for it, and was very disappointed when XBox One controlled did not work. I started to dig the issue and read forums. I already spent over 2 hours trying to solve this. Here are
 some details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Symptoms:</p>
<ul>
<li>I connect XBox One controller with a USB cable</li><li>After connecting it takes it 2-5 seconds to initialize. After that it works for 1 second, and then it stops working.</li><li>It always works in calibration program ("Set up USB game controllers")</li><li>Once it opened Game bar and worked there, but not in the game</li><li>In Little Nightmares if I click the XBox button (main one) the game screen slightly flashes brighter, but game won't switch to controller mode and no other buttons work</li><li>XBox Accessories app only recognizes it after I reboot my PC. The rest of the time it tell me that I need to connect the controller.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Steps tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>I tried about 5 different micro USB cables</li><li>I checked drivers in Device manager - they are up to date</li><li>I checked firmware verison XBox Accesories app tell me it is up to date</li><li>I tried it with other games, lik Ark, Destiny</li><li>I tried killing some overlay services, after killing Game bar&nbsp;it worked for a few seconds but then stopped working again</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please, help me. This issue totally ruined my evening.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm oldschool, but I'm used to such things like GAMEPADS - WORKING 24\7.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>Thank you for your response. The standard Xbox One Wireless controller has a built-in Bluetooth technology that will allow you to connect your Xbox One controller to the PC via a Bluetooth connection.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the controller is working on Xbox One, that means there is an issue with the drivers or the updates installed on your PC. To resolve your concern, we suggest that you manually uninstall the drivers from the Device manager and update it again. Here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Open the&nbsp;<strong>Device Manager.</strong></span></li><li><span>Right-click (or tap and hold) the name of the device.</span></li><li><span>Select&nbsp;<strong>Uninstall</strong>. </span></li><li><span>Unplug the USB cable for the controller and restart your PC.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue persists, resetting the Windows Update components will help resolve your concern since it started after an update. You may refer to
</span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/971058/how-do-i-reset-windows-update-components" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How do I reset Windows Update components?</a><span> for the steps.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Should you need further assistance, you can contact us anytime.</span><br />

    <title>keyboard stops working when using mouse at the same time playing games - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            keyboard stops working when using mouse at the same time playing games</h2>
                    Hi there!
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have the wireless laser 3000 desktop set - and when playing games (Minecraft, and just now discovered it does it in Dungeon Defenders also) I use the W" key as forward, and my right mouse button to change my view as I move. &nbsp;But in both games, if I am
 running along, changing the view as I go, all of a sudden I stop moving forward - it's as if using both at the same time interferes with each other or something =/</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This is a brand new (less than 1 hour) old desktop set, with fresh batteries and it's happening - but I also had the set before, and have just replaced it, and it happened with that one too</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyone have any idea what could be causing it? &nbsp;I'm on windows 7 64-bit - but it also happened when I had 32-bit - everything is updated to latest. &nbsp;I'm totally stumped as to what could be causing this - would really appreciate any help!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>*edits* Should add, I just tried to download IPx64_1033_8.20.468.0.exe and ITPx64_1033_8.20.469.0.exe which was the software Microsoft had on the website to download, but when I tried to run them, got told I had newer versions on my PC</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>*edits again* I can use any other mouse, and it doesn't happen - or any other keyboard with the sets mouse, and it doesn't happen - it's just when I use those two together - so am wondering if it's something to do with the wireless desktop receiver thing?</div>
                </div>

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>This could be due to some common issues between the transceiver and the keyboard/mouse devices. This could also happen if there is any third party software conflicting with the keyboard device. I would like to ask some questions

            Hi Rajesh - thanks for getting back to me! =)<br />
<br />
I did all the trouble shooting, and nothing changed, also did the clean boot, and the problem still happened in game when I did that.
<div><br />
<div>I don't have any third party keyboard driver software installed that I know of - I checked through installed programs etc just to be sure</div>
<div><br />
<div>As far as I know this only happens in games - but I honestly can't think of a way to test it in any other program - I opened up a blank text document and held the "W" key down while waggling the mouse all around the screen and that didn't seem to stop
 the "W" from typing - just made me laugh at myself ;)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Originally (when I posted this question) the keyboard/mouse that was installed was automatic from windows when I plugged them in - it installed a Mouse &amp; Keyboard center. &nbsp;But I noticed that the "intellitype" drivers/program wasn't installed that way,
 so I uninstalled it, then re downloaded the latest IntelliType Pro and IntelliPoint from Microsoft and installed them.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, in one of the games - Dungeon Defenders - I actually have to hold the right mouse button down, and move the mouse to change where the "camera" is in game - in Minecraft I just have to move the mouse, without holding down any buttons - and it happens
 in both games. &nbsp;There's no set time that it takes to happen - sometimes it will go for 15 seconds or so before it stops me moving - other times my character will move just one step and stop.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Very frustrating when you are running a time sensitive mission! &nbsp;Which is why I am very glad I had another mouse here ;)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks again for your help! &nbsp;Fingers crossed something else you can suggest might work!</div>
<div><br />
<div>*edits* while I was doing the trouble shooting this morning, I also changed the wireless receiver as I had kept the old one plugged in 'cos I was too lazy to change them when I got the new keyboard &amp; mouse - but that hasn't fixed it either =)<br />
<br />
Also felt it worth mentioning, &nbsp;I have been having this trouble for many months now - on my old PC as well as this new one (old PC had win 7 32, this one has win 7 64)</div>

<p>Hi Teeshy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I really apologize for the delay in responding to this thread.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since, you have tried almost all the troubleshooting steps (given in the above
<b><i><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hardware/en-us/help/support/troubleshooting/keyboard/wireless-bluetooth" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></i></b>) for the common issues that can occur with the transceiver and the keyboard/mouse devices; this could be a hardware
 issue with the mouse or the keyboard. Thus, I would suggest you to get in touch with the Microsoft Hardware Support and check with them from this link:</p>

            Thanks for getting back to me Rajesh =)<br />
<br />
I have already contacted hardware support (I think!) I went to that link before I ever started this thread, and phoned the number for Australia, and the lady I spoke to on the phone also told me I needed to contact hardware support (even though the number I
 rang was the one listed on that page) she then sent me an email with some links (quoted here)<br />
<br />
"Thank you for contacting Microsoft Customer Service.

That's how I ended up here, I tried all their troubleshooting, and then went to answers.microsoft.com&nbsp; (here) and posted this thread =)<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if the phone number on the microsoft site is wrong, but she didn't seem to be hardware support either.<br />
<br />
I'll try the number again today, and see if I can get somewhere helpful!&nbsp; Thanks again for trying =)<br />

<p>
</p><p>It looks like there were a few permissions problems found doing that.&nbsp; Did you do it elevated (as an Administrator)?&nbsp; Also, some of those should have been fixed by Kapil's suggestion, so make sure that you do it elevated too and look for any error messages
 about the two problem applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm wondering if there has been a syntax change though.&nbsp; For example, picking the command line apart I found that only&nbsp;this was suggested (e.g. via Tab completion)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>PS&gt;Get-AppxPackage -All *shellexperience* -PackageTypeFilter Bundle</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing was output?&nbsp; But without the second filter term there was one object output.&nbsp;&nbsp;The same thing happens with&nbsp; -All *cortana*&nbsp;&nbsp; In fact, the only filter term that worked for either one (as discovered using Tab completion) was Main.&nbsp; When I listed each
 without adding the filter term both outputs showed&nbsp; IsBundle False (which makes sense for the nothing being output with that filter).&nbsp; So since only one thing is found in each case even without the filter I doubt that you need it in order to have something
 for the second stage of the pipeline to work with; so I would try either changing the second term to
<strong>-PackageTypeFilter Main</strong> or omit it entirely (and then see if the second stage did what was expected, for each package.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that this is speculation on my part and I hope that Kapil will comment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>HTH</p>

            I believe i did it as administrator, which is what i usually do, but after trying for days, wouldn't swear to anything. Thank you for taking the time and interest in trying to resolve this . for the past 12 hours i cannot even get to the sign in page just
 the one asking if you like what you see.&nbsp; I have been trying right and left clicking at various places on the page. tried esc. the date showing is correct time is wrong.&nbsp; will save this in case i can get back in

<p>
</p><p>Try pressing Alt-Tab.&nbsp; That symptom can mean that you have an accessibility tool running as the task which has focus and it may be off-screen.&nbsp; Then pressing Alt-Tab would show you two tasks and allow you to switch to the one which would represent the Login
 screen.&nbsp; Also, to be clear that you are at the Login screen anyway, look at the bottom right.&nbsp; You should see both the Power options menu's button and the Accessibility menu's button.&nbsp; Then you would be able to use both menus' options.&nbsp; Unfortunately we cannot
 undo choices made via the Accessibility menu but we can add to the list of running tasks that way.&nbsp; Another possibility that I am aware of but having never seen is using the Hello! feature which I guess would suppress the Login input fields as being superfluous.&nbsp;
 For that case I would press Ctrl-Alt-Delete and see what that gives.</p>

</p><p>If nothing else, I would try doing a Restart via the Power button menu.&nbsp; But you could also try doing a Shift-Restart there and see what you can do via the Advanced Boot Options dialog.&nbsp; Unfortunately I think that PowerShell is not available by default in
 a Command Only boot; otherwise presumably you would be able to do some PowerShell based repairs there too.</p>

<p>Hi there,<br />
<br />
Are you able to see your friends on your friends list when you access it here on Xbox.com? If so, I'd recommend re-<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-CA/my-account/manage-gamertag-and-profile/profile-move-delete" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">downloading your profile</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If so, go ahead and follow Mad Cow Dizease's advice of re-downloading the profile. :-)</p>

<p>I am in need of help. Can I be messaged by a moderator? Basically during this error, I deleted my profile thinking it was glitched(I did not know servers were acting up) I re-downloaded my profile, and everything was normal... However my gamertag was changed
 back to a generic name. I paid to have a changed gamertag(<b>[Mod Removed]</b>) However, my Gamertag is now 'SlickJoey917853' ... This is on Xbox 360. Can I please get some help? I'm not really happy about this</p>

<p>Please read, this might help you...</p>
<p>It's all good, it's just a glitch in the system, so just wait until tomorrow and double check your system. Xbox.com is still trying to fix this issue, and you can check the updates by reading the services alert on this following web page:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../xbox-live-status</a></p>
<p>Just hope that the system will be fixed for tomorrow, but if not, you can continue to play your games, but you might need assistance from your friends via skype/phone (or whatever kind of calling system you use to contact your local friend) to notify who
 on your friend's list is online or offline. </p>
<p>Hope this helped. :D</p>

            update to original post. Tried to do a clean boot to see if any conflicts from other software were the cause but still couldn't open QB Pro 2011. I then reverted to an earlier version of Windows 10 (before the 9/22 upgrade # 1607) and all is fine. Can
 open QB Pro again. Something in the Microsoft upgrade didn't like QB. Hope I don't run into any issues when Microsoft decides to upgrade again<br />

            I had the same issue. Called Intuit and they told me that it is possible that it will not work with new version of window 10 because they already stop the updates for the sunset version. Sigh*. So my option is to upgrade to 2015 or 2016 where are rolling
 updates if the OS has updates.

<h2>            thumbcache files size limited to 1024 KB and No thumbnails in windows explorer</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Since a few weeks, windows explorer is not showing any thumbnails for image files.</p>
<p>First the things I tried :</p>
<p>- In explorer : file -&gt; folder options -&gt; view -&gt; "Always show icons, never thumbnails" is un checked</p>
<p>- Tried to run&nbsp;sfc /scannow which found no violations.</p>
<p>- Tried to delete thumbcache files with disk cleanup without success</p>
<p>- Tried to delete thumbcache files manually by going to&nbsp;C:\Users\Jean-Philippe\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\Explorer : I had to run explorer or cmd file as administrator to delete otherwise I got a permission error.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I deleted the files I noticed all files where recreated to 1024 KB file size. Seems very weird to me.<br />
</p>
<p>Below the&nbsp; screen shot showing thumbcache files limited to 1024. You can also notice that the left pane is empty. This is another problem (maybe they related) which is the same as&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-files-winpc/windows-10-file-explorer-very-slow-working-on-it/1710ec88-a944-4fae-9444-1302a483e1a2" title="explorer">this
 one</a>&nbsp;although the fixes suggestion did not work either.</p>

<p>Well, it looks like stopping the "windows search" service brought back the thumbnails and now the thumbcache file size looks correct.</p>
<p>Still a problem with "windows search" service.</p>
<p>If I start again de the service and then go to : control panel &gt;indexing options , I get stuck with a message : "waiting to receive indexing status" and the "working on it..." message on an empty explorer window is back again.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's identify the root cause of the issue. Have you made any modifications prior to the issue? Also, is the option "<strong>Show thumbnails instead of icons</strong>" checked?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update us. Will be waiting.</p>

<p>Yes Show thumbnails instead of icons is checked in system performance settings.</p>
<p>I don't really remember when the issue started so can't tell what modifications I might have done... But all I know, is now I stopped the "windows search" service, the thumbnails are back. if I start it again, the generated ones stays there but no new ones
 are generated. and of course if I delete the thumbache files, they are all gone (until I stop the search service again)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing. When the issue is happening. The view -&gt; layout pane is grayed. I can't change anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once i stop the service, after around 1 minute, everything goes back to normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is two screenshots illustrating the differences. First with the service stopped, second with the service started. That's the only action I did between both</p>

<p>This is not a problem! Just navigate your way to your download history on your Xbox or check out your purchase history on the Xbox.com site and you will see it there. Then you can download it again.
</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Just click on your account at the top right and on the next page at the bottom (second in from the left) is your Marketplace History. Hope this helps! :-)</p>

</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Did you get your Skype Number together with a bundled calling subscription?

            To further assist you regarding your concern, since you’ve done changing the appearance of your display from the
<strong>Control Panel,</strong> we suggest that you connect the monitor of your choice to the default port on your PC. This will be the simplest way to use the specific monitor as your default screen.<br />

            If you already selected a default monitor on the <strong>Display settings</strong> from the
<strong>Control Panel</strong>, when you use a single monitor, the default port will be your default screen. If you want to select a different monitor, you may first change the
<strong>Display settings </strong>and choose another default screen. <br />

<p>Hi Luca,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've seen the video that you've uploaded and based on the information you've provided, we've tried to recreate your concern regarding the monitor issue and we've encountered the same problem. Selecting the
<strong>PC screen only</strong> option won't allow you to select the second monitor as the default. However, if you choose the
<strong>Second screen only</strong>, this will allow you to use your other monitor as the default screen.</p>

    <title>When will we be getting a way to limit the download speed the Xbox One - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            When will we be getting a way to limit the download speed the Xbox One uses&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>With many programs out there one can limit the speed at which a pc, tablet, etc. download and so can we please get this ability on the Xbox One?!?!?. &nbsp;Right now my experience with the Xbox One hasn't been close to as good as my experience with the Xbox 360.
 &nbsp;I had to shut off my wireless connection on the router so with that done I can't wireless connect to my PS3, Wii U or one of the Xbox 360s in my home. &nbsp;Also when not using the Xbox One for some reason at times with the console set to NOT download updates
 on it's own it still uses bandwidth for other things. &nbsp;I don't have Kinect and yet it still seems the Xbox One must be running on low power on it's own collecting information and who knows what and robs me of bandwidth I need to surf and do other things in
 my home. &nbsp;I thought there was supposed to be a way to turn off all the spy features but I guess not. Anyway while I enjoyed some gaming on it playing the new Tomb Raider demo, Star Wars Battlefront and NHL 16 if things don't get better with this system I am
 going to have to sell it. &nbsp;I should be able to dictate how much bandwidth the console uses or I should be able to trust Microsoft to not rob me of bandwidth when I don't want the console doing anything. &nbsp;By the way I just got an error regarding just trying
 to send message to people on my friends list too. &nbsp;All the little annoyances and big annoyances add up and again it has me wanting to get rid of a console I wanted to give a chance. &nbsp;Now I have a DIR-615 router and so if you can tell me how I might be able
 to limit the bandwidth the Xbox One gets when idle that would be great but I doubt that is the solution that will work best. &nbsp;What should be happening is there should be a way to set download speeds for the console and Microsoft you should not be sneakily
 running the console in some low power mode when I have supposedly shut the thing off. &nbsp;Seriously what the heck?</p>

<p>xbox one is constantly updating your friends and feeds and so on , but it should not be doing it in energy-saving mode , it should be ALL the way off , that's why it takes so long to boot up in that mode...maybe yours isn't in that mode or it isn't working
 properly...</p>
<p>Energy-saving power mode</p>
<p>In energy-saving power mode, your console is shut down to save energy. In this mode:</p>
<p>•Updates are not downloaded and installed until your console is turned on.</p>
<p>•Your console takes 45 seconds to start up.</p>
<p>•You must press the Xbox button to start the console.</p>
<p>Notes</p>
<p>•In energy-saving mode, the PSU is in off/standby mode and the solid orange LED on the PSU is bright.</p>
<p>•The console uses 0.5 watts of power when in energy-saving mode.</p>
<p>so if the psu is off , I don't see how it could use the internet...</p>
