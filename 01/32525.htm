<h2>            Thumbnails not showing image in Photos</h2>
                    I am new to Windows 10 and I'm not sure what I've done, but all of the thumbnails for all my photos look like the Photos icon. The one that has a blue background and looks like a couple little mountains. How do I get then to show the photo image again?&nbsp;

            Hi Amanda
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer 
<br />
<br />Open a folder of Photos 
<br />
<br />On the View Ribbon (tab) choose small, medium, or large icons in the Layout Section 
<br />
<br />Then at the end of the View Ribbon (tab) click 'Options' 
<br />
<br />On that Dialog, click on the View Tab 
<br />
<br />Uncheck the box marked 'Always show icons, never show thumbnails' 
<br />
<br />At the top of that tab, click 'Apply to folders' and confirm 
<br />
<br />Then click Apply and OK 
<br />
<br />That's It!

            Hi Amanda
<br />
<br />Can you check if those files are actually on your PC or on OneDrive - what is the exact location of those files you are looking at?
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type winver and hit Enter
<br />
<br />On the resulting dialog, what version of Windows 10 are you running?

<h2>            What is infection and how do I avoid being infected&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I just read the policy-change about infection and went Googling to find out more about it. I'm worried now,&nbsp;since I do not want to get banned. I haven't really been able to work out what&nbsp;infection is exactly and how you get infected. The first step seems
 to be an invite to a lobby. But how do I recognise an infected lobby? Can I get banned just for being in such a lobby? In other words: can I still safely accept game-invites?</p>

<p>First thing to do is not accept invites to any matches, unless they are from people you know and trust.<br />
<br />
If you find yourself in a game and anything is happening or on screen that you know should not be then leave immediately.<br />
<em>(But you need to dashboard from the game).<br />
<br />
</em>To do this press the xbox guide button and select dashboard, never leave a modded game in the usual way you leave a lobby. This applies to any modded games at all.<br />
<br />
As far as punishment goes, I think it applies to people who are knowingly joining these games and spreading this 'infection' as its called. I do not believe you would be punished for accidentally joining a lobby like this, but you do need to leave it immediately.<br />
<br />
This is by no means an official answer, I am just a gamer and forum member. If you want an official response you could try sending a PM to a member of the XBLPET or possibly a forum moderator. Moderators do not really deal with Live but they may have some information
 about this problem.<br />
<br />
The only sure fire way of avoiding modded lobbies is to not play the games they are rife in, mainly CoD WaW &amp; MW2. But I have also&nbsp;seen a lot of posts from people saying&nbsp;there is modding going on in CoD 4, but to a lesser extent than the other 2 titles.</p>

<p>If you want to be safe from receiving infections then the # 1 piece of advice I can offer you is don't join any private matches from random invites. &nbsp;Even if it is your friend you have known for a while still be cautious. &nbsp;A infected lobby in the pregame
 has a checkerboard design in the place of the map you should be playing. &nbsp;You can be banned for playing with infections so even if they might seem fun and cool (which they definitely are not) DON'T. &nbsp;You will know if you have infections because your on-screen
 hud will not look right, you have to physically turn on the infections through following on screen directions to turn them on and off. &nbsp;If you somehow find someone telling you to "backout and then go play split-screen" then #1: Don't follow their instructions
 because that activates infections, #2 Dashboard or turn off your console immediately to clear the infections from your console. &nbsp; &nbsp;
</p>
<p>You can NOT receive infections through playing a legit ranked online match, they are received only through private matches. &nbsp;If you have to match make to find the game then you should be fine.</p>
<p>Just be cautious if you join a private match, if something seems fishy (ie. No-clip, Godmode, Superspeed) just do the online multi-player a favor and dashboard and reboot the game and play the game it is meant to be played. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>GreyPilgrim is correct. &nbsp;Just to add one extra piece of information though. &nbsp;I have read through some of the suspension posts and if you join a lobby that is infected and then go into another lobby (with infections attached) you will be banned.</p>
<p>What you need to do is as soon as you see that you are in an infected lobby immediately back out and restart your console. &nbsp;Only by restarting the console will you turn off any infection (cheat) that has been attached to your profile. &nbsp;This will prevent you from carrying them through to any other MP Lobby.</p>

<p>Hey boyscoutdan1234. &nbsp;i hope you are having a great weekend.</p>
<p>As said in the posts above you, if you do however get into a hacked game and you don't want risk being banned, you can always dashboard. &nbsp;If you dashboard you will remove the infections from the game. &nbsp;If you still have the message, file a complaint on him/her
 and block communications. &nbsp;If you do those two simple things, you will be a trusted loyal user on XBox Live.</p>

            <p>@boyscoutdan - if you've joined a hacked lobby, odds are that you're infected as well. &nbsp;You could certainly try the dashboard idea to get the infection off your account. &nbsp;However, I would recommend shutting down and restarting as that will get rid of the infection.</p>
<p>And definitely report the tags that were in the lobby.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Installation Debacle - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> shcalifornia  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Installation Debacle</h2>
                    <p>Microsoft installed Win10 on my wife's computer through automatic update. Although the computer was mostly usable for short periods of time, BSOD and reboot follow frequently starting with day one of the installation. After 4 chat sessions lasting a couple
 hours each without resolution, I was given a phone number. The tech knew immediately that the computer was not compatible with Win10 - a Dell Vostro 460 x64 i7&nbsp;purchased in November 2011.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. The automatic installation is shear nonsense.</p>
<p>2. How can MS do the installation without checking that the computer is compatible? Bad Word.</p>
<p>3. How can MS partner with Dell who is not supporting its customers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been a customer of MS since the very early 1980's and cannot ever remember an OS transition problem with a brand name computer so new, let alone being forced into the installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This bears some discussion and correction by MS and the community should know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>then change your update settings to never check for updates</p>
<p>and forget that microsoft even exist</p>
<p>because everything microsoft is doing right now&nbsp;</p>
<p>is send windows 10 crapware on your windows 7 in order to make you upgrade to windows 10</p>
<p>and microsoft doesn't care really what you want..!!</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>if you worry about your computer security</p>
<p>just get a third party antivirus </p>
<p>and run at least once a week the free version of Anti-Malware from&nbsp;Malwarebytes</p>
<p>that is what the windows XP users are being doing since microsoft drop the support for windows XP.</p>
<p>and Windows XP is solid and secure like a ROCK..!!</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>then you have plenty of time to consider </p>
<p>and try out all possible alternatives against windows from microsoft.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>PS</p>
<p>I just buy a $270 dollars PC tablet with android OS</p>
<p>and is 1'000 000 better of windows 10&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn't encounter any issues of any kind yet</p>
<p>I don't know how much is private yet&nbsp;</p>
<p>but has long I stay away from windows 10</p>
<p>I'm happy with that..!!!</p>
<p>now I'm exploring a Mac for Gaming&nbsp;</p>
<p>and maybe in 2020 when microsoft drop windows 7 support</p>
<p>I drop them F.O.R.E.V.E.R....!!</p>
<p>just say that i feel a big relief ..!!!</p>
<p>so I guess is exactly what I'm going to do&nbsp;</p>
<p>maybe I don't even wait until 2020...!!</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Jesus Christ</p>
<p>microsoft really fck things up this time...!!</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>PS N2</p>
<p>if you think that microsoft is going to change their own policy about windows 10 by any means</p>
<p>I'm soo deeply sorry </p>
<p>if I'm the one who have to tell you this</p>
<p>but you're a delusional</p>
<p>because microsoft do really believe that windows 10 is best OS that microsoft ever produce</p>
<p>and I saw former microsoft employees laugh about that &nbsp;for at least an half hour.!!</p>
<p>for the record that kind of laugh that leave you without tears anymore..!!</p>

            <p>Well, yes,&nbsp;our solution was to return to Windows 7, which Microsoft "allows" you to do for 30 days after the installation of Win10. We were then able, using the GWX Control Panel, to supposedly disinstall the Win10 files and block Win10 from installing itself
 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft&nbsp;went from an OS company to&nbsp;an "all things for all people" on PC's. They did a pretty good job since they didn't have the advantage of the lack of diversity that a company like Apple had. But I think perhaps the complications of doing that for now
 "all platforms" is just too complicated and complex. Time to return to market segmentation with cooperative interface standards. But what do I know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell went from a company you can trust for upgradable standards to a company that tells me "we can't control the suppliers of the parts of our computer to provide new drivers". Well then, what is a Dell - a bunch of parts? What's changed? Dell on the way
 down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be keeping Win7 on both machines as long as possible. Then it will certainly not be Dell and a good chance not Microsoft then either.</p>

<h2>            Halo 4 Weekly Campaign Challenges Not Responding&#47;Completing</h2>
                    
<p>Hey all,</p>

<p>I just completed Reclaimer on Legendary with both Thunderstruck and Mythic skulls on (along with the dialogue, grunt birthday and explosions skulls) to kill two birds with one stone for this week's challenges. However, at the end of the mission, I see "Completed
 Reclaimer on Legendary" for 0 points, and the challenges are not complete on the challenges section! Was there something I did wrong, or can I contact Microsoft at all to get those achievements worked out (it was a lot of work to complete that mission with
 those skulls on!)?</p>

<p>i have noticed issues with the game not recognizing that you are online. this happened to me when completing the game on legendary. all achievements unlocked, but it still said i had not completed the final mission.</p>
<p>you can tell if you are not on the halo servers when your sr rank shows as sr1.</p>
<p>this may require you to reload the game or reboot your 360.</p>

            <p>In general it's recommended&nbsp; to use Malwarebytes Anti-Malware only as an on-demand scanner alongside your Anti-Virus program to avoid possible conflicts.</p>
<p>But, I've read also many reports of users saying that they do not experience any conflicts when the real-time protecion feature of Malwarebytes Anti-Malware Premium is enabled.</p>
<p>Perhaps you can just experiment a bit and might have to set some exclusions. Here is an older article:

<p><span><span>Hello mdf12,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thanks for using the Microsoft Answers Forum.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>There are a couple of options for troubleshooting of this problem. You might try doing an SFC scan to try and repair any damaged system files
 on your computer. I have included the instructions below for the SFC scan.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The System File Checker tool</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To determine whether the issue that you are experiencing is caused by one or more system files that are used by Windows
 Vista, run the System File Checker tool. The System File Checker tool scans system files and replaces incorrect versions of the system files by using the correct versions.
<br />
<br />
To run the System File Checker tool, follow these steps: </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Click
<span>Start</span> </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Collapse this imageExpand this image</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>, and then type
<span>cmd</span> in the <span>Start Search</span> box. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Right-click
<span>cmd</span> in the <span>Programs</span> list, and then click
<span>Run as administrator</span>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Collapse this imageExpand this image</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password or click
<span>Continue</span> </span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>At the command prompt, the following line, and then press ENTER:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>sfc /scannow</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>When the scan is complete, test to see whether the issue that you are experiencing is resolved. If the issue that you are experiencing is not
 resolved, use the procedure that is described in the "The System Restore tool" section.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Also, from looking at the specifics of the dump you posted it says that you are running Service Pack 1. You might consider installing Service
 Pack 2 to see if it helps resolve the issue as well. I have included a link below where you can find the service pack as a standalone file download if it is not working through Windows Update.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://download.microsoft.com</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Let us know if either of these options helps to resolve your issue.</span></span></p>

<p>A transferencia de licença serve apenas para o caso de você precisar trocar de console. Ela não deve ser usada para a troca de jogos com amigos. Isso fere as normas de conduta da Xbox Live e é passível de suspensão.</p>

<p>I have updated my xbox one and my digital games from the 360 that are on the compatible list do not appear under the 'Ready to Install' section as the FAQs say they will.&nbsp; The disc based games are installing just fine and I have logged into the 360 and launched
 the games while connected to xbox live to see if that will wake it up and still nothing.</p>
<p>Does anyone have a fix for this?</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried downloading the troubleshooting and that is where it tells me I have an issue with Service registration is missing or corrupt and not fixed.</p>
<p>I have also tried the SFC /Scannow, with Errors were found and could not be fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried the following DISM.exe</p>
<p>dism.exe /Online /LogPath:c:\dism.log /Cleanup-Image /Restorehealth<br />
Dism.exe&nbsp; /Online /LogPath:c:\dismScan.log /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth<br />
Dism.exe&nbsp; /Online /LogPath:c:\dismScan.log /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth</p>
<p>All ending with the same error "dism error 0x800f081f the source files could not be found"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont have an Install.WIM file, the only one I can see is an install.ESD.&nbsp; I have also tried the DISM with the following "DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /source:ESD:H:\Sources\Install.ESD:1 /LimitAccess"&nbsp; H being the mounted Windows 10 Iso.&nbsp;
 But fails with the same error, I can navigate to this location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then a few days ago I noticed when closing down the application holding the pc up from shutting down was in Chinese type writing.&nbsp; So I am starting to wonder if I have Malware or a virus.&nbsp; I have scanned with Malwarebytes, spybots sophos and Mcafee but found
 nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try the clean boot and let you know if anything shows up!</p>

            <p>Hi Guru Kiran</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the troubleshooting as above, didnt find anything? :(&nbsp; Next step is the cleanboot.&nbsp; I have checked the update logs and someupdates have started coming through again.&nbsp; But DISM and SFC still dont work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will let you know the outcome of the clean boot when completed.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">Oh and found the answer to the Chinese or Asian writing from an application stopping me from closing down or restarting.&nbsp; It is from a question raised "An application in chinese (?) prevent my computer from shutting
 down"&nbsp; Its a windows 8 question, but the same or at least simular message.&nbsp; Trusteer\IBM issue, maybe?</p>

<h2>            Reinstall Print to PDF Option &#47; Missing Print to PDF &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>When I first upgraded to the Windows 10, I enjoyed the new&nbsp;"Print to PDF" option under the list of printer options. However, for some strange reason it stopped working a couple of weeks ago.&nbsp;I tried going back to previous "Builds", systems restores before
 updates, etc., but&nbsp;nothing fix the issue. I notice that "Print to PDF" was listed as a device under the Devices: Printers &amp; Scanners within settings, similar to actually&nbsp;my Kodak Printer. So I thought I could just remove the "Print to PDF" device/printer/driver
 and reinstall it, similar to reinstalling my Kodak printer or a Kodak printer diver. However, I have been unsuccessful in locating a download or driver on Microsoft/Windows website for the "Print to PDF".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where can I find the Microsoft/Window 10&nbsp;"Print to PDF" DOWNLOAD or DRIVER to download/install to get back my "Print to PDF" as a printer function/printer option?</p>

<p>Hello Dennis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern in this regard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you able to see "Microsoft Print to PDF" option&nbsp;under <strong>Device and Printers</strong>?</p>
<p>Are you getting this option when you print other documents or from Web browser?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggest you to check this issue by printing other Documents to see if 'Microsoft Print to PDF' option appears. Also try printing on web browsers to check if it lists the 'Microsoft Print to PDF' correctly. I understand that Microsoft Print to PDF option
 is selected under <strong>Windows Features. </strong>However let us try clearing and selecting the option to see if it makes any difference.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Right-click on <strong>Start </strong>button&nbsp;and select <strong>Programs and Features</strong>.</li><li>In the Programs and Features window, click&nbsp;<strong>Turn Windows features on or off</strong></li><li>Under&nbsp;Windows Features dialog, uncheck <strong>Microsoft Print to PDF and click
</strong><strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Reboot your PC once. </li><li>Once you reach desktop screen, reopen the Windows Features dialog, and this time enable the
<strong>Microsoft Print to PDF </strong>checkbox, and click <strong>OK.</strong></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Now see if <strong>Microsoft Print to PDF </strong>option shows correctly.</p>

            Thank you, and yes this worked with one caveat; it does not show up in IE.&nbsp; From Outlook and Edge, the "Print to PDF" option is available. I honestly don't know if they've been there all along or just showed up after applying the suggested changes, as
 I've not used Edge much and rarely print from Outlook. I do know that it had been an option in Internet Explorer, as I've used it many, many times, and then it, mysteriously, wasn't there. The cynic in me says it's not-so-subtle persuasion to get me using
 Edge instead of IE. Or maybe it's just some overlooked glitch.

<h2>            preventing system sounds on a video call</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying to prevent Skype to share computer system sounds during a video call and can't seem to find a solution anywhere. Every computer sound gets broadcasted during a call, system sounds, music sounds, videos sounds, etc sounds. Is there any way to prevent
 it from happening? Or an option to share it or not like in the Windows version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Had an old Mac and the issue resolved by itself, then had to purchase a new Mac and after installing the new version of Skype it went back to sharing all sounds. Had the OS reinstalled and reinstalled Skye and that didn't make a difference either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm running macOS Hight Sierra 10.13.6 / Skype Ver 8.28.0.41</p>

            Hi LBS62, 
<br />
<br />My name is Douglas and I am an Independent Advisor. I would like to help you. Let's try first to download your flash file from website:
<br />
<br />
<br />"Open the video site in Firefox. Navigate to the Flash animation that you want to watch. Firefox is the easiest browser to use when downloading a Flash file directly from a website.
<br />This method will not work with YouTube, Vimeo, and other streaming sites. This is for Flash animations and games on sites such as Newgrounds. To download YouTube videos, use the Method 4. If you right-click on the movie itself, you will not find the View Page Info option. You must click somewhere on the page that is not the video or a link.
<br />Image titled Save a Flash Animation from a Website Step 2
<br />2
<br />Visit the website with the animation you want. Once the animation has loaded in Firefox, right-click on the page. Make sure you're right-click on the page's background, not on the Flash object itself.
<br />Image titled Save a Flash Animation from a Website Step 3
<br />3
<br />Select “View Page Info” from the right-click menu. This will open a box with detailed information about the site you are viewing. At the top of the box, you will see a set of tabs that can display different information about the site.
<br />Image titled Save a Flash Animation from a Website Step 4
<br />4
<br />Click on the Film icon. This will show a list of all of the multimedia objects that the site contains, such as button graphics and banners. It will also contain the .SWF file of the animation. Click the Type column heading in the list to sort by object type.
<br />Image titled Save a Flash Animation from a Website Step 5
<br />5
<br />Find the Flash file. The movie will be in .SWF format, and will be listed as an "Object" or "Embed" in the Type column. The name of the file is often similar to the title of the animation on the website. Select it from the list and click "Save As...". Name the file whatever you would like and click Save.
<br />Image titled Save a Flash Animation from a Website Step 6
<br />6
<br />Play the movie. Once you've downloaded the movie, you can open it in any browser that has Flash installed. When you first try to open the file, Windows may tell you that you need to specify a program. If your browser is not listed as a suggested program, search your computer for it. Most browser programs are located in the Program Files folder on your hard drive, in a folder labeled by the company (Google, Mozilla, etc.)"

<br />
<br />Then insert Flash into PowerPoint:
<br />
<br />Open a PowerPoint presentation or create a new one, then select a slide where you want to insert Flash.
<br />
<br />2
<br />Now under the Developer tab in the Controls section, click on the More Controls icon.
<br />

<br />
<br />3
<br />Scroll down, select Shockwave Flash Object and click on OK.

<br />
<br />4
<br />Draw a rectangle on the slide that will be the placeholder for your .swf Flash file. You can resize the placeholder by dragging its handles.
<br />
<br />Resizing the Flash movie box in PowerPoint
<br />
<br />5
<br />Right-click on the placeholder and select Property Sheet.
<br />
<br />Choosing Property Sheet for a Flash movie in PowerPoint
<br />
<br />6
<br />You will see the Properties dialog box. Next to Movie, enter the full path to the SWF file, including the filename and extension. You can either insert a SWF file from your computer (e.g., C:\movie.swf) or from a website (e.g., http://www..com/movie.swf). Set EmbedMovie to True.
<br />

<br />
<br />7
<br />The Properties window has a few other settings for fine-tuning the movie playback:
<br />
<br />Set the Playing value to True if you want the Flash movie to start playing automatically.
<br />
<br />Set the Loop value to True if you want the Flash movie to start over automatically after the playback is finished.
<br />
<br />8
<br />Close the Properties dialog box. To see the animation in action instead of a white placeholder, click on the SlideShow button under the View tab, or press F5 on your keyboard. To start the slideshow from the current slide, press Shift+F5.

<br />
<br />It is possible that you are not accepting it because you must have saved the zip in the same folder where you have saved the ppt.
<br />Try it and let me know if we can solve the problem.
<br />
<br />see you soon!

<h2>            unable to start service &#8220;Network Connected Devices Auto-Setup&#8221;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Community,</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>I'm unable to connect to my company's LAN because of some change they've made recently ; the solution they are applying to my colleagues laptops (windows 7) is to start the service automatically, but for me whenever I try to start it I get the following
 message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>The Network Connected Devices Auto-Setup service on Local Computer started and then stopped. Some services stop automatically if they are not in use by other services or programs.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>any ideas how to fix this ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
</div>

            <p>Hi Mehdi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the issue description, I understand you are unable to connect to your company’s LAN.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I appreciate if you could answer a few questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Are you able to connect to your home network?</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Does this issue only occur with company’s LAN?</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> What is the make and model of your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are unable to connect to company’s LAN only, there is possibility your company might have set some policy towards their network.
<span>&nbsp;</span>I suggest you to check with your company IT administer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the status of the issue.</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Windows Mail error 0x800ccc0f. Unable to receive new e-mail messages.</h2>
                    <p>original title:&nbsp;windows mail error 0x800ccc0f</p>
<p>Hello fantastic support network. Been reading the prior answers but none of the steps work or apply here.</p>
<p>This is a January 2009 HP Pavilion dv6-1030us laptop which came preinstalled with VISTA . I immediately
</p>
<p>enabled Windows Mail client &amp; its been working fine on AT&amp;T / Uverse yahoo mail . Microsoft Security Essentials&nbsp;&nbsp;is my protection.</p>
<p>*On November 30, 2011 Receive of POP3 suddenly stopped at ~ 3 PM&nbsp; But SMTP sending worked. Using the</p>
<p>send-receive button&nbsp;gave&nbsp;the &nbsp;infamous 0x800ccc0f . Another&nbsp;IMAP account still worked in the MAIL client .
</p>
<p>* The process of getting POP mail is reported in the normal status window : It is the same as always ...connecting,
</p>
<p>authorizing, receiving list of messages BUT&nbsp;the progress bar thermometer gets ~1/2 way THEN&nbsp;the VISTA busy circle
</p>
<p>appears where the cursor was in the window and the (not responding) appears in the top bar of the&nbsp;box&nbsp;, the box grays-out
</p>
<p>and after 30 seconds or an eternity , the ERROR 0x800ccc0f&nbsp; and all its gory detail&nbsp; appears under the ERROR tab</p>
<p>*Web-based browser AT&amp;T email still worked fine . Whether I was logged into that or not, &nbsp;the MAIL client still would not receive.
</p>
<p>* Yes I checked reentered changed settings / secure sockets ... as the other helps suggested . What I had been using was correct.
</p>
<p>* Not sure how to really kill uSoft Security Essential Virus dead ...some have suggested such things can get in the way .</p>
<p>But&nbsp;I can turn it off &amp; see a "WARNING&nbsp;not secured" message "so I presume its off&nbsp; but&nbsp;the issue persists in either case. &nbsp;</p>
<p>* I later on took a bunch of Microsoft VISTA updates that I was holding out on &amp; no change.</p>
<p>*AT&amp;T help pages wrote that the server names had been migrated from pop.att.yahoo.com to inbound.att.net&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;(similar on smtp) so I changed those back &amp; forth but nothing functionally changed.</p>
<p>*Called AT&amp;T help folks &amp; they checked that my mail &amp; server was OK as far they could tell.
</p>
<p>* In despiration I set up a new MAIL account unsing the identical info and checked the box to" synchronize"
</p>
<p>(on the opening properties tab page) &nbsp;&amp; unchecked that box on the original&nbsp;account. NOW send/receive
</p>
<p>downloaded ALL my mail on&nbsp;&nbsp;the server from the beginning of time for &nbsp;the account, 20,000+ items. Some 4 hours</p>
<p>&nbsp;later I had a up to date&nbsp; stuffed inbox. Thought it was fixed . The next send/receive button &amp; ol' ccc0f was back.
</p>
<p>The work-around&nbsp; is sending from web mail to my IMAP but that is getting old fast .</p>
<p>* Please do not solve it by dodging &amp; migrating me to another MAIL client unless you can prove that all my fussy files
</p>
<p>&amp; such will be moved like magic.&nbsp; </p>
<p>*Yes I've done Vista backups to an external hard drive ... but the thought of a full clean WIPE &amp;&nbsp;reinstalling everything</p>
<p>to fix some broken uSoft code is repugnant. </p>
<p>* I am willing to use some trusted repair tools if they are truly clean . I cannot find any MAIL install repair facilities in this
</p>
<p>machine&nbsp; whereas in XP the settings/programs did offer repair functions. </p>
<p>The computer is &lt;just&gt; a tool for my business &amp; life , &nbsp;not a hobby or past-time or avocation. &nbsp;I just wish it was MAILing like it was.</p>
<p>*So I appeal to you experts . Thanks in advance ! RFjock 12/10.2011 5 :30 PM Chicago</p>

            <p>Bruce asked me to jump in here, since I'm more familiar with Winmail and the database and I wrote WMUtil.&nbsp; The reason I wrote it is because there is no easy way to manually compact the database, and WMUtil just wraps the MS utility to make it easier for
 the users.</p>
<p>Here are some suggestions:</p>
<p>If you have the WinMail gadget running, get rid of it.</p>
<p>For MSE, go to the settings and disable scanning of the eml file type.&nbsp; That will prevent the eml files from being scanned and deleted, which results in a database mismatch that corrupts the database (WMUtil fixes that).&nbsp; If you are incautious enough to
 open an infecting attachment, MSE will still act in the background to block it.</p>
<p>Your issue stems from one of two possible ones, from what I can discern.&nbsp; The database in Winmail could have been corrupted, so you can run WMUtil (and let it finish.&nbsp; If you are worried, then make a backup of things, if you haven't already (see
<a href="http://www.oehelp.com/backup.aspx#wm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.oehelp.com/backup.aspx#wm</a>)).&nbsp; Then see if the problem mail accounts work.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>If you still get the error, then the other issue could apply, which is that there may be a problem message on the server that Winmail can't handle and that is generating the error.&nbsp; For that situation you would have to identify the problem message and get
 rid of it.&nbsp; Since you already have 2 copies of your 20,000 messages you have in the POP3 inbox, I would suggest that you create a new mail folder on the server and move the messages from the server's&nbsp;inbox to it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then add another copy of the POP3 account
 in Winmail&nbsp;and see if it will download the newer messages.&nbsp; That might rid you of the issue then.</p>
<p>See if any of that helps.&nbsp; </p>
