                    I'm having an issue with a windows update, specifically this one,&nbsp;2019-02 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1803 for x64-based Systems (KB4487017) - Error 0x800706ba. To fix this, I have tried to restart my computer and update it, then I ran to
 troubleshooter and it said all the issues were fixed, but the update still doesn't work and gives me the same error. What can I do to fix it?

            Hi Rebecca.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Most Updates will sort themselves out in a few days so I'd wait to see.  If not then here are steps you can take:  
<br />
<br />1) There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />2) If that fails try manually resetting Windows Update Service:
<br />
<br />Open administrative Command Prompt and type following commands one-by-one followed by Enter key. 
<br />
<br />net stop wuauserv 
<br />net stop cryptSvc 
<br />net stop bits 
<br />net stop msiserver 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />Ren C:\Windows\System32\catroot2 Catroot2.old 
<br />net start wuauserv 
<br />net start cryptSvc 
<br />net start bits 
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />Close Command Prompt and see if Windows Updates works then
<br />
<br />3) You can also install the Updates manually that fail to install which are logged at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History, and then search for those to download and install from this Catalog:  <a href="http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=windows%207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/sit...</a>
<br />
<br />4) If they continue to fail and interfere, then you can block them using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />5) What I'd do at this point if you haven't yet is install latest Version 1809 by installing Media Creation Tool from this link and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />6) If problems with Updates have become chronic and especially if you have other performance problems, be aware that what we have found is that in Windows 10 everything depends on the quality of the underlying install, the same reason enthusiasts have never run Factory or Upgrade installs because they know there would be endless issues. 
<br />
<br /> For example there have been zero return problems by those who follow the gold standard Clean Install here:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  It is better and faster than any previous version of Windows, and a better install than any amount of money could buy.  So when you get time I'd study over that to see if it's something I can help you do.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls Windows while shedding factory bloatware that can cause issues and affect performance, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />

<h2>            Windows will not install updates</h2>
                    <p>I've looked at other posts and tried lots of different fixes.</p>
<p>Fix-it doesn't work</p>
<p>I notice that the last successful windows update was KB 2515325 on 23 January.</p>
<p>I've had a few defender and office updates since.</p>
<p>I hadn't realised I had update failure until last week this as on shutdown I get the message 'Windows is installing 1 of 3 updates' so assumed it was updating OK.</p>
<p>It tells me I have 24 failed updates.</p>
<p>I get error message 8000FFFF</p>
<p>I have scanned for virus &amp; malware - all clean.</p>
<p>My windows is genuine and activated.</p>
<p>I tried disabling / enabling automatic updates.</p>
<p>I don't have a system restore point that far back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Nick</p>

    <title>Why doesn&#39;t the Microsoft Store require signature for - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carlo gesualdo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why doesn&#39;t the Microsoft Store require signature for delivery&#63; &#36;1500 laptop missing</h2>
                    <p>Having read the excellent reviews for Microsoft's Surface Book, I pulled the trigger and bought one for my wife from the Microsoft Store online to be delivered before Christmas. &nbsp;I tracked the order every day, and then when it was scheduled for delivery,
 I ensured that someone would be home to take the delivery. &nbsp;After all, I didn't want the shipment to be delayed, and I assumed that FedEx would require a signature for something this valuable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, it looks like the item was never delivered (even though FedEx's online tracking system indicates that it was). &nbsp;I contacted FedEx and they're not sure what happened and I contacted Microsoft and they're not sure what happened. &nbsp;Now I'm stuck waiting
 for an indeterminate amount of time until Microsoft's escalation team (case number&nbsp;1366309717) gets back to me. &nbsp;In all likelihood, I won't have the item I ordered in time for Christmas and until I hear from somebody, I'm just out a pretty huge chunk of change.
 &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is how can Microsoft justify sending a ~$1500 device through FedEx and then NOT require signature confirmation - especially around the holidays when package thefts traditionally spike?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update 1 - After not hearing from anyone from escalations today, I called the support number back at 3:30pm EST and spoke with someone who assured me that someone was on my case. &nbsp;Then out of nowhere, I received an email from someone named "Delani W." who
 was writing to follow up on a solution...to someone else's case. &nbsp;The email contained details from a resolution for a completely unrelated case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I called the support number again, and spoke with someone who told me that my case number had been closed. &nbsp;After being on the phone for almost an hour, I was finally transferred to a supervisor who said that he wasn't sure how I ended up attached to
 the case number that I was originally provided, but it clearly wasn't related to the order I called about. &nbsp;What's worse is that the issue that I originally called Microsoft about on 12/12/16 was never actually escalated...so now I get to basically start over
 at square one waiting for the escalation team to contact me. &nbsp;My new case number is now&nbsp;1366461240. &nbsp;Microsoft has had my money for eleven days now and I still don't have my wife's Christmas gift due to their decision to save a couple of bucks and not require
 signature confirmation for delivery.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply Barb. &nbsp;I've been thinking about doing just that if I don't hear back soon. &nbsp;It just seems negligent of Microsoft to ship such an expensive piece of hardware and then not to include a signature requirement for proof of delivery. When
 I did a little searching to see if other people had this idea with the Microsoft store, it actually sounded like other people were required to sign for their Surface Book deliveries - so it seems even stranger to me that my particular shipment never required
 a signature.&nbsp;</p>

            My Surface Book was delivered today and did not require a signature, which I thought was insane. I'm not sure what the appropriate feedback channel is (which is how I ended up here). I hope you ended up getting yours.

            The very same thing happened to me in late December. I heard a "plunk" on the empty receptionist's desk and an elevator ding as someone left. I went to see what it was and there sat my $2,700 Surface Book! WTH? I was shocked.

<h2>            Flight Simulator X claims there is no directx 9 after installing on Windows 7</h2>
                    I just installed Flight Simulator X on Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit.&nbsp; Although the installer said it installed DX9, when I went to run FSX, I got an immediate error message saying DX9 was not installed.&nbsp; I tried installing the latest DX9 redistributabl
 package, but to no avail,&nbsp; Flight Simulator X still complains there is no DX9.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?

            Use DirectX Websetup and Install it. Websetup will download and install required Dx files only. I got the same problem while playing games and it worked perfect.

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>This service depends on Remote Procedure Call (RPC) which is another service.&nbsp; Check that service to make sure it is automatic and started.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work, we'll have to try some basic troubleshooting techniques to try to isolatte and resolve the problem:</p>
<p>============================================================================================================</p>
<div>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work.<br />
<br />
If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning windows installer (Start / Control Panel / Administrative
 Tools / Event Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>You may be infected by malware.
<span>
Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:
</span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and
</span><span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span><span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a></span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials
</span><span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></a></span><span>
<span>(with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time).
<span>&nbsp;</span>You may also want to try the free Avira at: </span></span><span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a></span><span>
 and Avast at: </span><span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a></span><span>.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Reboot after completing all the scans.<span>&nbsp; </span>
You may also want to try the free OneCare at </span><span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></span></a></span><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work.&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install
 (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></p>

<h2>            Need assistance re-installing Windows 8 on HP envy.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: WINDOWS 8 trouble.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My laptop is a new HP envy m4 1015dx that had windows 8 professional pre-installed,due to certain problems i had to erase my entire hard disk and reinstall windows 8 using a bootable pen-drive, i had read that windows makes use of the product key "embedded
 in the BIOS" and so its now not printed anywhere on the laptop or separately provided to the consumer, but i am being asked my product key which i do not have and hence i am unable to authenticate mine,there are programs like "produ key" etc that supposedly
 finds out the key that is "embedded in the BIOS" but that is not working. ***during the initial installation procedure the installation media provided a key to install windows 8 first but now whenever i am using such programs then they return to me that particular
 key only,,is it possible that when i formatted my hard disk it got erased,,or that during the new installation the key that i entered has overwritten the original one ? is it possible that i can get the key by contacting the HP support staff by providing them
 my product number and serial number ?? </p>

</span></span></span><span>Which Microsoft Fix it are you referring to?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the exact error message are you getting along with the failed updates?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the steps provided below and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:

<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:
</span></b><span>If the issue persists then
</span><span>t</span><span>ry to set your computer in
</span><span>Clean Boot state and then install the updates.</span></p>
<p><span>By setting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.</span></p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After clean boot troubleshooting step, follow the “<b>Steps to configure Windows

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:
</span></strong><span><strong><span>Manually try installing the updates from Microsoft Download Center.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to the

 website, type the "KB" number of the update into the download search box, and then click&nbsp;Go.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the list of search results, click the Knowledge Base (KB) article link to go to the download page. If there's more than one listing, look for
 a link that goes to the Microsoft Download Center.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there are multiple versions on the download page, find the appropriate one for your computer. Click the&nbsp;Download button, and save the update
 to your desktop.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When prompted, click&nbsp;&nbsp; Open to install the update.</span></span></p>

<p>My apologies for the time between Gaurav's post and mine.</p>

<p>I was looking over your previous post and noted that your error code was <strong>

<p>Can you check that code and verify that it is correct?</p>

            <p>Hi Mathew thanks for your reply the code for the KB246332 was 0x65b not what you sent back.
</p>
<p>Also the KB2423089, I went out to Microsoft and downloaded the security update and then ran it to my computer,. it actually was successful its in the add remove programs as an update but my computer doesn't acknowledge that because it still says that I need
 that update as well as the KB246332..</p>

<p>I can now see where the confusion came from.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You were saying "of 0x65b" and it showed as "ofox65b."</p>

<p>To the point.</p>

<h3> anthony lubrano  say:</h3>
<h2>            system service exception fltmgr.sys</h2>
                    <p>I have a [fairly] new Surface 3 Pro... working perfectly.&nbsp; Upgraded&nbsp; from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10.&nbsp; I simply let the system get updated from the download when Windows 10 became available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the most part, it operates flawlessly however, I keep getting these FLTMGR.SYS BSOD messages.&nbsp; System restarts and all is well for awhile.&nbsp; So far, I have been unable to see any usage pattern that precludes the BSOD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No new hardware or software has been installed.&nbsp; All the software claims to support Windows 10.&nbsp; I use McAfee for security.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where might I find the "dump" or data collected before Windows restarts.&nbsp; I don't know if there are any useful messages in the data that might help me pinpoint the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The discussions so far indicate that something was added or changed to cause the problem.&nbsp; This is not the case... other than Windows 10 upgrade, nothing was added or changed... hardware or software.&nbsp; I am current on all my maintenance... even the optional
 stuff is installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although this is not a serious problem, I would like to get it resolved.&nbsp; It is bothersome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanx in advance for any assistance.</p>
<p>Tony</p>

            <p>Hi Anthony,</p>
<p>
</p><div>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I appreciate your interest in windows 10. I understand the inconvenience you faced. I will&nbsp;help you with this.</div>
<p>
</p><p>FLTMGR.SYS&nbsp;blue screen errors&nbsp;are typically <strong>caused by faulty hardware or corrupt device driver files.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to follow the below link to fix the issue:</p>

<p>I have a [fairly] new Surface 3 Pro... working perfectly.&nbsp; Upgraded&nbsp; from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10.&nbsp; I simply let the system get updated from the download when Windows 10 became available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the most part, it operates flawlessly however, I keep getting these FLTMGR.SYS BSOD messages.&nbsp; System restarts and all is well for awhile.&nbsp; So far, I have been unable to see any usage pattern that precludes the BSOD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No new hardware or software has been installed.&nbsp; All the software claims to support Windows 10.&nbsp; I use McAfee for security.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where might I find the "dump" or data collected before Windows restarts.&nbsp; I don't know if there are any useful messages in the data that might help me pinpoint the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The discussions so far indicate that something was added or changed to cause the problem.&nbsp; This is not the case... other than Windows 10 upgrade, nothing was added or changed... hardware or software.&nbsp; I am current on all my maintenance... even the optional
 stuff is installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although this is not a serious problem, I would like to get it resolved.&nbsp; It is bothersome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanx in advance for any assistance.</p>

<p>Hi Anthony, you can download for free a small program called "Bluescreenview" and that lets you
</p>
<p>view all the BSOD mimi dumps etc. to give you more info</p>

            <p>I'm have the same issue...sort of. I recently upgraded the Motherboard, CPU, and RAM in my PC. As a result I ended up wiping my HD after backing it up and then Installed a fresh copy of Windows 10. There were a few questionable glitches in the first 24 hours
 but it seemed to smooth itself out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where I've had trouble is when my PC enters a sleep state. I've tried Sleep, Hibernation, and Hybrid and get the same result. If my computer doesn't BSOD immediately upon being woke up it will simply not do anything. The background will be black, mouse barely
 moves, Task Manager might open for a second and then goes away. Ultimately I power down and then get the BSOD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Installed the BlueScreenView to look at it and unfortunately it's not something simple like a video card driver. NTOSKRNL.EXE is in both of my recent sleep crashes along with FLTMGR.SYS in one and SRTSP64.SYS in the other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this make sense to anyone?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The attached DMP file is of the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>REFERENCE_BY_POINTER (18)</strong></span> bug check.<br />
<br />
<em>This indicates that the reference count of an object is illegal for the current state of the object.</em><br />
<br />
The reference count of an object is illegal for the current state of the object. Each time a driver uses a pointer to an object, the driver calls a kernel routine to increase the reference count of the object by one. When the driver is done with the pointer,
 the driver calls another kernel routine to decrease the reference count by one.<br />
<br />
Drivers must match calls to the routines that increase (reference) and decrease (dereference) the reference count. This bug check is caused by an inconsistency in the object's reference count. Typically, the inconsistency is caused by a driver that decreases
 the reference count of an object too many times, making extra calls that dereference the object. This bug check can occur because an object's reference count goes to zero while there are still open handles to the object. It might also occur when the object's
 reference count drops below zero, whether or not there are open handles to the object.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">-------------------</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1. </strong>Uninstall YouCam from CyberLink.</p>

</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span><span>Thank you for posting your query in the
</span><span>Microsoft Community</span><span> Forums. This is issue is a complex one. It can occur due to a number of reasons,
 mainly if the hardware (RAM) is not seated properly.</span></p>
<p><span>Let us start with a few questions-</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Is this a laptop or a desktop?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><span>I would like more information regarding the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us now perform some troubleshooting steps. All the steps are to be performed systematically and in an order.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 1-</span></p>
<p><span>Make sure that you have all the updated drivers on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>You can download and install the same from the manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 2-</span></p>
<p><span>I would have you check if the RAM is seated correctly in the slot.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method 3-</span></p>
<p><span>I would have you run the Windows Memory Diagnostic tool.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the steps-</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on “Start” and type “Windows Memory Diagnostic” (without the quotes).</span></p>
<p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try one of these.. You will be surprised at how easy Windows 8 works with a proper start menu.. My preference is for Start8..
</p>
<p>Alternative start menus.. </p>

            The same problem with me. My laptop already manufacture installed 4 GB RAM. Windows 7 64 bit shows me 4 GB Installed 4GB usable. In windows 8.1 Pro 64 bit, it show me 4GB Installed 2.18 Usable.<br />
<br />
How genius microsoft ? My guess, it is OS problem. Not hardware problem. Same laptop, same RAM, different OS show different RAM usable. Microsoft makes me surprise :)<br />
<br />
When i searched in google. I found this site. I don't know whether it work or not. I am not try yet.<br />

</p><p>I've tried multiple times with multiple different fixes to get the anniversary update to install but I always get the failed at safe_boot os section.</p>

            <p>l will forward this to a Support Manahrr who has asked to see these cases since youve done so much research.&nbsp; But my experience is that if all other steps&nbsp; have been have been completed and it is still failing the install is too corrupt to continue with
 and will only cause you problems If It upgraded anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you follow the steps in <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">
Clean Install Windows 10</a>&nbsp; then you get both a priceless learning experience and install.&nbsp; It compiles everything that works best and shows you how to apply it with your own hands, making you permanently the master of your PC.&nbsp; You will know more after completing
 those steps than 90+% of the people out there about how Windows 10 works best and have configured it yourself.&nbsp;

<p>Lol. Why does not the Store just say "Your trial is over, please buy the game." ?! I'm tired of searching every damn error code here. I do search, but a casual user thinks for himself "K, gonna pirate that thing, it's easier". And he's right, because it
 actually is, compared to finding out what's the problem, sinking into discussions etc.</p>

<p>8 GB RAM</p>
<p>
</p><p>On January 26th 2016, I shut down my computer to install some updates.&nbsp; When I turned it back on the next day, the computer was going slower than I thought possible.&nbsp; It took half an hour for startup services to get going.&nbsp; A left-click took the better part
 of a minute to register.&nbsp; Right-clicks took several minutes.&nbsp; The Start Menu wasn't working, as well as the search bar.&nbsp; I tried opening up Task Manager, but it was non-responsive.&nbsp; After fiddling around for a while, I used DISM's scan and restore functions,
 and that allowed me to access the Search Bar and Task Manager again.&nbsp; Disk usage was at 100%, but nothing was reported to be using the disk very much.&nbsp; I went to System Restore, and after an extensively long time waiting on it, I was given this error:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Too much time elapsed between freezing a transaction manager and thawing a transaction manager (0x80042329)</p>

    <title>After windows update unable to boot in desktop error&#58; The - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nova9  say:</h3>
<h2>            After windows update unable to boot in desktop error&#58; The application was unable to start correctly &#40;0xc000007b&#41;</h2>
                    <p><strong>Original title:</strong> Userinit.exe The application was unable to start correctly.....
</p>
<p>I can't log in, after I type in my password, this error appears:<br />
<br />
userinit.exe - Application Error<br />
The application was unable to start correctly (0xc000007b). Click OK to close the application.<br />
<br />
If I close ok, the windows disapears and I get a blank desktop with nothing on it. No icons, taskbar, nothing. CTRL ALT DEL works, and I can see the task manager. Under users, my username appears as Active; Session: Console.
<br />
<br />
This happened early this morning right after the computer was forcing me to restart after last night's updates. (Yesterday was August 10, 2011. Today is August 11, 2011)<br />
<br />
Besides today, the last time an update required me to restart the computer with that pop up window reminding me every so often, this problem happened as well. However, after that error message came up, I did a restart and I logged in just fine. This time however,
 a restart does nothing.<br />
<br />
The only application I could see messing something up or interfering with the updates is Avira Antivirus, or maybe MalWarebytes. Avira made that "something was detected" or "something was blocked from running" beeping sound sometime between the update and restart..
 I was on YouTube the whole time, so I don't think a virus could have caused the problem. I checked Avira's event logs, but nothing showed up. No error or detection, warnings, nothing for that day, even though the beeping sound came up about 4 times, each right
 after the other.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Got any idea what could be causing the problem or how to fix it? I already tried a system restore to the point right before the update was installed, which didn't work. I've also tried a Normal Startup and a Selective Startup, but it still doesn't work.<br />

<p>Alright so here's the deal,</p>

<p>I have a Windows 8 computer and I made an xbox live account on it.</p>

<p>I also have an xbox live account on my xbox.</p>
<p>I remember all of the information for my xbox account (which is the one i'm posting with)</p>

<p>but I can't remember the email I used with the account on my computer.</p>
<p>I never linked the account to an xbox or anything, it just stayed on this one system.</p>
<p>I remember my gamertag, but not my email.</p>
<p>if I knew what email i'd used, i'd probably remember the password for it too.</p>

<p>help please?</p>

<p>EVERYONE WHO DOESN'T KNOW THEIR MSA, OR DOESN'T RECOGINIZE IT PLEASE READ: </p>
<p>Have you ever taken advantage of the 3 free trials for a brand new xbox?</p>
<p>Have a sibling who used your email, had a friend who created your account, or other circumstance of the like?
</p>
<p>IT'S INCREDIBLY POSSIBLE, AND VERY LIKELY THAT YOUR MSA IS NOT YOUR CURRENT OR BEST EMAIL OR WORST CASE, IT WAS MISSPELT.
</p>
<p>If you are signed into xbox.com and your seeing a weird gamertag or having to accept TOU and "Joining Now" that is not your current MSA for your good gamertag.
</p>
<p>SO, you need to figure out what your MSA is. </p>
<p>Thankfully for most with the new TFA on the console when it asks for your email &amp; password your email is auto-populated. If you are seeing a mis-spelt email, the "wrong" email, a parent's email, it doesn't matter what you think, that's what Microsoft has
 on file for that gamertag. </p>
<p>Unfortunately after a few rounds of getting it wrong it won't auto-populate. Either way you need to reset that email's password on account.live.com.
</p>
<p>If it was misspelt, say gail.com, gamil.com instead of gmail.com, ect when you go to account.live.com you sign in with that incorrect spelling as the Microsoft Account. TRUST ME.</p>
<p>-As far as resetting the password, most likely it's going to send an email reset link to that non-existent email so hopefully you have a security question or another valid proof on your account.
</p>
<p>If your gamertag was created as a secondary to a family pack and the primary didn't put in an email because you didn't have one, you didn't want to give you one, etc and it gave you *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, that is your MSA and you need to use
 that as the MSA and reset that.</p>
<p>-Luckily for most in that instance, the primary's email is the proof you receive the email reset link.
</p>
<p>Very rare instances are your account being compromised and they changed your MSA, but they would have had to have had your gamertag on their console for more than 30 days to do so.
</p>
<p>-In that case you can call support, but if they don't find Unauthorized Access your still having the same issue only longer without your account.</p>
<p>Some of the older live accounts may have the advantage to re-create the email attached to their MSA because the email is so old it was dropped by domain and you can re-create it.
</p>
<p>I hope this helps. It's irritating I know, but seriously your MSA is your responsibility, always has been. MS will never have your passwords and you need to add proofs to keep from losing your account because in the future you won't have any options for
 resetting your password. That's all TFA is doing, making you add options to reset your password for the future. &nbsp;In regards to the other network its actually kind of scary how easy they give out resets, imagine a pissed off "friend" ex-girlfriend, brother,
 neighbor, all they need to know is basic info and the last 4 of your cc, which they can get from a receipt or something.
</p>
<p>@Jeenyusuz if you can verify the information on your account it's possible for xbox support to provide you the email or &nbsp;MSA (Microsoft Account) that is on your gamertag. If you had say, put in fake information, or someone else set it up for you and you
 can't remember what's on it support will not violate security of the account and provide it.

<p>Hi there! &nbsp;Without any other info, it may be difficult to recover it. &nbsp;You could contact phone support at
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/contact-us</a> but if you don't have info on it and never used it on a console, there may not be a lot we can do.</p>
