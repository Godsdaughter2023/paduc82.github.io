<h2>            Windows 10 and HDMI</h2>
                    <p>I just downloaded Windows 10 and then last night tried to watch a video and there is no signal on the TV when I hook up the HDMI cable like I always did on Windows 7. &nbsp;Please give me a fix. &nbsp;It is not an audio problem like one answer had. &nbsp;It is total. &nbsp;No
 video or audio. &nbsp;I look in devices and it shows USB, but no HDMI. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a Toshiba laptop, HDMI has always worked since I have had the laptop, so it is not my computer. &nbsp;I need this fixed, and the other suggestions have not worked. &nbsp;There needs to be a fix for the operating system to just be able to plug and play with
 the HDMI cable.</p>

    <title>cannot back up to external USB flash drive - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            cannot back up to external USB flash drive</h2>
                    <p>I bought new pc this week with Windows 10. &nbsp;From the start, had much difficulty trying to back up my data. &nbsp;I've had to try many, many times &nbsp;Finally seem to get the hang of it. &nbsp;I've made some backups. &nbsp;But today, it will not back up. &nbsp;I've followed the
 MS Support instructions. &nbsp;The USB drive has plenty of room. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I go to Settings, Update &amp; Security, Backup, ADD A DRIVE. &nbsp;When it shows my USB drive, I click it. That turns on Automatically backup my files. I click on More Options. Then click on Back Up Now. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All I get is a CANCEL button and message that my data is not backed up. When I check the drive, there are only 4 folders, with no data. &nbsp;I keep deleting them. &nbsp;I even remove the USB drive, close down and re-open settings. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, when you make in 10.1, please improve Backup so it's all on one screen. &nbsp;Wish you'd make it the way it was in Win 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what else to do. &nbsp;Am I doing something wrong? &nbsp;I am most grateful for your advice.</p>

            <p>Hello Kashka,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you tried using some other External Storage device for backup?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect that there might be some problem with the USB stick which you're using to Backup. Suggest you to try using some other External storage drive to see if problem still persist. Also try changing the USB port before initiating the backup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before checking the issue, do try the following.</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Restart your PC, post complete shutdown.</p>
<p>* Press <strong>Windows + X </strong>and select Command Prompt(<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">A</span>dmin)</p>
<p>* Type <strong>net start VSS </strong>and hit enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now try if you're able to Backup the files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted if you require further assistance.</p>

            <p>I tried using a different port and a different USB drive, no luck.&nbsp; I just did your other suggestion, the VSS thing.&nbsp; Then tried to back up. Immediately saw the CANCEL button again.&nbsp; Scrolled down the screen a bit wondering what else could try.&nbsp; Was just
 about to remove the usb when it suddenly lit up and backed up.&nbsp; Success!&nbsp; I know it takes many seconds for the drive to light up, and I was patient on my previous tries.&nbsp; Thank you so very much.&nbsp; And, can you tell me what the Volume Shadow Copy Service does?
 What is "volume"? &nbsp;Maybe I'll need to use it some day for other things.&nbsp; Sure glad to have this fixed.&nbsp; Yashwanth, a tip of the hat!</p>

            <p>To Yashwanth and Everybody:&nbsp; It turns out that my reply of Oct 25 was premature.&nbsp; Doing the "VSS" thing worked once.&nbsp; Then, later last night, I could not back up no matter how often I tried.&nbsp; I did complete shutdown and turned off pc overnight. Today, I
 still cannot back up.&nbsp; I don't want to keep doing VSS every time I do a backup.&nbsp;&nbsp; The USB drive is new and has lots of room. Ports on new pc are good.&nbsp; Getting so frustrated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>(BTW:&nbsp; this may not be related, but I'll mention it as I am not a "techie".&nbsp; The first few days of Win 10, when I inserted the USB stick, something opened on the right side of screen asking what to do with it. Suddenly, that has stopped appearing. I don't
 recall seeing a checkbox to turn it off.&nbsp; But file manager recognizes it and I can see my previous backups.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate a permanent solution to my back up problem.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

            Turns out all I have to do to backup is merely copy my documents and paste them into the USB. &nbsp;I once thought that's what to do, but a man on radio stressed back up. So when I got Win10, I used the Backup &amp; Recovery. &nbsp;It's a confusing thing, and I still
 don't know why it doesn't work as I expected. &nbsp;But I'm doing just fine with simple copy &amp; paste.

<h2>            Windows 10 Update reboots to a blank screen</h2>
                    <p>I am doing an upgrade for my Aunt. &nbsp;The third upgrade to windows 10 I have completed.. &nbsp;Again, the whole upgrade worked great. &nbsp;Just like the other two upgrades, the system was working. &nbsp;However, on bootup the system displays the windows logo, then a black
 screen. &nbsp;The system is working, you can hear actions in the speakers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The video card is an intel HD graphics 3000.</p>
<p>The computer is a Toshiba - Satellite L775 - Laptop</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system shows no errors.</p>
<p>This happens during a restart or a shutdown and restart.</p>
<p>The windows installation seems complete, since it does start while the black screen is there and it can run with a little coercion.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How to "trick" the computer to running.</p>
<ol>
<li>Power Button:
<ol>
<li>Boot</li><li>Blue Windows Logo with spinning dots</li><li>Black Screen - unresponsive to any input</li><li>"Trick"</li><li>Power Button - wait for HDD light to stop</li><li>Power Button</li><li>System immediately turn on</li></ol>
<p>
</p></li><li>Uninstall Display Driver:
<ol>
<li>"Trick"</li><li>While Windows is running, uninstall display driver.</li><li>Restart, as prompted.</li><li>system starts perfectly, until the display driver is installed.&nbsp; Then black screen.</li></ol>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Personal diagnosis:&nbsp; Display or Display Driver issue.&nbsp; There seems to be no newer drivers for the card. &nbsp;The roll back driver button is greyed out.&nbsp; What should i do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Additional Diagnostics:&nbsp; The laptop has VGA and HDMI outputs.&nbsp; I tested the computer startup with my digital projector attached to the VGA output.&nbsp; It started fine on the projector.</p>

            <p>Try the following for TEMPORARY fix. Whilst Using external monitor...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Uninstall the graphics drivers completely. This will leave the laptop with Basic windows drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Update Driver using the Microsoft automated search system (update driver)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Once drivers have been detected and installed, DO NOT Reboot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Turn laptop off completely and unplug external monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Turn laptop back on and the screen appears on the lapto as it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Down side to this is that you cannot use the Restart Button. You must use the shut down each time or put your laptop to sleep.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you use the Restart button then you will have to plug in your external monitor again or do a soft shutdown by holding power button in for 4 seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this Temp fix helps.</p>

            <p>I have the very same laptop and the very same problem. I did a factory reset with the included Toshiba Windows 7 and then did an upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have not tried to do a fresh install of Windows 10 yet. I don't have anything installed on this laptop so that was my next step if I can't resolve this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An additional note: If I shutdown as mentioned above, and then turn the machine back on, everything is fine. It is only the reboot function that brings me to a backlit black screen. Pressing the power button to suspend and then resume from the black screen
 solves the problem.</p>

            <p>1.&nbsp; Make sure you turn off Microsoft Automatic Updates in&nbsp;Advanced System Settings / Hardware / Device Installation Settings and select No, Let me choose what to do and then click on "Never install driver software from Windows Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. &nbsp;Uninstall Graphics driver. It should show a Basic Generic driver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. &nbsp;Use Driver Navigator to download latest Graphics drivers whilst you are still operating in Windows 7. Do not use the drivers from Intel's website. There is a problem with their driver.</p>
<p>Once you have installed these drivers with Driver Navigator, go ahead and install Windows 10. You should no longer have to use the external monitor and your LCD will display correctly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This should do the trick</p>
<p>
</p><p>Intel is not supporting 2nd gen i3 cpu with HD3000 Graphics. See my earlier post.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Does the alias starts with “live:”? You cannot sign in to Skype using a technical ID. If your Skype account has a Skype name that starts with
 “live:”, that means the account was created using a Microsoft account and you need to sign in to Skype using the Microsoft email address.

    <title>0x24 Blue Screen Issue &#40;SATA Drives&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jasonw000  say:</h3>
<h2>            0x24 Blue Screen Issue &#40;SATA Drives&#41;</h2>
                    <u>STOP: 0x00000024 (0x00190203,0x89FD3CA0,0xC0000102,0x00000000)</u><br />
<br />
<br />
I have a Dell Vostro 420 running Win XP Pro, fully updated as of last week. This morning while working on a spreadsheet in Excel two small windows popped up. The top window indicated a problem writing a file that, by name, appeared possibly to be related to
 my antivirus software, AVG 2013 Free. The only option in the window was [ok] but I was unable to select it either with the mouse (frozen) or by keyboard. As such, I was unable to read the second window behind it. Using [ALT] [TAB] I was able to reach Excel
 but my attempt at saving the file was unsuccessful. Shortly there after the entire machine locked up preventing even a warm restart. I am now unable to reboot in any mode, including safe mode, etc. and receive the following error:<br />
<br />
STOP: 0x00000024 (0x00190203,0x89FD3CA0,0xC0000102,0x00000000)<br />
<br />
The machine itself checks out ok. I have run the diagnostics at the bios level. I also have an older drive from the same machine that when installed, boots fine. I have not made any recent changes other than installing a batch of Windows updates last week.
 The machine has been running 24/7 since then, without issue.<br />
<br />
As I am a security minded user, running antivirus (AVG 2013 Free and McAfee Security Scan Plus) and sitting behind a hardware firewall, I am hoping that it is just a disk error and not a virus. At minimum I have multiple Outlook accounts (Office 2007 / no Exchange
 Server) that I need to recover. At best I would like to recover the entire disk.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have followed the instructions found on this site for recovering from an 0x24 blue screen but have come up short. I am the original owner of this computer and would have any disks it came with, however, the item closest at hand is an earlier Windows XP Pro
 Upgrade disk from March 2004. (part number X10-52219). Booting from this disk I am unable to reach the Windows recovery console. I have tried selecting 'r' during boot up as directed here:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Description of the Windows XP Recovery Console for advanced users&nbsp;&nbsp; (http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314058)<br />
<br />
Nothing happens.<br />
<br />
During the boot, I am offered the option of an automated recovery program by selecting [F2] but it then instructs me to place a specific disk into the floppy drive. I couldn't do that even if I had the disk (no drive). If I allow it to run through without selecting
 anything, I get an 0x0000007b error instead. Does the recovery 'r' option not work from an upgrade disk, do I just need to find a later version (service pack 3) Win XP install disk? Perhaps it's an issue with the SATA drives? Is there any other way to access
 the recovery console? I have found a number of links to JoseIbarra's iso file but it appears it will not work with my SATA drives.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your assistance. <br />
<br />
Jason

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            You will not be booting in any mode with that error.<br />
<br />
You said:<br />
<br />
<i>Shortly there after the entire machine locked up preventing even a warm restart.
</i><br />
<br />
So what did you do?&nbsp; Use the power button, pull the plug?&nbsp; Things like that can cause corruption in your NT File System (NTFS) and a symptom of that is the error you describe.<br />
<br />
If I were you I would start by running a chkdsk with error correction (always first for that error).<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are not sure what you have for bootable media, from a working system, make yourself a Hiren's Boot CD, boot on that into the Mini XP mode and run the chkdsk from there.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Here's how:<br />
<br />
Make yourself a Hiren's Boot CD which you can download from here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/</a><br />
<br />
The ZIP file is large, so the download will probably take a little while to complete bit it is worth it.&nbsp; Then unzip the download to extract the Hirens.BootCD.ISO file that will be used to create your new bootable CD.<br />
<br />
Creating a bootable CD from a .ISO file is not the same as just copying the .ISO file to a blank CD.&nbsp; You have to use software that understands how to burn a .ISO file to a CD to create a bootable CD.<br />
<br />
In the Hiren's ZIP file are the BurnToCD.cmd file that you can double click to launch it, but I have never used it and prefer to use ImgBurn.<br />
<br />
If you need a free and easy CD burning software package, here is a popular free program:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a><br />
<br />
Like many third party programs you might install, the ImgBurn installation defaults to installing things you probably don't want installed on your system in the form of extra Internet browser toolbars or may make other adjustments to your browser.&nbsp; You don't
 want to install any of that so you have to pay attention during the installation.<br />
<br />
When clicking through the installation screens be sure to pay attention to the screens and always choose a Custom install and UNcheck the following (or any other things like it):<br />
<br />
UNcheck:<br />
<br />
Install the AVG toolbar and set AVG Secure Search as my default search provider<br />
Set AVG Secure Search as my homepage and newly opened tabs<br />
<br />
Choose custom installation again and UNcheck the following:<br />
<br />
Uncheck:<br />
Install QuickShare<br />
<br />
There could be other things too.<br />
<br />
Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a><br />
<br />
It would be a good idea to test your new bootable CD on a computer that is working.<br />
<br />
You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive as the first boot device instead of the hard disk.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
These adjustments are&nbsp; made before Windows tries to load.&nbsp; If you miss it, you will have to reboot the system again.<br />
<br />
When booting on the Hiren's CD you will see a menu of options.&nbsp; Choose the Mini XP option.&nbsp; Then it will appear that Windows is being loaded and you will be presented with a desktop that has the look and feel of the Windows Explorer interface you are already
 used to using.<br />
<br />
Remember:&nbsp; You did not boot on your hard disk - you booted into the Hiren's desktop.<br />
<br />
One way to check the disk for errors is to open My Computer and right click your afflicted drive and choose Properties, Tools, Error-checking, Check Now... put a check mark in both the boxes and then Start.<br />
<br />
Sometimes that doesn't work, so you can also click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
<b>cmd</b><br />
<br />
Click OK to open a Command Prompt window and enter the following command (assuming XP is installed on your C drive)<br />
<br />
<b>chkdsk&nbsp; c:&nbsp; /r</b><br />
<br />
This disk checking can take a long time (perhaps several to many hours) depending on the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume and what the disk checking finds to do.
<br />
<br />
<p>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find.&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Depending on the the speed of your system, the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume and what chkdsk finds to do, it may take a long time for chkdsk with error correction to complete (several to many hours) or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'.&nbsp;
 Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something so don't interrupt it.&nbsp; It will finish eventually one way or the other.&nbsp; Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear to go backwards
 sometimes.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You may have to run the chkdsk&nbsp; /r&nbsp; it more than once.</p>
<p><br />
When the chkdsk runs clean, remove the CD and restart your system.<br />
</p>

<h2>            File Explorer stuck on &#39;Working on it&#39; after mega patch today</h2>
                    <p>After today's horrific mega-patch, MS, in good fashion, managed to screw up my system again in a bad way. When opening the file explorer, it just hangs on "Working on it," revealing no drives of any kind (networked, fixed or mobile). Without the file explorer,
 you can do as good as nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to solve this?</p>

            Not that anyone at MS gives a sh*t, but for those who do, I found out&nbsp;MS messed up the permissions of the C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Search folder (thus making it impossible for the file explorer to do its discovery). I deleted the Data folder therein, and
 sure enough the file explorer worked again.

<h2>            Random Connection Drops</h2>
                    
<p>So as of late, my connection will randomly drop in online multiplayer. In all my games, i will run with best connection but it will drop to low for about 15-30 seconds and then go back to normal and i don't know why. At first i thought it was because of
 me running off of wifi so i moved my Xbox and hardwired it to the modem and i still have the problem. Any help is appreciated.</p>

<p>I have run into this problem with my ISP before. Your connection is not holding steady. I don't know if you are using cable, DSL, or Line of sight. Your speed is fine for playing the problem is it will not always be 1.23 meg. If othesr are on your network
 it will drop you speed. Also you should call your ISP and have them do a line test. They have logs that will show if they are losing connection to you. My ISP did this several times. Also have you cycled your modem? There may also be noise on the line. Your
 ISP will be able to tel if this is the case. Most of the time the connection loss is with the ISP. All ISP's will have this problem. some more than others.</p>

<h3> crazydud24  say:</h3>
<h2>            Infinite Restart Loop</h2>
                    I purchases a Razor Blade Stealth computer back in December and on occasion it would go into an infinite restart loop after I shut it down. Every night I would properly shut it down and every week or two their would be a problem turning it back on. Their
 would be a screen that is mostly black with the exception of 3 lines of text at the top left saying "press F9 for recovery menu" and similar things but non of the listed buttons do anything. Their would also be a circle of a few white dots in the middle to
 show loading. After about 3 or 4 seconds of loading my laptop would crash and restart the loop, the only way I can end it is holding the power button for a lot longer than usual to shut it down. I am only bringing this up now because for a few months now it
 had stopped its self but just a few minutes before typing this it did it again and I want to stop it. I have looked around a little and haven't found another post about this problem so here I am, I don't know much about computers s

<p>Hi We could use a little more information. Is your PC still under warranty?</p>
<p>Did it come with W10?? You could try a repair or reinstall with the media creation tool. Let me know how things go!</p>

<li>The tool will walk you through how to set up Windows 10 on your PC.
<ul>
<li>If you don’t have a license to install Windows 10 and you have not previously upgraded to Windows 10, you can purchase a copy of Windows 10, see
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-windows-10.</a></li><li>If you previously upgraded to Windows 10 on this PC and you’re reinstalling it, you don’t need to enter a product key. Your copy of Windows 10 will automatically activate later using your digital license.</li></ul>
</li><li>When Windows 10 is ready to install, you’ll see a recap of what you’ve chosen, and what will be kept through the upgrade. Select
<strong>Change what to keep</strong> to set whether you would like to <strong>Keep personal files and apps</strong>, or
<strong>Keep personal files only</strong>, or choose to keep <strong>Nothing</strong> during the upgrade.</li><li>Save and close any open apps and files you may be running, and when you’re ready, select
<strong>Install</strong>.</li><li>It might take some time to install Windows 10, and your PC will restart a few times.
<strong>Make sure you don’t turn off your PC.</strong></li></ol>

            <p><span><span>Hi Goutham,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thanks for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>We understand the inconvenience caused and we will try our best to resolve the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>We appreciate you for trying the troubleshooting steps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To assist you better, I like to know; are you referring to the forward and backward button on Windows Explorer?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I suggest you to try the below steps and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Step 1</span></strong><span>: If you are referring to the forward and backward button on Windows Explorer. Then is it might be an issue with some of the system files. I suggest you preform DISM command and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Deployment Image Servicing and Management (<strong>DISM</strong>) is a new command line tool that you can use to service a Windows image or prepare a Windows PE image. The DISM tool replaces the Package Manager (pkgmgr.exe), PEimg, and Intlcfg tools.
 DISM consolidates the functionality found in those three tools, as well as delivers new functionality to improve the experience of offline servicing.</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the steps to Run <strong>DISM</strong> Commands:</span></p>
<p><span>1) Press <strong>Windows + x</strong> on your keyboard.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>
</p>
<p><span>2) Select <strong>Command prompt (Admin)</strong> to open <strong>Administrator Command Prompt</strong> .</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3) In the <strong>Administrator: Command Prompt</strong> window, type the following commands.
</span></p>
<p><span>4) Press the Enter key after each command:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; <strong>dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth </strong>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; <strong>dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Step 2</span></strong><span>: For the issue related to Booting of the system, I suggest you to perform start up repair and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the below steps:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Press and hold <strong>Shift key</strong> and <strong>
restart</strong> your Computer.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Select <strong>Advance Option</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Select <strong>Startup Repair</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>

<h2>            &#34;Unfortunately, this PC is unable to run Windows 10. The CPU is not supported&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I want to upgrade my PC from Windows 7 to Windows 10, but I keep getting the following message:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/15433541-9cee-4625-bbd4-913372275f7d" height="255" width="392" /><strong>"The CPU is not supported."</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I am <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">absolutely sure</span> that my PC is more than capable of running Windows 10 because these are my specs:</p>
<p>

</p><p>And these are the system requirements for Windows 10:</p>

<li>

<p><strong>RAM:</strong></p>
<p>1 gigabyte (GB) for 32-bit or 2 GB for 64-bit</p>
</li></ul>
<p>I've seen older computers running Windows 10 (see <strong>link</strong> below).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I refuse to believe that my PC is "unable" to run Windows 10. This has to be some mistake. Is there anyone who can help me?</p>

            <p>Have you checked that the Data Execution Prevention CPU feature ("NX") is enabled in your BIOS settings?&nbsp; If you don't have this setting in the BIOS, a BIOS update may be available from your motherboard or PC vendor that adds this option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get the same message with my HP Mini 5102, but I do have this switched on in the BIOS, and all 3 required CPU features (<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/what-is-pae-nx-sse2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Windows 8.1 has the same CPU requirements as Windows 10">PAE,
 NX, SSE2</a>) are reported as present by the recommended SysInternals utility "<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/cc835722.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Command-line utility created by Mark Russinovich">Coreinfo</a>".&nbsp;
 I got a more specific error message when I tried running "setup.exe" from the Windows 10 DVD (you can download the ISO): It said my PC couldn't install Windows 10 because the processor lacked the NX feature.&nbsp; Maybe this would be the case for your PC if you
 tried this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the accusation that my CPU doesn't have NX enabled is rubbish, so surely it must be a bug in the detection code, since Coreinfo, which shows my Atom N450 CPU has NX enabled, uses the Windows
<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms683194.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Technet page">
GetLogicalProcessorInformation</a> function.&nbsp; I also dual-boot to Ubuntu Linux, which reports (cat /proc/cpuinfo) that all of these features are available in the processor.</p>

            <p>Well, I have, since I posted above, installed Windows 10 on my HP Mini 5102 twice. Once was straightforward: A clean install on a borrowed hard drive. This convinced me it should be possible to do the upgrade, so I attempted it on a cloned copy of my Windows
 7 installation (so I'd be sure I could go back). This wasn't so straightforward, probably due to pre-existing Windows configuration plus the foibles of the Windows-launched installer. The Windows configuration I speak of is the DEP settings you mentioned,
 and perhaps more, because changing the DEP setting to include all programs didn't solve it. I got it to upgrade by running the setup.exe found in a subfolder of the Windows 10 DVD (which I'd written to a USB stick). This trick, which bypasses (at least some
 of?) the checks in the setup.exe in the root folder, is from Windows 8; it is still valid for 10.</p>
<p>I haven't upgraded my actual Windows 7 installation yet, for 3 reasons: (1) I wanted to see the detection code fixed, (2) I didn't want to be a very early adopter, and (3) now that the bug has been fixed (at least for my case; after a Windows Update that
 said it was for the Get Windows 10 app, it said my PC was Good to Go), I haven't found the time to do it yet.</p>

            Thank you for your response. So I guess I should look for an update for the Get Windows App first then try the other suggestions (or work through them with a more tech savvy person). Do you know the KB number for the Get Windows update? &nbsp;Did it come through
 the normal Windows Update Process? Thanks again for your feedback.

            Hi Gerard,<br />
<br />
<br />
The error code you're experiencing while installing a Windows update might be due to a variety of reasons.<br />
<br />
That being said, let's run the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027322/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Update Troubleshooter</a></strong> to find and repair problems with installing Windows updates
 on your PC.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, let's <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/971058/how-do-i-reset-windows-update-components" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">reset your Windows Update components</a></strong> to further troubleshoot the issue.<br />
<br />
Let us know what happens next.<br />

<p>I ran Windows Update Troubleshooter multiple times which did not resolve problem. Each time it was ran the Troubleshooter claimed it fixed the errors (Windows Update Error 0x80070057, Problems Installing Recent Updates, Service Registration Is Missing Or

<p>
</p><p>I ran DISM.exe/cleanup-image/restorehealth and it stopped at 40% after running overnight (5 hours). This also did not solve the update problem.</p>

<p>Manual downloading of update did not solve the problem. The update still fails at 97% complete after the restart. What would cause it to always fail at 97% complete?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have TorGuard VPN installed. Would that affect installation of the update? I tried installing the update while disconnected from the VPN and it also failed. I haven't tried uninstalling the VPN and running the update.</p>

<p>Hi Gerard, </p>
<p>
</p><p>You might experience some difficulties in installing Windows Updates due to these reasons:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Restricted or limited Internet connection</li><li>Incorrect date and time settings</li><li>Applications that are blocking the process</li><li>Missing or corrupted system files</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, we suggest following the steps on this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> that can help identify and resolve the issue.</p>

<p>Mayra,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need to read the entire thread of this message. I attempted the steps in the article you referenced and the DISM process failed to complete (only got to 40% complete) after letting it run for 5 hours. I read elsewhere online that the DISM process should
 only take minutes to complete.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anybody at Microsoft answer what occurs after the update process states that it is 97% complete? What is the next step in the update process that is failing after 97% completion? That might give us a clue about what is going on.</p>

<p>Here's an interesting development. I did some research and found that the August 2017 update has multiple components:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">Monthly Quality Rollup for Windows 8.1 KB4034681 &nbsp;(this fails to install at 97% complete after restart)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">Security
 Only Quality Update for Windows 8.1 KB4034672 &nbsp;(I successfully installed this update)</span></p>
<p>Why would KB4034672 successfully install and KB4034681 fail to install? What is the difference between the updates?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do I need KB4034681 with KB4034672 successfully installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Hello Andy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for providing us the opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description it seems that your Sculpt Touch Mouse is working but lags some time. So,
<span>I would suggest you to run the Hardware and devices troubleshooter to troubleshoot the device:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a. Press <strong>Windows key</strong> <strong>+ Q </strong>to launch search box.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Type “<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>” without quotes and click on <strong>
Troubleshooting</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>c. In the new window, click <strong>View all</strong> on the left pane.</span></p>
<p><span>d. In the list of options, click on <strong>Hardware and devices</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>e. Click <strong>Next</strong> and follow the on-screen instructions.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to check if you have installed all the updates on the computer:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Open Windows Update by pressing <strong>Windows key + Q</strong>. In the
<strong>search box</strong>, type <span><strong>Update</strong></span>, and then, in the list of results, click
<span><strong>Windows Update</strong></span>.</span> </li><li>
<p>In the left pane, click <span><strong>Check for updates</strong></span>, and then wait while Windows looks for the latest updates for your computer.</p>
</li><li>
<p>If any <strong>updates </strong>are found, click <span><strong>Install updates</strong></span>.
</p>
</li><li>
<div>You might see both <strong>important </strong>and <strong>optional </strong>
updates. If you don't see the <span>Install updates</span> button when there are only optional updates, click
<span>Optional updates available</span>, choose the ones you want, and then click
<span>OK</span>. </div>
</li></ol>
<p><span>In order to find the answers of your queries I would recommend you to follow the suggestion provided in the following articles.</span></p>

There are several ways to get that<br />character,&nbsp; but one easy way is to hold down the alt key and type 137.</p><p>As a point of information if you are interested, the purpose of a<br />diaeresis is to indicate that the second of two successive vowels is<br />pronounced separately. So the word "book" is pronounced buk, but the<br />name Boök is pronounced BO-ock.</p>

                    <pre><span>Problem with DELL XPS13 9343 equipped with Dell DA 100 docking station

Installed operating system version Version 1803 17134.48

Display Link version: 8.3.2008 also tried to install the latest version 8.4.3005

Driver version Intel HD Graphics 5500 20.19.15.4531 also tested with version 20.19.15.4835

Problem: connecting via hdmi-utp extender to a CISCO SX10 device with CE firmware 9.2.4.4de75bc if you try to go to projection mode you get the following error message:

Resolution not supported

Changing the PC resolution at any level always has the same problem.

<br />
<br />If that does not work, keep the following in mind...
<br />
<br />
<br />As future Windows 10 feature updates are released it will introduce incompatibility with older devices and PC's. Certain components will not support these changes as observed by some users not seeing transparency anymore. Recommendations include, rollback, block the upgrade or consider upgrading components in your system such as graphics, storage, BIOS, motherboard or purchase a new Windows 10 PC. 
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

Many thanks for your prompt reply Andre,<br />
<br />
Dell xps 13 is a clean install of Windows 1803 and same problem is present&nbsp; for hundred laptop with WINDOWS 1709 installed.<br />
<br />
Have tried old and latest versions of Video and Display Link Drivers, without any improvment.<br />
BIOS version have been updated to the latest and it is the same version of working laptop with old windows version.<br />
<br />
Dell XPS 13 with WIN 1803 or 1709 works fine just connected with short hdmi wired to CISCO SX10 bypassing extender hdmi-utp or with cisco proxmity installed.<br />
<br />
Dell XPS 13 with WIN 1703,1607 and 1511 works fine also with extender hdmi-UTP<br />
<br />
Hope Microsoft/Dell will dig further soon as possible&nbsp; this issue.<br />
Many thanks for your cooperation.

<p>Problem and workaround found.<br />
My thought is the problem is indipendent from OS Version <br />
With Hdmi extender seems that video card can't intercept the&nbsp; right Refresh Rate Hz of external monitor (cisco SX10).<br />
Workaround is plug hdmi extender with Dell DA 100, Switch projecting mode to Extend and looking in Advanced video properties of second Monitor under Monitor -&gt;Monitor Settings-&gt;change Screen Refresh Rate to 30Hz --&gt; safe change and Presentation start.<br />
Looking in dxdiag logs, i found for external monitor(DisplayLink USB Device) on Working Dell XPS 13
<br />
Current Mode: 1920 x 1080 (32 bit) (30Hz)<br />
In not working Dell XPS 13 DisplayLink USB Device :<br />
&nbsp;Current Mode: Unknown<br />
or on some other Dell XPS 13 not working:<br />
&nbsp;Current Mode: 1920 x 1080 (32 bit) (60Hz)<br />
Just to know&nbsp; why some Dell XPS 13 with Same Hardware and Same Drivers works automatically and other not.<br />
Many thanks For your Help</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 Crashing upon boot. &#40;URGENT&#41;</h2>
                    Hi, I've installed Windows 8 since around October 30 this year. However, my experience with this OS has not been nearly satisfactory. This is due to the constant crashing of my system during start up. Upon turning on my laptop, my system crashes upon arriving
 at the loading time "win 8 logo". I have to repeat this process a dozen times over before I can actually have a stable and running system. But this is only a brief reprieve of this mess. The whole crashing recurs the next time I switch on my system. I've checked
 my event logs and it has the following event:&nbsp;

<div><strong>&nbsp;We do need the actual DMP file as it contains the only record of the sequence of events leading up to the crash, what drivers
 were loaded, and what was responsible.</strong><br />
<em>You may be able to get the DMP files without crashing by booting into safe mode (F8) with networking.<br />
If you are overclocking stop.&nbsp; (chances are if you dont know if you are, you are not)<br />
To enable us to assist you with your computer's BSOD symptoms, upload the contents of your "\Windows\Minidump" folder.</em><br />
<strong><br />
The procedure:</strong><br />
<em>* Copy the contents of \Windows\Minidump to another (temporary) location somewhere on your machine.<br />
* Zip up the copy.<br />
* Attach the ZIP archive to your post using the "paperclip" (file attachments) button.<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>When exactly do you get this error message?</p>
<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Were there any recent changes made on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform a clean boot on the computer and check if any third-party program is causing the issue.</span></p>

<p>if this is the old fat xbox when the disk tray goes in the box physically push the tray in a bit harder &nbsp;and hold it. if that doesn't work you will have to call support or something.</p>

<p>If it's not reading anything then it can a laser problem or the disc drive in general, if your console is still under warranty MS will fix it for free otherwise try and get it done locally it should run you just under $100 to get it fixed depending on the

<p>[/quote]Apparently not long enough.</p>
<p><br />
Seriously though. sounds like a faulty disc. i personally had technical difficulties with BF3 with saving, loading and other things. Don't know if its the devs or just EA bs. Could be your console is getting old. Just chill out and don't break anything.</p>

<p>I hear what you guys are saying.... Im not going to snap back at the person who said I havent been playing long enough.... I have the new version one, maybe a year at best maybe less... I refuse to believe that the disc is faulty .. when it comes to discs
 I keep them extremly clean, EXTREMLY... I can understand the laser eye possible going bad but it just doesnt make sense though, maybe Im in denial but I dought it.... now Ive read that people have had problems with the dash board update and certain games like
 L4D 2 and I had major problems too but I let a friend borrow it and it came back messed up .. ergo I am the only one who handles my discs (I know that may not sound right lol) These discs are clean as a whistle, the box aint that old, I had the older fat white
 one for damn near 4 to 5 years until someone conviced me to get it modded which in turn got my box banned which in turn led me to purchase the new version one.... I cant go with EA bs because MW3 does the same thing.... &nbsp;is there a way for me to put the model
 and serial on this site some where that would tell me if it ins warrenty .... Either way I appreciate all the responces, even the doughter of longevity of game playing. I dont wanna take it to a local place without a concrete confirmation that the eye is bad.
 &nbsp;IM JUST SCREWED ARENT I?</p>

<p>XBOX 360's come with a standard 1 year warranty, you can check the warranty status by going to the repair site and clicking "Start a Repair" it will ask you to add your serial number and it will let you know if it's in warranty or not.
