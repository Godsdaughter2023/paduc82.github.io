I have the same problem with a Nikon single reflect lens camera. &nbsp;It says it is an NEF file type. &nbsp;And windows media player does not recognize it and cannot play it. &nbsp;Please help.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>NEF files are Nikon's proprietary RAW file format and cannot be opened in Windows Media Player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have a few options, including:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Download and install <a href="http://downloadcenter.nikonimglib.com/en/download/sw/5.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>Nikon ViewNX2 </strong></a>&nbsp;which can open NEF files.</li><li>Install the Microsoft Camera Codec Pack which will then allow your NEF files to be viewed in File/Windows Explorer and Windows Photo Gallery (check that your camera used to take the photos is listed in the
<strong>Details </strong>section or it may not work). The links are:</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=26829" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Camera Codec Pack</a></strong>&nbsp; (Windows Vista/Windows 7)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/download/details.aspx?id=40309" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Camera Codec Pack&nbsp;
</a></strong>(Windows 8.1)</p>
<ul>
<li>Use&nbsp;proprietary photo-editing software (with the necessary plug-ins installed as necessary) to open and edit the NEF images.
</li></ul>
<p>When you have opened a NEF image in an app, you&nbsp;should then be able to save it as a&nbsp;much more widely supported image format such as JPG. There&nbsp;will be some loss of quality when doing this though, but good results can still be obtained.&nbsp;&nbsp;Once in JPG format
 (for example), Windows Media Player will be able to open the images.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't want to use NEF files in future, your camera should have the option to take/save the images in JPG format directly. Check your camera's settings.</p>

<h2>            Black screen computer crash.</h2>
                    <p>Hi, i have a issue where my pc would randomly crash, it happened 2 times when playing a game, then a third when i was scanning for viruses. I found a currupt executible and thought that was it. Once it was removed my pc would not start. I did two system
 repairs and it had a issue and it said it went offline and could not fix the issue, and then my pc worked fine untill about an hour later when i was playing a game (Arma 2) it crashed again. I got this information:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem Event Name: BlueScreen</p>
<p>OS Version: 6.1.7601.2.1.0.768.3</p>
<p>Locale ID: 1033</p>

<p>OS Version:6_1_7601<br />

<p>Product: 768_1</p>
<p>Files that help describe the problem:</p>
<p>C:\Windows\Minidump\013116-30622-01.dmp</p>
<p>C:\Users\Tyler\AppData\Local\Temp\WER-48391-0.sysdata.xml</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now i have had problems with my cpu overheating before, but i dont think this is becuase of this. I have a quite new cooler master cooler and dont think it will be crashing because of this. Im not to sure about if it is a virus or something to do with the
 cpu cache. Could anyone point me in the right direction? thx</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have been able to access the dump file and this is what it says:</p>

</p><p>I know there is more but if you need it i will paste it. I do not know how to fix the "authenticAMD" problem but it does say this: WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR (124)</p>
<p>So, i know its a problem with my cpu (which is an amd fx 8350) but i do not know what it is. Im not 100% sure it is a driver issue but if you could help me that would be appreciated! Thx.</p>

            <p>Thanks for replying,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already used safe mode to scan the system once with a anti virus software and it did not crash. The only thing is the crash happens randomly. It has happened 3 times today. 2 times when gaming. Once when it literally just turned on and was on the
 internet. So i have to idea if it actually doesnt crash in safe mode because it could be that it just does not want to crash at that time. Also when i installed the chipset drivers a few days ago it was fine. But after a day it started crashing again. I have
 had this system for around 2 years and this is the only time that it has happened. So, this might be pointing towards the harddrive considering that i have never scanned, de fragged or anything to my hard drive. I have only reinstalled windows once. So the
 hard drive might be corrupt. But i dont want to scan anything because i might lose data on the drive. Is there any way to find out any errors without losing data?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>OK first of,</p>
<p>My CPU is not the problem.</p>
<p>While i had a extremely bored day of crashing on Friday i thought that i may as well get a program to strain the CPU to see when the crash happens. I installed cine bench and started the CPU render. Everything was fine. Did it again, everything was fine
 no crashes. But as soon as i clicked GPU it crashed. I restarted and tried again, the same results but the GPU render got about 20 seconds in then crashed. So it was the GPU which was causing the problem. After i had solved this i took out the GPU, and because
 my CPU and limited integrated graphics i could play games that do not strain the CPU to much. After clean installing the drivers again for the GPU and did another render it crashed again. It seems that my GPU is dead. I do not know why but If you have any
 ways that i could fix this issue (either a certain driver might be malfunctioning) please let me know.</p>

<h2>            blinking hourglass windows xp</h2>
                    Good morning.&nbsp; Thank you to those casual users, engineers, IT support staff and all-around benevolent human beings that take the time to help people out.&nbsp; I am running Windows XP and just got done having the Dell PC cleaned with Symantec Endpoint Protection.&nbsp;
 However, I still seem to have a problem in that there is an hourglass next to the cursor point that is flashing on and off every 0.5 to 0.75 of a second or so.&nbsp; Obviously, something is trying to run/start but I don't know what that is.&nbsp; I am currently running
 a full scan of the hard disk using Symantec Endpoint.&nbsp; Please help.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
After the scan is complete, I'd suggest you follow these steps and check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
<br />
Boot your computer in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/boot_failsafe.mspx?mfr=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
safe mode</a> and check if the hourglass flashes.<br />
<br />
<br />
If the issue does not occur in safe mode, I suspect a startup or a third party program is causing the issue to occur. I'd suggest you boot your computer in a
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot
</a>state to eliminate third party software conflicts. <br />

            Since <span>you are running a Symantec product, I would start with downloading the latest Rapid Release definitions.</span>
<p><span>Next, boot into safe mode and running a Disk Cleanup (right-click the C drive, Properties, Disk Cleanup) - that will delete all the files that are in these temporary locations,
 as well as IE's temporary files, etc. Perform a full system scan in safe mode.<br />
If that fails to detect and remove any threats, there are some useful tools that are provided by Symantec for help with finding those hard to detect threats.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
1. The Power Eraser Tool eliminates deeply embedded and difficult to remove threats that traditional virus scanning doesn't always detect.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
2. The SERT (Symantec Endpoint Recovery Tool) is useful in situations where computers are too heavily infected for the Symantec Endpoint Protection client installed upon them to clean effectively.<br />
<br />
3. The Load point Analysis Tool generates a detailed report of the programs loaded on your system. It is helpful in listing common loadpoints where threats can live.<br />

<h2>            New Computer Blue Screen Errors and Reboot</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I just purchased a new HP All In One with Windows 10. It will boot fine, but when you got to install a new program or open an exiting program, I will get the blue screen with errors and the system will reboot. I did a diagnostic on the memory and hard drive,
 all fine, so that is why I think it may be a software issue??</p>

            Hi ,
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem
<br />
<br />If you need help to generate Minidump - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            Hi JR, those errors indicate your graphics card, and network card device drivers, however, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            Hi DCBUS
<br />
<br />Wow you have had a lot of system crashes, every one of those minidump files indicates a different device driver on your system as the cause of that individual crash
<br />
<br />You should go to the support page for your new All-In-One on the HP website, then download and install the full set of device drivers from that page . .

            Couple reasons this may happen.
<br />First check to see the windows time service is running.
<br />Go to search and type services and open services.
<br />Scroll to Windows Time and double click on it and set it to Automatic and Start it.
<br />Then set your timezone to automatic.

<br />
<br />Try that and see if that helps.
<br />If not it might be your system clock on your motherboard needs changing.

<p>It's not that your computer TIME is changing - it's your time ZONE that's changing.</p>
<p>Mine has started doing the same thing since the major April 2018 windows 10 update.</p>

<p>That is a good point.&nbsp; The clock stays working but the time zone changes all by itself - thus changing the time shown on my PC&nbsp; (also an HP).&nbsp; Did the reboot work or have you found a Microsoft fix?</p>

    <title>Creators Update ruined my Inspiron 5555 signature edition laptop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> soutemumb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Creators Update ruined my Inspiron 5555 signature edition laptop</h2>
                    <p>So for about a week I have not been able to reliably upload to my tumblr blog, play any games, or browse twitter.<br />
I've visited Windows, AMD and Dell technical support about the problem I have been having to no avail.<br />
My laptop keeps hard-crashing, It hangs then goes black(with the screen still on) it doesn't restart though, I have to hard reset it to get it to do anything again.<br />
AMD thought it was because of corrupt drivers and asked me to reset my laptop to factory defaults, then a safe startup so I could remove all traces of their driver from my system using DDU. When that didn't work they suggested that I try Dell since the hardware
 might have been custom for the laptop.<br />
Dell asked me to restore to an earlier restore point. I went to the recovery setting and the restore point option wasn't there.</p>
<p>Then while browsing my event viewer, I saw several severe errors in the system folder. Googling them leads me to believe that the creators update is to blame. So I went through the live windows support chat and had four techs tell me different things that
 didn't fix my problem.<br />
<br />
I need the functionality of my laptop back.<br />
<br />
Here are my specs:<br />
Inspiron 15 5000 series Touchscreen Pro Laptop (Flagship Edition)<br />
OS: Windows 10 Home x64<br />
Processor: AMD A10-8700P Radeon R6, 10 Computer Cores 4C+6G 1.80 GHz<br />
RAM: 8GB<br />
Graphics: AMD Radeon R6 Graphics<br />
Audio: Waves MaxxAudio Pro<br />
Network Qualcomm QCA9565 802.11b/g/n Wireless<br />
Drive Space: 1TB HDD<br />

            I'm already updated to the creators update, I downloaded it when it was offered because I didn't think Microsoft would let me update without checking that kind of thing like they have been doing for the rest of the windows 10 updates.<br />
Yes my processor is incompatible, so how do I fix the problem I am in now?

<p>Hello Soutemumb again<br />
I wanted to share the solution that worked for me and what the underlying problem was.</p>
<p>First off the problem was that my&nbsp;AMD A10-8700P with Radeon R6 Graphics wasn’t Creators Update Compatible and the incompatibility was making it unstable.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>♠</span>The proposed fix was to uninstall the update and go back to the Anniversary Update (or 1607).
</p>
<p>Some people might have the option to uninstall windows updates under Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery but some people will not.</p>
<p><span>♠</span>The people who do not have to contact Microsoft’s tech department for a copy of the Media Creation Tool compatible with their system (They require you to send them your product ID to make sure you’re not getting a copy that will end up with
 errors and crashing). </p>
<p><span>♠</span>I suggest backing up your files to an external hard drive, Flash drive, or optical media. But this is only in case corruption occurs, your files should still be accessible from your hard-drive in a folder called windows.old.</p>
<p><span>♠</span>Creating the media on flash-drive or DVD then they need to boot from the disk and install windows 10 1607 cleanly on their primary partition.
</p>
<p><span>♠</span>At no point should you connect to the internet until you’ve disabled windows update temporarily.
</p>
<p><span>♠</span>Then when the computer is done installing the downgrade, you type “Services.msc” into the run dialogue and press enter.
</p>
<p><span>♠</span>When the list of services pops up you need to find Windows Update, right click it and click properties to set it’s startup type to disabled and stop the service (at this point you can reconnect to the internet).
</p>
<p><span>♠</span>Then install all of the proper device drivers and restart the computer.</p>

<p>I thought this would have fixed my laptop but unfortunately it seems that in installing windows 10 creators update my AMD APU has been physically damaged. I'll be sending my laptop back to the seller on warranty to fix this or replace the laptop entirely.</p>

i have the same laptop and have factory reset it,up to version 1703....IT WILL NOT TAKE THE FALL CREATORS UPDATE 1709...IT WILL PROCEED TO TRY INSTALLING THE UPDATE WITH A ALL BLACK SCREEN THAT FREEZES AND DOES NOTHING....THEN WANTS TO REVERT BACK TO THE PREVIOUS
 WINDOWS......STOP PUSHING THE ISSUE AS A CUSTOMER FAULT WHEN IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE CUSTOMER AT ALL... YOU MICROSOFT HAVE CHOSEN TO CONTINUALLY CHANGE THE OPERATING SYSTEM WITHOUT PERSONALLY TESTING ALL COMPUTERS...THIS SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN RELEASED
 TO THE PUBLIC TILL IT WAS FULLY TESTED...WHICH AGAIN YOU FAILED TO DO THIS AS USUAL BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT A TRUSTED COMPANY ANYMORE....WINDOWS 10 SHOULD HAVE BEEN ALL &nbsp;AND ME ALL COMPLETED BEFORE IT WAS EVEN RELEASED PERIOD... SO YOU WILL HAVE DAMAGE REPORT FILED
 AGAINST YOUR COMPANY FOR RELEASING A BROKEN WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM...WE ARE NOT THE GUINEA PIGS HERE ...YOUR TEAM AT MICROSOFT ARE...SO GET ALL MAKES AND MODELS OF PC'S AND GET TO WORK...AND DO NOT RELEASE ANOTHER BROKEN OPERATING SYSTEM TO THE PUBLIC AS
 A LAWSUIT COULD AND WILL &nbsp;BE FILED IN REGARDS TO THIS ISSUE OR YOUR COMPANY'S INCOMPETENCE OF KNOWING AND UNDERSTANDING WHAT THEY ARE DOING TO CUSTOMERS PC'S.....IT'S CALLED DAMAGING HARD DRIVES...MY HARD DRIVE AND MY WIFE EXACT MODEL PC HARD DRIVE NOW RUNS
 AT 96 PERCENT CONSTANTLY NOW..MICROSOFT WILL BE BILLED FOR 2 NEW HARD DRIVES FOR THESE RATHER NEW WINDOWS 10 LAPTOP YOU CHOOSE TO MESS UP.... IF I COULD INSTALL WIN 7 ON THIS NEW LAPTOP IT WOULD BE DONE ALREADY...NEVER BUY A MICROSOFT PC UNTIL THEY CAN RELEASE
 A COMPLETED VERSION OF WINDOWS 10...TY.......NOW THE BIG QUESTION IS HOW DO I STOP THE FALL CREATORS 2017 UPDATE FROM CONTINUALLY TRYING TO INSTALL ON MY DELL INSPIRON 5555...REALLY BEGINNING TO HATE AND MEAN HATE MICROSOFT AS YOU FOLKS HAVE NO RESPECT FOR
 OTHER PEOPLE PURCHASES AND PROPERTY THEY BOUGHT EXPECTING A COMPLETE WORKING OPERATING SYSTEM... WISH I COULD THROW THIS LAPTOP THROUGH THEIR FRONT WINDOW WITH A MEDIA PRESENCE PROVING MICROSOFT DOES NOT CARE ABOUT THE CUSTOMER PROPERTY...YOU FOLKS SHOULDN'T
 BE IN BUSINESS ANYMORE,,FILING A CLAIM WITH BETTER BUSINESS BUREAU AS WELL...TIRED OF THE LIES AND INCOMPETENCE FROM MICROSOFT... NOW MY LAPTOP GOES INTO REBOOTING MODE LOOP BECAUSE OF THIS FALL CREATORS UPDATE.YOU HAVE OFFICIALLY RUINED 2 DELL INSPIRON LAPTOPS
 WHICH CANT BE USED AS IT IS IN A REBOOT LOOP BECAUSE OF THE UPDATE WHICH I CAN'T STOP,THIS NEEDS CHANGED AS WELL WE SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE WHAT UPDATES WE RECEIVE PERIOD...

<p>Having done that try running Vaio Care, if it doesnt run then likely those third party utilities have damaged your system files and the registry</p>

            <p>No that wasnt the reason, you were using a third party optimiser utility, Sony System Care does not cleanup the registry.</p>
<p>By reinstalling win you have removed that third party utility</p>

<h2>            Latest Windows 10 updates not installing. KB4034658 and KB 4035631</h2>
                    <p>As the title says I am getting an error trying to install the latest updates for Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are main updates for Windows 10 operating system version 1607 for x64-based systems</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last time it did it, it gave me an error number but unfortunately I didn't write it down and it hasn't given me it again. I know it ended in 5b4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas folks?</p>

<p>Thanks for the quick reply Anne.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought this was one of the big replacement downloads for Windows 10 O.S. but it wasn't I believe. Just another added upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You were correct with the 0x800705b4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I could not even get the start button to come up when I clicked on it. The whole laptop froze and when I eventually got to the settings through the action centre it did download the updates but when it started to install them it froze at 3%. Lots of failures
 with the above number. Was getting nowhere very fast</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another error came up one with lots of 0's. I tried uninstalling some of the other updates and again I got the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Eventually I switched of my Wi-Fi and uninstalled what I could in case there was some conflict, rebooted and allowed the updates to download and they did. All seams fine now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thought I was going to have to reinstall my O.O.T.B. (F9 on reboot) on my Azus K54C to go back to old Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an external HD so can I make a complete copy of my Windows 10 O.S on it in case I lose it, as I have before. You don't get Windows 10 free anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

<h2>            cant use my old account</h2>
                    
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an old account (like 3-4yrs old) and bought a new xbox360 a week ago.</p>
<p>The problem is that i can't connect or log in with my old account email and pass. it says thats its used by another.</p>
<p>then you think that you forgot to erase account then you sold your old box but as i see on my account here at this page i can see its never been used since i sold my box so that excludes that problem, so next step is that you uses your other live mail that
 never have had any live account and that says exactly the same (used by another)!!!</p>
<p>What makes this problem???</p>

<h2>            Help viewing Windows Stacked or Side by Side</h2>
                    Hey guys, I am trying to view my windows either stacked or side by side so that I can follow a tutorial and work in Photoshop. I have both open and right click on my taskbar.&nbsp; "Cascade, show desktop and task manager" works fine. But if I choose one of
 the other options nothing happens. Can someone please help? THanks

            Hi angievaughn,<br />
<p><br />
Have you tried doing this with other windows? If not, go ahead and try doing “Show Windows Stacked” and “Show Windows Side by Side” with something like two internet browsers or two Word documents for example.
</p>
<p>Another thing to try would be holding CTRL and then clicking on the Photoshop and the tutorial in the taskbar. After you have them both selected, try doing the “Show Windows Stacked” and the “Show Windows
 Side by Side” views.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>We look forward to hearing back from you on your results. If you have any further questions, please don’t hesitate to ask.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Quote:"<span> I can however connect both ways as a network".&nbsp; Homegrouo is a Network too.<br />
</span></p>
<p>-----------------------------</p>
<p>Sharing entails.</p>
<p>1. All the computers on the same Network.</p>
<p>2. Firewall and other software security configured correctly to allow Local Traffic.</p>
<p>3. File/Printers Configured to Share.</p>
<p>4. Permission/Security set for all Users.</p>
<p>-----------------</p>
<p>Win7 when configured on peer-to-peer Network has <strong>three</strong> types of Sharing configurations.<br />
<br />
<strong>HomeGroup Network</strong> = Works only between Win 7 computers. This type of configuration makes it very easy to Entry Level Users to start Network sharing.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<strong>Work Network</strong> = Basically similar to the previous methods of sharing that let you control what, how, and to whom folders would be shared with.<br />
<strong><br />
&nbsp;Public Sharing</strong> = Public Network (like Internet cafe) to reduce security risks.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;For best results log to each computer's System Screen and set all the computers to be on a Network with the same name while each computer has its own unique name.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_name.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/net_name.jpg</a></p>
<p><br />
Make sure that the Software Firewall on each computer allows free local traffic. If you use 3rd party Firewall On, Vista/XP Native Firewall should be Off, and the active Firewall has to adjusted to your Network IP numbers on what is some time called the Trusted
 Zone (consult your 3rd Party Firewall instructions<br />
<br />
General example,&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ezlan.net/faq#trusted" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/faq.html#trusted<br />
</a><strong><br />
Please Note that some 3rd party Software Firewalls keep blocking aspects of Local Traffic even it they are turned Off (disabled).</strong> If possible configure the Firewall correctly, or totally uninstall it to allow clean flow of local network traffic.</p>
<p>If end up with the 3rd party software uninstalled or disabled, make sure that Windows native Firewall is<strong> On</strong> .</p>
<p>------------------------------</p>
<p><strong>If your network is comprised of Win 7 only and you want a simple Network, use this.</strong></p>

<p>After configuring the Homegroup scroll down to the <strong>Permission/Security section.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Networking&nbsp;Win 7 with other version of Windows as&nbsp; Work Network (</strong><strong>works very well if all computers are Win 7 too).</strong></p>
<p>In the Network Center, clicking on the Network type opens the window to the right.</p>
<p>Choose your type of Network. Notice the check mark at the bottom, and check/uncheck it according to your needs.</p>

<strong>When finished with the setting of the system it is advisable to Reboot all the hardware including the Router and all computers involved.</strong></p>
<p>-------------</p>
<p><strong>If you have Permission and Security issues with Vista/Win7, check the <strong>
following</strong> settings.</strong></p>
<p>Point to the a Folder that meant to&nbsp; to be share. Right click and choose properties.</p>
<p>In the properties</p>
<p>Click on the Security tab shown in the pic bellow to the right) and check that the users and their permission (shown in the pic bellow center and left) are correctly configured. Then do the same to the Permission tab.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/Permission-Security.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ezlan.net/Win7/Permission-Security.jpg</a></p>
<p><strong>In both the Security panel, and the Permission panel you have to highlight each User/Group and examine that the Permission Controls are checked correctly.</strong></p>
<p>When everything is OK, Reboot the Network (Router, and computer).</p>
<p><strong>* Note</strong> . The Groups and Users shown in the screen-shoot are just an example. Your list will look the way your system is configured.</p>
<p><strong>**Note</strong> . All user that are allowed to share need to have account on the computers that they are allowed to connect to.<strong>Everyone</strong> is an account, it means a group of all of the users that already have an account
 and been established as users. It does not mean<strong> Everyone</strong> that feel that they would like to login.</p>

The ASUS rep has me uninstall HID compliant touchscreen driver in device mgr and said when u restart pc it should reinstall automatically. It did not reinstall at all. I asked about a force installation if the driver and ASUS said it was a function of the windows
 update and that would not correct. &nbsp;That i have to recover from and earlier set point. Which worked. &nbsp;

<h2>            Windows installation error code&#58; 0x80070570</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to do a clean install of windows 7 pro on a HP probook 6550b laptop. I have downloaded the&nbsp;<em>Windows-7-Professional-64bit.X17-59186.ISO</em> file and used the&nbsp;Windows
<em>7 USB DVD Download Tool&nbsp;</em>to make a bootable usb for the installation. The installer launches just fine and I get past the license terms and choose the custom (advance) option to get to the disk selection screen. After selecting the drive the installation
 starts but just a while after the expanding files phase starts I get the error: "Windows cannot install required files. The file may be corrupt or missing. Make sure all files required for installation are available, and restart the installation. Error code:
 0x80070570"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have updated the bios to the latest version, tried all the usb-ports of the laptop with two different usb-sticks. Tried both Sata device modes IDE and ACHI from the bios. Run memory test. I get the same error every time. Running out of ideas.</p>

<p>Hi HeikkiAakko,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In most cases, this error is caused by bad RAM. How did the memory test go? You might have to replace the RAM to rectify the issue.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the folders on your C: drive start with $ (dollar sign), delete those as this could also be the reason behind the error.&nbsp; Make sure to show hidden and system files in Windows Explorer options.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, disconnect all USB devices (except the keyboard/mouse) before trying to install Windows.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know how it goes. </p>
<p>

            I ran the memory test that came with the laptop bios and the memtest86 v. 5.01 several times and passed with no errors every time. I have delete all partition of the hard drive and made new one, so there cant be any files or folders on the C: drive. I
 also tried the installation with only one sodim installed with both dims in both slots one at a time. Issue still persists with no change. No other usb devices are connected other than the installation media and like I mentioned, have tried with two different
 usb devices and in all ports to rule out broken usb stick/port issue.

<p>Thank you for the update. This error usually means as mentioned by my colleague, a bad RAM or the source for the ISO installation files are not running correctly. Can you try burning the ISO file on a DVD and try to use it to install Windows 7? I suggest
 that you burn it on slow speeds so that we'll be sure that there wouldn't be issues on burning.</p>
<p>

</p><p>I'll be waiting for your updates.</p>

            I had the same problem. Got it solved by removing the printer from Devices and Printers (while the printer is off), and then power on the printer and let Windows add it back, and it works.

<h2>            Can&#39;t rollback from windows 10 to windows 7, even though windows.old folder is there</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I would like to roll back to windows 7, it says i have a month to do this.</p>
<p>But i can't because when i go to Settings&gt;Updates &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and attempt the rollback, it says "We're sorry, but you can't go back. The files we need to take you back to a previous version of Windows were removed from this PC."</p>
<p>I have not however deleted any files, and the Windows.old folder is still there in the C:\ drive unchanged.</p>
<p>I also tried restarting with advanced options and there is no option to roll back there.</p>
<p>Since updating to windows 10 i cannot even access my bios menu or other drives so doing a recovery that way is impossible.</p>
<p>Please sort this Microsoft, a rollback feature should not be something that's buggy.</p>
<p>

            Bump, this is horrible, windows 10 has corrupted my bios, promising me stuff i cannot do, and now i've noticed how much it chugs, even running old games from 2002 and i am getting frame dips, and now memory errors all over the place. This is the worst
 windows release yet, the fact it has disabled access to my bios not allowing me to downgrade alone makes this worse than any of the "bad" windows releases i.e ME and Vista. If you are going to try and force a new OS onto people, make sure it's not a beta OS
 like windows 10 is right now with the amount of bugs and lag it has. It's not like vista where you were rushed to release it and it clearly needs much more work yet. If you are on Windows 7 or 8 still thinking about upgrading, well unless this is fixed i cannot
 recommend it in the slightest, this is the worst experience I've had with windows and I've been there since the 90's, say what you want about Windows 8 but at least it wasn't broken like this.

            <p>My PC became unstable this past Monday, to the point where it would not even boot up.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Upon startup I'd get an error message; then a statement that Windows is fixing the issue; then it would restart and then it would go thru the same messages and restart routines; Windows would never load.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Even a Safe startup was not available as only options were for startup from disk, but only disk I had was for W7, not W10.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I had to send it out for a tech to look at it since internet connectivity was non existent by now and could not get remote support.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I checked with Dell &amp; found out that they've posted warnings on their site about compatibility issues with Windows 10 on some of their devices; wish I had checked this beforehand.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Got it back today (Windows 7 reloaded) and apparently there were multiple registry &amp; SFC issues caused by W10.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Windows 10 was supposed to be a free download, but its been far from free for me.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I lost 4 days of not having my PC available for use; at least 2 days of time spent trying to fix W10 issues; about 6 hours today reloading programs and drivers; and $150 for the tech support.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Not very happy right now;<span>&nbsp; </span>next time I look for a PC it may not be based on a Microsoft O/S.</p>

            Understood; thanks Alan.&nbsp; I have a number of Apple devices already and you're right, updates are frequent, but I've never experienced anything like the issues I had with Windows 10 and I've been around PC's since the IBM-XT.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe its a fluke, but when
 Dell posts to their web site to be aware of significant compatibility issues, it must mean something.&nbsp; I spent another 4 hours this morning resetting everything and loading the last of the latest drivers.&nbsp; Right now I am one click away from serenity!

<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">Setting up a gamertag should be free and need to remain so. Otherwise a lot of people can take up gamertags and then charge high prices for them. Wouldn't be fair would it now?<br />

Websites&nbsp;are different. Microsoft owns the gamertag system on Xbox LIVE and they can do whatever they want to do.</span></strong></p>

<p>Because it is against the rules to make any sort of profit off of anything that has to do with the Xbox Live service. You agreed to this when you accepted the Terms of Use and Code of Conduct.</p>

<p>They're selling stolen property,&nbsp;it's borrow something from someone and sell it to someone else as you do not own the Gamertag and it's content, just the rights to use it</p>
