    <title>Outlook.com&#39;s SMTP server is not allowing me to send mail with my - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Outlook.com&#39;s SMTP server is not allowing me to send mail with my IMAP account using Windows Live Mail on my laptop.  I get the error code 3219.</h2>
                    <p>I like to manage email locally, so after Microsoft stopped supporting an automatic link between hotmail.com and Windows Live Mail, I set up an IMAP account to connect WLM with outlook.com.&nbsp; This works well for receiving mail &amp; it syncs everything just fine--
 everything except sending.&nbsp; I get an error alert every time it tries to send the messages from the Windows Live Mail Outbox.
</p>
<p>Server Error:&nbsp; 3219.&nbsp; Windows Live Mail Eror ID: 0x8DE00005</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the IMAP account set up to require clear text authentication to receive &amp; to send.&nbsp; I have my Microsoft account set up for 2-step security, so whether or not I check the Account Properties SMTP security options box to log in with a password, it prompts
 me for a unique app password every time I open WLM, and sometimes it requires a password when I do a sync command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried choosing different SMTP security options, and methodically recorded them.&nbsp; One night, a few of my messages did go out after I retried checking a different box on the security options for sent msgs -- Amusingly, it was one night after
 I'd tried unsuccessfully to get help from Microsoft support.&nbsp; The live person who came on after the virtual helper admitted he didn't have enough knowledge to help me, ended up simply giving me the link to the customer support starting place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We do have slow DSL much of the day, but I'm experiencing this problem even when the internet is plenty fast enough.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
To help you with the SMTP server issue in Outlook, we'd suggest that you can refer to Edison Pus reply on this
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/oaccount-oother/outlookcomonedrivemicrosoft-account-problems/5b5a0dad-46ab-438e-911c-a3c8a96e9113">thread</a></strong>.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, you can do this workaround, you can re-open the browser and if that doesn't solve the issue, you can reboot your computer.<br />
<br />
Let us know the outcome.

            Thanks for offering to help, Gerardo, but your suggestions are not relevant to my problem.&nbsp; I have no problem using outlook.com.&nbsp; My problem is that I need the Outlook server to connect with my local mail client via the IMAP account, which I set up according

</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I am still not getting any help with my SMTP connection problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have searched all over the Microsoft website using the most specific keywords.&nbsp; Surely there is someone working for Microsoft who can give customers staightforward technical

            <p>Thank you for your help, Ron.&nbsp; Your suggestion is relevant to my problem.&nbsp; When I'm prompted for a password, I enter a new unique pw and that usually means the connection is made.&nbsp; My problem is, WLM doesn't always ask for a password, but just tries and
 fails, then gives me the error 3219 message.</p>

<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I initially set up the IMAP account to remember my regular Microsoft login password, but when it isn't accepted, I use a special app I get from Microsoft here:</p>

<p>
</p><p>There are messages in my Outbox that will not go out, even when my new messages do fly.&nbsp; I can't even delete them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right after I wrote for help, the problem seemed to have gone away, but then Windows Live Mail failed to send messages again.&nbsp; I'm now thinking that the server security requirements make it impossible to send mail without a fast connection speed.&nbsp; The DSL
 speed in our rural area varies.</p>

<p>That <em>DE</em> in the error code indicates a DeltaSync Error. Of course, you would only get a DeltaSync error if you were accessing a DeltaSync server, which I suspect the rest of the error message actually says:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://fud.community.services.support.microsoft.com/Fud/FileDownloadHandler.ashx?fid=d87c8345-ac0b-4101-936c-46ecbf18f5a3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3b5ab1ae-5782-41b4-870f-097c057bd032" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please confirm. If this is the case, it sounds as if you have set up your IMAP account but left the old HTTP account in place. When you send, the program is picking the old account to send with. In the message compose window, the
<em>From</em> dropdown will show both accounts, but they are indistinguishable:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8485336b-78c4-45fe-84b5-df8bc7c3d967" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8485336b-78c4-45fe-84b5-df8bc7c3d967" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The simplest way of dealing with this would be to remove the old account. Its folders shouldn't contain anything not present in the IMAP folders - but you should check first.</p>

<p>If you have messages in the outbox that can't be deleted, disconnect from the Internet to stop the program from trying to send them. You should then be able to&nbsp;remove them from the outbox.</p>

<p><br />
Hi</p>
<p>The Jump Lists are not folders.</p>
<p>Depending on the Pinned Program, you can drag and drop files or shortcuts onto the pinned icon to pin the item to a Jump List.</p>
<p>For instance, if you have Windows Explorer pinned to the Taskbar, you can drag a Folder&nbsp;to the pinned icon and hover it over the WE icon. You will a message "Pin to Explorer.exe".</p>
<p>If you have Internet Explorer pinned to the Taskbar, you can drag a website shortcut and pin it to that program. If you are viewing a website, you can also drag the Icon at the beginning of the Address Bar and pin it to the IE Icon.</p>
<p>If you have a program pinned to the Start Menu, you can click the Arrow at the right side of the pinned program to expand. In the Recent Items list, hover over an item and click the Pushpin Icon to pin the item to that programs pinned Jump List.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

                    <p>Never had this problem before. The only time Date Taken hasn't appeared in the past is when I edited a photo in Pixlr or, in some cases, opened a photo someone else had sent me. If I click on that line, I can enter the correct date (if I know it), but it
 automatically enters the time that I clicked on it! I also noticed that recent photos don't show the date-taken info when I pass my mouse over them, as they always have before.</p>

</p><p>Really hoping for an answer or two to my Oct. 11, 2018 question. Has anyone else suddenly lost "Date Taken" data from Windows Photo Viewer/Properties??? I also noticed that, when I save a photo from email to the Desktop or a folder, the automatic title for
 it if I don't name it now begins with "thumbnail_" then the image number, instead of just the image number (IMGA etc.). Could these changes be related to an update or such?? Thanks.</p>

<p>I appreciate your response, Nathan!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hadn't uploaded anything to One Drive in a while, so, after reading your question, I uploaded a photo I took on 11/15/18 to one of my existing One Drive folders, then clicked on the "Details" icon at top R to see what information was provided. Next to
 "Date Created," it showed today's date; however, it did at least show "11/15/18" under "Date Modified." I don't recall if that's how it has always categorized that information, or if it has changed, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then opened the image in Windows Photo Viewer, but there's still no information next to "Date taken" under File/Properties. I see a link to "Remove Properties and Personal Information" at the bottom of the Properties submenu; might doing that - assuming
 I can restore Properties afterward - bring back its original functions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

    <title>Xbox one says my nats open, but games says its not. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> retro link  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox one says my nats open, but games says its not.</h2>
                    
<p>Back when I first got my one I decided I wasn't going to put up with strict nat like I did with my 360 that I was going to try everything until I made my one open, and I thought I succeeded I made a static ip for my one and enabled dmz, from then on under
 my settings my one told me my nat was open, I could connect to my friends that had strict nat all of a sudden and it was awesome to finally know I don't have to put up with that anymore, but then I noticed some weird things it started off when I use to play
 COD Ghost with my friends it would say I had a strict nat but my one would say it was open, but I didn't believe it was strict because I was literally in a game with two of my friends that both had moderate and strict nat so if I had strict I wouldn't even
 be able to be in their party. So I just ignored that but then I started to have problems recently with the Destiny Beta, I would get on after choosing my character and every time a warning would come up and tell me my nat was strict and that it will degrade
 my experience.. I would join crucible matches and make it a quarter through the game until I would get kicked and it would give me the notification to troubleshoot my network, in free roam, the tower whenever I was with other people I always had the chance
 to get kicked out, and it confused me because every time I would check my nat and do the multiplayer diagnostic and hold lb, rb, rt, lt it would always show my nat information as being behind a cone nat which is good I thought. And Bungie was correct the issue
 I was having was degrading my experience because I never knew when I would get kicked when playing with random people, so I took it onto myself to again try to solve my issue. I thought instead of using DMZ I would disable it and just manually port forward
 my one, which I did.. And when I checked my nat status it still said I was open no change what so ever so I went back on destiny and got the same error message saying I had a strict nat, if my one thinks I have a cone nat when I don't how am I suppose to resolve
 this issue? I haven't really had issues connecting to servers or people in the past on my one since giving it a static ip and playing around with some settings until destiny, and like I said Ghost gave me the warning but even so I could connect to people that
 had strict nat when the game would say I had strict nat.</p>

<p>Activision games like Ghosts and destiny don't use the standard xbox live ports which is why the nat can be open on the dashboard but moderate or strict in the game.</p>
<p>When you play ghosts or destiny the game will use demonware port mapping to open required ports via UPnP.</p>
<p>Some routers dont seem to be compatible with demonware port mapping so the NATs in each game will be strict or moderate.</p>
<p>I had to stop using my bt homehub 5 router for this reason.</p>
<p>If your router is not compatible with demonware then you need to use port forwardin to open the nats.</p>
<p>COD ghosts requires port 3076 to get an open NAT.</p>
<p>Destiny beta seemed to require port 1200 and this may be true for the full game.</p>

<h3> gvrvighnesh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 task manager</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a brand new setup for hardware and installed windows 10 on it. From the day one onward including technical preview, i have observed some strange problems. My task manager will not update in a properly manner (Sync time 1 sec), CPU hits 100% when ever
 i open the task manager. And for other applications also it will hang for 10-15 sec whenever i launch an application. So many errors are there in my event log viewer, when i contacted Microsoft tech team to support they say it usually and nothing to worry
 about. Is this a regular issue that is happening to others also??</p>
<p><br />
I tried all the steps for sfc /scannow and dism tools and no errors popped out. Tried installing other user account, installed .Net framework etc stuff and all, still the problem remains. Any help would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response. To be more accurate I don't even know what went wrong because I have seen the same problem in windows 10 technical preview edition, I thought it might be fixed in the coming updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system is custom built and everything is brand new hardware, I've noticed this problem from day one, done all the checks, updates and walk troughs but no result. I can see a list of errors in my event viewer.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have run the memory diagnostic tool and it showed no errors (performed standard test type)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now when I performed that power shell command line it is saying "7 activities not shown" and gave me a error message. What does it mean actually?</p>

    <title>Removing link between PC account and Microsoft Account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ianmangion  say:</h3>
<h2>            Removing link between PC account and Microsoft Account</h2>
                    I am trying to remove the connection between my personal account on my PC and my Microsoft account. I clicked on "Manage my Microsoft&nbsp;account" in the account settings which took me to the Microsoft website where I can manage the said account. Here I found
 my device and attempted to remove it. After choosing to remove the PC, I was guided as follows:<br />
<br />
<p>&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>To Remove your Microsoft account from your device:</p>
<p>Go to&nbsp;<span>Settings&nbsp;</span>&gt;&nbsp;<span>Accounts</span>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<span>Your account</span></p>
<p>Tap or click&nbsp;<span>Disconnect my Microsoft account</span>, then restart the device&nbsp;</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I found two problems here.<br />
Firstly <span>"Your account"&nbsp;</span>does not exist in this path but instead&nbsp;<strong>"Your info"</strong> is present.<br />
And the second is that&nbsp;<span>"Disconnect my Microsoft account"</span> is nowhere to be found.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Can someone help me by providing a better guidance on how to remove this connection between my PC account and my Microsoft Account? I do not wish to delete my personal account since I have years of material and files in it which I do not want to lose.<br />

<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />Go to Accounts - Sign-in Options 
<br />Choose to sign in with a local account 
<br />(in newer versions of Windows 10, this might be on the Your Info Settings Page) 
<br />Enter your old password and enter a new password or leave it blank as appropriate 
<br />Close the Settings App

    <title>Winspool.drv error followed by various problems, System will no longer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> josh9961  say:</h3>
<h2>            Winspool.drv error followed by various problems, System will no longer boot properly.</h2>
                    I am running a 32-bit Vista Home Premium package. I installed a new game (Company of Heroes 2, but I doubt this has much relevance to my issues) and when I attempted to run the game, I was told my drivers were out of date and may be unsupported, so I downloaded
 and updated the drivers for my AMD Radeon HD 4850 (old I know, but I cannot currently afford an upgrade). I ran the game again and received the same message about drivers, but I pressed okay and the game started. I set up an online match with a friend, all
 the menu screens worked fine, but as soon as I loaded into the match itself, the screen went black and everything became unresponsive. I unplugged and reconnected my VGA to see if that fixed it, but my computer was frozen on a black screen, and would not respond
 to any keyboard or mouse input. I powered down the machine, and then powered it back on. It proceeded to boot normally, however upon reaching my desktop, all the .exe's that normally run on startup (Skype, Spotify, Steam, Realtek audio, etc.) gave me Not Responding
 messages. I spam clicked through close program and received an error message:&nbsp;
<div>"<b>C:\Windows\system32\WINSPOOL.DRV is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again
 using the original installation media or contact your system administrator or the software vendor for support."</b></div>
<div><b><br />
</b></div>
<div><font color="#000000"><span>I tried to close the message but it would reappear instantly until I'd closed it about seven or eight times. I searched online
 for a solution, and was told to rename the Winspool.drv to Winspool.drv.old, but every time I tried to do so, I was told I need permission to do so. My account is the Admin account and the only one on the PC, yet I still could not get permission to change
 the file.&nbsp;</span></font></div>
<div><font color="#000000"><span>I was told that booting it in safemode might allow me to either change Winspool.drv, or allow me to perform a system restore to before I updated the driver. I attempted to boot my pc
 in safe mode, however it failed, as the system freezes upon trying to load crcdisk.sys. I eventually shut the computer down after waiting about half an hour for it to progress with no result. I powered the machine back on, and Chkdsk wanted to run, so I let
 it, hoping it would fix something, but instead it started reeling of hundreds of lines of "Recovering orphaned file xxxxx into directory file xxxxx. It ran through this screen for around an hour, then completed Chdsk and the Loading Windows screen appeared,
 however the windows logo did not appear. After a couple of minutes the screen went completely black except for my cursor in the middle. I rebooted, but the same occured, it would get to loading windows then turn black with just my cursor on the screen. I tried
 using F8 to change to safe mode on startup but F8 now does nothing. I have no idea how to proceed because at the moment my PC is basically non functional. Can I recover everything? Is my hard drive failing?</span></font></div>

<p>Hello Marvin,</p>
<p>The attachment paperclip icon is not visible at all.</p>
<p>All email accounts such as gmail ECT</p>
<p>The missing item was PDF</p>
<p>Had a live chat with Microsoft and he remotely looked in my pc, his only explanation was to use outlook it is a better package.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All attachments appear in outlook</p>
<p>

<p>Hallo Neil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>this has been an issue since Windows 10 was launched.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is hundreds of peoply complaining about this as you can see here...</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/forum/livemail-email/mail-attachments-not-visible-in-the-windows-10/a70cc12a-d622-47e8-a6e1-500683b0336c</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft fix this!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I personally would recommand switching to mozilla thunderbird instead of buying ms outlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If someone sells you a car and this car comes without a steering wheel and he acts like nothing was missing you wouldn't buy a second car there, would you?</p>
<p>

            Hi<br />
<br />
"%ProgramFiles%\Windows Defender\MsAsCui.exe"<br />
<br />
Right click your icon - Properties - Shortcut Tab and compare your setting to the one above.<br />
<br />
That is the equivalent of :<br />
<br />
"C:\Program Files\Windows Defender\MSASCui.exe"'<br />
<br />
Note the space before P and the / slashes in yours.

<h2>            I am trying to add a HP 712C printer to my new Windows10 HP laptop</h2>
                    I am trying to add a HP 712C printer to my new Windows10 HP laptop.&nbsp; This same printer I have interfaced to another Windows7 laptop and is working fine.&nbsp; On the Windows7 machine I am using a HP720C driver into USB002.&nbsp; I have tried this driver on the Windows10
 machine as well as a HP710C driver (which is supposed to be very close to the HP712C printer).&nbsp; I have tried both drivers on USB001 and also USB002 per the Windows7 machine.&nbsp; Per the print status window, a print job shows the file printing and being complete,
 but nothing comes out of the printer.&nbsp; Need help!

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the information that you have provided, I suggest that you uninstall your printer drivers, and install the latest drivers form HP website. To&nbsp;do so follow the steps below</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;<span>Right click on the <strong>Start Menu </strong>and select <strong>
Device Manager</strong></span></li><li><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Double click and</span><span>&nbsp;expand the device</span></li><li><span>Right-click the device, and click<strong> Uninstall</strong>.</span></li><li><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Windows
 will prompt you to confirm the device’s removal. Click <strong>OK</strong> to remove the driver.</span></li><li><span>After the uninstallation is complete, reboot your computer.</span></li><li><span>After you have successfully uninstalled the driver, visit HP website, download the Windows 10 driver for your computer and check.</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>I would suggest you to perform clean boot and check if you able to download apps from Windows Store.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Place the computer in a clean boot state and then check if it helps. You can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of
 startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</p>

<h2>            Xbox 360 is Unformatted &#63; Help &#63;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p><span>Own - Xbox 360 S Halo Reach Edition</span></p>
<p><span>Problem - Hard drive is Unformatted</span></p>

<p><span>2 days ago - Playing Sleeping dogs and everything was fine, xbox started to be slow when joining parties with friends, comparing achievements, or attempting to go back to the dashboard. The lag and
 slowness began After I'd say maybe 4 - 5 hours of gaming and it wasn't but an hour of this until the game froze and I decided to reboot the system. Stopped in the white loading screen where is has the "Xbox Ball" and says "Xbox 360" for 20 minutes or so and
 I turned it off for the day thinking it could've just been overheated and needed rest.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Yesterday Morning - Console would not get past the same white "Xbox 360" logo screen after several attempts. ***NOTE*** i<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">t
 is not frozen the xbox ball logo is still moving slightly and after awhile it will go to the dashboard.. BUT... my profiles, games, music, apps, gamerscore, or hard drive are not there</span> and it is extremely upsetting. Heres the weird thing. - Unplugged
 my hard drive, power cord, moved my xbox (which was already ventilated) and hey* it worked, Signed on immediately erased all my Cache* because i was told to try that and it worked fine no lag, no slowness, perfect &nbsp;and played 3 or 4 different game over the
 span of at least 4 hours. Then it froze again. Same thing but removed my hard drive for the night and kept my xbox ventilated&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Today - Worked fine this morning, decided to buy/Download Batman Arkham Asylum onto my hard drive and at 28 % it froze and when i turned it off it is doing the unformatted shenanigans again. WHAT DO
 I DO???? Im at Attempt number what seems like 25 or so of trying to turn it on and my hard drive is just unformatted still but it takes sooooooooo long to get to the blank dashboard. so I'm really lost and i need to know that a large company such as microsoft
 cares about things like this. injury has lead me to be very limited in my usual physical activities for a few months so id really like to receive the pastime i pay for. I just bought so many games and would hate to lose all the work</span></p>
<p><span>Need professional advice please.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p><span>Questions/Concerns:</span></p>
<p><span>(please answer as many as possible to help me and the many others facing similar problems it has been so hard to find since you guys request we start a new thread for every person)</span></p>
<p><span>- Is my hard drive dead? I got this xbox when Halo reach was released and have had no problems besides the power chord dying.</span></p>
<p><span>- Am i going to lose all my saves data? -seriously would disappoint me if i lost years and years or gaming and that i just started going through Gears of war 1 on Insane</span></p>
<p><span>- As stated above the Batman Arkham asylum game, will i still have that if i needed a replacement hard drive</span></p>
<p><span>- Will microsoft reimburse for lost data that is out of my control. Im not talking about skins and guns but my time spent on your product?</span></p>
<p><span>- Will my gamerscore be protected regardless?</span></p>
<p><span><span>- Who do i contact for support and details on fixing the problem?</span></span></p>
<p><span>- How long would it take for my hard drive/xbox to be fixed and how much will it cost?</span></p>
<p><span>- Is it possible to purchase a new hard drive and transfer the data myself?</span></p>
<p><span>- Is there any other info i should know in general relating to this issue?</span></p>

<p><span>Thank you, and please respond in a respectful time frame, id really like this fixed and play the game I just bought from your marketplace.&nbsp;</span></p>


<p><span>**NOTES**</span></p>
<p><span>-xbox was purchased NEW in September of 2010 from Amazon dot com</span></p>
<p><span>- xbox is used on average daily, &nbsp;3 - 5 hours a day using various apps and games.. too many to list</span></p>
<p><span>-<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>NOTHING</strong></span>&nbsp;is modded or hacked.
</span></p>
<p><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>- NOTHING</strong></span> has anything been opened or tampered with&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>- Humidity and ventilation are not the errors nor has this xbox or hard drive ever been dropped, or even taken out besides the occasional freeze where i feel it proves to be beneficial to give it some
 air.</span></p>
<p><span><em><span>What should I do?</span></em></span></p>

<p>The hard drive should be fine, I got mine a year before Reach and it still works.</p>
<p>Going on with the hard drive being alright, your saves should be fine, but in order to safeguard these, should your xbox red ring, remove the hard drive immediately.</p>
<p>Hard drive should be fine, but the purchase will still be on your download history, so even if the hard drive is broken you can always download it again with no extra cost.</p>
<p>Your gamerscore is part of the Xbox Live Servers and will always be there no matter where you are, or what has happened on a console.</p>
<p>The rest of these can be answered by Microsoft, you can contact their customer service at (800) 469-9269. Their hours are 6am-10pm Pacific Time.</p>

<p>Do you have access to another 360 that you can try your HDD in to see if their console mentions that the drive is unformatted?</p>
<p>If you do and you can access your data you could move your saves to the cloud storage/a USB device before formatting the HDD and copying your saves back to the HDD after.
</p>
<p>If you find another console also says the drive is unformatted then that is another more serious issue when it comes to your save games.</p>
<p>Any downloaded content including Batman will be available through your Download History available for download again when you have a new HDD/formatted HDD.</p>
<p>If you bought another HDD you could try to transfer the content using a transfer cable or try to get the existing HDD to work long enough to copy your saves to the cloud storage or USB drive.</p>

<p>No, i don't have another 360. My only friend that lives near me and has a 360 uses the older model, not the S. I also called local gamestops to see if they would let me test my hard drive however they don't have any for me to try.</p>

<p>yeah... HDD died. just dead doesn't read at all due to "corrupt data" what could've caused this? I'm very cautious. don't quit during saved games or anything. Had to format and it is still saying unformatted as soon as i download my gamer tag. very upsetting,
 gaming lost its appeal greatly in my eyes. so much skyrim/minecraft data gone</p>

    <title>Cannot change Windows 10 Family settings - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smauggy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot change Windows 10 Family settings</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Since yesterday I noticed that Family Safety is not working anymore as expected.</p>
<p>No activity is reported on the website since few days. I do not receive anymore an email when my son asks for more time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All my current settings are still active on my son account, but when I change them on Family website, they are not applied on the computer. I need to edit the Screen time limits but nothing changed on the computer. I tried to disable Screen time restrictions,
 still nothing. I also tried to remove my son from the family and add him again, the same for the computer. No way to get the settings being applied on the computer (Windows 10 Pro French 64bits version 1511 build 10586.76).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

<p>My settings are applying again as expected on the PC. Do not know what happened, There should be a way to force syncing settings.</p>

    <title>Microsoft basic display adapter missing &#47; No brightness slider - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microsoft basic display adapter missing &#47; No brightness slider</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a desktop computer with a MSI monitor a week ago and I realized that the Basic Display Adapter does not appear in the device manager, instead I only have the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I might be wrong but I think that is the reason why the brightness slider is missing from the Display Settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any chance of installing the driver manually?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            Hey ramonezzz,
<br />
<br />That's wrong, the Basic Display Adapter is a fallback driver when your graphics device (in this case, the NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1080) is not working, your graphics drivers seem to have been installed correctly.
<br />
<br />Look for any drivers or software that pertains to the backlight/brightness control on MSI's support site. If you need any further assistance with this, please let me know.
<br />
<br />Good luck, I hope this helps.       
        </p>

            Hi Ramon.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Basic Display driver is only a placeholder driver which does not support good resolution or Sleep/Hibernate.  It is only meant to be there until you can get the actual Display driver installed, or if it 's really old hardware may be the only one to use even though it's undesirable.  
<br />
<br />Update the Display driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers.   There are even more steps here for Updating a driver including tracing the hardware on unknown devices:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/updating-a-driver/a5e6345e-af9b-4099-bef0-8d22254aa1c1">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If you still don't have the brightness slider in System Settings go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Check if you have brightness slider(s) in Settings &gt; System &gt; Power Options, then Additional Settings, then Change Plan Settings.  This slider is also dependent upon display driver.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi!<br /><br />The following are some tricks from another users:<br /><br />I ran the trouble shoot and it didn't fix either at first. So I double clicked on the laptop&gt;hardware tab&gt; AMD Radeon (it had the look at me! sign by it). While inside AMD go to the driver tab and then update. This should update the driver and fix that problem. Ran TS again this time it fixed the StorLib bus and said AMD was fixed too. BUT the Generic Pnp computer was now disabled and needed to be enabled. Following the prompts, it fixed that and with a quick test of my brightness that was fixed too! Now all the places that should have had the brightness settings visible do, finally!<br /><br />Right click on your home page and click on the "Graphic Properties..."<br />After You're in the app<br />Click the "Display" button and click the "color settings"<br />and BOOM!<br />control your brightness,contrast and gamma<br /><br />You can see more options here <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/wi

<p>Hi&nbsp;<span>ramonezzz,</span></p>
<p><span>Try right-clicking on an unoccupied area of the desktop then from the context menu look for and select the NVidia Control Panel (or similar) entry, if there. You may be able to then select to control the display settings from there.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps and Good Luck!</span></p>

<h2>            windows update won&#39;t scan &#40;windows 7&#41;....says service is not running but it is</h2>
                    <p>I just got my laptop from service (they replaced a new hard drive and installed windows 7). It is a Sony Vaio ....i own it now but it's a slightly used rent-to-own type of deal so no windows dvd or system restore or anything.</p>
<p><br />
They supposedly restored my computer to factory setting but I can't update my computer.
<br />
<br />
The bar to the left is red and i see a red shield with a white x and it says most recent checks for updates: never<br />
<br />
updates were installed: never<br />
<br />
i go to installed programs and nothing has been installed since early 2010. <br />
<br />
It's like whenever i try to click check for updates button it's like something is blocking it from connecting and scanning is the best way I can explain it. I desperately need help to update all my software and security patches etc</p>
<p>I found something online where it says to type services.msc and stop it and go to c/windows/softwaredistribution and delete the files and then start the service so then ....</p>
<p>windows updates still&nbsp;won't scan (windows 7)....says service is not running but it is.

<h2>            Dell Personal J740 Inkjet Printer</h2>
                    Can I download a printer driver to my new laptop with Windows 7 for this printer? &nbsp;Is it compatible with Dell Personal J740 Inkjet Printer. &nbsp;Do I need to buy a new printer? &nbsp;I actually printed from my old laptop (Windows XP) remotely. &nbsp;My printer is attached
 to my desktop upstairs which has a router. &nbsp;So maybe the printer driver should be loaded on the desktop instead of the new laptop. &nbsp;When I try to print from new laptop, it seems to be finding the location but the meassage I get is a printer driver for Windows
 7 needs to be downloaded. &nbsp;

<h2>            Re-linking Child Account to Parent Account</h2>
                    
<p>Hi forum - first post here.</p>
<p>Lately my 12 year old son has been unable to access Fifa Ultimate Team (FIFA14) play via Xbox Live.&nbsp; Browsing the EA Sports forums suggested that there was an age restriction that might be blocking him.&nbsp; Whilst I was trying to investigate whether or not
 this was the case I stupidly disabled my Xbox 360 account (parent) from being able to control my son's (child) Xbox settings.&nbsp; I don't know how to reverse this.&nbsp; Now my son is unable to access Xbox Live at all - when he attempts to connect to Xbox Live the
 message appears that the Parent Account details are invalid.&nbsp; I've spent a day trying to sort it out but had no joy.&nbsp; Given the amount of game information associated with my son's account I'm loathe to just create a new one and have him start from scratch.&nbsp;
 I don't mind creating a new parent account if that is any use as I don't really have any saved data that matters to me.&nbsp; Any advice other than not to mess where I shouldn't have.&nbsp; I do think a stronger warning was in order - like "Disabling this will bork
 your kid's access to Xbox Live and earn you no end of grief from the annoyed offspring".</p>
<p>Suggestions greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Well... I continued to hear nothing and made no progress of my own so I decided to delete my son's account and start from scratch. &nbsp;Intruigingly I could not cancel the automatic renewal of the Gold subscription (just kept triggering a server error) so I
 contacted XBox Support again to ask them to do it. &nbsp;The Support Analyst (Jay) was excellent and whilst we discussed my request I filled him in on the back story. &nbsp;It turns out that the first analyst had made a bit of a mess of my email address, so that's why
 I never heard anything after my first call. &nbsp;We discussed options and I decided to give it another go. &nbsp;Delighted that less than 10 days after the second call not only is my son's account linked to mine again, it also seems to have thrown off it's problem
 with EA Sports so he is currently glued to the XBox just as he should be. &nbsp;Kudos to MS XBox Support (and Jay).</p>

            <p>Could you confirm that error code? &nbsp; Should it be 1-80004005? &nbsp; If it is what you had given, then go to your Event Viewer (right click on Window icon and select Event Viewer. &nbsp; Then go to Custom Views &gt; Admin. Events and give it time to populate the window).
 &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Double click on that Error and give the details (including Event ID and Faulting Module, etc.) for code 1-80005004? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
