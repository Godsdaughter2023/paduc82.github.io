<h2>            Canadian Xbox One</h2>
                    <p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm living in Canada for the moment and I really want to buy an Xbox One.<br />
My question is :<br />
If I move to Europe (France) can I still continue to use my console ? Could I still use the game I bought online ? Technically, is the console will work ?<br />

    <title>Is there a wifi blocking option&#63; Please help &#33;&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Is there a wifi blocking option&#63; Please help &#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>Here is something going on in my area, please help. <br />
We have some wifi addresses around my house that flicker up and down and time to time popup in my laptop connecting my laptop without my permission. They steal my mobile data when I am connected to my mobile hotspot. They always keep poping up and connecting
 my computer even when I don't use any wifi. I am unable to block these unnecessary wifi in my windows 10. I do not want to even see them in my wifi showing lists, nor do I want them to enter to my laptop. So, I want to totally block them. The Forget password
 button can only help me remove the wifi address I had used before, but I can't block these wifis addresses that I was never connected. Please help.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>They hack me using their wifi routers and I need to block these wifi addresses. I don't see any option to block all these wifis routers not to enter, pop up or connect in my laptop. There must be an option somewhere to block all these wifis so that I can
 peacefully use my laptop with my own wifi/hotspot only. I mean I want it to be active only for my wifi and not other wifis. Please, help me to block all other wifis. How?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Thank you</p>
<p>

            Hello,
<br />
<br />IMO, there is no WiFi blocking option currently available. Although, you can forget known WiFi networks for sure:

            Is your router using the default SSID &amp; passphrase? If so then the first thing to do is visit the router’s homepage &amp; change them. However if the same wifi connections are appearing when on mobile hotspot that default passphrase may require changing too - this however is easy.
<br />If you have already changed everything then you may have malware.
<br />Download &amp; run MalwareBytes, ADWCleaner &amp; Eset’s online scanner &amp; post back with the results.

<p><span>Can i take the hard disk out and connect it to another system and running a registry repair tool on the specified partition will fix my problem?</span></p>
<p><span>You can’t perform this operation because it is risky and the system might become unresponsive. Moreover, you need to have a bootable operating
 system disk to perform this operation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As of now, I would suggest you to try the steps mentioned below.</span></p>

<h2>            Help&#33; getting 80070057 when trying to recover account</h2>
                    
<p>I have been trying to recover my account onto my xbox for 24 hours now. Any time that I try and do this i am getting error 80070057. I can log onto the web site (as you can see), but it is showing that I have 0 friends on my list, and all of my messages
 are gone. On top of this my xbox SmartGlass app will not load my account. I have recovered a friends account on my xbox for troubleshooting it and worked fine. I have also talked to some from xbox support in chat for over an hour and all I got from him is
 to call in for help. After i called in, and had a 2 hour talk with an againt she just had me do everything the chat againt had me do, (this againt didn't even know what SmartGlass was). Is any one else haveing this same issue or have you had it in the past?
 Any one know any tricks that I can try. Thanks for any help</p>

<p>No this did not answer my question. please reread my post. if it was an issue with the cache on my system or and iss with the xbox itself, I would not be able to load any other account, or would i be having an issue when looking at my account on the website
 or with the smartglass App. That support chat and typng this is about all i can do on the site. all my friends are missing and messages are missing. my gamer score is there but that is it. So basically if you are going to give me steps to remove cache, or
 reinstall the update that was sent out last week, or try loading it on another xbox do bother responding it have tried all of this and I get the same error everytime. The password is correct, aii know this because i tried with the incorrect one and got &nbsp;a
 different message.</p>

<p>sure thank you</p>
<p>1) first I was having an issue getting my account online so I checked on my billing on xbox.com and say that my account was good until 02/2014.</p>
<p>2) I removed the cache from my HDD and tried again, still unable to get the account on line. I then chck my connection and I am hard wired right to my modem and I was able to connect the console to xbox live.
</p>
<p>3) I removed the account from my HDD and tried to recover ( redowload) the account to the console and after entering in the correct password I got a message that states " We are unable to recover any accounts at this time 80070057"</p>
<p>4) I then tried to recover my girlfriends account to my xbox and with no trouble at all it loaded in.</p>
<p>5) I talk to support chat on xbox.com, all the had me do was remove the cache again. I did do it and same results. And he then sent me a link to a site that stated that the error code is for one of 2 things. 1) billing issue or 2) issue downloading a video.</p>
<p>6)24 hour later I called in to 1-800-4myxbox and this person had me remove the cache again 3 times and try again with the same results, after this she told me how to remove the latest update and reload it. after trying again same issue. I informed that I
 am have no issue load other account on the xbox and that if it was an issue with the xbox I would not be able to load any other account on to it.</p>
<p>7) just to prove her wrong I got my girlfriends xbox and tried loading my account with the same issue. and then put her's back on her xbox with no problem.
</p>
<p>8) I then told her that I was have an issue logging into the xbox smartglass App on my phone and her response was " is that an official xbox App?" and told me that she reviewed my error code and this is an issue with loading a video. nd that there is an
 issue with my xbox. she ended the call and I am here now</p>

    <title>How to reinstall correct drivers after uninstalling them for an Apple - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to reinstall correct drivers after uninstalling them for an Apple Magic Mouse</h2>
                    <p>Hello Microsoft Community, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I was trying to find a way to install the Apple drivers for Magic Mouses so that I could use the scroll function like on a Mac. So the mouse functioned properly with right and left clicks but the scroll didn't work. And when I installed the Driver, it kept
 saying it failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Out of frustration I uninstalled all the existing device drivers and since then my mouse would not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I tried Restoring a Restore Point and it failed to return the uninstalled drivers.</p>
<p>- I tried reinstalling the Drivers from Apple Support to no avail.</p>
<p>- I tried Going to Samsumg Support to download all the latest drivers and it did not help (Samsung is my Computer's brand).</p>
<p>- I tried removing the device and reconnecting it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what happens at this point:</p>
<p>
</p><p>So to test whether this device works, I remove and then reconnect the device through [Add device] from [Control Panel]. After doing so, my bluetooth detects it and starts installing drivers. Normally once this stage is complete, my Apple Bluetooth Mouse
 would be connected and work. Now it does not work despite installing device drivers. There is a yellow triangle sign on the mouse icon. I click [Troubleshoot] and at first it says the device's driver had not been installed. Upon trying to installing it online
 or through Apple BootCamp drivers, both say it failed. The troubleshooter directs the problem to be at the HID.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So naturally I went to the [Device Manager] &gt; [Human Interface Devices] and found the yellow triangle sign on one of them. When I tried to update it again, it suddenly moved to [Other Devices] and was called [Unknown Devices].</p>
<p>
</p><p>The biggest clues given by the Troubleshooter were 2 such points:</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Unnecessary applications running on the background may affect your computer components and their drivers. To troubleshoot the issue, we suggest performing a clean boot in Windows 8 and check if your device/driver will work properly after running Windows
 8 on its basic functionality. To do this, simply follow the steps in this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>.</p>

            Hi. I tried rebooting at least 20 times now and it still didn't work. I really don't work to reinstall windows. The biggest annoyance is that the mouse works on the other accounts but does not work for this account. The driver first of all would not install.
 Secondly, there are at least 5 different errors everytime I change something so I cannot tell what the actual trouble is. Thanks for your advices...

<p>Hello! Thank you Jeff Ore for your help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the issue with this:<br />
</p>
<p>In a correctly set-up normal Apple Mouse, there are 4 components (Seen in General&gt;Hardware)</p>
<p>- Apple Magic Mouse</p>
<p>- Bluetooth HID Device</p>
<p>- Device Identification Service</p>
<p>- HID-compliant mouse</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where I messed up was that I tried to replace Bluetooth HID Device with the Apple Mouse driver which ended up not working. So thanks for all the help I found out the self-made problem after 2 days worth of effort... heh...</p>
<p>
</p><p>SO basically if anyone has this error, </p>
<p>just go to View Devices/Printers &gt; Double click on the Mouse icon for Apple &gt; Switch General to Hardware on the top bar &gt; Double click on Bluetooth Peripheral Device/Unknown Device &gt; Use Admin Access to Change Settings &gt; Click on Driver top bar from General
 &gt; Click Update Driver &gt; Browse my computer &gt; Let me pick from a list of ... &gt; Tick "Show compatible hardware" and select Bluetooth HID Device!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 - Plugged in but not charging</h2>
                    Hello, I am having an issues that it seems MANY people have also had. My Surface Pro 3 only works when plugged in and when I remove AC power, it shuts off immediately. It reads "0% available (plugged in, not charging)." I have read countless threads on
 with this issues and I have tried all of the fixes. I know that I am late to troubleshooting thread(s) but this seems to have happened after an update. I just powered up my Surface after a while of not using it. Has there been a fix issued for this? I see
 the other threads have be locked for sine reason. Running Windows 10&nbsp;

</p><p class="contentStandard"><span><span><strong>Method 1</strong>: Windows Updates.</span></span></p>

</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>First, shutdown your Surface and then try disconnecting all external devices from your Surface like Surface case, keyboard cover, anything from the USB ports, and any micro SD card.</span></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>Once you have disconnected all the external devices, turn on your Surface and see if you are able to charge the Surface and try connecting each external device.</span></p>

</p><p class="contentStandard"><span><span><strong>Step 1</strong>: Click on the <strong>
Start Menu</strong> and search for <strong>Device Manager</strong> and open <strong>
Device Manager</strong>.</span></span></p>
<strong>Battery</strong> and <strong>Uninstall</strong> all the drivers under Battery section.</span></span></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span><span><strong>Method 4</strong>: Check the Power Adapter and the Wall Plug.</span></span></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>Take a look at the Wall Plug and try changing the Wall Plug because sometimes it is possible for a low-voltage condition to be present where power is flowing, but not as much as there should be.</span></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span><span>Also, check the Power Adapter cord is firmly seated and also try flipping the power connector upside down because it is possible that there’s some invisible damage to the connector and only one side is working. Once
 you flip it over, wait for 10 to 15 minutes and see if it starts charging.</span></span></p>
</p><p class="contentStandard"><span>Hope it helps.</span></p>

<p>Hello and thanks for the reply. I have cycled through all of the methods and I am still having the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;To answer your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>This seemed to connect with an update that I did to windows. I think it was going from 8.1 to Windows 10.
</li><li>I am not sure which update as I have been running updates as they have come, but the issues persist with each update. The most recent update I have to windows was on 7/03/18.</li><li>I have Windows Pro, Version 1803.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing to note is that there is an alert in device manager next to the Surface Pro UEFI, but this will not update b/c I have 0% battery power.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise as I am extremely frustrated by this issue. I love this device and it's almost useless without portability. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello again Shafeeq and thanks for your reply. I have went through the troubleshooting notes and have tried everything. One of the major issues is that at least one of the updates will not install b/c my battery percentage is at 0% and needs to be at at
 least 40%. I am note sure if this firmware update will even solve the problem. I am aware that many others have had this issue and while I am no longer under warranty, this is clearly an issue with Microsoft and either the software or the hardware (battery).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if I have other options. Thanks again for all your help! </p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting the query on Microsoft Community. I am sorry to know that you are facing issues with Windows 10.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I do appreciate your efforts and time, and will assist you with the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>FM20.DLL is a type of </span><strong><span>DLL file</span></strong><span> associated with MSDN Disc 8 developed by Microsoft for the Windows Operating System. The latest known version of FM20.DLL is 1.0.0.0, which was produced for Windows. This
 DLL file carries a popularity rating of 1 stars and a security rating of "UNKNOWN".</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Because they are shared files, DLL files exist outside of the software application itself. Although this provides many benefits for software developers, this separation also provides an opportunity for problems to occur.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The most common FM20.DLL errors that can appear on a Windows-based computer are:</span></span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong><span>"FM20.DLL not found."</span></strong></p>
</li><li>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong><span>"FM20.DLL Access Violation."</span></strong></p>
</li><li>

</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong><span>"This application failed to start because FM20.DLL was not found. Re-installing the application may fix this problem."</span></strong></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>These DLL error messages can appear during program installation, while a FM20.DLL-related software program (eg. MSDN Disc 8) is running, during Windows startup or shutdown, or even during the installation of the Windows operating
 system. Keeping track of when and where your FM20.DLL error occurs is a critical piece of information in troubleshooting the problem.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Manually Register FM20.DLL Using Microsoft Register Server.</span></span></strong></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p><span><span>When you install software that uses the FM20.DLL dependency, the software should automatically register the file for you. In some cases your DLL file may not register properly, and as a result, will provide a "FM20.DLL not registered" error.
 Fortunately, you can use a built-in utility called "Microsoft Register Server" (regsvr32.exe) to re-register your FM20.DLL file.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Surface Laptop 2 BSOD&#58; whea_uncorrectable_error</h2>
                    <div>I'm incredibly frustrated right now. My brand new SL2 has been BSODing all morning despite running fine since it arrived 2 days ago.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I read about the memory leak issue and disabled the ambient light sensor driver in device manager. I downloaded the latest firmware straight from Microsoft and installed. While these have helped, the issue persists. And it must not be memory leak as there
 is no issue with non-paged pool memory.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I can tell the laptop is about to crash as the fans instantly go full speed. The crashes sometimes are caused/triggered by plugging into my dock and 2nd monitor. Sometimes BSODs within 30 seconds of booting, sometimes it's after using the computer for
 10 minutes problem free.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>BSOD error is whea_uncorrectable_error. BlueScreenView pointed to hal.dll and ntoskrnl.exe as the culprits...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>All that is running is OneDrive, Dropbox, Slack, Skype, Adobe CC, Office, and Chrome.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I did update to 1809 overnight. Everything else is up to date to my knowledge. The computer just passed Intel's Processor Diagnostic Tool no problem.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thoughts?</div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
1. Which version of operating system are you using on the computer?<br />
2. Are you using Internet Explorer or any other third party browser to watch videos online?
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1:<br />
</strong>You may run the fix it provided in the link and check.<br />
Playing video files crashes or freezes Internet Explorer - Windows<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/video_freezes_or_crashes/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/video_freezes_or_crashes/en-us</a></div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>You may also try the steps from the knowledge base article provided if you are using Internet explorer.<br />

<div><br />
<strong>Method 3:<br />
</strong>If the issue still persists then I would also suggest you before installing Adobe flash player on the system; make sure that all the previous versions of Adobe flash player have been uninstalled from the system. Download the utility from the website
 mentioned below, install it and run it on the system.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Uninstall Flash Player<br />

&nbsp;<br />
Once you have done uninstalling Adobe then try to download Adobe Flash player form the Adobe website. Check the link mentioned below.<br />

            Hi Paulie.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Can you get into Safe Mode with Networking, or Safe Mode:  <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-safe-mode-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.digitalcitizen.life/4-ways-boot-saf...</a>? 
<br />
<br />If so in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, choose the problem devices and Roll back the drivers.  If unavailable then Uninstall the drivers, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver. 
<br />
<br />If this doesn't help then System Restore to a point before the Update:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If no Safe Mode access Repair Mode by whatever method works here to run System Restore:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>.
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />  If this is Fall Creators Update Version 1709, which you can check at Settings&gt;System&gt;About, you can also roll it back at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery, then hide it using the same tool above until it matures.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />
<br />    Dism /Image:D:\ /Get-Packages
<br />
<br />    Find the package(s) that were just installed by date. Run the following command on the last installed package:
<br />
<br />    example: dism.exe /image:d:\ /remove-package /packagename:Package_for_KB4014329~31bf3856ad364e35~amd64~~10.0.1.0
<br />
<br />    Reboot.
<br />
<br />Check if your mouse and keyboard start working again.
<br />
<br />If they do, block the update.
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:

<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes.

            Yeah, I have the same problem and I can tell you that it ruined a good part of my day at the office.&nbsp; Did any body feel the same way that I do that Microsoft does not make me happy.
