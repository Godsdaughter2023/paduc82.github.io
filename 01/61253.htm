<h2>            Acer wifi disconnecting</h2>
                    I have a windows10 acer aspire E15 and my wifi (wireless) that's 20meters away keeps disconnecting. Then you have to wait ages for the laptop to re-connect, pressing connect does nothing. It's really annoying and crashes every 10 minutes and I can't download
 any updates because it disconnects so much and takes ages to re-connect. My knowledge of computers is terrible so please help. Thanks

<h2>            Windows 10 - After reboot profile is empty &#38; only Mouse works</h2>
                    <p>Hi there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just rebooted my PC after problems with it booting up. Once i get to the profile screen after longer then normal and try to log in, which is taking longer then normal as well. I get into a profile where all i can see is the wallpaper my Mouse and the windows
 button, search icon and that tab view icon. I can only presse ctrl-alt-del. But that only Let's me log out or reboot, I can not open task manager. No windows commands work, i can not open the windows bar and the Mouse cursor has a Constant loading ring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have tried.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>I tried to reboot into safe mode with and without networking they all have the same errors as when I log in normally and have no way to interact with the os.&nbsp;</li><li>I have rebooted from a windows 10 USB tool, tried to run sfc and chkdsk. Neither of them have shown any errors.&nbsp;</li><li>I have tried system restore but the system gave me an error with my disk. After which i re did the chkdsk and sfc, with no errors.&nbsp;</li><li>I tried to reset the pc just keeping my files. The process completes and boots to the user profile and I have the exact same issue as the first time i log the profile.&nbsp;</li></ol>
<p>Could it be a virus of some type or could it be some type of disk failure ?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anything else i can try that doesn't involve a full reformat?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If i had an extra HD on hand i would just boot it up on that and copy the files over then check the drive where the os has been installed but all the toys are at work.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 et lecteur dvd qui ne fonctionne plus &#40;dvd don&#39;t work with windows 10 update&#41;</h2>
                    <p>tout dernièrement j'ai remarqué qu'aucun périphérique fonctionnait (imprimante, graveur dvd) sur mon ordinateur portable. J'ai réussi a downloader les drivers de l'imprimante après plusieurs difficultés. Impossible d'utiliser mon graveur dvd cependant. J'ai
 fait comme expliqué partout, y compris par le monsieur de chez asus (modèle de mon ordi) c'est a dire désinstallé le périphérique et éteindre mon ordi pour le rallumer, chercher des drivers en ligne et aller dans panneau de configuration pour scanner les problèmes
 de périphérique et les résoudres, mais lorsque je rallume l'ordi et met un dvd dans le graveur lecteur, le sablier apparait, le disque tourne. puis plus rien...quoi faire svp?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking for dvd drivers or something that could make windows 10 recognize my dvd player...I uninstall it and close windows, but when i restart it, nothing... Some suggestions?</p>

<h2>            devices and printers list</h2>
                    <p>Because I had to buy a new printer, I wanted to uninstall my old printer. &nbsp;When I went to Control Panel &gt; Devices and Printers, I found a number of devices listed as "multimedia devices" and most of them I do not recognize. &nbsp;They all have a musical note
 icon on them, and many of them have what appears to be an email address listed next to a device name. &nbsp;I do not recognize any of the email addresses or device names.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea what these multimedia device names are and whether I can safely delete them? &nbsp;There are 30-some of these.</p>

            <p>I have run the Malwarebytes scan - nothing found. The Defender is still switched off and I can't&nbsp;turn it&nbsp;on - shows to be out of date. When I looked for Defender in my search box I found the following file: RemoveWare.ini</p>
<p>Does this mean someone has removed Defender from my PC. If so, how can I re-install it?</p>

That's<br />good, not bad. Not only is there potential conflict, but there's no<br />reason to have both; they all essentially have something very similar<br />to Defender built into them, and running both at once will hurt your<br />performance and create the risk of problems as they conflict with each<br />other.</p><p>Ken Blake, Microsoft MVP</p>

<p>Yes, I have Miscrosoft Security Essentials but because I could see the Defender was switched off I had real concerns. MS Essentails has worked well for me for over 3 years so I will leave well alone.</p>

<p>Hi LeiJiang2,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We noticed that your thread is idle for quite some time now. May we know if you still need assistance in finding what you called the device ID. Just to clarify, may we know what are you trying to do? Are you trying to activate a Windows 7 using a product
 key?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your response will be highly appreciated for us to sort things out.</p>
<p>

<p>You can delete photos by going into Windows Explorer, select the folder with your photos in and select the ones you want to delete.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Once you have selected the files hit the delete button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also open Photos and if you hover your mouse pointer on a photo a box will show in the top right hand corner of the photo, select and then delete.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not want to delete the photos go into Windows Explorer and move them to a USB memory stick.</p>

    <title>27 GB Space Disk with Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            27 GB Space Disk with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>As the subject says i bought a notebook with windows 10. Problem is that i have no more money to spend on technology. So i bought the cheapest i could. The notebook i bought has 27 GB Storage space and Windows 10 every single day since i bought it asks me
 to keep updating and updating and updating and it never ends. I Do NOT have storage space for these abnormaly 10 15 20 GB UPDATES. I Have a storage disk of 27 GB wich currently Windows 10 is using 21 GB Free Space of 4 GB, Im only using 2 GB FOR MYSELF. ABSURD.
 If i store a MB more windows bothers every restart telling me to Free Space disk. Its hilarious. So .. Right now i would like to erase, delete, eliminate, anihilite, oblive Windows 10. I tried to STOP for ever the windows 10 Updates but it keeps comming up.
 Like a f... Terminator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i first bought the computer a month later Windows 10 almost harrassed me every single hour to update to Windows 10 Creators Update. I just couldnt find any sort of way to eliminate this threat. So i had no choice but to buy a 64 GB memory card and update
 the Windows 10 without me wanting it. But Windows 10 needed to. I didnt know at the time i would loose everything on my computer. The only warning i had which i didnt see was a tiny tiny tiny tiny tiny sentence at the end of the installation. Like Windows
 10 was trying to troll me, that i would loose everything. After 5 pages of reading of how wonderful Windows 10 Creators update will be and the very end of the installation i didnt read that last sentence could i just wanted to FINISH THIS that i didnt want
 in the very first place and keep working. But Hey .. The Windows 10 Creator update was finally installed. Safe and Sound, Clean Disk ofc... Thnx Win 10. 10 out of 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As i said i bought this computer with windows 10 included. So its impossible to reset the computer to Windows 8.1 or Win 7. I prefer 8.1. I already did the backup. LOL 2GB.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So .... After going through hell and back through hell and back with Windows 10. It keeps asking me for more and more updates. And these updated are not 500 mb or 1 gb are 10 - 15 GB Updates!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So ... Does anyone have any clue how i could delete forever Windows 10. I dont want to hear about Windows 10 for the rest of my life. I bought a computer i dont use Internet much often so i dont care about viruses or malwares. I just go to the office bring
 work to home and work for about 2 to 3 hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Summary: I want to delete Windows 10 and install Windows 8.1 or 7 .. I dont care which i just dont want to be bothered ever again with 15 GB updates anymore.</p>

<p>30 GBytes is grossly insufficient for Windows 10. 250 GBytes would be reasonable, 500 GBytes would be good. I fail to understand why manufacturers sell such crippled machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead of loading Windows 7 or 8, you could stay with Windows 10 but disable all updates. Doing so requires a small amount of technical expertise. However, it would also disable your virus scanner updates. You would lose your defences against new viruses.<br />

            The laptop is likely designed to run only Windows 10, especially if it was bought within the laptop last year. There is likely the chance it might though. 
<br />
<br />What is the make and model of the laptop?
<br />
<br />Windows Update is likely attempting to install another feature update. 
<br />
<br />When it comes to low capacity drives, your are options are the following:
<br />
<br />Step 1: Free up space on the drive:

<br />
<br />See the infographic for steps what you should do with the ISO file and an external drive.
<br />
<br />Note, if the local drive where Windows is currently installed does not have enough space to download the ISO file, do the following.
<br />
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer with enough space.
<br />
<br />Connect your external drive to that working computer.
<br />
<br />Download and save the ISO from that working computer to your external drive.
<br />
<br />Reconnect the external drive to the target computer.
<br />
<br />Open the ISO file from the external drive.
<br />
<br />Start setup it should let you select the external drive.<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/dfef3c3a-5443-4865-913e-076d50439dfc?upload=true" />

            <pre>Also, here are some tips for freeing up space:
Problem 1: Lack of free space.
Press Windows key + R
Type: C:\Windows\Logs\CBS
Hit Enter
Delete any log files found in that folder.
Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage
Under Storage sense, click Free up space now
Wait while it scans for temporary files.
Check any location with large amounts of space.
Click Remove files.
Also see how you can use TreeSize to find and free up space:
https://www.groovypost.com/howto/map-hardrive-usage-find-hidden-files-windows-10-treesize-freeware/
Search through any folders that might be on your desktop that might be taking up space. 
Options for freeing up space:
Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space inaddition to improving overall system performace.
Having enough disk space is especially important if you are performing task such as upgrading to the new Windows 10. It is one of the the first things Windows setup checks before it starts copying files. Large programs too will often require that you have enough disk space available.
Lets start.
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
Then hit Enter
Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
Location/Type 	Description 	Safe to Delete
Downloaded Program Files 	Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. 	YES
Temporary Internet Files 	The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster. 	Keep It
Offline Webpages 	Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. 	Keep It
Recycle Bin 	The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. 	YES
Temporary files 	Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you don’t want to redownload it every time. 	YES
Thumbnails 	Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I don’t see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. 	YES
Debug Dump Files 	When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. 	Keep It
System error memory dump files 	Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur in Windows. 	Keep It
 The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from previous version of Windows 10 or clean install, Windows 10 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.
http://notebooks.com/2010/11/09/how-to-recover-documents-music-and-email-after-upgrading-with-the-windows-old-folder/
Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
System Restore – System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 10. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of  disk space to keep System Restore Points.
Configuring System Protection settings
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated. 
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file. 
Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn’t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It’s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.
There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.

            That indicates that there's something really wrong with your installation. There shouldn't normally be more than a handful of these files in the store folder. Each time a transaction takes place in the program - a message is received or sent or read or
 moved, for example - the transaction is recorded in a file called edb.log. Whenever&nbsp;the&nbsp;edb.log file grows beyond 2MB, its name is changed by adding a serial number and a new edb.log file is taken into use. In quiet moments, these log files are replayed and
 the details of the transactions written to the main message database file (Mail.MSMessageStore). As the transactions recorded are written to the database, the log file is deleted. When Windows Live Mail is closed down, the program finishes replaying current
 log files and updates the check file.<br />
<br />
Since this problem has clearly been going on for some considerable time, it's not certain that it can be remedied. I would have expected to see very poor program performance - have you not noticed? Why are you still using a version of the program released in
 2010?<br />
<br />
Repair will involve using database management tools in an administrator command window. Are you prepared to give that a go? It will be a complex and possibly frustrating exercise, but with any luck we can get those orphan log files replayed and your database
 back to a more normal situation.

            Thanks for the comments.&nbsp; Not my machine actually but one I was working on for a friend.&nbsp; Poor performance was one of the reasons.&nbsp; I thought your comment about the older version made sense so I did upgrade.&nbsp; Performance is back to normal but the number
 of edbXXXX.log is still growing.&nbsp; I blew out the&nbsp; old ones with no ill effect but the problem still exists.&nbsp; I also did an install repair on WLM2012 but no change so I think I will need to look elsewhere for that culprit.&nbsp; Thanks for the help.

            <p>'Blowing them out' may not have been a good idea. The database is bound to be even more confused than it was before. It sounds like you'd be well advised to create a new database, since many records will have been destroyed by removing the log files. What
 is the date of the file Mail.MSMessageStore in the folder <strong>%localappdata%\Microsoft\Windows Live Mail\Backup</strong>? Does this folder contain many edbXXXX.log files?</p>

<h2>            Dual monitor Windows 10 glitch</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft people,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I gladly upgraded to windows 10 and I've been enjoying it a lot except for one little glitch that's been bothering me a lot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It happens only when i connect my TV through an HDMI cable AND the sound output is on the HDMI (although I'm not too sure about that sound output). &nbsp;Basically what happens is that the screen either flashes or gets distorted in some places like the window
 opened, or during an Alt tab or especially when in fullscreen in video games. This forces me to play on my main monitor. I have a Geforce GTX660M, windows 10 64bit, on i7-3630QM. I checked if when i adjust the scaling of the secondary display on either GPU
 or main display it would change something but it doesn't seem to affect it.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Installer directory on Windows Server 2012 R2 unbelievable huge&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am wondering why the Installer directory becomes so huge. In my case my HDD has 95 GB. From this 95 GB the Installer directory occupies 58.8 GB.</p>
<p><strong>Honestly, can this be for real?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Why should I assign an expensive server storage for update files? Windows is wasting 50% of my HDD space for garbage which is never needed again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to reduce the size of the Installer directory?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Another very remarkable point:</strong></p>
<p>I have an exactly copy of the Windows Server 2012 R2 server on HDD with 40 GB. On this copy the Installer directory has only 259 MB!</p>
<p>Of course all updates have been installed on both servers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please explain me why there are such differences and is there a reliable way to reduce the 48.8 GB to a normal size?</p>
<p>What happens when I empty the Installer directory?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>
<p>

<p>I'm trying to link my ea account to my Xbox Live gamer tag, and the support at EA keep telling me my birthday is incorrect...&nbsp; I'm pretty sure that hasn't changed since I was born so perhaps I entered the wrong thing accidentally. Can anyone tell me where

<p>The fact is that EA uses their own servers to allow people to play their games and &nbsp;EA has a minimum age requirement of 13 to be able to play their games, when i made my EA account and linked them i had no issue linking my account, yet when my nephew tried
 he could not play the games (He was 12).</p>
<p>If you are in fact over the game minimum, just make a new EA account and make sure your birthday is correct as the one you entered when you signed up for xbox live, and then link the account. Like Tem stated, if you did not lie it will be your actual birthday.</p>

<p>I must say Microsoft is completely stupid. &nbsp;They ask you to enter your birthday as part of your Live account details when you create an account, but then that's it......they hide it away from even their own customer support staff. &nbsp;I just got off the phone
 with XB Live customer support and they said they can't see the birthday associated with my account. WTF!!!!!!! I can see the birth date associated with my Windows Live ID but not my Xbox Live account. &nbsp;The guy on the phone said it was for security purposes.
 Security from whom...myself. &nbsp;The stupid thing is if I had typed it in wrong on that clumsy @@@ POS software keyboard when creating my gamertag and didn't notice it, that's it, it will always be wrong. No one can change it or even at least VIEW what it is.
 &nbsp;Why Xbox would hide details of a customer's account even from themselves is beyond me.</p>
<p>I too can't link my EA account with my gamertag now. &nbsp;My gamer tag is now stuck being liked to an older ea account. &nbsp;So Stupid. &nbsp;Maybe i'll have more luck if I just call EA instead of using the chat service.</p>

<p>It's not viewable because as a previous poster made very clear, Microsoft assumes that you know your own birthday, and you should carefully confirm it as correct before submitting it. &nbsp;Microsoft assumes that people enter their correct birthday, but as we
 all know, it seems to be too much to assume that customers might actually do the right thing. &nbsp;In your case, it's understandable but still not Microsoft's fault that your birthday was entered incorrectly. &nbsp;Xbox Support will not be able to see your birthday
 anymore than you can. &nbsp;This is so that parent's can rest assured that a child account stays a child account instead of a child wanting to just run in and change their birthday whenever they feel like it. &nbsp;EA detects your birthday tied to your Xbox Account,
 and that is where it denies access. &nbsp;</p>

<p>When being added on to a Family Pack as someone other than the main account, the service resets your account to a child and changes your birth date. &nbsp;Since Microsoft screwed up and can neither view nor change an accounts birthday, this causes many, many
 problems among various services that require your birthdate. &nbsp;When linking my EA account, they said my birthday was wrong, when I know for a fact I entered it correctly 4 years ago. &nbsp;Microsoft made a serious error in their implementation of handling account
 information. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For everyone trying to link their EA accounts, if you have an online access code that was tied to that account, provide it to the service representative when you call them. &nbsp;He was able to link my account by using my NHL 12 online access code for verification.</p>

    <title>5.1 low dialogues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lord marcusrax  say:</h3>
<h2>            5.1 low dialogues</h2>
                    
<p>Hello everybody;&nbsp;<br />
My Xbox One is connected to the TV with an HDMI cable, exactly how my 360 was. Problem is, the 5.1 system does play games and movies at low dialogue volume.<br />
For example, in Dead Rising I can't hear people talking, and in Battlefield radio transmissions are way too low. &nbsp;<br />
The odd thing is that if I connect the 360 or my PC with the HDMI this problems don't show up, so I started the kinect audio test, and the last two sounds don't play.&nbsp;<br />
If i set the console in stereo it is all right but, obviously, it isn't in 5.1<br />
<br />
My home theater is a Panasonic SA-DT310<br />
<br />
What am I missing? Anybody else is having this issues?&nbsp;<br />
Thank for your attention. &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Task Manager Incorrect Disk Usage - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> george109  say:</h3>
<h2>            Task Manager Incorrect Disk Usage</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Task Manger, In The Processes Tab, It says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>50%</p>
<p>Disk</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But in the Performance Tab It Says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Disk 0 C: 100% (It's at 100% All The Time!!!!!) </p>
<p>Disk 1 G: 0% (This is the Integrated&nbsp;Memory Card reader, but there is<strong> NOTHING inserted into it</strong>!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I Know why the disk usage is at 100% as I have µTorrent and Bitcoin Client&nbsp;Running (Which is Updating), but why is it still monitoring the memory card reader when there is nothing inserted into it, and also the percent often ticks up to from 1% to 5%. Why
 does it do this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also know that the disk usage is 50% in the processes tab, because of the memory card reader activity being monitored, and it is getting an average of this, but&nbsp;why is it monitoring it if there&nbsp;is&nbsp;nothing inserted?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>George109</p>

Hi,</p>
<p>I can't download Microsoft Security Essentials as Windows Defender is installed, and there is no download link.</p>
<p>Also, I have the event Viewer opened, What do I do in it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will report back about safe mode in about 5 minutes!</p>

In Safe Mode, The ONLY Tabs in Task Manager are Memory and CPU, There is no disk or network mentioned anywhere in processes or performance! I'm Going to restart into normal mode, and then report back about process explorer!

    <title>Superfetch For Gamers - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jemfaycrystal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Superfetch For Gamers</h2>
                    <p>TL:DR&nbsp; Microsoft stop making secretary OS's and make Gaming OS's.&nbsp; Start with tweaking Superfetch to be more gamer friendly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Superfetch is an odd program.&nbsp; It both does what it is suppose to do and is a big fat inconvenience to those on a slower low end computer.&nbsp; While it is doing it's thing it is a big memory hog.&nbsp; If I play a game like, let's pick popular Overwatch, at 7pm
 every day then superfetch gets it nice and ready to launch at that time for me.&nbsp; But what if I get a day off and play at 7am instead?&nbsp; Why can't I tell Superfetch just keep Overwatch ready all times and don't try to figure out what time I'm going to use it.<br />
</p>
<p>Can't Microsoft offer gamers a gamers' version of Superfetch? &nbsp; So it wont be zipping up my unused apps at the same time I want to play my massive memory hogging game?&nbsp; So it will not be repeatedly unzipping my most used game?&nbsp; I mean, why can't I tell superfetch
 to leave all Windows apps zipped up even if I use them.&nbsp; Cause I don't care if Outlook or Alarms&amp;Clock or Weather opens up fast.&nbsp; But I care if Overwatch loads up fast!&nbsp; Why can't I tell Superfetch to keep Paint.net and Overwatch at the ready at all time?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And could MS give Superfetch an auto abort command when I load a massive memory using game?&nbsp; So it will not be running at the same time I am trying to play a memory hog of a game?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do Microsoft Devs even play hard core games and understand what we want our PC's to do?&nbsp; Like, NOT LAG DURING GAME PLAY because superfetch is farting around with some win app in the background we so do not care about.</p>
