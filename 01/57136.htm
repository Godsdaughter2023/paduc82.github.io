            Hi Lisabeth.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.

<br />
<br />Type services.msc in Start Search, open Services panel, scroll down to Windows Media Player Sharing Service, check it's set to Manual, then click on Dependencies tab, check that each of the services listed there is set to Automatic and will Start. Under Search, check Remote Procedural Call's Endpoint Mapper service is set to Automatic and Started.

            <p>Hi Gerry thanks for your efforts. I don't understand why the product doesn't just work. Customers should not have to go through that to get a brand new PC to run. Mine would not even download chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have only just solved the problem, by re-setting my PC. Once windows began its re-install I could enter my wifi code, and made my first task to check for updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The updates have downloaded this time, and installed, now I can open programs and seems to be running ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect the problem is that my PC pre-installed windows version was an early W10 version which seems to be full of errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It has taken me a full day to sort this out and I am very disappointed with Microsoft. It is bang out of order to have millions of PCs for sale in PC World which they know will not function correctly until you have fixed all the errors yourself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>For anyone else with the same problem, or buying a new PC, I would make re-setting it your first task, which takes a long time.</p>

            Unfortunately many xBox games can only be played on the console itself rather than via the xBox app on Windows 10, 
<br />If you are 100% sure the game is xBox app compatible then you can try signing out of the MS store &amp; signing in again. This has fixed the problem of being unable to download from the App Store for some.

<p>I've been getting a few BSOD's daily for around a month. Definitely driver related and I've tried testing all my hardware with no results. Then I tried the verifier but didn't get past reboot. I have tried every trick in my bag and I've run out of options.
 Does this look familiar to anyone? I realize that this BSOD can be created by any number of things or combinations of things so that's why I need some help figuring this problem out. Any help will be greatly appreciated.</p>

            4 of the dump files blame AVG as the root cause so fair enough to believe it is the root cause:
<br />*** WARNING: Unable to verify timestamp for avgStm.sys
<br />*** ERROR: Module load completed but symbols could not be loaded for avgStm.sys
<br /> avgStm+0x1f4a2
<br />
<br />Remove AVG and use Windows Defender in its place:

<br />Not necessary, but if you can uninstall malwarebytes too it would be also great, at least to narrow down.

<p>Thanks Sumit...</p>
<p>The problem was the corrupted AVG files. Uninstalled AVG and and everything is good. Would be interesting to to know what happened but will probably re-install both AVG and Malwarebytes to see.</p>

<p>Hiya!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul from the Xbox Forums Team here to assist, it sounds like you're experiencing an issue&nbsp;with NHL 19 freezing and crashing. I do see that you've tried some troubleshooting steps in resolving the issue. What I recommend doing is
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Performing a power cycle</a> on the console as well as uninstalling and reinstalling the game. Please let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy Gaming!</p>

<p>Hi KhaosNite89,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying and keeping us updated. Its recommended you should try the all the options available in our wizard entitled
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/troubleshooting/game-freeze-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox One Game Freeze Solution</a>. Of course, you should go past the steps asking you to power cycle the console since that step didn't work, but essentially the troubleshooter will fully give you all solutions available for the issue, including resetting your
 console if necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give this a try and please let us know the results. I hope that this helps a bit more.</p>

<p>Shy of factory reseting my console, the entire troubleshooter has come up empty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have some questions before I decide to so that however, because if I have to factory reset my console to be able to play ONE game, when all others work, I’m going to be very upset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One: I have almost my entire game collection downloaded on an external drive. If I reset, can I plug it in, and they’ll work straight away?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two: Assuming all my game save data for the above is stored in the Cloud, will I risk losing any of it, or will it sync as I start them again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Three: And the most important: What happens if my NHL 19 STILL crashes after a factory reset?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously a factory reset is a last resort, so I just want to be thorough before I do it.</p>

<p>Hi KhaosNite89,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for replying to keep us updated. When you factory reset a console, you have 2 choices:
<em>reset and keep my games &amp; apps</em>, or <em>reset and remove everything</em>. You'll want to disconnect your external HD in either case. Your game progress/saves will be in the Cloud so long as your console was connected to the internet in order to sync
 them to your profile. If your game still crashes after the factory reset, then only that game should be removed and then reinstalled. It should work after that since any type of factory reset should remove any potentially damaging files from your consoles
 operating system. Just be sure to know the log ins to your profile and your network (if using wifi).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps out!</p>

<h3> horusgfx  say:</h3>
<h2>            Intel Display Driver MISSING&#47;NOT REGISTERING After Win10 Update</h2>
                    Recently have had a Windows update and now every game I launch will play but begin to stutter then black screen . This causes me to have to hard to reset. I never had this issue prior EVER. I looked into it and reinstalled nvidia drivers, completely cleared
 prior drivers, but I noticed my Intel Integrated Graphics Driver via Display Adapters was completely missing. I tried going through the legacy and it's only showing the Windows Default displays. So I'm pretty sure my Nvidia is not the issue but the Intel is
 causing it. I tried plugging my monitor into the default Intel HDMI port on my computer and it doesn't work either. As well as trying to install Intel Drivers I'm given a "This Computer Doesn't Meet the Requirements" message.<br />
Microsoft support&nbsp; took control of my computer and all he did was work around my Nvidia drivers (*Which I have done prior*) and did not fix this issue.<br />

            I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Go into the BIOS/UEFI setup to make sure the desired Display is selected and the other one disabled.  <a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mydigitallife.info/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Update the Display driver from the PC's Support Downloads web page.  While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />Try also if necessary the previously installed drivers which are not removed even after a Version UPgrade that removes Update history and Restore points.  To do this open the Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, choose Display device, then Driver tab, then Update Driver, then Browse PC, then Let Me Pick, try all drivers listed. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers.  But I'd also ask in the Intel or Nivida forums and Support to learn if this is a known issue and what they are doing:  <a href="https://communities.intel.com/community/tech" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://communities.intel.com/community/tech</a>

<br />If not then roll back Version 1803 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If you cannot roll it back you can Clean Install the old version that worked, although first I'd try Clean Installing the newer version which seems to work better.  Follow these steps which compile the best possible install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Old version media here:  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />Burn to DVD  or create bootable 8+gb flash stick installer using this tool installed to Windows:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56485" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/detail...</a>

<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1803, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until the Spring Creators Update matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; under Go back to my previous version of Windows 10, click Get started. 
<br />or
<br />Press Control + Alt + Delete
<br />Click Sign out
<br />
<br />At the Sign In screen, hold down the shift key on your keyboard while clicking the Power button on the screen
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key while clicking Restart
<br />Continue to hold down the shift key until the Advanced Recovery Options menu appears
<br />
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />Click Advanced options
<br />
<br />Click Go back to the previous version of Windows
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Yes, not the best news you want to hear. These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Now, get ready to go back to your previous version. I recommend Windows 10 1703 because its the most stable and efficient release to date. 
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You should backup your files before downgrading.
<br />Applications will need to be reinstalled.
<br />The custom install will archive your files, so you can recover them from the Windows.old folder - make sure you follow the instructions to the letter. 
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709/1803 and certain hardware or software. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709/1803, but the release is significantly flawed. Software and Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709/1803 after an upgrade and sometimes loses functionality or stability.

                    <p>I've been trying to update my windows 10 to the latest version and I needed to use the windows trouble shooter. I keep getting an error saying "Potential Windows Update Database error detected." Now when I get to the details of this not fixed item it says
 delete re download data log in a zip file and such but the one error is an access path is denied This is the whole thing:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Access to the path 'C:\WINDOWS\softwaredistribution' is denied</p>
<p>
I'm at a lost. I can find and look at the path but not sure what to do to make this update take.</p>

 take.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never used Norton on this laptop, do not like how they're product works, if I had it I uninstalled is. I use AVG.</p>

            <p>Windows update processes and requirements have changed a bit with Windows 10. Old ways of thinking are now somewhat out of place. Currently, any device incapable of receiving and processing updates is in violation of the license agreement. Currently, OEM
 support is an important part of the&nbsp;Microsoft Lifecycle Policy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While a device may operate after a clean installation of Windows 10, if it is incapable of in place updating, it is simply not licensed for use of Windows 10. If Windows 10 is not an OEM supported OS for a given device, the device is not covered under the&nbsp;Microsoft
 Lifecycle Policy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Use of an unlicensed and or unsupported OS is not a good idea, nor has it ever been.</p>

<p><strong>I am running Windows 7 Backup automatically and encounter two problems:</strong></p>
<p><strong>1) The back up completes but skips some files it is unable to find. &nbsp;The message I get is:<br />
</strong><span><strong><span>Backup encountered a problem while backing up file C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile\***\***. Error:(The system cannot find the path specified. (0x80070003))</span></strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>I notice that the folders are same as what's in one of my libraries.... &nbsp;When I look up the *** folders they are not there in the path listed above.</span></strong></p>
<p>2)When I open Backup and Restore the page says (in the Backup section):&nbsp;<br />
"Last backup: Never"</p>
<p>When I select "Restore my files" button, there are no files or folders listed. Yet when I select "Search" button it does display the backups that were performed.</p>
<p>Last element: when I look at my backup drive in Windows Explorer, the backup file is there but the Date Modified is older than the most recent back listed in by the "Search" button.</p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>The error message says: When back up checks for the folder in the location (C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile\***\***), it could not find
 it and that is the reason for the error. Since backing up of this folder is skipped, it will not even show the files which are backed up because the backup procedure was not completed successfully.</span></p>
<p><span>You may try these:</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1: Copy those folders to the location mentioned above and check if it is backing it up.</span></p>
<p><span>Step 2: If not, check the issue 4 mentioned in the article:<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/973455" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/973455</a></span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10, Microsoft Edge and the Windows Store</h2>
                    Hi there, I'm new to this type of Help. I have Windows 10 OS, And I can't download Apps from the Windows Store using Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer or Google Chrome.&nbsp; The download stars, then stops and I receive error code: 0x80240437. I have contacted
 Microsoft Support and they have been less than helpful, I was told by one tech that they don't know what is causing the problem. Another tech tried to remote access my Pc and did such a poor job that Windows reverted back to Windows 7 and removed Windows 10
 from my PC. I had to reload Windows 10 this morning. So can anyone help me?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may have stumbled upon a solution to this problem. I'm running Kaspersky Internet Security software on my PC. I shut down Kaspersky - I exited the program - and then went to the Windows Store and downloaded a free App: WiFi Anaylzer. It downloaded in about
 two seconds and seems to be working fine. I turned Kaspersky back on and tried to download the App: NFL on Windows and it failed with the 0x8024043 error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everyone may want to try shutting down their security software and trying to download an app. Microsoft and Kaspersky need to get together and figure out what this incompatibility issue is all about.</p>

<br />
</span><b><span><br />
Note:</span></b><span> Modifying BIOS/ chipset incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/chipset can be solved. Modifications
 of the settings are at your own risk.</span></p>

<h2>            What does Windows 10 Volume 2 signify&#63;</h2>
                    When I start my computer I get a blue screen asking me to select which system to use, Windows 10 Vol 2, Another option I do not recognise and a further choice ?? Windows 10 Vol 2 or options. None of this makes sense to me and starting the computer is very
 difficult and is only achieved by selecting another option - ignore and proceed with Windows 10 Vol&nbsp; - which does not appear with the first 'options' but only after several attempts to start. What is this all about and why ids there no clarification?

<p>Hi <strong>philmaxwell</strong>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What you have described seems like an issue with a multiple operating system being detected in your PC. That is why you are seeing Volumes upon startup, that is possible indication of the number of operating system being read. To check this, try accessing
<strong>Run</strong> command by pressing the <strong>Windows key + R</strong> from the desktop screen. Type
<strong>msconfig</strong> and hit the <strong>Enter</strong> key. The <strong>System Configuration</strong> window will launch, and click the
<strong>Boot</strong> tab. You should see there <strong>Windows 10 Current OS; Default OS</strong>, but if you see more than that, try deleting the other OS that you see,

<p>Hi Mark Isi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response. I have done as you suggested&nbsp; but there was only one operating system listed. This was something of a disappointment as it occurred to me that this could solve some of the problems I have been having, e.g. start up screens which
 vary from one start up to another i.e. sometimes I get an Edge start up and sometimes a Bing start up. I also get freezes which last about 1 minute each time. I guess I will have to look at something else for a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards, Phil Maxwell</p>

<h2>            Did Windows 10 ruin my comp&#63;&#63; HP DV7 6153nr Stuck in sleep mode after shutdown&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My computer was working normal until I put it into sleep mode about a week ago. I came back and opened it expecting it to wake but it did not. The screen remained black with a continuously blinking caps lock light and the wifi light is orange instead of
 white. We changed the cmos battery and flicked it on and the cmos reset and it worked great for a day. Thought the issue was resolved. Put into sleep mode later and was presented with the same issue. I powered down and removed a stick of ram and then put the
 stick of ram back and turned the computer on. Everything powered up like normal. Got the hp splash screen and the desktop loaded right up. Computer was working normal again. Thinking that the problem was windows sleep modes I went into settings and disabled
 all sleep and hibernate modes. I shut the computer completely down for the night thinking that the problem had been fixed but when I woke up the next morning and turned the computer back on it was once again stuck on black screen with orange wifi light (normally
 white) and forever blinking caps lock light. Can hear all of the hardware in the pc running like the cpu fans, disk drive, etc...This is soooo frustrating!</p>

            I am so sorry you are having these issues.
<br />
<br />First you will need to force your machine to get into the recovery screen.
<br />To do this boot up and wait for the blue windows screen with the spinning circle, when you see that press and hold power button to shut down.
<br />Boot up again and do the same thing by waiting for the blue windows screen with the spinning circle then shut down, power up for the 3rd time and you should get repair screen.
<br />Let it run.
<br />You will then get a screen with the Automatic Repair, select the Troubleshoot and Advanced Options.
<br />From there do a reset and keep files.

<br />
<br />If you can't even get the windows logo then you will need to create a recovery disk from another working machine.

<br />
<br />If reset does not work you will need to do a clean install.

    <title>XP PRO sp3 clean install does not recognize 500 GB HD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lozon  say:</h3>
<h2>            XP PRO sp3 clean install does not recognize 500 GB HD</h2>
                    
<p>OK, here are the details:</p>
<p>System: Acer Aspire 1700 LAPTOP, Pent4, 2 GB RAM, 80GB (3.5" full size, intern) IDE HD [this is the original HD on this large sized laptop which is designed to use 3.5" harddisks].</p>
<p>Original situation: Winxp Pro (SP3 integrated) installed on 80 GB HD and running without poblems. BIOS does NOT show Capacity of the intern HD in the BIOS screen. BIOS reports only the model and serial number of the HD, and there are no options to specify
 HD type/format (such as LBA, etc.)</p>
<p>Available: Win XP Pro bootable CD slipstreamed with SP3; it is tested and verified to work successfully to install PC or laptop!<br />
<br />
While running XP Pro on a partition off 80 GB intern HD, and when I attach a brand new WD 500 GB IDE HD via USB, the HD is recognized correctly. I can partition and copy data onto the 500GB HD without any problems!<br />
<br />
When I replaced 80 GB old HD with the new 500 GB HD as the intern HD on the laptop, I have the following problems:<br />
<br />
1a. I CANNOT start winxp Pro (SP3) that was ghosted onto the 500 GB HD from the old 80 GB HD. laptop reboots, and if I try recovery console or safe start up, then the laptop reboots also.<br />
1b. I ghosted xp partition from 80 GB HD to a spare HD (40 GB) and replaced the 80 GB with the 40 GB HD, and was able to boot the laptop without problems. Therefore the problem is NOT ghosting related!</p>
<p>2. I CANNOT perform a clean install of winXP Pro (SP3 integrated) because the winxp setup recognizes the 500GB HD as 131 GB HD. Therefore the remaining capacity is not recognized.</p>
<p>3. I CANNOT perform installation of Winxp pro (SP3 integrated), even if I pre-partition the new 500 GB HD by first attaching it to a spare desktop PC, and use Partition Magic, Paragon Disk partitioner or any other partitioning tools. After pre-partitioning,
 when the 500 GB HD is installed on the laptop (as intern HD), then win xp setup lists the HD capacity as 131 GB, and lists the existing partitions as corrupt!</p>
<p>4. Strangely enough, if I use Knoppix, Debian, Ubuntu, or Mint linux boot CD and boot the laptop with any one of those linux distros, then the linux installer recognizes the HD correctly during hardware recognition phase, and later during HD partitioning
 phase, the linux system reports full 500 GB capacity available for partitioning. Additionally, when there are pre-existing partitions, then the linux partitioner lists those partitions correctly as well!<br />
<br />
Considering the 4 points and especially MS WinXP PRO (integrated with SP3, which should recognize HD with sizes larger than 137 GB limit --since MS says you need at least XP SP1 to overcome 137 GB size limit-- and that the various linux distros can see the
 full 500 GB HD size without any problems, what exactly is the problem with Win XP? Why doesn't it recognize the full capacity? And how come win xp recognizes 500 GB capacity if the new HD is attached to the laptop via USB as an external disk when running XP
 PRO (SP3) from the internal 80 GB HD?</p>
<p>Sooo.... Can anyone shed a light to the issue with Win XP Pro installation on 500 GB IDE HD?</p>
<p>Kindly,</p>
<p>LO</p>

<p>Hi Palcouk and Doc,</p>
<p>I believe this is the final answers!</p>
<p>Although, there are a mix of simple to complex answers to the problem at hand, what it all boils down is that there's a significant difference between WinXP&nbsp; installer and Linux installer. XP installer needs help from BIOS to deal with the HD, and if the
 BIOS doesn't support it, XP has no facility to deal with the situation. OTOH, most of the new Linux kernels rely on the BIOS to a limited extended, but then directly communicate with the hardware, in this instance, with the HD itself, and therefore manages
 the hardware accordingly.</p>
<p>It seems among the dual-boot users (win/linux) who use old PCs, this is a pretty well-know issue. What they end up doing is using the first 137 GB that is seen by the BIOS without problems for XP (either as a single partition or divided into several partitions),
 and the rest of the space is used for Linux, since linux has no problems.</p>
<p>I guess this really nails down the problem with my laptop to a NON-48-bit-lba BIOS!</p>
<p>So do I close this thread as answered or does anyone have more to add to this thread?</p>
<p>LO</p>
<p>P.S.: It was very nice meeting you fellows and appreciate all the help and tech expertise.</p>

                    <span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I am trying to install windows 10 from a usb onto a Lenovo laptop.
 Everything seems to be working fine until I get to the actual installation where it is telling me "windows could not prepare the computer to boot into the next phase of installation" then tells me to restart. I am doing the custom installation because when
 I try the upgrade it tells me to restart the process (which also does not work). I am installing it onto my main drive, I just tried formatting it to see if that will work. I had installed windows 10 working a few weeks ago, an had issues with wifi then did
 a factory restart to windows 8. I could not get the computer to install windows 8.1 so I decided to go back to windows 10, and now I am in this situation. I really need this to work because I am not able to go back and now have a OS'less computer.</span>

<p>You didn't' answer the question everything depends upon:&nbsp; Had you confirmed the Upgrade was activated?&nbsp; Follow the steps I gave depending on that answer.&nbsp; Those steps are what are working best for others. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remember that for a Clean Install you need to delete all partitions during the booted install.&nbsp; Anything else is not clean and can leave problems.&nbsp;

            I had assumed it was activated because I had upgraded and successfully installed Win 10 before. Now I tried deleting all the partitions and installing but it was stuck at "copying windows files"

            <p>I would not assume it was Activated because if it wasn't then you'll never Activate the Clean Install.&nbsp; You must confirm the Upgrade is activated first to know for sure that it's reinstall will always activate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your best option is to start over and Clean Reinstall Windows 8.1 then Upgrade again, following the steps with links I took the time to write out for you.&nbsp; This provides the optimal install to Upgrade and should resolve any issues itself.&nbsp; If not we will
 help you resolve them.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Where did you get the Windows 10 installation media exactly?&nbsp;&nbsp; How long did you allow the files to copy?&nbsp; It may take awhile.&nbsp; But I would not count on Windows 10 reinstall activating if you didn't confirm the Upgrade was activated.&nbsp;

<h2>            Surface not opening apps and programs</h2>
                    <p>I got a surface pro&nbsp;3 months ago and I have upgraded it to Windows 8.1.&nbsp; I use my surface pro for high school instead of an iPad.&nbsp; Recently the school upgraded their WiFi.&nbsp; Once they upgraded their WiFi I had problems with my surface pro.&nbsp; Apps don't open
 like internet explorer, settings and as well it doesn't open programs like word.&nbsp; It says that its not responding.&nbsp; The surface pro doesn't even turn off when you want it to.&nbsp; You have to do a force shut.&nbsp; This all happens at school.&nbsp; I never had problems
 before at school.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But when I get home my surface runs fine like its new.&nbsp; It opens word, internet explorer and can shut down by tapping the shut down button with no problems.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Do I have to tell the tech people at school for the WiFi options conflicting with my surface pro or is it my surface pro is which is not working fine.</p>

<p>Hi mdbarq,</p>
<p>Just to be sure, did you download the latest software/firmware/drivers from Canon's website directly?</p>
<p><a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&amp;tabact=DownloadDetailTabAct&amp;fcategoryid=335&amp;modelid=14444" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&amp;tabact=DownloadDetailTabAct&amp;fcategoryid=335&amp;modelid=14444</a></p>
<p>Also, if that doesn't fix the issue, please contact Canon directly regarding your scanning issue:</p>

<p>Hi Debra,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, I downloaded the 64-bit driver from Canon.&nbsp; I worked with Canon Technical Support for two hours and confirmed that it is not their scanner or their driver that is causing the issue.&nbsp; Nuance Technical Support (PaperPort 12.1) blames Canon, but if that
 were correct, then why did the Canon MF-4150 work properly with their earlier version, PaperPort 12.0?&nbsp;&nbsp; Complicating the situation, I uninstalled version PaperPort 12.1 and re-installed 12.0 using the Nuance Remover tool available on their website.&nbsp; Now,
 PaperPort 12.0 does not communicate with the scanner function of the MF-4150, either.&nbsp; The Windows Installer pop-up activates repeatedly when I attempt to use PaperPort and requires manual shut down (10-12 times), but still PaperPort does not communicate with
 the scanner function.&nbsp; Further, the Canon scanner driver ("ScanGear MF) error message (cannot communicate with the scanner) also pops up.&nbsp; Removing the Canon scanner software entirely results in Windows 7 64-bit downloading and reloading the Canon drivers
 again.&nbsp;&nbsp; Canon Technical Support was as helpful as reasonably could be expected but it is not their software that is causing the problem.&nbsp; Nuance Techical Support is less than competent.</p>
<p>How can I verify the Windows 7 (64-bit) Installer is not corrupted?&nbsp; I already verified that it started (Services) and is set to "Manual".&nbsp; If it is corrupted, then how do I fix it?</p>
<p>Thank you for your help.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Mike</p>

<p>Hi Debra,</p>
<p>I worked with the Canon Technical Support and Nuance Technical Support technicians for several hours this week about the issue with my Windows 7 64-bit PC not being able to communicate with the MF4150 scanner function.&nbsp; After extensive and in-depth (registry
 level) investigation, both technicians concluded that the problem is caused by a faulty WIA file in Windows 7.&nbsp; They suggested re-installing Windows 7, which may fix the problem but introduces a major headache in having to re-install all of the other applications
 and data.&nbsp; Therefore, I have a couple of questions:</p>
<p>1) Is there a way to repair the WIA files in Windows 7 64-bit without having to reinstall the entire OS and undesireable result of wiping the drive?</p>
<p>2) Do you have any other suggestions other than the ones that did not work in previous messages in this thread?</p>
<p>Thank you for your kind attention and time.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Mike</p>

<p>Hi Debra,</p>
<p>I worked with the Canon Technician for several hours on this issue.&nbsp; I did the same thing with a Nuance software technician.&nbsp; No joy.&nbsp; As a last resort,&nbsp;both technicians&nbsp;suggested re-installing Windows 7 and hope for the best.&nbsp; This is an undesireable solution
 because of the additional time to reinstall applications and restoring data from the external hard drive.&nbsp; Is there a way to repair potentially damaged Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit files (e.g., Windows Installer activates repeatedly when starting almost any application
 and I can stop it using Task Manager) without re-installing the entire OS?</p>

<p>Hi mdbarg,</p>
<p>Have you attempted a clean boot?&nbsp; This could help determine what is blocking your scanner software:</p>

<p>Did you try the built in repair function in W7? It seems to do a good job of fixing system files.</p>
<p>mdbarg, Did you find a driver that has "letter" as the default size and not "A4"?&nbsp; Every driver I have found, including the Canon ones for the US market, are Euro drivers that default to A4. I really don't want to give up this great printer and running a
 virtual box is a hassle.</p>

            I've been going through the same thing, spending two hours with the Canon support group.&nbsp; One thing that I did find from them is that the scanner does work using the Paint program, as he told me that it uses a different set of drivers.&nbsp; The conflict seems
 to be with the twain files where there is another scanner/camera/small device that is blocking it.&nbsp; Can not seem to get any answers from the computer manufacturer, or Canon that has resolved the issue.&nbsp; Canon tech was assuming the conflict is coming from a
 snp2uvc file that seems to be associated with the PhotoFunStudio, provided by Panasonic for their camera (also Kodak cameras) that has never seemed to work properly.&nbsp; It locks up after pictures are downloaded with a window that says that it is updating the
 files, but never does and never completes the project.&nbsp; You have to close the program, or do a force close as the system stops working.&nbsp; I'm probably going to uninstall this program and see if that helps.<br />

            I have had this same problem since buying a new computer with windows 7. It is now fixed by using a new high speed rated usb printer cable. Boy what a pain. None of the experts ever mentioned trying this but it is the answer.&nbsp;

            <p>SOLVED:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the same exact problem and here is how I fixed it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 - I uninstalled the printer from the device manager</p>
<p>2 - I then uninstalled the drivers and mf toolbox from the control panel programs area (anything that says Canon on it)</p>
<p>3 - Unplug the printer from the computer</p>
<p>4 - Restart the computer</p>
<p>5 - Download the latest DRIVERS from Canon (not MF Toolbox yet) and install those first.</p>
<p>6 - Download and install MF Toolbox....voila....I'm printing again</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, your mileage may vary as all computers are different.&nbsp;</p>
