<h2>            Cannot hear Sound Recorder feed back or record on Media Player</h2>
                    I have windows vista home basic. The problem is I&nbsp;seem to be able to&nbsp;record on my sound recorder and see&nbsp;visuals of it "playing", but&nbsp;I don't hear anything via speakers or headphones. Also another thread said Media player has a recording option but I can't
 seem to find it. <br />
<strong>I have tried</strong> - Adjusting all levels and properties for sound, microphone(line in), and feedback setting. I have been through all help options but with no success. I do have a sound card and can hear eveything else I should be able to; music,
 windows sounds, speaker tests, web content. I have restarted and checked everything again.

            Hi iloatheyou ,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting to answers.microsoft.com<br />
<br />
Let's check the following;<br />
<br />
Click Start ORB/ Control Panel / Classic View / Click Sound&nbsp; / Click the Recording tab<br />
<br />
1.&nbsp; On an empty spot in the recording tab window RIGHT CLICK and Select Show Disabled Devices from the popup window.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; If you see new devices - Right Click those devices and enable them.&nbsp; Make sure all devices are enabled.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; To Record Sounds through a Media Player select STEREO MIX CONTROL - click the SET DEFAULT BUTTON<br />
<br />
You will have to change the default to use other devices as your input source.<br />
<br />
(Note:&nbsp; If you don't see the Stereo Mix device it may be disabled at the hardware level.&nbsp; Check with your hardware vendor on how to enable it in the bios.)<br />
<br />
Some hardware vendors have disabled these Stereo Mixers and recording options but with the latest drivers a lot are enabling the functionality again.&nbsp; Be certain your sound card has the very latest driver installed.<br />
<br />
Please let us know if this assists you in resolving the issue or if further assistance is needed involving this matter.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />

                    Hopefully, this is the right forum. I&nbsp;need to keep operating my Windows XP Pro 64 bit SATA. My operating system is faulty and needs replacing. I have tried all possible ways to solve this problem will no results.&nbsp;Unfortunately, my reinstall disk is damaged
 (cracked). I need to get a replacement disk or download, as I do have the product key. I am a retired vet with access to a large veteran base, I have queried many vets, but no one has an XP&nbsp;Pro 64 bit SATA operation.&nbsp; Thanks&nbsp; in advance for any help.&nbsp;

            <p>64 bit,or 32 bit OS,are simply that.The SATA or RAID configuration</p>
<p>is hardware basically.The best bet for repair w/o a cd,if recovery console</p>
<p>was installed,boot pc to it.Select 1 for C:&nbsp; press enter for password,</p>
<p>type: CHKDSK C: /R</p>
<p>But recovery needs to be installed before SP2 with xp retail.</p>
<p>Where is the problem,try tapping the F8 key on pc start-up,</p>
<p>safe mode,cmd prompt,enter xp as the administrator.In cmd,</p>
<p>type: CHKDSK C:&nbsp; This is read only,no repairs,but info will show,</p>
<p>type: CHKDSK C: /R&nbsp; Agree to restart,type: EXIT&nbsp; Restart pc,CHKDSK</p>
<p>runs on restart.</p>
<p>Also,with no support to xp from microsoft,call them on a land-line,</p>
<p>&amp; PLEAD youre case...Maybe a new cd is available.&nbsp;</p>

            Andrew E, thanks for your reply. I entered the safe mode in the cmd prompt as an adminstrator. Check disk was started and stating during stage&nbsp;2,&nbsp;it was recovering lost files. My next step was chkdsk c/r, which finished while I was away from the computer
 and windows had started upto the desktop. When&nbsp; I attempted to open any of the eighteen icons, there was no response. I moved the mouse pointer to the start button and the pointer changed to the hourglass and stayed in a constant state. I was never able to
 seek the recovery console. I maually shutdown and selected F12 which had a diagnostics test. I ran it and received an error code 0142, followed by MSG: Error 2000-0142, then a second MSG: Hard Drive 1 - Self test unsuccessful. Status 79. I am really in a dilema
 here, because of the reinstall disk problem, which is now complicated by a HDD replacement, and still no disk. I explored Ebay for a short time, however, I was reluctant to pursue a purchase from a stranger, with the pos

<h2>            Stolen computer recovered but Windows was wiped and an invalid copy was installed</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Gateway computer that had Lojack installed when I purchased it from a retail store.&nbsp; Last year the computer was stolen but I was able to recover it through the Lojack recovery system.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the thief wiped the hard drive including the operating system.&nbsp; Whatever&nbsp;OS&nbsp;they installed was apparently&nbsp;invalid and now I am getting an error message (and of course the computer is locked).&nbsp; I just bought Windows 7 for my other computer
 and would like to take care of the stolen laptop as well.</p>
<p>What do I do?&nbsp; During the theft I also lost my backups and my software.&nbsp; I can prove the computer is mine but I don't have the windows Vista product key anymore.</p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>How to obtain Vista Recovery Media and/or use the Vista Recovery Partition on your Computer to
 put it back to Factory Settings</span></span></strong><strong><span>.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is no legal free Vista download available.<br />
<br />
Contact your Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Vista&nbsp;Recovery disk/s.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They normally do that for a small $ cost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also, ask them if you have a Recovery Partition on your Computer/Laptop to restore it to Factory settings.</span></p>
<p><span>See if a Manual came with the computer, or&nbsp;go to the Manufacturer's website, email or phone them for info on how to do a Recovery.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Normally, you would press F10 or F11 at Startup to commence the Recovery Process..</span></strong><span>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Another way I have seen on some models is to tap F8, and go to a list of Startup options, and start a Factory Standards Recovery from in there, by selecting the Repair
 computer option.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</span><span><br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Also ask them if it is possible to make Recovery Disk/s from the Recovery Partition in case of Hard Drive failure or System Crash.</span></p>
<p><span>They will tell you how to do that.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Each Computer Manufacturer has their own way of making Recovery Disk/s.</span></p>

            1. For Microsoft Account 
<br />Windows Key+I to open Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Your Info &gt; Manage my account, the link will open in your default browser . The link simply takes you to your Microsoft account settings page &gt; Click on your picture or your name &gt; Click on Edit name link against your name &gt; Finally, on next page, type in the name you want to appear as user account name in Windows 10. Click Save and close the browser
<br />Reboot your computer
<br />
<br />Sometimes, this account name doesn't reflect immediately in your computer as synching may take some time. In this case, wait for few minues and reboot again
<br />
<br />2. For Local Account
<br />Windows Key+R &gt; Type netplwiz &gt; Enter
<br />In the User Accounts window, on the Users tab, select the user account you wish to change the name for and click Properties
<br />In the property sheet, on the General tab, put your desired name against User name. Click Apply followed by OK and you’re done

<p>
</p><p>My Windows 10 update on my older Core 2 system failed a number of times until it installed fully by itself. But The number of failed installs ended up giving me the duplicate&nbsp;drivers. Is there any way I can remove them without getting my&nbsp;computer frozen,
 which seems to happen as soon as I uninstall any one of the system drivers.</p>

<p>Das selbe Problem habe ich beim WLan-Spielen auch (auch mit 'ner Fritz-Box), was sehr ärgerlich ist, da ich vor kurzem so 'ne Gold-Mitgliedschaft verschwendet habe.</p>
<p>Wenn ich mal mit Kabel probiert habe ging es . . . allerdings kann ich ja schlecht ein Lan-Kabel durch die ganze Wohnung legen.</p>

    <title>Support for CD Text - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrprocess  say:</h3>
<h2>            Support for CD Text </h2>
                    Hi <br />
<br />
My car radio would display song and singer on a normal audio CD if that information was present on the CD following the CD Text standard. I have bought&nbsp;an CD burning application which supported CDText that no longer runs on Vista.&nbsp; Before I see to get this
 renewed wondered if you knew of a way where Media Player would support this natively (CDText is probably a 10 years old standard) and/or a plugin to Media Player (I search the web and could not find any)<br />
<br />
Thx<br />

            Hi Hubert,<br />
<br />
Ryan is correct.&nbsp; Windows Media Player does not burn audio CDs with CD text, and there are not any Windows Media Player plugins that will add this support.&nbsp; There are plenty of third party CD burning applications that do.&nbsp;&nbsp;alternatively, if the CD player in
 your car&nbsp;supports WMA or MP3 playback, you could use Windows Media Player to burn your&nbsp;CDs with more songs per&nbsp;CD and all the track information.&nbsp; Please let us know if you have any other questions.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;

    <title>Windows Hello disappeared - Fingerprint not working anymore - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Hello disappeared - Fingerprint not working anymore</h2>
                    <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Elitebook 840 G2 with Windows 10 running on it. Since I use Win10, I was always logging in with Windows Hello and the built in fingerprint reader.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, I made a restart of Windows and some updates were installed. When I wanted to log in again, there was no login possible anymore with the fingerprint. Instead, I had to use the PIN. A short glimpse in the Settings revealed that there was no Windows
 Hello option anymore! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Although there are two drivers, a Synaptics Driver and a Validity Fingerprint Sensor Driver in my program list, the whole fingerprint reader does not work anymore. Does anyone have an idea where to get a new, correct Windows 10 driver or to troubleshoot
 to get Windows Hello back? In my opinion, it is all about convenience of logging in :-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your response,</p>
<p>Marco</p>

            No unfortunately the resize arrows come up but nothing happens. This just happened after I allowed a Windows update and has happened before after a windows update. I am getting annoyed at having to take it into an IT specialist to have it fixed.

<p>Glad to hear it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just for some background -- the reason this happened is your computer was set to have a 2nd screen attached (like another monitor, a TV, or a projector).&nbsp; So the computer was putting that folder on the "other screen", even though you didn't have another
 monitor plugged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows+P shortcut lets you quickly change your projector mode.&nbsp; I see sometimes people click that combination by mistake (maybe as an accidently when they meant to use Ctrl+P to Print), and so it starts trying to use a 2nd monitor and if stuff is open
 over there, you can't see it.</p>

            Thanks Andre, but the process you are recommending doesn't work because after the "About" step ("<span style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)">Select&nbsp;</span><em>About&nbsp;</em><span style="color: rgba(85, 85, 85, 1)">then&nbsp;</span><em>Change
 product key or upgrade your edition of Windows.</em>") I find myself on the page with the "Change Product Key" and "Store" buttons, neither of which work. &nbsp;So there is no pop-up dialogue box into which I can enter the default product key.

<p>I cannot figure out the commond denominator - but more and more frequently&nbsp; I will go to open or close a program and the program fails to respond. Without fail - if I hold my cursor over the task bar an hour glass appears. Nothing on the task bar, quick
 launch etc will work. Anything still open can be worked in - but if I minimize the open program to the task bar - it too becomes inaccesible</p>

            Something is running in the background that is taking up all your processing power. You need to find out what this is. Most commonly it is malware, but it could be some other legitimate runaway/incompatible process.<br />
<br />
I take your first sentence about not being able to find a common denominator to mean that you can't figure out the answer to The First Question Of Troubleshooting (if the problem is new, what changed between the time things worked and the time they didn't?).
 If this is correct, please move on to answer:<br />
<br />
The Second Question of Windows Troubleshooting: what is the malware/virus status of the machine? If you think it is clean, what programs (and versions) did you use to determine this?<br />
<br />
Be sure the computer is clean:<br />

Then post back with the results if you need more help.

</p><p>You cannot change the default Windows&nbsp;10 calendar. However, any event from your&nbsp;Yahoo calendar will show up.. Once you have added them to the&nbsp;Yahoo calendar, sync your mail then the events show up in a different color on the Windows&nbsp;10 calendar. Your&nbsp;Yahoo
 calendar does not have to be the default calendar.<br />

<h3> carlosmolinero  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 update broke my computer. Blue screen.</h2>
                    <p>First, I am annoyed that Microsoft does not allow to directly contact a technical support team.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a computer scientist so I know what I am doing. my computer is a 2 year old Dell inspiron.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My computer was on perfect working state with windows 8.1, then I clicked on the annoying upgrade to windows 10. It turns out that the update did not check if all drivers were compatible, and doing the upgrade has created an endless loop of :</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1. blue screen of death. DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (iaStorA.sys)</p>
<p>2. restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can not access any type of secure login, F8 does not seem to work. F12 or F2 bring me to configurations that don't solve anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot access recovery mode either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like it has also broken the boot sector, because I tried to install a Linux from the USB and it crashed when trying to create the boot menu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So: The update was breaking my computer, I have lost all access to it, and I demand that Microsoft sends me a fresh copy of Windows 8.1, so I can reinstall it. Either that or you need to buy me a new laptop.</p>

<h2>            I&#39;ve lost my Bluetooth adaptor on my Windows 10 Laptop and have no idea how to fix the problem</h2>
                    Hi, I have been unable to turn on my Bluetooth on my Acer laptop today. I tried checking all around my computer and I found no way to turn it on. So then I tried using the troubleshooter, but that said it detected no Bluetooth adapter. Checking the Device
 Manager didn't change much either. I found no sign of any sort of Bluetooth adapter to uninstall and anything Bluetooth-related that I did uninstall was not relate to my adapter problem. Is there anything I can do to fix this problem on my own or do I need
 to send in my laptop for repairs?

            Hi Noah.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> I'll give all possible steps for troubleshooting Bluetooth in order of priority:
<br />
<br />Make sure you're pairing correctly as shown here:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15290/windows-connect-bluetooth-device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15290/...</a>

<br />
<br />Try the Bluetooth troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />Try turning off Fast Startup at Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do &gt; Change settings that are unavailable &gt; uncheck Fast Startup.  
<br />
<br />If this is a mic or headset right click Volume icon in System Tray to Open Sound Settings,  make sure the correct device is selected for input or output in the dropdown menu.  
<br />
<br />Try Updating the Bluetooth driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model.  Install it even if it's the same or newer than the one in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to access Device Manager, locate Bluetooth device (if necessary from View tab Show Hidden Devices), on Driver tab see if Roll Back is available, if not try Update Driver, first automatically, then Browse, then Let Me Pick to try all previously installed Drivers.  
<br />
<br />If these fail try to Uninstall the Driver, restart PC to reinstall.
<br />
<br />Then try pairing again, if necessary run the Bluetooth Troubleshooter again.  
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>

<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            <p>This happens when you are using any application (or process related to an application) where the SB is using the nVidia dGPU as the graphics processor,&nbsp;because the dGPU is in the keyboard. So when you try and Detach it is saying, "hey, but I'm using the
 video card you are about to remove!". </p>
<p>
</p><p>You either have to close such applications and/or process before you detach - a royal pain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or go into the nVidia 3D settings - in the NVidia Control Panel - and change the Global Settings graphics card default ('Preferred Graphics Processor') - either to Auto-Select (which will work pretty well in practice) or to Integrated Graphics.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do the latter, you can still go into the Program Settings tab and change the default to the NVidia dGPU for any specific application you think would benefit from it. BUT if you are running that application you will get the same message on a&nbsp;Detach
 request, and will have to close it down first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had this when in a fit of enthusiasm I changed the default global to the dGPU - I soon changed it back...</p>

            <p>Ah.&nbsp; That can happen, the normal way round this kind of SB amnesia is to detach and reattach, and magically the SB 'finds' the dGPU. But you are having problems detaching, so you either have to close down all programs and processes about which it is complaining;
 or do a two-button reset.</p>
<p>Press the Power button and Volume UP button simultaneously until it reboots into the UEFI screen. Then just Exit and Restart without changing anything...</p>

            <p>Pressing Power + Volume UP seems to give me mixed results. Sometimes it simply shuts down the computer. Other times, it puts the computer to sleep. I did reach that screen you mentioned once, so I selected Exit and then Shut Down. The problem persisted,
 however.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One time when I pressed Power + Volume UP, the SB shut all the way down, and I heard the clipboard make that clicking noise it normally does when it's ready to detach. I grabbed it, and it came away from the keyboard. I turned on the clipboard and signed
 in. I reattached it to the keyboard, but the problem persisted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps my only option is to shut down those processes. How can I find "Search UI" and "Shell Experience Host"? I have no idea what those things are, and a look through the processes list in the Task Manager doesn't show anything like these two items.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for any ideas you have!</p>

            <p>I'm having the exact same problem of late.&nbsp; Not sure what prompted it, but it seemed to coincide with the Microsoft surface dock firmware upgrade (which failed repeatedly).&nbsp; That may just be correlative, and not causative, but it's a major, major inconvenience.&nbsp;
 Especially since if you kill SearchUI it simply restarts and if you kill ShellExperienceHost it logs you out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I somehow, once got it to go away, by attempting to boot into safe mode and then exiting...but it came back within a reboot or two and I have been unable to repeat that success and at any rate it isn't a viable solution to execute that process every time
 one wants to detach the&nbsp;screen.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>MS definitely, definitely needs to address this as it&nbsp;is a MAJOR, MAJOR dissatisfier.&nbsp; &nbsp;I went from a recommender - and nearly a purchaser of a SB for my daughter going to college - to "wait and see" and buying a MacBook for her to take to college.&nbsp; I've
 got a degree in CS and if it is a buzzkill for me, it's a product killer for the general public.</p>

            <p>Ok, I managed to fix this by going into my system settings and then choosing 'apps and features' and then in the top box searching for 'nvidia'.&nbsp; I had two things listed which were installed on the same day (4/29) that I started having the problem.&nbsp; NVidia
 driver build 362 and the NVidia control panel.&nbsp; I de-installed both and the problem went away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also worth noting that when I previously tried to run the NVidia control panel as was recommended by a previous poster, I got the same 'You are not running an Nvidia display' error message that others got....so not really sure why it is getting included
 with the SB updates...especially since it seems to be causing a serious issue.</p>

            <div>
<p>Decided to continue tinkering with this because the consequence of deinstalling the NVidia driver and control panel&nbsp;is that I am no longer driving my 4k display via the display port.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I manually downloaded the latest update package 'SurfaceBook_Win10_160700_1' and unzipped it and then went into the dGPU subdirectory and did an install of only the driver, but not the 'NVidia Update' and voila, when I reboot the issue with 'Elevated Processes',
 'SearchUI' and 'ShellExperienceHost' instantly reappears and I can't detach the clipboard and the little red light on the detach button is lit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An interesting little correlative 'proof' of this particular driver install being the issue however is that I then went back into System-&gt;Apps and sorted by date and de-installed the&nbsp;Nvidia V.362 package and as soon as it finishes deinstalling and before
 I choose 'reboot' to finish the de-install,&nbsp;the detach light turns green and the clipboard goes 'click'!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm gonna do a reboot and try the 'clean install' option for the package and see if that makes any difference.&nbsp;</p>

            Thanks for sharing your troubleshooting results. I haven't had time to mess with it and have just been using the SB without detaching the clipboard with the intention of contacting Microsoft Support at some point. But if you can figure out whether it's
 fixable or if it's a bug Microsoft has introduced, that would help a lot.<br />

            <p>After much investigation it kind of came down in my case to something I saw somebody else having issues with in another thread.&nbsp; Specifically that for some unknown reason my configuration after the last updates got stuck on the Microsoft basic display driver.&nbsp;
 This was somehow clashing with the NVidia control panel and other stuff and it was causing the 'Elevated Processes', 'ShellExperienceHost' and SearchUI messages that needed resolution before a detach could occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure how that came to be the display driver, but all of my attempts to load a different display driver were non-productive.&nbsp; I even went into the setupapi.log or some such file that everyone suggested and looked at the logs every time I tried to get
 it to load a driver.&nbsp; Problem was the log always said 'SUCCESS', but if you looked closely it sets up a fallback driver which is the basic display driver, so even though it was exiting with SUCCESS for whatever reason it was showing up using the fallback driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried removing old display driver instances w/ pnputil -d oemXXX.inf.&nbsp; This was successful in some cases, but not always because even though it was plainly using the basic display driver, when I tried to remove the new ones with pnputil, it would say that
 they were in use.&nbsp; It actually was saying this for two different versions of the display driver that were both in different inf files.&nbsp; I even tried some old windows 95 display driver tricks like booting to the low resolution driver and attempting to boot
 in safe mode both with and without command prompt in my attempts to remove them, but nothing was successful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ultimately I concluded it was stuck in some kind of confused / half pregnant display driver install state so my only choice was to do a reset and reload windows.&nbsp; That of course requires reloading all of my programs so I am doing that now, which is its own
 frustration and what I was ultimately attempting to avoid through my efforts to begin with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check what display driver you are using as a first step is the suggestion I'd give to anyone having the won't detach problem.</p>

<h2>            Logitech h150 creates squeeking and buzzing sounds to my recording</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Logitech h150</p>
<p>I just bought a Logitech h150 to use with ventrilo while playing video games. My problem is that while the mic DOES work it also adds some weird squeeking and buzzing sounds to my recording... like some weird feedback. Any help in getting rid of the extra
 noise would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p>I tried methods 1 and 2 and no problems were found. I don't have the time at the moment to invest in method 3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's the answers to the questions you asked of me:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. I was talking to a friend in ventrilo when I swapped from my old headset to my new one. I made no changes to the computer prior to that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I don't have another computer at my disposal to test my headset on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Upon reading your question I did try my old headset again (it's mic was fine, I replaced it because the speaker's were giving out) and it is now providing the same weird feedback noises (high pitch and low pitch, long beeps).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an extra note; I tried recording myself on my computer's sound recorder program and it made the same noises as vent.</p>

            <p>The noises exsisted on the new account as well. A friend said it's possible I may have scratched the audio jack somehow in the process of swapping the headsets. My laptop's built-in mic works fine... it just makes me sound like I'm in a cave. So for now
 I may use that and invest in a USB headset. Thank you so much for trying to help me!</p>

            Squeaking sounds usually can be cause by the mic being too close to a speaker and it is picking up feedback.<br />
<br />
Buzzing sounds can be cause by various things. <br />
<br />
-- Bad power<br />
-- Ungrounded power outlet<br />
-- "Cheap" power bars (???)<br />
-- Crossing the head set lead over a power cable<br />

<h2>            An unidentified program wants to access your computer</h2>
                    I've got a program that everytime I run it comes up with a pop up with the&nbsp;message - An unidentified program wants to access your computer.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I then need to say yes I want that program to run.&nbsp; How do I get it so that Windows Vista accepts this program as legitimate and the pop up doesn't appear everytime?<br />
<br />
Is there a view or panel that shows authorised software?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />

<p><span><span>Hi Dave Brougham,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The message is part of UAC (User Account Control), and is designed to inform you that a program requires elevated administrative) privileges to run.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>An unidentified program is one that doesn't have a valid digital signature from its publisher to ensure that the program is what it claims
 to be. This doesn't necessarily indicate danger, as many older, legitimate programs lack signatures. However, you should use extra caution and only allow this program to run if you obtained it from a trusted source, such as the original CD or a publisher's
 website. <span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the program is from a legitimate source, then you may better check the manufacturer for updates where the application is aware of the
 security protocols in Windows Vista.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>For more information, you may refer the following link:</span></span></p>

<span>Tips :</span><br />
<br />
some of this spells cost magicka over 500&nbsp; to 850 depending of the Skills/perk if this didn't&nbsp; use any less cost perk novice/adept etc like i did so the best way to boost your magicka is via Fortify magicka items. Use the enchant lab to add the spell 9remember
 to use a strong forty enchant potion), then go to the smithing equipped with items that help you improve better your armor, use a high fortify restoration spell and use the smithing to improve your equipment for reason that i unknown this mix will boost too
 the percent of the spell you did add to your equipment.<br />
<br />
<br />
======</p>

<p>Remember to buy in the expert spells like Rage, Frenzy aren't so effective like Maters spells version but comes in handy or spells like Waterbreathing ( if you don't want to add this spell to an item) , Invisiblity (if you don't want to use potions) Telequinesis
 etc<br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A corrupted driver, missing driver, and hardware issue are a few of the reasons why you are experiencing challenges connecting a device to your laptop. Before we proceed, we would like to confirm the following:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>You’re using the same Windows 10 build as your laptop.</li><li>You’re connecting the portable device using the same cable cord.</li><li>You’re using the same version of the driver on your desktop and laptop.</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the statements above are all correct, there's a possibility that it is hardware related. To further isolate your concern, we suggest that you try to connect the portable device using a different port on your laptop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are looking forward for the response.</p>
