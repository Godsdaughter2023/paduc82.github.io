<h2>            Microsoft Store Sale - AAA Xbox One Games Under &#36;30</h2>
                    
<p>The Microsoft store seems to be having a sale on some of the early release AAA Xbox One games, all of which seem to be under $30. Games included are Assassin's Creed IV, Call of Duty Ghosts, Battlefield 4 amongst others. At the moment these sales appear
 to be US only though, which sucks for me but I thought I'd post it for those across the pond. There's a few Xbox 360 games going very cheap around the site too.</p>

<h2>            Programs continuously crash, need help finding&#47;resolving issue &#40;Windows 10&#41;</h2>
                    <p>So, I just got this brand-new laptop a few days ago, and within a couple of hours I was fighting off piles and piles of adware and trojans and viruses, seeing as the computer had no good built in anti-virus software.</p>
<p>Now, 4 anti-virus and anti-malware programs later, I am 90% sure the laptop is now virus free. However, I am unable to use a program without it crashing continuously. It won't close, and I can still interact with it, but it's icon on the bottom of the screen
 keeps restarting, and the browser bar of the program keeps flashing, letting me know that it is in fact, restarting.</p>
<p>This prevents me from using quite a few programs comfortably, namely Pandora, which will just shut off if I so much as move my mouse over the icon, and a java environment based program, Shimeji, which will refuse to respond at all. Steam gets the worst of
 the glitching.</p>
<p>Also, as a side note, I am unable to expand any browser page to the left without the program giving me a "not responding message" and almost crashing the entire screen, nor am I able to move them left either.</p>
<p>It's really weird.</p>
<p>Any advice on how to fix this? If it helps, my computer is an AMD A6 series HP laptop running windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I have also been locked out of using Windows Defender, with no clear reasoning.</p>

<p>How new of a brand-new laptop? Sounds like its not virus free yet. Third party AV will shutdown Defender. Some third party malware will shutdown defender.</p>

<h2>            Advanced Recovery Methods not working in Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys. Does anybody have any idea why when I click the "Advanced recovery methods" from my Backup &amp; Restore program it does nothing at all? I don't know how long this has been this way because I never used it until today. I can still create WindowsImages
 and backup files with no problem, but when I try to recover from an image, the program won't open. Here's a screenshot of what I'm talking about:</p>

            <p>I do not appreciate your answer due to that when you use update windows in Internet explorer 'update windows' is say wuapp.exe is missing. You did not answer how to check for windows update if the latter option do not work.</p>
<p>Further I personally cant get 'action center' to open as well as 'Edge' as well as 'Store'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For me it seems you have released a Beta version for us all to find all your errors and then wait too long for a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the hard tone, but I am not impressed</p>

            something I discovered this morning. I went to hp support assistant and clicked on update and security and when windows would not update, I clicked advanced options and and checked the "give me updates for other msn products when I update windows" and
 then tried to update windows and sure enough it worked! so, it is possible to update windows in the support assistant, although it still does not work by going to ie and tools/options/ windows update. the wuapp.exe still appears as an error<br />

<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 has really gone beyond the limits of&nbsp;control.&nbsp; Windows 10 denies you of your choices.&nbsp; Not only with Windows update but also with Windows Defender and so on and so on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who in the world worked on Windows 10?&nbsp; A bunch of 10 year olds kids.&nbsp; Windows 10 definitely sends the message that it's just all about the money and nothing else.&nbsp; Forget about the end user.&nbsp; Us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 is by far the worst of all Windows that I've had the misfortune of having installed.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I've been on computers since the days of DOS and Windows 3.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if Bill Gates knows how bad Microsoft is screwing up his company.&nbsp; I've tolerated more and more with Microsoft but this has reached my limit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going back to Windows 8.1 Pro which is the lesser of two evils.&nbsp; And then I'm researching other operating systems.&nbsp; There has to be something better than this non-ending ****.</p>

            This answer has nothing at all to do with how to fx the missing wuapp,exe. You can't even get to Windows Update&nbsp;in IE because this is not there.&nbsp; We need to know how to fix it. That is what you are there for.

    <title>How to stop Windows from entering phantom spaces when - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rrhain  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to stop Windows from entering phantom spaces when copying&#47;pasting words</h2>
                    Is there any way to convince Windows that when I am selecting text, I don't want the space on the end of the word? &nbsp;One of the most annoying things about Windows is the logic it uses with regard to selection. &nbsp;I am very grateful that you can select an
 entire word by double-clicking on it, but it is maddening that when you do, it includes the space on the end. &nbsp;That means when I paste it wherever it needs to go, I have to delete the space. &nbsp;Does nobody at Redmond understand that words do not include spaces?
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And now it seems that Outlook will add a space at the beginning of words that are pasted in. &nbsp;It's a specific circumstance: &nbsp;If you are composing a message in Outlook (I'm using 2010) and have started a quotation, then if you paste in text after the quotation
 mark, Outlook will insert a space *before* the text you pasted in. &nbsp;I now have to go back and delete the space between the opening quotation mark and the pasted text. &nbsp;As an example, suppose I have the following in my message:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And I quote, "</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If I then copy some plain text from somewhere and paste it in after that quote, Outlook puts in a space between the quotation mark and my pasted text:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And I quote, " Here is my pasted text.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What is that space doing there? &nbsp;It wasn't in that I copied. &nbsp;Why did Outlook insert it?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The logic behind selection and pasting should be very simple:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1) &nbsp;Do not add anything that wasn't in the original selection. &nbsp;You paste what is on the clipboard and nothing else.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>2) &nbsp;Auto-selection should follow natural breaks in text layout. &nbsp;That means no extra spaces unless I deliberately slide my mouse over them to include them. &nbsp;Thus, double-clicking on a word selects the word and only the word. &nbsp;No spaces in front of or behind
 it. &nbsp;This also means no punctuation or symbols. &nbsp;Numbers should count as letters (so that when you double-click on a piece of hex code, you get the whole thing), but things like hyphens, punctuation marks, and other symbols are to be excluded from a simple
 double-click. &nbsp;If you do a double-click-and-hold to start dragging over text, then follow those natural breaks: &nbsp;Grab the space at the end as a jump, then the next word, then the punctuation mark at the end, then the space after the punctuation mark, etc.
 &nbsp;This way, I am the one telling the computer what I want to select, rather than being forced to take characters I don't want.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This needs to apply even if you start doing a single-click-and-drag when it starts selecting words: &nbsp;No spaces unless I deliberately drag over them.</div>
                </div>

            I was unable to replicate your issues, using word 2010, and copying/pasting various text from your post, at various points within an existing doc

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Please try again and don't use Word 2010 (since it seems to have some logic in it about how to handle pasted content with a space on the end) but something else like Notepad. &nbsp;For example, go to the following URL in Internet Explorer:
<div><br />
<div>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/buy?ocid=GA8_O_WOL_Hero_Home_FPP_Null</div>
<div><br />
<div>Double-click on the word "Clicking" in the first paragraph under "Upgrading is easy." &nbsp;Notice that the space on the end of the word has been chosen and you don't have any way to not choose it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you then double-click-and-hold on the word "Clicking" and then start dragging to the right, you'll notice that every word you move over includes the space on the end. &nbsp;At this point, copy the text you have selected.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now indeed, if you were to go into Word at this point, put your insertion point on an empty line, and then paste in the text you just copied, there wouldn't be a space. &nbsp;And, if you were to put your insertion point right in front of a word that is already
 in the document and paste in the text, you'd get a space between the text you put in and the word that was in there. &nbsp;As I mentioned, Word seems to have some logic regarding this and that's fine.</div>
<div><br />
<div>But go into Notepad and paste in the text you selected. &nbsp;There's that space on the end. &nbsp;That's because it was selected when you copied it and you didn't have any way not to select it.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Now, here in this forum (answers.microsoft.com), there seems to be some control over this, but it is a bit weird: &nbsp;If you double-click on a word, the space on the end of it is included. &nbsp;If you double-click-and-hold, the space is included but as soon as
 you move the mouse, the space is taken off. &nbsp;It then starts behaving exactly as I would like it to as you drag over more words: &nbsp;The word is highlighted, but the space on the end is not included until you actually drag over the space.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There is a way to fake this on the URL mentioned above: &nbsp;If you double-click-and-hold, you get the space on the end. &nbsp;Drag to the right to include words beyond the ending point of what you would like to select. &nbsp;Then, drag backwards. &nbsp;The system suddenly
 realizes that spaces on the ends of words aren't necessarily wanted and will allow you to remove them from the selection.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Note, however, if you only want one word, you have to select at least two words beyond that one in order for the drag-forward/drag-backward trick to work: &nbsp;If you double-click-and-hold on just one word and then drag-forward on only one word, dragging backward
 drops the selection of the first word and instead reverts to if you had only done a single-click-and-hold, selecting only from the spot you had originally clicked rather than the entire word.</div>
<div><br />
<div>All this logic and&nbsp;back-filling&nbsp;for what should really be a simple process:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1) &nbsp;Single-click-and-hold: &nbsp;Start selecting from the position you clicked.</div>
<div>2) &nbsp;Double-click-and-hold: &nbsp;Start with the entire word you clicked on, no space.</div>
<div>3) &nbsp;When dragging, do not include the space unless it is actually selected by the drag.</div>

    <title>Upgrade to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1 after re-installation - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Upgrade to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1 after re-installation</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>Because of frequently occurring blue screen on my PC I decided to re-install Windows 10. I have upgraded for free more than a year ago from licensed Windows 8.1 to Windows 10. Because I have .ISO file of Windows 8.1 and a purchased product key for this version,
 I created a USB bootable media to do the re-installation process. After installing the Windows 8.1 I tried to upgrade to Windows 10 using the Media Creation Tool form the&nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/bg-bg/software-download/windows10 and after trying to implement
 the upgrade, it asks for a product key. I enter the product key of Windows 8.1 version and it doesn't recognize it. Please advise how to recover the issue and to upgrade to Windows 10 again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Nikolay</p>

            Hi Nikki, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time, this will bypass the need for entering a Product Key and it will not cost you anything !
<br /> 
<br />You should just clean install Windows 10 rather than upgrading from Windows 8.1. This will have 2 benefits, if you have to reset again, it will reset to Windows 10, not 8.1 and your system will be more responsive and reliable . . . 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10

    <title>FavIcons not showing correctly in File Explorer but do show correctly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> meyouknowwho  say:</h3>
<h2>            FavIcons not showing correctly in File Explorer but do show correctly in Internet Explorer.</h2>
                    <p>Please Note: This is the opposite of what people usually describe their problem being.</p>
<p>I have Windows 7 Pro 64bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My FavIcons are not showing correctly in File Explorer (Folders View) but do show correctly in Internet Explorer. This puzzles me. When I open IE Browser, the correct favorites icons show to the left of the shortcut file name, in both the Favorites pane
 and the Favorites Bar. However, when I open Windows File Explorer and view&nbsp;my&nbsp;Favorites files and folders, the FavIcons are the generic globe icons, not the icons specific to the web sites that the shortcuts link to. The links work ok. It's just that that
 the FavIcons are generic globes. (Not all, but many.) I want the correct FavIcons to show in the Windows File Explorer view.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried revisiting the web sites and dragging the URL (and favicon) from the IE address bar to the "favorites" folder again. That did not solve the problem. I tried going to the website's page and typing the /favicon.ico extension and saving it, but
 windows wouldn't let me save it. (Where can they be saved? And how would I assign them to the shortcut file&nbsp;in File Explorer? Or is that not the way to deal with the problem?)
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to fix this without downloading an app/program? Is there a way to fix this without modifying the registry? Or is the registry modification simple?</p>
<p>I want the correct Favicons to show in File Explorer, as well as Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reply in simple English, not in techy words. If you suggest a procedure, please explain where everything is (how to find the things to click on that you recommend.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for help. </p>

            <p>THIS IS THE ANSWER. WOULD A MODERATOR PLEASE MARK IT AS THE ANSWER, OR REPLY TO IT SO I CAN MARK IT THE ANSWER. IT SEEMS ABSURD THAT WE CANNOT POST AN ANSWER TO OUR OWN QUESTION AND BE ABLE TO MARK IT AS THE ANSWER. Thanks.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I searched and found the answer. Also, I realized I had experienced this problem about two years ago and had saved the solution info to a notepad file. On the following site, the answer given by Chris H is the solution. It involves deleting the icon cache
 are correct for each shortcut.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-desktop/some-desktop-icons-appear-as-broken-icons/05abcead-adb1-43ba-9bb7-e308d0cc83a4">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-desktop/some-desktop-icons-appear-as-broken-icons/05abcead-adb1-43ba-9bb7-e308d0cc83a4</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Two methods are given there. I'm listing the instructions for the first method, which worked for me. You can click to that page to read more.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a couple of things that you can try:<br />
<br />
First: (Rebuild Icon Cache)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Open Folder Options to select (dot) Show hidden files and folders.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Open a Windows Explorer window.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Go to C:\Users\(User Name)\AppData\Local<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Right click on IconCache.db and click on Delete.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Click on Yes to confirm the deletion. <br />
NOTE: This deletes the file to the Recycle Bin. It is safe to empty the Recycle Bin when finished.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Close the window.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. Empty the Recycle Bin.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 8. Restart the computer.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 9. When you go back, you will notice the Size of the IconCache.db file is smaller, and the&nbsp; Date Modified is now the current date.<br />
NOTE: If for some reason IconCache.db is not there or the size has not changed much, then just restart the computer again. You may need to restart a couple of times in some cases.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10. The icon cache has been rebuilt.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 11. Open Folder Options to select (dot) Do not show hidden files and folders.</p>

<p>
</p><p>To reinstall go into device manager and scroll to the network adapters. &nbsp;Uninstall your wireless ,and wired if you use it. &nbsp;Then restart the pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There seemes to be a bug in the 1511 update as several people seem to be having this issue.&nbsp;</p>

            Fortunately, just after i posted the question, managed to sort out the issue... It seems the AVG anti-virus firewall component was de-activated. Re-activated it and im back online.

            <p>I'm on an ageing Toshiba Satellite Pro U500-1E5 laptop, with 8GB Ram and an Itel Core i5 CPU. Yesterday I installed the 1511 release of Windows 10, replacing the original W10 release, along with assorted other Windows updates.&nbsp; It took hours, but at the
 end everything seemed to be working fine.&nbsp; Certainly I could access the 'net without any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This morning to my surprise there were three new Windows updates waiting:-<br />
* Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1511 for x64-based Systems (KB3116900)</p>
<p>* Security Update for Internet Explorer Flash Player for Windows 10 Version 1511 for x64-based Systems (KB3119147)</p>
<p>* Update for Windows 10 Version 1511 for x64-based Systems (KB3122947)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I installed these and rebooted.&nbsp; Afterwards, while my Wifi connection was up and apparently working, none of my browsers would access the 'net.&nbsp; Running the Windows Network troubleshooter told me that "one or more protocols are missing".</p>
<p>
</p><p>A search for this (from my phone) led me to the following website: http://www.surfacetablethelp.com/2015/05/windows-108-one-or-more-network-protocols-are-missing-on-this-computer-error.html which suggested reinstalling the TCP/IP protocol, and gave the instructions
 to do this from a command prompt (as Administrator) - as follows:-</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">From Start screen, search <strong>Command Prompt</strong>, select
<strong>Run as Administrator</strong><br />
Type the Command and press the Enter key to execute it:<br />
<code>netsh int ip reset</code><br />
Then restart the device to apply all changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having done this, internet access was magically restored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I feel there must be a bug in one of the three updates listed above which caused the TCP/IP protocol to be removed or damaged in some way, as this fix definitely did the job, and I've never experienced any similar problem before.&nbsp;
</p>

</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I think you might be on to something, because something very similar happened to me when I upgraded my wife's Toshiba laptop (which I'm typing from) to Windows 10 from 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The difference is that she could access the Internet (both hardwired &amp; wireless), but could not connect to any other Windows machine on the LAN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I discovered that her network card (RealTek) was updated.&nbsp; We've always used DHCP on this machine, and for some odd reason, the machine was requesting a preferred address of "192.168.173.1", and getting it.&nbsp; Our LAN router is set to issue DHCP addresses
 on network "192.168.3", from 100 - 199, but for whatever reason either issued the IP address as requested,</p>
<p>or this machine ignored the strongly worded suggestion.&nbsp; DNS and gateway issues worked just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The end result was that my machine could see and access shares this laptop, but this laptop could not see my machine, which I find strange.&nbsp; HTTP and TCP requests to our NAS worked just fine.&nbsp; I've set the card up for a static IP V4 address of 192.168.3.10,
 and everything is much happier now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a LOT of places in the registry I changed from "192.168.173.1" also, which seemed to be related to LAN networking.</p>
<p>I'm now left with one entry which "I don't have sufficient priveleges" to change:</p>
<p>
</p><p>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WlanSvc\Parameters\EapolKeyIpAddress]<br />
"LocalAddress"="192.168.173.1"<br />
"PrefixLength"=dword:00000018<br />
</p>

            <p>Hi Amir,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greeting for the day!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess you want to hide the user account which is active from your log on screen. If so, you can do this by following the steps mentioned below:</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Open Elevated command prompt( I.e. command prompt with administrator rights).&nbsp;To open, press '<strong>Windows Key'
</strong>and type <strong>cmd,</strong>&nbsp;when the command prompt gets highlighted in the start menu<strong>,
</strong>hold <strong>SHIFT+CTRL </strong>key and press Enter key. It will prompt for User Account Control&nbsp;then&nbsp;select 'Yes'. Instead press '<strong>Windows Key'
</strong>and type <strong>cmd </strong>right click and select 'Run as Administrator'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>*&nbsp;Put the command line into the command prompt without quotes: <strong>"net user&nbsp;username /active:no"
</strong>and press Enter key<strong>. </strong>For example the user account name is Yashwanth then the command will look like this &nbsp;<strong>"net user&nbsp;yashwanth /active:no"</strong> (I.e. without quotes).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In future you can unhide the account by just replacing the 'no' with 'yes' in the command line.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this will work fine. Cheers!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Yashwanth Kumar</p>

            <p><span>Hi Amir,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As explained, you can make an account hide or inactive by using the command line that mentioned in my previous post. However, I get you concern, please&nbsp;try the below steps and let me know if it works:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>* Go to run command by pressing <strong><span>Windows Key+R </span></strong>and type<strong><span>âgpedit.mscâ
</span></strong>(I.e. without quotes)&nbsp;and hit Enter Key</span></p>
<p><span>*&nbsp;Navigate to Computer Configuration -&gt; Windows Settings -&gt;Security Settings -&gt; Local Policies -&gt; Security Options.</span></p>
<p><span>* In the right-hand&nbsp;side find&nbsp;<strong><span>Interactive logon: Do not display last user name
</span></strong>double click and set it to <strong><span>Disabled</span></strong> then click
<strong><span>apply</span></strong> &amp; <strong><span>ok</span></strong>.. It determines whether the name of the last user to log on to the computer is displayed in the Windows logon screen.</span></p>
<p><span>* Restart you PC to see the effect.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Try the second method if it doesn't fix the issue.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>* Navigate to &nbsp;Local Computer Policy â&gt; Computer Configuration â&gt; Administrative Templates â&gt;System â&gt; Logon</span></p>
<p><span>*&nbsp;On the&nbsp;Right side panel, find <strong><span>âHide entry points for Fast User Switchingâ
</span></strong>double click&nbsp;make it <strong><span>Enabled</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>* &nbsp;click <strong><span>apply</span></strong> &amp; <strong><span>ok </span></strong><span>and&nbsp;r</span></span><span>estart you PC to see the effect.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Regards,</span></p>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">services.exe</span> </strong>"Services and Controller App" is taking up 90% + of my CPU power most of the time. Does anyone have any idea why this should happen please?</p>

<p>Hi SpiritX and Andre,</p>
<p>Thank you both for your help &amp; concern.</p>
<p>I'm not sure ( 100 % ) if a program called "Spiceworks Desktop" was the culprit.</p>
<p>However after running <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>SFC /scannow</strong></span> and also scheduling a disk check which ran 100% with nothing untoward found,&nbsp;this evening I started my laptop, pressed F8, selected
<p>:-)</p>
<p>I'm going to set a restore point ( where it is now ) and find an up to date virus checker that will run on WINDOWS 7.</p>
<p>The one my I.S.P for FREE provide will not run on Windows 7. :-(</p>
<p>I am also going to backup everything to my large external hard-drive <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>after</strong></span> I've run a virus check.</p>
<p>I think I'll try <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Norton AntiVirus 2010 OEM</strong></span>&nbsp;from here as I've bought from ARIA before.&gt;&gt;</p>

            <p>Hi Akshat,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Are you able to view the Pen Drive in Disk Management?</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; What is the operating system installed on your computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to follow the steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: </strong>If you are able to see Pen Drive under Disk management, check the format of the Pen Drive and post back,</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Change-add-or-remove-a-drive-letter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>Change, add, or remove a drive letter</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong><span>Check the Device status of your Pen Drive and post back the status updated.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Go to Start.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Type Device Manager in the search box and open it.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Check the device is listed over there.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Right click on the device and click on properties.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Under General Tab, check the Device status.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 3: </strong>You may also try to connect the Pen Drive to a different computer and check if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 4: </strong>If you are using Windows XP as your operating system you may follow the steps from the link and check if it helps.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 reset&#58; product key doesn&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>Hi all!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to reset Windows 8.1 on a laptop that I will give to a friend. Before starting the reset procedure I created a USB recovery drive and used "Windows Product Key Viewer" to read and write down the product key. However, when prompted to enter the key
 after starting the reset process, there is a message saying "This product key can only be used to add features to Windows. It can't be used to install Windows".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop had originally an OEM version of Windows 7 installed. I bought the Windows 8 upgrade right after purchase of the laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried the product key that I found on the invoice for the Windows 8 upgrade. It didn't work either ("The product key entered does not match any of the Windows images available for installation. Enter a different product key.").</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally tried the Windows 7 product key from the original OEM version (sticker on the bottom of the laptop). Message: "This product key didn't work. Please check it and try again."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Three different keys, three different messages, but none will work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help!<br />
</p>

            <p>I am more than a little confused. The HP recovery partition should be for Windows 7 not Windows 8/8.1 so quite what you have ended up with I am not sure. A factory image cannot be updated with a new version of Windows, it has to revert back to the original.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best I can suggest is to contact Microsoft's Activation centre and run through your options, they may issue a release based on the fact that you do have a legitimate license albeit an upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Factory images are always pre-authenticated and should never ask for a key. The key is in the Windows Image in Windows 7 and in the BIOS for those computers with Windows 8 preloaded.</p>

 I have done a few quick scans but they haven't come up with anything. Basically I am totally lost and have never seen this error before, please help ASAP!!!!</p>

            <p>The system does not crash, the only thing that crashed was Steam itself when the error box first showed up. Otherwise the programs I try to run won't open at all, and the same error showed up for all of them. Also turns out my brother downloaded something
 fishy from God knows where. Did a more thorough virus scan and turns out there was two Trojans. Did what it told me to do, problem still there.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not that good with computers, so any help you guys have please keep it simple. XP ROCKS, thanks for the help but I think you got the wrong idea here, but correct if I'm wrong.</p>

<p>I played it. I played a lot of the sandbox mode( I think it was called that? IDK, but I had infinite money and couldn't fail.) I liked the game. The missions to me were hard because the food wouldn't export -_- I loved the free-roam though. You can impose
 martial law and etc and do some other neat stuff.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>It's definitely more of a rental game IMO.</p>

<p>I responded to your post giving you a link to the Tropico 3 demo. &nbsp;It's (for the most part) the exact same gameplay. &nbsp;Tropico 4 just has some extra buildings and more edicts.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The game is great, but I think initially it can feel overwhelming. &nbsp;You have to make your citizens happy, foreign diplomats on your side (more emphasis on this in T4), as well as generating an income. &nbsp;It may take you awhile to get used to it, but I think
 the initial build-up will almost always be the same.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Start with a couple farms to produce food for your people, and then build a couple farms for cash (sugar, coffee or tobacco). &nbsp;Always try to build a medical clinic, church, and high school w/in the first 5 years. &nbsp;Dang, I could give you tips for hours, but
 I managed to get good at the game going in blind.. so, I'm sure you'll manage.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>p.s.&nbsp; I'd also like to add that if you see the DLC - Modern Times - go on sale, to pick it up.&nbsp; It adds 12 more missions and a bunch of new buildings.&nbsp; I've purchased both T3 &amp; T4 and I absolute love these games.&nbsp; So stoked for Port Royale 3 next month --
 also released by Kalypso.</p>

<p>tropico 4 is fun. it is the exact same game as tropico 3 however. just a couple of added edicts, disasters and buildings... but other than that it is the most scandalous photo-copy of a previous game in any given franchise, lol. doesnt make it a bad game
 though. if you havent played 3, i would suggest jumping into 4. my only advice is to save the game to the hard drive. it feezes ALOT! and never play the biggest map. with a map that big, after about 30 years of building, it can get pretty ridiculous.</p>

<p>I have tropico 4 on PC and it is amazing. I didn't like tropico 3 though, it feels more serious in a bad way.</p>
<p>if you can get it on PC get it on PC as it lets you have more buildings and people on your island then xbox. but if not its still real fun. I am hoping they have a gold edition for xbox with all the dlc this year.</p>

<p>Great advice. I will keep it in mind. Since I cant rent Tropico 4 I might consider buying it. The demo for Tropico 3 was very fun.&nbsp; As I said above it consumed 3 hours.&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldnt believe how large the island was.&nbsp; In the demo I started going negative with
 my finances and wasnt able to recover.&nbsp;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>As for PC gaming, I dont buy games for my PC anymore.&nbsp; I&nbsp;am on a PC all day and its the last thing I want to see when I get home. So I would just consider it for the 360.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'll agree w/ Bad Instincts. &nbsp;In Tropico 3, you had to watch out how big your island got as having too many people would bog the game down and sometimes it would crash. &nbsp;In Tropico 4, they fixed most of these issues. &nbsp;It still had some bugs/corrupt save
 issues, but there weren't as many.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>As for getting out of the red... make sure you have some farms producing cash crops, ranches w/ smoked beef (if you can afford it), and try to build a mine or 2. &nbsp;Once you really start getting a steady stream of cash coming in, work on building up some industry.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>2 things I never bothered to actually try (unless the mission actually called for it) was oil &amp; tourism. &nbsp;I just stuck w/ making my Tropicans happy, and making a lot of money. &nbsp;</p>

            Am I glad you asked this question. DX11.1 was going to be for Wni8 only.<br />
It's nice to see that Monopoly$oft has decided to do the right thing for once and make<br />
it available for Win7.<br />
It'll will be a while before games make much use of it, but it's good to know that Win7 will<br />
be able to use it.<br />
<br />
You would be looking for x64 - x86 is for 32bit OS.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just had a closer look at the article - It's the same on avaricious Monopoly$oft afterall -<br />
<br />
