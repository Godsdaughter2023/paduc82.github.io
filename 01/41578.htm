<p>
</p><p>I noticed in some Windows 10 laptops.</p>

<p>Hi InTech,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having Airplane mode on and still getting internet connection through Wi-Fi and LAN connections is something that we need to verify and investigate. Some laptops may have encountered such problem, but that might be triggered by the recent updates installed,
 incompatible drivers, or could be a hardware-related issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For us to verify and investigate as to why this happens, we need to consider some information. A few would be:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When did the issue start?</li><li>Was the airplane mode working before?</li><li>Were there any changes or updates performed on the computer prior to the issue?</li><li>What's the build and version of the Windows 10 computers where you've noticed this behavior?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you have encountered this problem on your laptop, please provide us the above details so I'll be able to assist you.</p>

 computer. Wifi/LAN Internet was working even Airplane Mode was ON. I believe all where latest Windows 10 i.e. Build 1803. I don’t have more details.</span></p>

<p>Thanks for the info. I've further checked on this and basically, the WiFi connection can still be enabled on the laptop even if it's on Airplane mode. If you go to
<strong>Settings &gt; Network &amp; Internet &gt; WiFi &gt; Airplane mode</strong>, you'll see that you there's an option to
<em>toggle On</em> or <em>Off </em>the Wi-Fi connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/905d249d-ac0a-442e-bec1-71b4d2cae0ac?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/905d249d-ac0a-442e-bec1-71b4d2cae0ac?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>When the airplane mode is activated, it disables connectivity for cellular voice and data, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS and
 location based services. It does not cover the Ethernet connection. That's the reason why their laptops, when in airplane mode and is connected via Ethernet, still have internet access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if you have further questions.</p>

                    <p>Original title: Windows 10 </p>
<p>Hello <strong>Microsoft</strong>,<br />
<br />
So, I recently updated my <strong>Windows 10</strong><em>(Updates)</em>. Most recent time of my latest updates was at; (1/27/2016 3:40) After the update, I restarted my PC and noticed that I experiencing some lags, slowness, / stuttering performance. I've already
 checked for the updates, any potential dangerous threads, etc. Cleaned my <em>C:/Disk</em>, checked for the errors, etc. Nothing turned to be suspicious. It was all ok, did anybody knows the most common fix to this issue? and/or Why it might have been occur?
 I'm thinking about <em>Updates</em>, but it only upgraded me for the newer version of W10 built, and updated my Antiware
<em>(Windows Defender)</em>. Please, reply asap! Thanks in advance!</p>

            Hi Suvarna Govinda,<br />
<br />
As you see in my screenshots below, I've reset my <strong>Windows 10</strong> Yesterday, and immediately updated it. I got that problem after updating my
<strong>Windows 10</strong>. I've followed these tutorials, step by step and nothing did helped me.<br />
<br />
In that first screenshot, you can clearly see that there are no suspicious programs installed on my OS.<br />
Everything that I installed, I installed from official/trusted websites for necessary reasons. Everything that I installed yesterday, I installed before too and there wasn't any problems. I'm planning to reset my
<strong>Windows 10</strong>, but this time, I'll turn off <strong>Windows 10</strong>
<em>Updates</em>, from the <em>services.msc</em>/<em>Windows Updates</em>&nbsp;to stop its action. Is that fair to do? Also, I did that
<em>msconfig</em> things and <strong>System Maintenance</strong> check-up, there were no issues found as you can see. I'm hopeless! I don't know what to do, please reply asap! Thanks in advance!<br />

<h2>            Removing GamerTag from Child Account</h2>
                    
<p>My son got a XBOX LIVE Membership for his birthday.&nbsp; Long story short things got really *** up so I want to transfer his gamertag to another non-child account.&nbsp; I go to the XBOX, log into his account, go to the Change Microsoft Account screen, enter in his
 password, then my Live ID and Password (I'm the parent), then finally the new Live ID and password.&nbsp; I press the GREEN button and I get a message that says to go to some useless website that says nothing.&nbsp; I've tried this three times now and I get the exact
 same result.&nbsp; Is there another way to transfer this GamerTag off this child's account over to a non-Child's account?</p>

<p>This is how to promote an account from child to adult on Xbox 360</p>
<p>Age is determined by the date of birth on the Xbox Live account. Once a person turns 18, he or she can follow the steps here to promote their account.</p>
<p>On your Xbox 360 console, sign in to Xbox Live using the account that you want to change.</p>
<p>Go to Settings and select Account.</p>
<p>In the Your Information panel, select Promote Child Account. </p>
<p>Note “Promote Child Account” will only be available if the date of birth for the account indicates that you have reached adult age for your country or region.</p>
<p>If you’re prompted to sign out of a current game session, select Yes.</p>
<p>On the “Promote your current Xbox Live child account to an adult account” screen, select Continue.</p>
<p>Steps 6 through 9 apply only to accounts that are currently billed to a credit or debit card. If your account has a prepaid subscription, go to step 10.</p>
<p>On the “To promote your account, replace the credit card that is associated with the account with a new card or payment method” screen, select Continue.
</p>
<p>Note The same credit card can be used again. However, the credit card details must be re-entered.</p>
<p>Enter the name, credit card type, credit card number, expiration date, and verification code for the replacement credit card, and then select Next.</p>
<p>Enter the billing address, city, state, and postal code for your credit card, and then select Next.</p>
<p>Verify your contact information, and then select Done.</p>
<p>Accept the Xbox Live Terms of Use and the Privacy Statement.</p>
<p>On the “Your Xbox Live account is now an adult account” screen, select Done. </p>
<p>Note If your Xbox Live account doesn’t change to an adult account, try signing out and then signing back in.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community. I understand your concern and I am glad to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case there are issues with operating system, then you may try to boot in Safe mode to see if it works. In case there is an issue with system hardware (hard drive in this case), booting in safe mode will not help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Error code 0142 or&nbsp;<span>0F00:1332 indicates an issue with the hard drive. If you get this error message, you may consider replacing the hard drive of your computer. I would also recommend you to back up all the data that you need on any external USB storage
 device (If possible).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Using the </span>Windows 10 recovery drive&nbsp;You may troubleshoot.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">1. &nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Start your computer from the installation media. Insert&nbsp;the disk or USB stick and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to “<strong>Press any key to boot from DVD</strong>,”
 do so. If you don’t see the message, you might need to change the boot order in your computer's&nbsp;BIOS settings so that it first starts from the disk or USB. When you see the
<strong>'Install Windows'</strong> page, tap or click <strong>'Repair your computer'</strong> link to&nbsp;start the
<strong>Windows Recovery Environment</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">2. Here click on <strong>Troubleshoot&gt; Advance Options&gt; Startup Settings.&nbsp;</strong>You will have to click on the
<strong>Restart</strong> button, once done select the appropriate key to log into
<strong>Safe Mode</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><strong>Step 2: </strong></span><strong>Check a drive for errors</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can solve some computer problems by checking a drive or drives for errors. For example, you can check your computer's primary hard disk to fix some performance issues, or you can check an external hard drive if it's not working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Open&nbsp;<strong>This PC.</strong></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
</li><li>
<p>Right-click the drive that you want to check, and then click <strong><span>Properties</span>.</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p>Click the <span><strong>Tools</strong></span> tab, and then, under <span>Error-checking</span>, click
<span>Check now</span>.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p>To automatically repair problems with files and folders that the scan detects, select
<strong><span>Automatically fix file system errors</span></strong>. Otherwise, the disk check will report problems but not fix them.</p>
<p>To perform a thorough check, select <strong><span>Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors</span></strong>. This scan attempts to find and repair physical errors on the drive itself, and it can take much longer to complete.
</p>
<p>To check for both file errors and physical errors, select both <strong><span>Automatically fix file system errors</span></strong> and
<strong><span>Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors</span>.</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p>Click <strong><span>Start</span>.</strong></p>
</li></ol>
<p>Depending on the size of your drive, this might take several minutes. For best results, don't use your computer for any other tasks while it is checking for errors.</p>

&nbsp;I went to the Dell Support to download the wininet.dll driver and every post refers to Trojans &amp; spyware. I went into Boot device to Diagnostic and it says there are no Diagnostic Partitions to insert the Drivers &amp; Utilities CD. Unfortunately I don't have
 the disc because I purchased the computer from an individual and didn't get any CD's with it. Now I'm not sure where to start... do I install the wininet.dll or continue t o try and locate the drivers from the Dell support site?

            Not even Vista drivers for your D610 so you have a real problem. If fact none of the 600 series have Windows 7 drivers. I would guess your PC is about 5 years old.<br />

            Its a retail XP CD. I tried to copy the disc as someone suggested on here and it won't copy...gets to 84% and says it can't read the disc. I'm thinking I have a defective cd and going to request an exchange. It had windows xp pro originally however the
 computer had to be wiped out due to viruses on the hard drive. When we reinstalled xp it said it wasn't genuine which is why I purchased this software. The computer worked just said it wasn't genuine software.<br />

            <p>I'm having the very same issue. It did not start happening until I installed the most recent updates to Windows (5/18/13).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of my connected USB devices are working fine and they don't even skip a beat when the message appears. When looking at the "device manager" screen I notice "unknown device" pops up and then instantly disappears. I've even unplugged all of my USB devices
 and "unknown device" still popped up every 2-3 seconds. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've tried both methods suggested above and neither have resolved the issue. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only recent hardware changes I've made was that I have installed 4x Corsair Vengeance 8gb sticks of RAM. Even after installing the RAM I did not have this problem. It was not until yesterday I noticed it, and I had went through the Windows Update process
 the night before. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went through each device and updated drivers, all drivers are up to date.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I took the case off of the computer and searched around for loose connections, I found none.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please help!</p>

            <p>My guess is that the port/link is going into compliance mode - basically the port thinks that the device connected to the port is a compliance test device. We have seen this predominantly on systems that use&nbsp;faulty&nbsp;ReDriver circuit to fix the integrity of
 signal when the the distance from the IC to a connector or device might be far enough to result in degradation.&nbsp; A redriver provides signal conditioning that can correct for signal degradation. Search for redriver and USB3 and you will find numerous articles
 on this.</p>
<p>If you provide me ETW trace, I can confirm whether the issue you are seeing is due to compliance mode.</p>
<p>Instruction for capturing trace is given in this blog page:</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing or disabling the automatic updates for the core apps (Windows apps) and other programs may affect the performance of your computer. Microsoft recommends each computer that's running a Windows OS to be updated to experience the latest and best features.
 It's also the reason why automatic updates are turned on by default. However, "there's always an exemption to the rule" that's what they say. If you really want to stop your apps to update during start-up, you may do it via
<strong>Services</strong>. Here are the steps on how to do so:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Search for <strong>Services</strong>.</li><li>Look for <strong>Windows Update</strong>.</li><li>Right-click, then choose <strong>Properties.</strong></li><li>Click <strong>STOP</strong>, then <strong>Apply</strong> and <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Close the Services window.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>You may need to restart the computer for the changes to take effect. We suggest that you check this
<strong><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc755249(v=ws.11).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong> first to learn more about
<strong>Services</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your feedback.</p>

<h2>            Organize Mail in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Before updating to Windows 10 mail would automatically move newsletters, social media mail, junk, etc. to their prospective folders, leaving my inbox with only the mail that I wanted to see. &nbsp;After updating my mail all goes to one combined inbox...not organized
 at all. &nbsp;Can anyone help me get this back to the way it was? &nbsp;If not is there any way I can de-upgrade my mail so I get it back to the way it was? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>You have pointed to the Window 8 mail app, which is different from the Windows 10 mail app.<br />
The Windows 10 mail app doesn't have even the functionality that was in the very limited Windows 8 mail app.</p>

            <p style="margin-left: 60px">I don't understand why these responders are not answering the questions. Instead the responder just post a link to refer to, which does not solve the problem. The issue is productivity. windows 10 mail has made using it as the mail
 app less productive in comparison to mail in windows 8.1. There is no way to organize mail, create folders or favorites for specific email recipients. For example, when my Territory or market manager would email me I was able to have a folder that ONLY contained
 emails from them. It made it easier to sort throouh emails that were not as important.&nbsp; The ability to do this is gone. Now in order to do this I have to go to the web app create a bunch of rules and sync them with my windows mail app on my surface. I can't
 believe the developers thought this was a positive thing. This is a productivity app. why would features be removed to make the user less productive. This forced me to download a third party mail app to use. I could use Outlook which is a fantastic app. However,
 I don't need something that feature rich. Mail in windows 8.1 was the killer app that cause me to purchase a surface pro three.

            <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>I am having the exact same issue with the windows 10 mail app.</p>
<p>I just tried getting an answer from the Microsoft tech support online and was given the url for the windows 8.1 "way to organise your&nbsp;mail" tutorial. Which is fantastic if you are using windows 8.1, however useless if you are using windows 10. I do not understand
 why they can't just admit that you are unable to create any new folders to organise your mail if you have the window 10 mail app. Very annoying.</p>

<h3> imperious queen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 always unreliable - Apps &#38; Store don&#39;t work at random after multiple fixes</h2>
                    <p>Can someone please explain as to why we windows 10 users are constantly having issues with the App store along with Windows 10 apps? Every single month since downloading windows 10 I have to spend at least a day or 2 sometimes a week trouble shooting the
 "app store won't launch" issues along with randomly affected apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every month I have to scour the internet for fixes and have run all kinds of command prompts. Truth is this never happened with windows 8, 7 or lower versions. I have never had to devote so much time to making an app store and apps work on my laptop. At
 this point I hate windows 10 I have created so much work with Win10 apps and it is unfair that Microsoft can just throw our work away over and over again. It is unfair to ask us to upgrade to a product that is just too unreliable to do any kind of serious
 business. I can't present to potential clients because guess what my apps aren't working again and this happens on random days at random times (happened again this morning). I have lost so much time trouble shooting windows 10 "I can't use my apps, can't use
 the store" issues and I am just so tired of having to trouble shoot . </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a final fix???? You know something that actually works for more than a month???? Or is it that Microsoft doesn't value the time of there users? Is it that Microsoft has so many users it doesn't even care about the quality of product it puts out
 anymore???? I feel as though I have fixed this issue a hundred times since installing the upgrade last summer. &nbsp;I have had to verify and re-verify my products and services to a painful degree. I just need a fix that allows the app store and the windows 10
 apps that are affected to work for more than a week or month I need this to work as it is advertised. Please be advised I am looking for a permanent fix not a "try this and see if it works" fix.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Enforcement, console ban ended but has not been lifted - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Enforcement, console ban ended but has not been lifted</h2>
                    <p>I had a one week console ban on 7/4, it ended on July 11. Since the console ban has ended, it no longer allows you to submit a case review so I cannot appeal my problem of not being able to talk in party chat or send messages. It looks like the ban was not lifted correctly, as I have no active suspensions. I can play online games and everything, even send messages online through the xbox-live website. I&nbsp;have talked to supervisors who are effectively useless because they "don't have an answer". I've tried all troubleshooting steps. Nothing works. It's one week since the ban was "lifted" still can't access the party and message features. Chat support said post here. But I already know what the responses will be. Same song and dance. This is getting extremely ridiculous. I can't submit a case review because the suspension is not active so don't even go there. Basically the privileges have not been restored correctly by the enforcement team.</p>

    <title>S&#47;MIME Issues with IE 11 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            S&#47;MIME Issues with IE 11</h2>
                    I have S/MIME installed for IE 11, and use it for Outlook WebApp for work. When S/MIME is installed, I can't view encrypted emails and I can't send emails at all. Any advice on how to fix this? Any help would be appreciated.

            I'm having the same problems with S/MIME on IE 11 (Windows 10).&nbsp; When enabled all signed/encrypted emails show up blank.&nbsp; If you disable the control then you can view the signed emails (not encrypted of course).&nbsp; Don't have this problem on Windows 7 with
 IE 11, only my Windows 10 loads.

<p>I resolved this issue with opening digitally signed and encrypted emails with OWA on Windows 10 using IE 11 by performing the following steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Open 32 bit Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Click the gear icon located on the top right corner of the browser.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Select Safety menu and then turn on ActiveX Filtering by selecting it.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Click the gear icon again.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; Select internet options.</p>
<p>6.&nbsp; Select security, trusted sites, and then click the sites button.</p>
<p>7.&nbsp; Add the URL of&nbsp;your OWA to the trusted list.&nbsp; i.e. <a href="https://osan.mail.us.af.mil" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://osan.mail.us.af.mil</a></p>
<p>Edit: 7.A. If you have issues sending emails, you may need to add an underlying URL, like
<a href="https://web.mail.us.af.mil" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://web.mail.us.af.mil</a>. or <a href="https://web.mail.mil" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://web.mail.mil</a>.&nbsp; This step was not required for me, but may be required for others.</p>
<p>8.&nbsp; Navigate to your OWA site.</p>
<p>9.&nbsp; At the top of the URL bar, you should see a circle with a diagonal line through it.</p>
<p>10.&nbsp; Click that circle and then click Turn Off ActiveX Filtering.&nbsp; If you don't do this for the OWA site, you will not be able to download, or use S/MIME.</p>
<p>11.&nbsp; Verify S/MIME is installed by going to the OWA options, see all options, settings, S/MIME.</p>
<p>12.&nbsp; Download and install if required, otherwise you should see the two checkboxes for sign and encrypt.</p>
<p>13.&nbsp; A final step if you are still having issues would be to add site to your compatibility view options.&nbsp; I did not have to perform this step.</p>
<p>Edit: 14.&nbsp; forgot to mention.&nbsp; After performing all of these steps, close your browser and reopen for changes to take effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!&nbsp; </p>

                    <p>Mein controller funktioniert nicht mehr ganz. Ich hab ein Problem mit dem steuerkreuz, die Taste für hoch reagiert nicht mehr. Hab den schon aufgeschraubt und Kreuz entfernt und so drauf gedrückt es klappt nur wenn man mehrfach mit Kraft auf diese silberplätchen drückt.&nbsp;</p><p>Update hat leider nichts gebracht. Ersatzteile sind schon drin geht aber auch nicht... Das plätchen kann ich nicht ersetzen da an der Controller Platine dran :(</p>

<p>Leider hast Du den Controller schon selbst aufgeschraubt und herumgebastelt. </p>
<p>Ansonsten hättest Du den Controller zur Reparatur an Microsoft schicken können. Falls der Controller noch innerhalb der Garantie gewesen wäre sogar kostenlos.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jetzt bleibt Dir nichts anderes übrig, als einen neuen Controller zu kaufen. Oder einen Gebrauchten Controller, der ein anderes Problem hat, und von dem das Board als Ersatzteil zu nehmen.

<h2>            CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST MICROSOFT and this WINDOWS 10 everything</h2>
                    Microsoft faces $600m lawsuit over forced Windows 10 upgrade<br />
<a href="https://www.pcauthority.com.au/news/microsoft-faces-600m-lawsuit-over-forced-windows-10-upgrade-485569" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcauthority.com.au/news/microsoft-faces-600m-lawsuit-over-forced-windows-10-upgrade-485569</a>, posted
 on Feb 18, 2018<br />
I am preparing to start a CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT against MICROSOFT, because<br />
and this is the most recent issue. I am a computer technician for 30 plus years.<br />
When downloading this Windows Media Creation toolkit,...<br />
I have a PATRIOT 16GB thumb drive that I had a folder on, which I deleted it<br />
Then I ran the Windows Media Creation tool kit on and ended up getting this error of<br />
0x80042405-0xA001A<br />
I called Microsoft. Level 1 says tried the same thing, and got the same error, and blame it on<br />
a NETWORK ERROR, so he downloaded a WINDOWS 7 tool to make it a bootable thumb drive,&nbsp;<br />
then used my ISO file for the Windows 10 installation, and it did not work either.<br />
I found this chat about this error, and am trying it now, but I expect to see the same error...<br />
I have had many clients return the computers that my company and I have sold to them, namely<br />
DELL, HP, LENOVO, and I end up losing my commission as well as the customer has to pay<br />
$99.00 an hour for me to come out. I AM TIRED OF FIXING MICROSOFT ERRORS... meanwhile they collect their BILLIONS OF DOLLARS from us, and claim we can just call them to get them to fix the problems, spending HOURS ON THE PHONE WITH THEM. If you ask me, they
 need to fix their software before making available to the PUBLIC. I see LOTS OF ERRORS with WINDOWS 10, worst that VISTA ever was... TIME FOR A LAWSUIT, and<br />
if you ask me, Microsoft needs to be brought in front of CONGRESS to testify as to what they are doing with<br />
this WINDOWS 10 STUFF!!! BIG TIME<br />
<br />
THE problem just popped up with the SAME ERROR popped up in the Windows Media Creation toolkit, and it is the same error<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7ff69b00-f009-47ae-a704-efe97c7169bd?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7ff69b00-f009-47ae-a704-efe97c7169bd?upload=true" /></a>

<p>I used to get this same error about half the time making USB flash drives using the Media Creation Tool.&nbsp; Sometimes it would work and sometimes I could Quick Format the drive and then it would work. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the MCT for the 1803 Feature Update it was getting the error every time.&nbsp; What I finally figured out was if my USB flash drive was formatted with NTFS instead of FAT32 the MCT worked perfectly.&nbsp; Given the small size if your USB flash drive I'd guess
 it came formatted as FAT32.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is actually a big thread here on Microsoft's forums about this error.</p>

<p>There are lots of other tools out there for creating USB bootable drives for installing software - perhaps try downloading the ISO for Windows then use another tool if the MCT isn't working for some reason?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Out of interest why are customers returning 3 different mainstream OEM manufacturer computers to you?&nbsp; The only returns we get here are if hardware has failed shortly after purchase, not because of Microsoft problems?</p>

            It is pretty simple, and the customers are not returning the computers to "ME", but to my company.<br />
The customer(s) said they let Windows do an update, and end up with a BLACK SCREEN, and that<br />
was within a week, or so.<br />
There should be NO REASON as to, I have to go out and RESEARCH, to find a tool to make a bootable<br />
USB thumb drive, in order to put this Windows 10 ISO on it. What is the point that MICROSOFT puts a<br />
tool out there if it is not going to work. (Like we have all the time in the world to do things like this).<br />
You would certainly think, as BIG as MICROSOFT is, and considering how long they have been around<br />
with their OWN software, they would have been able to figure out ALL the possibilities as to what is<br />
going on. I should not have to spend ANY TIME, AT ALL, having to do any research, to figure out WHY<br />
something that MICROSOFT has posted on their WEBSITE, DOES NOT WORK.<br />
If you buy a new car, would you appreciate, having to go out and RESEARCH why the brand new car<br />
is not running correctly, when you get it cranked up? ARE YOU KIDDING??? I guess you have all the
<br />
time in the world, to do things like this. I personally DO NOT want to spend any time trying to figure<br />
out what is wrong with something, that MICROSOFT says will resolve a Windows 10 problem...

            Robert, to be honest, you seem to be more interested in ranting in all caps about Class Action Lawsuits than getting help for real issues.&nbsp; I took the time to post a possible solution to your Media Creation Tool problem, but you completely ignored it.&nbsp;
 It's a surprise that you haven't been banned from the forum by now.<br />

<p>
</p><p>What I find odd is that you are getting returns from 3 different mainstream OEM manufacturers that have a wide customer base on Windows 10 very successfully.&nbsp; Is there a common build at play, common software etc?&nbsp; Something doesn't add up there and I think
 getting to the bottom of that is key.&nbsp; There should be no reason for you getting this wide a range of returns.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, didn't realise that making a USB bootable is a researchable job.&nbsp; Sometimes plan A doesn't work, plan B does, that's life in the tech business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft are just not going to be able to anticipate all the permutations of software and hardware that Windows is installed on.&nbsp; Just think about all the possible combinations that are out in the wild.&nbsp; But, I refer back to my first point, there should
 be no reason for 3 different mainstream manufacturers devices having failures of this level so is there something else at play that's throwing a spanner in the works?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On your final point, it would be great if we just hit start and it worked.&nbsp; Unfortunately the reality is that things have never worked like this, for many reasons - I am surprised you don't know this being a 30-year veteran in IT.&nbsp; Most of the time its plain
 sailing but not always, that's where IT professionals come in to bridge between the vendors and the businesses / end users.</p>

            I support you 100%, this type of conduct would be unacceptable in any other sectore; essentially we are all paying to be Beta testers. Microsoft's response; "just do a clean uninstall"... Why should i have to waste my time and lose all my data because
 yout forced an update on me...i even have the update service turned off. Uggh it just frustrates me. Good luck and i support you 100%

            No Ranting in CAPS about this. I don't come to this forum 24x7 to see what is going on. I stay too busy. This is NOT about RANTING... This is about all the customers I see that purchase a new computer, only to have Windows Update mess it up. The only reason
 Microsoft would BAN me, might be because I am speaking truths and facts. Microsoft is a $BILLION$ corporation. This would be called "HIDING THE FACTS FROM THE PUBLIC". You would certainly think, that after all the years of being in business, and all the developers
 and QA people on staff, that would certainly have worked out all the bugs in their software, by the time it reaches the Windows Update platform. This 1709 update had LOTS OF BUGS in it, along with the Windows Media Creation tool. How is that possible? When
 developing software, you certainly want to BETA TEST the heck out of it, before releasing it to the public. Are you kidding? Perhaps you don't deal with customers getting new computers on a daily basis, which would NOT allow you to see what I am talking about.
 Here is a link on YouTube, about this very think that people are experiencing about this MCT, some have fixes, and some are showing this error... (TAKE YOUR PICK FROM THIS LIST - I suppose you want MICROSOFT to get with GOOGLE, and BAN these video's too??
 Right?):<br />

Like i said. You would think, after being in business for YEARS and making $BILLIONS$ of our hard earned dollars, they would be beyond this type of stupidity... And yet this problem continues.<br />
Perhaps you should ask yourself "WHY IS THIS STILL HAPPENING"!!!<br />
My latest ( 5/16/18) experience with this type of problem. Customer had a computer that had problems. This IS a new computer, mind you... It was not READING "ANY" CD on a continuous basis. Basically, you insert the CD/DVD and nothing would happen, "SOMETIMES".
 Other times, it would read the CD/DVD, where you have the little window open up in the bottom right corner of the desktop, showing you the drive letter. Again, other times, this would not happen, no matter how many times you took out the CD and inserted it
 again. The customer and I tried different type of CD's and DVD. and still the same thing. Also ran MALWAREBYTES on the computer, but NO VIRUSES, at all.<br />
I contacted Microsoft about this, and the Microsoft Supervisor remoted into the computer, and the very first thing she did, was to look at the WINVER, which was 1709. She immediately started upgrading the computer to 1803. I ask her if this problem was due
 to the Version of Windows on the computer (1709), and was she wanting to do the update to 1803 to resolve this, and she said "YES"... Of course, my customer had to pay $99.00 an hour to get me and my company out to fix this... WHY ARE WE STILL DEALING WITH
 THIS STUPIDITY, and more importantly, why are customers having to spend money like this, to resolve MICROSOFTS problems? Do you actually think that the End Users wants to become a computer tech and learn how to fix these things themselves??? This is like:
 You go buy a new car, and you have to start diagnosing why the car is not working correctly, meaning you are having to become a car mechanic, just to drive your car, or are you going to take it to a mechanic? In the first place, there should be NO REASON,
 with a new car, that you have to start fixing it, just as it should be with a NEW COMPUTER... ARE YOU KIDDING.
<br />
If you want to say I am RANTING, then SO BE IT!!! I like ranting about customers who are getting ripped off from companies that aren't paying attention, and expect the customer to just PUT UP WITH IT. Oh, they say, you can contact Microsoft, to fix the problem,
 but just as in a car, I do not BUY a computer, or car, just to have to start FIXING IT in the first or second week or having it!!!<br />

            Maybe after 30+ years of being in IT it's time to retire? Seems like getting out of the business would help your blood pressure if nothing else.<br />
I have 5 more years myself and I'll be out of IT for good!

<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have checked all the settings and the laptop is not allowed to turn off wifi to save power and I have changed all the network adapter and sleep settings to do the same. Yet still the wifi is disconnected when i close the lid for any period of time. Never
 used to do this, only a recent phenomenon.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have recently started using laptops connection for xbox live and had to stop the wifi from&nbsp;being disconnected while laptop slept but the changes didn't work. I had to stop sleep altogether.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I want my laptop to sleep when lid is closed to save power but not disconnect wfi.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />

<p><b>Method 1: </b>Change the power management settings of the wireless card:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on ‘Start’ and right click on ‘My Computer’ and click on ‘Manage’.</li><li>Click on ‘Device Manager’.</li><li>Click the + sign to expand the ‘Network Adapters’ entry.</li><li>Right-click the wireless adapter and click ‘Properties’.</li><li>Click on 'Power Management'.</li><li>Uncheck 'Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power'.</li><li>Click on 'Ok'.</li></ol>
<div><b>Method 2: </b>Also, change the power options for the wireless card:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Click 'Start<b>'</b>.</li><li>Click 'Control Panel'.</li><li>Click 'System and Maintenance'.</li><li>Click 'Power Options'.</li><li>Click on 'Change Plan settings' depending on the power plan your system is using currently.</li><li>Click 'Change advanced power settings'. Balanced [Active] should automatically show in the dropdown box.</li><li>Click the <b>+</b> symbol in front of 'Wireless Adapter Settings' to expand the section.</li><li>Click the <b>+</b> symbol in front of 'Power Savings Mode' to expand the section.</li><li>Select 'Maximum Power Savings' for the 'On Battery' setting.</li><li>Click on 'Apply'.</li></ol>
<p><b>Method 3: </b>I would also suggest you to update the drivers for the wireless card from the manufacturers website.<br />

    <title>Bluetooth Mouse either does not connect or stops working after moving - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> d. zydek  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth Mouse either does not connect or stops working after moving stops</h2>
                    <p>Before I go into more detail, here's what I'm using:<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Macbook Pro 2016 with Touch Bar (Model A1706)</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Tecknet BM307 Bluetooth mouse</strong></em></p>
<br />
<strong><em>Windows 10 Home (Version 1803, OS build 17134.165)<br />
</em></strong><em>I got the product key from my previous Windows laptop (HP Streambook 13")<br />
and used it in account settings.</em><strong><em><br />
</em></strong>The subject explains it all, I use bootcamp rather than MacOS, which has no problem pairing with the mouse, but trying to connect it in Windows is not too easy. Whenever I attempt to connect, it detects the mouse and keeps showing "Connecting..."
 for hours on end, or it would connect and it would work as normal, but it has to stay moving or otherwise it simply stops working. Windows says it's connected and the mouse is still turned on and with full batteries but the pointer won't move.<br />
<br />
After countless looking around frequently asked questions including Microsoft's, it simply just says turn the mouse on and off or restart the system which doesn't work. I unpaired it in MacOS to see if it worked, but no changes.<br />
<br />
Now, I'm just not sure. Windows clearly has the drivers installed but it has problems keeping a connection with the mouse, or that's what I think. Sure, the touchpad is nice, but I find using a mouse far more easier when I'm at the desk.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?

<h2>            Windows 10 Update Fail</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I have a Windows Update failure that I just cannot solve.&nbsp; Please help as I have literally tried about 20-30 times over 2-3 months but still fails (and it takes at least an hour each time for goodness sake!)</p>
<p>- "PC is running Windows Version - 14393.&nbsp; The latest version is 16299".</p>
<p>- "Feature update to Windows 10, version 1709" - Fails repeatedly.</p>
<p>- Update now leads to a black screen that does not resolve (I've left for over 8 hours a couple of times).&nbsp; Note that this is not a display issue as I have checked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I include below detail about my system and the many steps I have taken to try to resolve.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder is a 'device' is causing the update to fail, even though all unnecessary are unplugged and all drivers have been updated to the current/ latest?&nbsp; Note that there are a number of items reported under system "[Conflicts/Sharing]" below?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>
</p><p>===========================================================</p>
<p>
</p><p>STEPS I HAVE TAKEN TO TRY TO RESOLVE...</p>
<div>1) Check for status of windows updates - Search for in Cortana<br />
2) Make file space on your C Drive by deleting the 'SoftwareDistribution' folder in Step 7.<br />
2) Turn of Windows Defender - Search for in Cortana<br />
3) Turn Off my Virus Protection - Avast (have deleted it completely)<br />
4) Turn off background services/ programmes to create a 'Clean boot in Windows' - Go to Run, System Configuration, Services, Tick 'Hide All Microsoft Services', 'Disable All Services'.<br />
5a) Unplug all unnecessary USBs<br />
5b) Update all Drivers - Open Device Manager, right click on each driver and update via an internet search<br />
6) Clean up the C Drive/ ensure sufficient drive space - Right Click on it in Windows Explorer &gt; Tools Error Checking &gt; Optimise and Defrag<br />
7) Run Windows Update Troubleshooter</div>
<div>8) Delete the Windows Update folder.<br />
&nbsp;The Windows Update folder (C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution), is the location where Windows stores the new updates after downloading them. In many cases, the “SoftwareDistribution” folder’s contents become corrupted and cause problems during downloading or
 installing updates. At these cases all these problems can be easily bypassed if you delete the “SoftwareDistribution” folder.<br />
&nbsp;To delete the Windows Update folder:<br />
&nbsp;1. Simultaneously press the Win&nbsp; + R keys to open the run command box.<br />
&nbsp;2. Type the following command and press OK "services.msc"<br />
&nbsp;3. From the list of services, at the right pane locate the 'Windows Update' service.<br />
&nbsp;4. Right click on “Windows Update” service and choose Stop. *<br />
&nbsp;5. Close “Services” window.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;* Note: If you cannot stop the Windows Update service, then:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;a. Double click on it to open its Properties.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Set the Startup type to Disabled and click OK.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;c. Restart you computer.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;d. After restart, continue to the next step.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;6. Open Windows Explorer and navigate to C:\Windows folder.<br />
&nbsp;7. Locate and then Delete the 'SoftwareDistribution' folder. *<br />
&nbsp;* Notes:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;1. If you cannot delete the folder with error “Folder in use – try again”, then restart Windows in “Safe Mode” (Hold 'Shift' whilst selecting 'Restart' on the Power Menu) and repeat the procedure.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;2. If you have disabled the Windows Update service (Startup type = Disabled), then go to services and set the Startup type to Automatic.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;8. Restart your computer.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;9. After the restart, go to Start &nbsp; &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;10. Check for updates and install them.</div>
<div>9) If 1-8 doesn't work...<br />
&nbsp;Download and install the Windows 10 v1709 Update Manually.<br />
&nbsp;The next method, to resolve the issues while downloading or installing the Windows 10 Fall Creators update 1709, is to download and install the update using the “Windows Update Assistant”: To do that:<br />
&nbsp;1. Navigate to Windows 10 download site and click the Update now button - https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10<br />
&nbsp;2. When asked, click to Run the “Windows10Upgrade9252.exe” file to start the installation immediately, or click the Save button to run the installer later.<br />
&nbsp;3. Finally click the Update Now button and follow the on screen prompts to install the Update.</div>
<div>10) If 1-9 doesn't work...<br />
&nbsp;Repair System Files with SFC.<br />
&nbsp;If you still experience problems with the Windows Update installation, then try to repair Windows System files by using the SFC command line tool. To do that:<br />
&nbsp;1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator. To do that:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;a. In the Search box type: cmd (or command prompt).<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;b. Right click on the command prompt (result) and select Run as Administrator.<br />
&nbsp;2. Type the following command and press Enter:&nbsp;"SFC /SCANNOW"<br />
&nbsp;3. When the SFC scan is completed, try to install the Windows 10 Fall Creators 1709 update again.</div>
<div>11) If 1-10 doesn't work...<br />
&nbsp;FIX Windows corruption errors with the DISM command line tool.<br />
&nbsp;1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator.<br />
&nbsp;2. At the command prompt window, type the following command &amp; press Enter: "Dism.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /Restorehealth"<br />
&nbsp;3. Be patient until DISM repairs component store.<br />
&nbsp;4. When the operation is completed, you should be informed that the component store corruption was repaired.<br />
&nbsp;5. Close command prompt window and restart your computer.<br />
&nbsp;6. Check for updates and install them.</div>
<div><br />
12) Download the latest Service Stack Catalogue - http://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB4058702</div>
<div>13) Perform an in-place upgrade via the "Windows 10 Update Assistant"<br />
Download the Windows 10 Media Creation Tool (MCT) and use it to perform an “in-place upgrade” of Windows 10. We have a video that can show you how if you aren’t sure.<br />

<p>Thanks both for taking the time to respond.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've now solved, but took multiple cycles of 'action, new issue, new issue resolutions, repeat' to get there over the course of four days totalling about 30 update attempts.&nbsp; Crazy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since posting above, I took the following action: &nbsp;</p>
<p>- I attempted to complete the "in-place upgrade" which failed, but was useful because provided three different error codes I could work through to resolve - all driver related issues.</p>
<p>- So, I installed some free, excellent drive update tools (Driver Booster, Driver Pack, Device Clean Up) which deleted about 30 unnecessary drivers, and update about 80 old drivers.</p>
<p>- In-Place upgrade still failed!</p>
<p>- I then attempted a clean install via a USB drive, but this failed and created an endless reboot cycle.</p>
<p>- I changed boot order preference to USB first (via the bios), then attempted to install again, but turns out that both my C &amp; D drivers were the incorrect file structure type for windows to accept the install.</p>
<p>- So then managed to format and change C drive file structure type via Command Prompt, which then enabled me to install Widows 10 from new, including the latest 1709 update.</p>
<p>- I'm just working through update of all software content again, everything from Drive Updates again to Steam/ games, Spotify etc</p>
<p>
</p><p>I worked through all of the above via google searched and YouTube videos.&nbsp; Life Savers!</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So, a massive time consuming effort but feels like it's probably now solved for the long term.&nbsp; I hope.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks again.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows update 1709 &#40;KB4056892&#41;</h2>
                    Updated Windows 10 to 1709 after much frustration. Now I keep getting reminders to restart to finish upgrade. When I restart the computer it appears to be OK with no stalls or error messages. But I continue to get reminders to restart to complete the upgrade.
 My system still reports build 16299.15 and does not upgrade to 16299.192. Very difficult to troubleshoot when no errors are being reported.

            I followed the instructions as posted. Update troubleshooter detected 3 problems and reported them as fixed. However, it did not change the results. I'm still showing restart required (after several restarts) and the build number is unchanged.

<h2>            App with Chinese&#47;Japanese characters preventing from restarting</h2>
                    <p>I get the following message with Chinese/Japanese characters preventing my SP3 from restarting. I have a new windows 10 installation with some programs/apps installed from well known software vendors, all licensed and official. I reinstalled windows 10 on
 suspicion of virus and repeated install of basic programs, same occurred. If this&nbsp;is&nbsp;a legit message from a known vendor, this vendor should be summoned to change to English on English installations. Could this be virus/malware? Antivirus did not find anything.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Egbert,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community.<br />
We appreciate your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perform <strong>Safe mode and clean boot </strong>and check if the issue is resolved</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>a. </strong>To go to <strong>safe mode</strong> follow the steps below</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Safe mode is a troubleshooting option for Windows that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The word Safe Mode appear in the corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode
 you are using.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Use the power button on the sign-in screen to <strong>
Shift + Restart</strong>. This will take you to the recovery boot menu. </p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> Click <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>,
<strong>Advanced options</strong>, <strong>Startup settings</strong>. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You then see a list where you can choose&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Safe Mode</span></strong><span>&nbsp;or&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Safe Mode with Networking</span></strong><span>&nbsp;(depending on whether you think you’ll need the Internet).</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>To know more about <strong>Safe mode, </strong>following is an article on <strong>
Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode) </strong>(Applies to Windows 10 also)<strong>:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>b. </strong>To perform <strong>Clean boot</strong>, follow the link below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</strong></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Disclaimer: </span></strong><span>To start the computer in normal mode refer the section,
<strong><span>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting
</span></strong>from the link above.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Get back to us if you have queries regarding Windows, we will be happy to help you.<br />

<p>
</p><p>It does not resolve my problem. There are no services or other boot processes that can be identified to relate to the message. The SP3 runs fine, but it is a concern to get a Chinese? app running. There seems to be other similar incidents.</p>
<p>

            <p>I just saw this same issue in my computer when trying to reboot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You ou provide instructions on how to boot into safe mode, but I need information on what I should be looking for or how to identify what would be causing this.&nbsp;</p>

 a conversion resulted in <em>TrusteerNotificationAreaMsgBox.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>So it is likely that users with this shutdown issue have a IBM product such as

<h2>            Wireless Broadband error messages</h2>
                    I have XP, Service Pack 3.<br />
When I plug in my 4G Wireless Broadband device, I get 3 different error messages-
<br />
1. The wrong volume is in the drive. Please insert volume BigPond Mobile Broadband into drive I.
<br />
2. The application failed to initialize properly (0xc0000006). Click on OK to terminate the application. and
<br />
3. Exception Processing Message c0000013 Parameters 75b6bf7c 4 75b6bf7c 75b6bf7c.
<br />
I am still able to use wireless broadband, but am concerned about these messages and any problem. Can you help please? Richard

            <p><span>Hi Richard,<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you receiving the error only while using 4G Wireless Broadband device?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Which wireless broadband device are you using?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any software or hardware changes on your computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<br />
Let’s follow these methods &amp; check if the issue persists:</span></p>
<p><b><span><br />
Method 1</span></b></p>
<p><span>You may follow the steps suggested in this link:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_xp-system/windows-no-disk-exception-processing-message/b1a67525-d5e8-46ae-9801-6b169547e656">Windows
 No Disk Exception Processing Message c0000013 Parameters 75b6b7c 4 75b6bf7c 75b6bf7c</a></span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious
 problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be solved. Using Third Party Software is at your own risk.</span></p>
<p><b><span><br />
Method 2</span></b></p>
<p><span>You may configure the computer in clean boot state and check if the issue persists.
</span><span>It will start Windows XP by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs and helps to eliminate software conflicts.
</span></p>
<p><span>The following link has steps showing how to perform clean boot:
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353</span></a><span><br />
<b>Note:</b> Please ensure that the computer is set to start as usual by following the section ‘Steps to configure Windows to use a Normal startup state’ from the above article.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Hope the information helps.<br />
