            <p>Hi Clark,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue occurs because some computers have hybrid video cards that are not yet compatible with Internet Explorer 10 for Windows 7. Internet Explorer 10 will not install on these computers until updated hardware drivers are available for these video cards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>Method 1: Refer to the steps from the following Microsoft article, which will help us to resolve this issue.</strong></span></p>

<p>Hi Don,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We noticed that your post has been idle for two days. We just want to check on things and confirm if you're still experiencing the issue. If so, we'd be glad to assist you in any way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To set your expectations, please take note that the Windows Hello feature requires a special infrared camera. As such, not all cameras will support the feature and this may be a possible reason.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you were able to use it before, it would be advisable to check if all your device drivers are updated. In addition, it helps to backtrack on your activity and see if there were significant changes made in your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the flip side, if you're using Surface, you may want to check this <strong>
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/security-sign-in-and-accounts/windows-hello?os=windows-10&amp;=undefined" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> for some troubleshooting suggestions to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any additional input from your end would be appreciated.</p>

<h2>            Windows Live Mail not working after auto update to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Windows Live Mail</p>
<p>
</p><p>After my computer auto updated to Windows 10, nothing would work correctly, so I had to have the update removed. &nbsp;After it was removed, my windows live mail said that I have over 4000 emails (unread)--long story short, my local internet company thought that
 the best thing to do would be to delete my old email account, and then re-add it in hopes of eliminating all of the mess. &nbsp;Upon doing so, I have the new account, but the old account still exists, and I cannot get it to delete. &nbsp;Over on the left side, under
 quick views is the old account, &nbsp;then the new account shows up, &nbsp;then the old account &nbsp;with the 4,000 emails. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When I right click on the old account and select remove account, nothing happens at all, no error message, nothing.<br />

            <p>There are numerous instances in which the "reversion" process failed to return Windows 7 to a functioning system.&nbsp; Many have spent many hours trying to get things working properly again.&nbsp;&nbsp; My advice is to save yourself all that hassle and simply re-install
 Windows 7 fresh and clean.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<em><strong>Win10 back to Win7</strong></em>
</p><p>
</p><div>
<p>Copy&nbsp;your data off first.&nbsp; If you can not boot your system, remove the hard drive and put it into a USB external drive housing.&nbsp; Connect to a working PC, copy the data off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Always check to ensure the hard drive you are about to rebuild is actually sound from a hardware perspective.&nbsp; Download and run your hard drive manufacturer’s drive testing software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Read Woody Leonhard’s advice first, to see if you can complete the restoration without a re-install.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/3033806/microsoft-windows/how-to-roll-back-your-windows-10-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>However, if you are unable to make the reversion back to Windows 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;You should do a complete re-install.&nbsp;&nbsp;The only absolutely sure way to have a perfectly clean system.&nbsp; In the install process, it is called a “Custom” install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need a Win7 install disk.&nbsp; You will need a legal product code and the win7 disk must match the edition of the code and its bitness (32 or 64).&nbsp; If you do not have the original Windows 7 install disk, borrow one from a friend.&nbsp; If that disk has SP1
 (Service Pack 1) on it, it will save you many hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BEFORE you start the re-install, download (32 or 64 bit versions) KB3020369, &nbsp;KB3102810, and KB3161608 in advance, and store on a USB stick,&nbsp; Note:&nbsp; When you search for the&nbsp; 64 bit versions of these KB’s specify 64 bit.&nbsp; The 32 bit versions do not say which
 version they are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NEVER install anything but Windows Updates until your system is up to date.&nbsp; Once you have the update list, install all of them together.&nbsp; Installing updates in batches will not speed the process or make it better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Boot your system to the Windows 7 install disk.&nbsp; When it asks where to store the system, click Advanced.&nbsp; Delete all partitions. Proceed with the install until you get your new desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Change Windows Update setting to Never check for updates.&nbsp; This is the setting you want to keep.</li><li>BEFORE the newly installed system can go online for the first time, <em><strong>disconnect
</strong></em>the computer from the Internet.&nbsp; This timing is critical.</li><li>Manually install KB3020369 and restart.</li><li>Manually install KB3161664 and restart.</li><li>Manually install KB3161608 and restart</li><li>Restore the Internet connection and launch Windows Update as normal.</li><li>After a few minutes, you should have&nbsp;plenty of updates to download and install.</li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">After Windows 7, system drivers and all updates are installed and any stable applications like Microsoft Office are installed and updated, and
<em><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">before</span></strong> </em>any data or dynamic applications are installed such as antivirus software, create a system image.&nbsp; It will take 3 or&nbsp;6 DVD
<em><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">+</span></strong></em>Rs (not -Rs) and about an hour.&nbsp; When you are done you will have a very nice bit of insurance.&nbsp; Should you ever again need to re-build a corrupted system or replace a hard drive,
 you will have a precise duplicate of your system as it was at time you made this image.&nbsp; You can restore that image to a hard drive in about 20 minutes.&nbsp; Creation of System Image is found in your menu under Maintenance, Backup and Restore.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Another great feature about using the image is that you do not need an install disk or a product key to do the re-install the next time.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I emphasize the need for <strong>PLUS</strong> R DVD blanks.&nbsp; Do not use the more common MINUS R DVD blanks.</p>

<h2>            Is it cheating to use a fighting stick online if it has turbo&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I wanted to know if it was cheating or against the rules to use a Hori arcade stick online.I thought about buying the premium one but found out it has turbo?Could you be banned for using one online?I'm afraid I'll be playing online in a match and accidently
 turn it on or something.</p>

<p>Technically yes, it can be classed as using a method to exploit a game. It's not an officially supported product and is generally frowned upon in fighting communities.</p>
<p>If you want to be good, and be respected online, don't use it, ever.</p>

<p>ummm no. you wont get banned for using a fight stick since fighitng games almost require a fight stick if you want to get really good.

<p>Thats like asking if using a racing wheel in a racinggame will get you banned.</p>

                    I installed Google Chrome on Windows 8 Release Preview and the web pages that come up look very fuzzy.&nbsp; Does MS Windows 8 do this on purpose, so people will stop using Google Chrome and will continue using Internet Explorer.&nbsp; The same page that comes up
 in IE look crisp (not fuzzy).&nbsp; Can anyone help here?&nbsp; Thanks.

            I had a similar issue but it's not just with Google Chrome. I purchased Windows 8 Pro (upgraded from a fresh install of Windows 7) and noticed most of the programs I had ran fuzzy (Chrome, Firefox, Spotify, Skype), except IE. But note that if I ran the
 program in Windows 8 mode, everything was clear. It's only in Desktop mode where I had this 'fuzziness' issue. (Win8 mode and desktop mode in Chrome properties)
<div><br />
<div>I had to check "Disable display scaling on high DPI settings" in the exe properties of the problematic programs. The next time I ran the program (in desktop mode), all was crystal clear!</div>
<div><br />
<div>I probably have a bigger issue, perhaps my video card is failing or I have an incompatible display driver. But disabling this setting corrected the issue. I hope this helps.</div>

            Disabling display scaling worked. Anyway to turn this off for the whole computer? Is is a driver issue?

<h2>            Backwards compatibility DLC issues</h2>
                    
<p>So I have a few backwards compatible games for XBox one that have DLC I purchased or downloaded on my 360 from GOTY editions, like Borderlands 1 and Fallout 3 but they're not coming up for me and I haven't found an answer to this at all. I do not own the
 GOTY discs anymore as I sold my 360 and games prior to getting the X1 so will I have to purchase the DLC again or the GOTY discs to get the DLC?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 Pen Button Customization - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jakeinmotion  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Pen Button Customization</h2>
                    <p>I am a previous owner of a Surface Pro 2, and loved the capability it provided of customizing the button commands per program through the Wacom drivers. As a new owner of the surface Pro 3, I a very disappointed to discover that the same functionality is
 not available in the N-trig driver options. As an artist, the primary use of my surface is for drawing inside of programs like Adobe Photoshop. Not being able to customize the button functions on the new pen is detrimental to my efficiency as a digital artist.
 Without the ease of having quick access to specific commands through the pen buttons, I am forced to either dig through the menus and submenus of the program to execute a simple command, or connect a keyboard to use hotkeys. One of the greatest features of
 the surface is the ability to draw inside of photoshop as if it were a paper notebook, freeing me from my desktop work space and removing the requirement of the mouse and keyboard. Without the customization of these pen buttons, I lose that freedom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spoke to a Microsoft support tech this morning who informed me that "hopefully" in the next month or two, this feature will be added to the pen drivers. While this is a new product, and I understand that some features are still in development, this feature
 is crucial in the workflow of any artist using this device. I already own a desktop computer and a laptop; so again, the primary function of the Surface Pro 3 for me is drawing inside of programs like Photoshop without the need for a mouse and keyboard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know if any Microsoft representatives read these discussions, but if there is a way I could be included in any sort of pre-release developmental versions of drivers that introduce this capability, I would love to be a part of it and am happy to provide
 feedback from an artist's perspective.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>To be able to configure each button would be a very nice feature. I vote for that!</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased surface pro 3 mainly for drawing purpose. I realized that I can't config the functionalities of the pen buttons. For example, when blending colors, I need to rapidly pick up colors. I need quick access to color picker. On my desktop, I use a
 wacom tablet, which comes with two pen buttons too. I often config one of the buttons to be the color picker, but I can't do the same to the surface pro 3 pen buttons. This is totally a deal breaker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>in photoshop, for example, the shortcut for color picker is alt+mouse click, so all I need to do is letting one of the pen button to be the alt button. this should be an easy to implement feature. I'm surprised it is missing from surface!</p>

            It is probably not configurable now but possibly later. &nbsp;I would say to keep voicing what option you want on them and some Microsoft people do read these threads and pass that info on. &nbsp;In fact, that is how the Trackpad Setting app got created. &nbsp;With that
 in thought, they may be able to make an app that functions like the Trackpad Settings app to configure the pen.

            <p>The Trackpad Settings app only works with the Surface RT and Surface 2 tablets. &nbsp;If you can't find it in the Store, that means it is not compatible with your machine. &nbsp;I don't know why Microsoft limited it to just those tablets but that fact was mentioned
 when I read the Surface Pro 3 User Guide in regards to the keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In fact, go to Microsoft's web site and click on "Surface" and look at the bottom of the web page and look for "Surface User Guides". &nbsp;They have guides for all the tablets. &nbsp;It is 108 pages long and describes just about everything. &nbsp;Of course, it is also
 missing a lot of 'fine line' details but good enough.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, open the Store and in the search box, type in "Touchpad Settings" (without quotes) and hit ENTER. &nbsp;If it does show up, it should display what models it works with. &nbsp;I think it should be available for all but it is not.</p>

</p><p>Thanks for getting this started. Here's one for the architects out there as well. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We&nbsp;need&nbsp;programmable buttons to navigate through basic 3D environments, Revit / sketchup / CAD.</p>
<p>Without it, its only effective as a viewing device at best. </p>

            <p>I am not an artist or graphics designer, but would also think programmable buttons would be an added benefit. To me, I want to use the pen to use the 'Snip' function, and then that piece would go directly to OneNote for editing.

            <p>This should be mandatory imho. I have many programs that need custom functions and I paid a huge premium vs a typical touch laptop for the active digitzer and pen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also want the ability to choose which program launches with the eraser click, and the function of the double click. It is absurd that they lock this sort of customization down, we aren't using a $2000 ipad here...</p>

            I'm with you on this, the ability to define the function called by the various buttons on the pen would be a complete game changer for my use experience. Ideally it should be able to be defined by what application has focus. I have one concert audio application
 I use constantly and professionally that makes incredibly intuitive and useful function out of the legacy 'mouse chord' (hold left click &amp; tap right click). The workaround with the pen is to tap an onscreen radio box before tapping the specific element you
 are attempting to adjust, so if you want to adjust several in a hurry (which is pretty much always in a live concert setting) you are required to frantically, and accurately, tap multiple places on the screen. The ability to redefine one button to right click
 &amp; another to mouse chord would absolutely transform the scenario. In the absence of this sort of functionality being a part of the driver, anyone with a workaround or 3rd party app that would enable this&nbsp;behavior&nbsp

<h2>            Windows  - BIG Disappointment</h2>
                    <p>Dear Microsoft,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope you take the time to read this post. &nbsp;I'm sure you are laughing all the way to the bank after the windows 10 upgrade. &nbsp;But, let me tell you my story.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a new laptop 3 years ago with windows8, then upgraded to windows 8.1, and finally to windows 10. &nbsp;I was anxious to upgrade because windows 8 was presenting the 2 most common words to me each and every day that I used it: &nbsp;"Not Responding". &nbsp;Windows
 file explorer would continuously crash, Firefox would freeze, etc, etc. &nbsp;However, upgrading that laptop to windows 10 showed no improvement. &nbsp;Thinking my laptop was old and "semi-compatible" with windows 10, I bought a brand new laptop with i7 processor, 16GB
 of RAM and 1TB hard drive...,..and pre-loaded with windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Guess what? &nbsp;NO CHANGE!!!! &nbsp;I'm still seeing "Not Responding", still crashing file explorer regularly, and Firefox still freezes up on me. If I re-boot, or try some of the other fixes like messing with the registry, using command prompts to attempt fixes,
 etc, etc, it may or may not work. &nbsp;Re-booting usually works, but why should I have to? &nbsp;Why should I have to mess with my registry? &nbsp;It's a NEW machine for crying out loud!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just know, I will NEVER buy another Microsoft product...I will go into debt if I have to to purchase an Apple product.....or if not Apple, anything BUT Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Signed,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given Up!</p>

<p>
</p><p>some comments on your rant, because I cant resist</p>
<p>1) giving it away free is a certain way to get Microsoft laughing all the way to the bank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) couple of other things that are the same with both of your machines </p>
<ul>
<li>you, and what you do with your machine</li><li>the software you are using.</li></ul>
<p>3) the vendor is responsible for supporting preinstalled software on a new machine, so you could speak with them about the problems you are experiencing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>4) <em>Just know, I will NEVER buy another Microsoft product...I will go into debt if I have to to purchase an Apple product.....or if not Apple, anything BUT Microsoft.</em></p>
<p>I suggest you take a look in the forums dedicated to the OS that you are considering before you get into debt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>if you would some help trying to solve the issues, give us a bit more information on the problems you are experiencing.</p>
<p>what programs stop responding?</p>
<p>do you have the latest version of firefox?</p>
<p>what are you doing when windows explorer crashes?</p>
<p>what solutions have you tried?</p>

<br />
<br />Is it a desktop or laptop? Let's try a hard shut down. Push and hold down the power button for 10 seconds. Let's see if it powers down. 
<br />
<br />Let me know!

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update
 or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily
 lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is
 connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.
</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to perform a <strong>
SFC Scan</strong> and check if it helps.</p>
<p>Refer to the following link given below.<br />
</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> While performing SFC Scan I would recommend you to make sure that there are no applications or programs running on the back ground.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. Please let us know if you need any other assistance with Windows in future. We will be happy to assist you.</p>

            Surface Book, i7/512GB. So I used the USB port, and then system crashed due to DCP WATCHDOG VIOLATION. If this has been since Windows 8, why isn't it resolved on Windows 10.&nbsp;Surface Book is becoming a disappointment to me, and&nbsp;it is exactly&nbsp;the system&nbsp;I
 wanted!&nbsp;I have the crashing also due to sleep mode issue. Is this DCP VIOLATION going to happen every time I use a USB?

<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure I understand that you were having this problem on Surface Book under Windows 8, as Surface&nbsp;Book was not released with Windows 8.</p>
<p>Does this happen every time you use this particular USB device?</p>

            After the one error message I've never gotten another.&nbsp; I've done the Nov 2nd update so maybe that took care of the error.&nbsp; I do get the pesky driver error occasionally but it immediately resolves, I lose nothing other than a couple of seconds of time&nbsp;and
 is nothing more than an irritation.&nbsp; It seems to happen only when using the IE 11 browser.&nbsp; I'll be glad when it is fixed. I get no errors using Lightroom/Photoshop CC or Visual Studio 2015.&nbsp;&nbsp;I love this computer.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Ok, this is my new problem with my Surface Book (I have all the updates done). i7, 16GB, 512 GB. The laptop ran out of charge while sleeping, then I plugged the charge in, but when I tried to turn on the laptop the monitor was frozen. Pushing only on power
 button didn't work, so I pushed button+volume up; which gave me this error.

</p><p>Thanks for the quick reply. I have been having many more problems than you encountered. I am trying to figure out if I need to swap this Book out or make it work. I have been installing and checking for updates multiple times per day. I have both a hardware
 and firmware updated 12/17/15. I have been back to the Microsoft store already, and I wanted to see if I could make this book work somehow so I don't have to throw away the 15-20 hours of copying files, installing apps, etc. that I have completed so far. The
 rest of the BSODs I have had were related to the NVidia graphics card, so I hadn't seen this error yet and was researching it.

<p>
</p><p>I hope I can find a way to keep this book. I really like the weight and feel, and even more so as I get used to it. I just hate losing work or potentially losing files due to crashes and restarts. I use a computer too often to be willing to overlook this
 level of instability. Hopefully when everyone gets back to work next week we will have some further driver updates coming and this will all go away.

</p><p>Don't be too sure about having more problems than I encountered. &nbsp;I was the earliest of adopters and got mine at the Microsoft Store the morning of the first day of availability. &nbsp;I had the infamous video driver problem right away and the Atlanta Microsoft
 Store swapped me out for a new one. &nbsp;I then had a bright, misplaced space bar backlight and got another replacement. &nbsp;I then had a total hardware failure on the Muscle Wire lock and am now on my fourth SB. &nbsp;I've had this one since Nov 30. &nbsp;It is Lot # 1546
 (found in the middle of the sticker on the back of the box). &nbsp;So far this one has been close to perfect. &nbsp;My first SB was Lot # 1542.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep all my data on Microsoft OneDrive and all my applications are subscription, so I can get a new machine and be up and running as if nothing happened in less than half an hour. &nbsp;All I have to do is install my apps from the web and all my data is already
 there on OneDrive. &nbsp;I love it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I have left to see fixed is the "sleep" problem. &nbsp;Microsoft has promised the fix right after Jan 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had dozens of computers since my first IBM PC in 1982. &nbsp;My Surface Book i7/16GB/512GB is the best, most fun to use computer yet. &nbsp;I've never had any data loss or software failure. &nbsp;I run Interactive Brokers Trader Workstation, Microsoft Office 365,
 Microsoft Visual Studio 2015, and Adobe Lightroom/Photoshop CC. &nbsp; My Surface Book isn't going anywhere!</p>

<p>But mods ruin games!111!!</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how it works seeing as there will be certain mods that will require outside plugins that more than likely will not work on console (Aka SKSE for Skyrim for example being required for nearly everything) or animation mods needing
 special scripts. Should be fun to see people complaining that their games bricked though and not understanding why.

<p>I've never had an issue with mods on fallout or skyrim on pc. I'm sure they know what they are doing. There have been some awesome and fun mods for these games on pc. I'm glad consoles may get to see what some of these are like.

<p>^Except that Microsoft and Bethesda don't decide what can be created. If somebody creates something that picks up and is required for the majority of mods to work and it can't end up running on console the whole mod feature is essentially dead except for
 basic stuff. Fallout 3 and New Vegas both has a script extender (+Skyrim) that is required for most mods and it will not work period unless it's launched separately.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's not just huge for the extended life of the game. It is huge because community fixes are almost a necessity on Bethesda games. They're just too big to be polished to a fine finish. Console versions have been stuck behind stringent patch processes, and
 when support ends, they're stuck in time, in whatever state. {XD</p>
<p>I'm thinking there'll be a way to organise your mods, like with FOSE on PC. If you add something and it affects the games adversely, or isn't compatible with official add-ons later on, you can go ahead and delete it from your list. Simply.</p>
<p>If the PS4 doesn't get this feature... Playstation as a platform will be batting a thousand with sub-par Bethesda game experiences. The Fallouts on PS3 ran notoriously poorly.</p>
<p>If community mods include things like accessing the "console" through intuitive UI's made by modders, in the game -- anything bugging out can be deleted, or reset. (Anybody have that dead dragon following them around fast travel locations in Skyrim on 360?
 Deleted.) Players could noclip if they get stuck in environments. That merchant not where he should be? Teleport to player, and stand where he should be.</p>
<p>The modding community is amazing for going through the game with a fine tooth comb and just cleaning it up.</p>
<p>I was taken aback when Phil Spencer announced backward compatibility, but when Todd Howard announced PC mod support for Fallout 4 on the X1 I almost sharted in my pants. The game's lifespan on console just increased by a factor ten.</p>
<p>Cannot wait for this game to drop. lol</p>

<br />Greetings! I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Since chats are being stored in the cloud, once deleted, it gets deleted for forever. You can't retrieve it. Main.db will come into picture only if you were using Skype version 7 during that time. 
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

<h3> vladimir_rs  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 &#34;remove everything&#34; made Asus Vivotab Note 8 go into a BSOD &#34;inaccessible_boot_device&#34;, completely BRICKED&#33;</h2>
                    <p>My tablet originally had windows 8.1 and then I installed the technical preview, and finally it got windows 10 through updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After it was launched and it was confirmed as windows 10 in the computer settings, I wanted to do a clean install, so I went into options, recovery and selected to delete everything and to reinstall windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tablet completed the reset procedure (resetting and percentage was showing after reboot) and in the end it asked me to confirm the TPM clearing by pressing F12/Volume up (since tablet has no physical keyboard). After I did so, it rebooted and
 keeps showing your PC has run into problems and needs to be reset....with the error "inaccessible_boot_device".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried putting windows 8.1 on microsd card and into tablet, I tried putting it on USB drive, I tried connecting physical keyboard, all without results. I was unable to access BIOS or to select the booting device (because it requires at least a
 functional windows version running in order to get there). I tried combinations with power button and volume keys, as well as with physical keyboard keys F2, F10, F8, shift+F8....nothing!</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point my tablet is completely ruined by the clean re-installation of a final version of windows 10 and it shows a continuous loop of blue screen "inaccessible_boot_device". I am kindly asking you to find a solution so that I can reinstall
 windows 10 or return to the Windows 8.1.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I repeat, windows 10 final version clean reinstall from system settings made my tablet completely useless. All I want here is that you tell me how can I return it to a functioning state.</p>

            <p>Wait, I just got into the BIOS for the device. Here's how to do it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Push the power button normally until the camera LED comes on</p>
<p>Release the power button</p>
<p>Immediately push power and volume down simultaneously</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should now be in the BIOS screen.</p>

    <title>Windows Store gone after upgrade to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nathanhawkes  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Store gone after upgrade to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have just upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 today. I get that there may be bugs in the software on its launch, but losing all of my Windows 8.1 apps, games and even the Windows Store itself shouldn't be one of them. &nbsp;It looks as though they are all
 being downloaded, but none of the meters are filling up to show data is being received, even though I am obviously connected to the Internet because I am posting this from the same laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, what confused me greatly is that I received an email immediately after my upgrade saying that I had reached my limit for installing apps and games from the Windows 10 Store, and it advised that "if you want to install apps and games from the Store
 on another Windows 10 device, remove a device from the device list." &nbsp;I have one device using Windows of any version and variety; my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a bug? &nbsp;Or do all of the Windows 8 apps actually need to be updated?</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any app that I try to open, with the exception of the Store, which does nothing, displays this alert:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b046e9da-059d-4aff-a3fa-a375378bb697" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>So I would assume that the Store has been completely removed from my system after the upgrade, no?</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I understand that you’re facing issue with apps after upgrading to Windows 10, I will make sure to help you with this issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You might have unpinned the Store app from the start screen. Use the Search box
</span>to search for Store. Right click and choose Pin to Start&nbsp;if the issue persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>First I suggest you to reboot the system and check if you can see Windows store.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the issue persist I suggest you to try the below steps and check:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 1:</strong> Run SFC scan and check if it helps</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>The “<strong><em>sfc /scannow</em></strong>” command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct Microsoft versions.</span></span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press “Windows Logo” + “Q” keys on the keyboard and type “<strong><em>cmd</em></strong>” in the search box.</span></li><li><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right click on the “<strong><em>Command Prompt</em></strong>” icon from the search results and select “<strong><em>Run as administrator</em></strong>”</span></li><li><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the command prompt window, type the following command, and then press “Enter”</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></li></ol>
<p><strong><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>sfc /scannow</span></span></em></strong><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the on-screen instructions and complete the scan.</span></li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>After running the SFC Scan, you may check the scan results. If there were any corrupted file and if the scan was able to fix it successfully, then you may try opening the store and check if the issue still persists.</span></span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 2: </strong></span><strong><em><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Clear the Store Cache</span></em></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>You may try these steps to clear the Store cache and check if it helps:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Press the “Windows Logo” + “R” keys on the keyboard.</span></li><li><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type “<strong><em>wsreset.exe</em></strong>” and press “<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>”.</span></li><li><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reboot the computer and then check if you still face this issue.</span></li></ol>
<p><span><span>For reference:</span></span></p>
