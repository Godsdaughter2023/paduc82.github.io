<h2>            Anyone have a better contact number for service problem</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Book i7 512 with GPU. The screen part of the Surface started to bulge and has yellow burn in on the left edge of the screen and the bottom of the screen. Got an advanced exchange on the Surface and they delivered a Surface Pro Keyboard by
 mistake. Fine. That order was cancelled and they sent a return label to got the Keyboard back.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Advanced exchange attempt #2 EXACT SAME THING!!! Got another Surface Pro Keyboard. Mind you, each time they are putting a $2700 hold on my credit card. I need to speak to someone who will actually once and for all solve this for me. I am annoyed at how hard
 it is to get help for their double screw up.</p>

<p>Hello VEP_229,<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We know how important it is for you to use your Surface Book. Were you able to get in touch with our
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Support</a></strong> over the phone? Can you tell us where did you purchase the device? Is it from an online (Microsoft Store/via third-party vendor)
 or through a retail store (Microsoft Store, authorized reseller, etc.)?<br />
<br />
If you haven't contacted our support, please do so. If you're outside the US, we also suggest that you contact our Global Support as well. You'll find the phone number for your country/region
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13948/global-customer-service-phone-numbers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Was able to get someone on the phone but it seems that support staff are very limited in how they can actually help resolve issues quickly when a mistake has been made. Looked at paperwork; it was purchased through the Microsoft&nbsp;store shipped to our office
 in Illinois. This honestly has been the worst support situation we have ever had to deal with. This Surface Book is the best laptop I have ever had. I have had fantastic laptops from
<strong>Dell</strong> and <strong>Lenovo.</strong> The Surface Book was better. At over $3000 with accessories, I would have expected no glitches with support and more so I would not have expected screen to start bulging and burning in. Clearly, a manufacturing
 defect (it is a known defect that many have had) In this last batch of orders, we got 2 surface books and 4 Pros with Keyboards. 1 Dial and cases for all. Previous order was 6 Pro's with keyboards and a few docks. The plan had been to move everyone from Thinkpads
 to Surface Books. We also were looking at a few Studios for the design department. But since this situation, we got nervous and have started moving back to Lenovo and Apple for those departments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First Advanced Exchange order was on <strong>June 1st</strong>. The wrong item was shipped. The second advanced&nbsp;exchange order was put in a few weeks later and sure enough, the same wrong item was delivered. It is now
<strong>July 12th</strong> and there is talk of having to go through and process a 3rd advanced exchange order. Again each time an order goes is put in, it requires a hold on a credit card. Company card means paperwork submitted to accounting to request permission
 to allow large holds. I am tired of filling out paperwork for the same thing again and again. Also, accounting is starting to look&nbsp;at me funny :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow thanks.</p>

<p>Case opened&nbsp;June 1. 2 shipments for an advanced exchange with a $2700 hold on credit card. Both shipments were the wrong part, Surface Pro
 screwed over by the customer support dept and the lack of urgency after over a month of waiting for my advanced exchange device. Worst customer service EVER! I don't say that lightly. I wish I had never bought the Surface Books and all of the Surface Pro's
 we have at the&nbsp;office. Hate supporting companies that treat their customers who buy their most expensive gear like crap. Hopefully, the advanced exchange will be finalized this year sometime. Could not function without a laptop so was forced to buy a new laptop.
 Thanks #LenovoThinkPad. They were able to rush deliver a similarly specced&nbsp;machine after hearing my Microsoft story. They were able to get one to our offices in 24 hours no B.S. like we are getting with Surface Support. Miss my touch screen but at least I
 don't have to worry about a screen that is bulging from a bad battery and that gets hot enough to where I have to avoid traveling with it cause I am afraid it is going to catch on fire.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am kind of laughing at being told that my case has been escalated. I had faster responses and calls when my case was not escalated.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Mark,
<br />you need to use audio cable to connect line-in pinhole on PC with line-out or headphones pinhole on player. Probably stereo cable with mini-jack on both side will be suitable.

    <title>Need to change Name and Password on Laptop Gift - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> denisestowers-fultz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Need to change Name and Password on Laptop Gift</h2>
                    I bought a laptop for my son for Christmas, and had the people at the store put my son's user name on the login screen with no password.&nbsp; It was fine for a few hours, then the computer updated.&nbsp; When it came back on, it had my Microsoft account name on
 the screen and we had to use my password to get him back onto his laptop.&nbsp; Also, he made a graphic design for his homescreen, and after the update on his computer, this design was somehow the homescreen on my desktop computer.&nbsp; How and why did this happen?&nbsp;
 My son is so frustrated and feels as if I now have 2 computers since my name shows up and he has to use my password.&nbsp; Is there a way to change this back to his name or am I doomed to having everything on our two computers merged together.&nbsp; Just because I paid
 for the computer doesn't mean I want it tied to mine.&nbsp; Please help.&nbsp; Thanks in advance.

    <title>Red light on console - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> strayninga  say:</h3>
<h2>            Red light on console</h2>
                    My Xbox slim froze in the middle of a game, I powered it off and turned it back on and received a red light in the middle of the power button on the console. I tried unplugging the power brick and doing trying that fix which is recommended as well as buying
 and trying an entirely new power brick. I also removed the HDD and shook it and replaced it as well as leaving it out while restarting it each time I try something new. I still get a red light, I am pretty positive that my warranty just exp. and I'm on my
 3rd Xbox which both o the other two received the red ring. Any advice on what the issue is or do I just need to get it repaired?

<p>It sounds like your xbox is over heating. Make sure the area is well ventilated. If you have the Xbox in a cabinet open the doors. It shouldn't be on carpet either, put on a solid surface if you have it on carpet. Check the vents are clear. Make sure your
 xbox isn't in direct sunlight or any other heat sources. </p>

            <p>Hey there Stray!<br /><br />The normal troubleshooting steps we have for a solid red light on an Xbox 360 S console are:<br /><br /></p>
<p><b>"There is a solid red light on my console and the screen is blank.</b></p>
<p>Try the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Let the power supply cool for about 30 minutes.</li>
<li>Plug the power supply into a different wall outlet.</li>
<li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/accessories/disconnect-reconnect-accessories" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Disconnect and reconnect all accessories</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/console-power/check-power-supply" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Check the power supply</a>.</li>
<li><a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/add-remove-hard-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Remove the hard drive</a>.</li>
<li>If the above steps don’t solve the issue, order a replacement power supply from the&nbsp;<a href="https://myservice.xbox.com/pages/consolemanager.aspx?useraction=requestarepair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Online Service Center</a>."</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;<br />It looks like you've tried the majority of those steps (unplug/replug power supply, remove HDD, etc) but I want to make sure you've tried all steps in that order.<br /><br />If you try those and they don't work for you (before you move on to Step 6) <strong>do you know a friend/family member with an Xbox 360 S console who would let you text their power supply with your console?</strong> If so, that will be a cheaper alternative to buying a new power supply to test your console with.<br /><br />Let us know how everything goes and we'll work with you from there! ^_^&nbsp;</p>

<p>You can check the forums for any solutions, or you can call 1800-4my-xbox. It depends on how many red lights are on but if you call xbox customer support can guide you through the trouble shooting process. Most likely it's a simple fix but if it isn't xbox
 will have you send it back to them for repairs. It takes 5-10 business days for to xbox to be shipped there and back. Just call and your problem should be resolved.</p>

            I do not get the i cloud error but my surface pro 2 is running very hot compared to how it ran windows 8.1. The back cover of the surface is uncomfortable to hold in your hand. No new programming has been installed since windows 10 upgrade was installed.
 Dimming the display doesn't seem to have a positive or negative effect on the temperature of the tablet. Battery saver mode helps slightly on battery life if i turn the display down to the 25% setting.

            Same here, I have rolled back to windows 8 and my heat issues are gone. I would love to continue to use windows 10 on my surface pro 2 but it's not possible until Microsoft fixes this problem with heat and battery life.

            <p>I have a Surface Pro first generation and as soon as I upgraded to Windows 10 it has ran HOT.<br />
And it runs HOT just sitting doing nothing.<br />
The only way for it to not run HOT is if I shut it down.<br />
<br />
There must be some process stuck causing the processor to be taxed constantly or something.<br />
<br />
I hope they get a fix soon. </p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT:</p>
<p>So after using the surface for a little bit now indeed the fan ramped up but now I look at the processes and it is STUCK at 70% to 80% and at 2.4 Ghz CPU speed.</p>
<p>Earlier the processor was at normal idle. So something is up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The processes that are at 10% and higher right now are:<br />
Windows Driver Foundation which is using an average of 14% CPU constantly.<br />
Service host: Local System which is using an average of 15% constantly.</p>
<p>System is at about 10% constantly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything else is 5% or less.<br />
<br />
Hmm, that is weird how those processes ramped up after a bit.</p>
<p>I turned off the internet for a few minutes to see if this was due to Windows sharing driver and software updates as they now do but it seemed to not make a difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT AGAIN:<br />
After watching this thing cause my CPU to stay at 70% for 15+ minutes I did an END TASK to the Windows Driver Foundation and immediately the CPU usage dropped to idle.<br />
The Service Host also stopped using CPU at that same time.<br />
<br />
I'm going to let it sit now and see if it is stable and if it cools off without shutting it down.</p>

    <title>Xbox will not read game discs - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> degradingdruid7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox will not read game discs</h2>
                    <p>I have not used my Xbox in quite some time and recently decided to play a game. However, none of my games work (they all used to and are in great condition) however it will play music cds.</p>
<p>I have tried removing the memory units, added them back in and reset the box countless times. I checked the unit for dust as well. I do not get an error code, instead it says:</p>
<p>*open tray (pretty simple, I then put the game into the slot and close the tray)</p>
<p>*reading (sounds like it might be doing something but doesn't)</p>
<p>*open tray</p>
<p>
</p><p>It can't seem to read any of the 3 games I have, which as I stated all previously worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else had this problem? Any ideas on how to fix It?</p>

<strong>Solution 2: Try playing the disc on another Xbox One console</strong></p>
<p>
Playing the disc on another console will help you figure out whether the problem is with the individual disc or the console's disc drive. Try the disc on a friend's console, or at a retail location that can test a disc.</p>
<p>
If your disc works on another Xbox One console, go to the following section,&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/system/disc-error#mydisc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">None
 of my discs play, or my disc isn't recognized when I insert it</a>.</p>
<p>
<strong>Solution 3: Make sure the Blu-ray player app has installed successfully</strong></p>
<p>
If you can play game discs but not CDs, DVDs, or Blu-ray Discs, make sure that the Blu-ray player app has installed successfully. For more information, see&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/apps/dvd-blu-ray-setup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Set
 up and install the Blu-ray and DVD player app on Xbox One</a>.</p>
<p>
<strong>Solution 4: Make sure your DVD or Blu-ray Disc is from the same region where you purchased your console</strong></p>
<p>
See&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/apps/watch-bluray-dvd-movies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Supported
 regions and formats for Blu-ray and DVD movies on Xbox One</a>&nbsp;for more information.</p>
<p>
<strong>Solution 5: Replace the game</strong></p>
<p>
If none of the previous solutions fixed the problem and you still can't play a particular disc, go to&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/system/disc-replacement-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox
 One game disc exchange</a>&nbsp;to learn how to replace a Microsoft game. For non-Microsoft games, contact the game's publisher about their game disc replacement policy.</p>
<p>
<strong>Important</strong>&nbsp;If none of your games or discs play, go to the following section,&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/system/disc-error#mydisc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">None
 of my discs play, or my disc isn't recognized when I insert it</a>. This information may help you avoid replacing a disc unnecessarily</p>

            A Wlan based printer is easier to use when you connect the printer to the Wlan (WiFi) router instead of directly connecting to the netbook.&nbsp; Whenever a Wlan printer is connected to a computer, via the Wlan signals, it is usually used 'exclusively" with
 that computer.<br />
<br />
Do you have a WiFi router?<br />

            <p>you will have to use a tool such as the Windows 7 USB/DVD Download Tool (<a href="http://store.microsoft.com/Help/ISO-Tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://store.microsoft.com/Help/ISO-Tool</a>)
<br />
This simple tool will help you convert the same image file into to a USB thumb drive. For installation purposes, you should get a thumb drive that’s at least 4 GBs in size to store the installation files. Browse to where the Windows 7 DVD is stored, open it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select the USB device where you want to have the backup stored to for installation.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the USB device has been identified, click the Begin copying button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And that’s it, the next step now is to boot your&nbsp;computer from the thumb drive, make sure the thumb drive you will be installing Windows 7 from is plugged into the USB port. This might vary by manufacturer, but the usual one to try is F12, start your computer
 and press F12 repeatedly until a screen is displayed giving you the option to boot from a USB Memory device, select that and press Enter on your keyboard.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 7 will boot as it normally does into the setup environment</p>

            <p>Installation of Windows via USB device, pendrive/hard drive requires that, first, you format the USB device&nbsp;to NTFS filesystem and&nbsp;make sure you don't have any data on the device after formatting.&nbsp;Then, copy all the files present in the Windows Installation
 DVD/ISO image file&nbsp;to the USB device. [Use any trusted third party software to extract files from ISO image].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Important:</p>
<p>Do not add any other files after copying the Windows files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, change the boot device priority to USB devices as first, followed by hard drive, from your system setup (refer your system manual for this operation).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I believe you set the boot device priority accordingly, insert the USB device&nbsp;and switch on the system. The device&nbsp;boots for Windows installation.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Code 43</strong> Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43).</p>
<p>One of the drivers controlling the device notified by the operating system that the device failed in some manner.
<br />
</p>

<h2>            Gamer Zone Cheater Gone by itself&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Ok soooo I was on the Xbox Dashboard and had just signed in and I went to my profile to edit my bio when I looked and realized my gamer zone didn't say cheater anymore!! I didn't do anything and when it got set like that 1 year ago maybe 2 months after Halo
 Reach came out in 2010 September.&nbsp; I know that my gamerscore was reset and I will NEVER DO IT AGAIN but Im gonna be honest when my friend modded my gamerscore and bumped it up only 5000-7000 points compared to my LEGIT earnings of 16000 really was unfair and
 I just wish they could have only taken away the modded achievements instead of all of them including my legit earned ones. Well I would just wanna know how or why my zone went back to normal? and no I dont know if I can still earn achievements from past games
 that had modded achievements in it. After my gamerscore reset I never cared about achievements ever again because it just was...disappointing and worthless.I use to LOVE getting achievements but now I don't THAT MUCH anymore.</p>

<p>Thank You and Goodbye.</p>

<p>thank you everyone for the answers but I still really haven't gotten a for sure answer on the subject although the second chance idea would be pretty cool.Also mayyybe my achievements that I have been earning fairly have been attracting attention and thats

<p>Were you playing on console or on PC? Either way you must have cloud save enabled so your progress is uploaded from the cafe and then downloaded to your home console. The steps for enabling cloud saves however will be different for each platform.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course you must also make sure you're using the same account at home as you were using in the cafe as your progress is saved to the cloud for your account specifically.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t log out of Hotmail &#38; Windows Live says can&#39;t log me - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ernestlong  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t log out of Hotmail &#38; Windows Live says can&#39;t log me out of MSN account services.</h2>
                    <p>My problems began on Oct. 19th. When using Hotmail and moving around from inbox, to the sent box, to the deleted box, I noticed that the display ads that turn up on the right side of the page, were flickering for an instant. They were flickering or giving
 me an instantaneous, 1/2 second glimpse of the ad, that was headed to the riight side of the page. This happened every time I'd go from one mail box to another. Finally on some ads I noticed "ad choices." I went there and opted out of well over 150 ad sources.</p>
<p>The same thing would happen on Yahoo Finance. The small square ad that was destined to the right side of the page, would try to open on the top left. Again it was just for an instant, before the ads would end up on the right side.</p>
<p>People said to use IE 9.0 tracking protection. I watched a video on that and decided to enable it. That did not help, so I went back and disabled tracking protection.</p>
<p>People asked for a screen shot of the problem. I can not provide a screen shot of something that is an event and last for only 1/2 second. Ads and tracking cookies, and so forth, are quire normal and to be expected. However the way they are trying to be
 displayed in my Hotmail account and on Yahoo Finance is not normal, and just started a couple days ago.
</p>
<p>I decided to un-install my IE 9.0 and did so. The ads on Yahoo Finance are still there and flicker on the top left before heading to their normal location, middle of the right side. The ads on Hotmail have stopped. "IF" Hotmail is a separate program, then
 my new copy of IE 9.0 has not affected the ad issue, and the lack of ads now, may be due to the multiple times, I clicked on "ad choices" and opted out.</p>
<p>Now, I can not log out of Hotmail. I get these messages:</p>
<p>1. on the left side it says:<br />
Windows Live<br />
Sign-out isn't complete... &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br />
We couldn't sign you out of these sites: &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br />
MSN Account Services &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br />
<br />
2. on the right side it says:<br />
Finish signing out<br />
Try clearing all of your browser cookies, and then close all browser windows.<br />
How? &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; a link to "How" to clear all browser cookies, etc.<br />
<br />
The link to "how" takes me to a Windows Sign In Help Center, where&nbsp;I see no sign out help.<br />
</p>
<p>I have deleted all my temporary files, cookies, and browsing history. Still, I can not succesfully log out of Hotmail, and before now, the action of logging out of Hotmail has always taken me to the webpage MSN dot com.</p>
<p>I do not have any of the above issues, the improper display of ads or the signing out of Hotmail, when I do testing using another browser beside IE.</p>
<p>People are telling me to repair-re-install Windows Vista and I am not clear at all on why that is the fix here. The problem just began as ads being displayed improprly on Hotmail and Yahoo Finance. All I did subsequent to that, was to click on "ad choices"
 and opt out of some ads. I also un-installed IE 9.0. When I re-booted, Windows said there were 4 updates and the 1st one was IE 9.0. So,&nbsp;I proceeded to let it install IE 9.0. I now have version: 9.0.8112.16421 update version 9.0.3.
</p>
<p>The only thing that has happened, between the time the display ads were being displayed properly, and when they were not being displayed properly, was an installation of 9 new Windows updates, on or about Oct. 13th. I did nothing after those updates. Then
 on the 19th here comes the display ads that flicker, blink, for a split 2nd on the "left side" of Hotmail (when I am moving around from mail box to mai box) when they are destined for the "right side" of the webpage.
</p>
<p>And now the inability to log out of Hotmail successfully. I removed the browser cookies, I think.</p>
<p>Someone told me to find the cookies here: %userprofile%\AppData\Roam</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            PSU fans, louder than xbox</h2>
                    
<p>hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have a fairly new Slim model and I just noticed the PSU fans are louder than I can recall. I just connected a Kinect sensor last night, didn't notice until then, but it may not be related. It;s loud with or without the Kinect.</p>
<p>The PSU is cool, and cool air is coming out. Any ideas on this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!!</p>

<p>How loud is the PSU? The unit should generate some noise (that's how you know it's keeping cool), but it shouldn't be overly loud, like, louder than the console, for instance.<br />
<br />
If you believe your console is producing an unusually loud sound, please give phone support a call at 8004MY-XBOX.</p>

    <title>Windows Boot Manager, I want to change the Hard Drive Configuration - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gromittoo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Boot Manager, I want to change the Hard Drive Configuration</h2>
                    <p>I have a computer with Two older 500GB Hard Drives.&nbsp; The "Legacy" OS is installed on the first physical hard drive in the system, and Windows 7 is installed on the second physical hard drive,&nbsp; They happen to be identical WD drives.&nbsp; I have purchased a brand
 new Seagate Barracuda 1000GB drive, that I wish to use instead.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So currently I have:</p>
<p>SATA-0, Partition 0:&nbsp; 500GB Legacy OS</p>
<p>SATA-5, Partition 0:&nbsp; 500GB Windows 7</p>
<p>
</p><p>With the new drive, I want:</p>
<p>SATA-0, Partition 0: 500GB Legacy OS</p>
<p>SATA-0, Partition 1: 500GB Windows 7</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have drive imaging software, that can copy the two drives to the new partitions on the new drive.&nbsp; What I want to know is how to make sure I continue to get the boot menu to see both OS's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, I will still have the old Hard drives available, and I can always put them back in.&nbsp; It is just that the cloning process takes a long time, and I would like to have my procedure in advance.&nbsp; The first time I boot the system with the 1 TB drive,
 there will not be a 500GB drive at SATA-5, Partition 0: in the computer.&nbsp; I don't know what files need to be modified, to look for Windows 7 in the new location.</p>

            <p>I should not need to do any reinstallation of windows.&nbsp; I believe I found the answer to what I was looking for elsewhere.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recall that two years ago, when I set up the Dual boot system, I followed these instructions:</p>
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/8057-dual-boot-installation-windows-7-xp.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/8057-dual-boot-installation-windows-7-xp.html</span></a>
<p>
</p><p>When I was done, I had a dual boot menu:</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Earlier Version of Windows</p>
<p>- Windows 7 Professional</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course I wanted it to say "Windows XP" rather than "Earlier Version of Windows".&nbsp; I searched and found that a tool exists to edit this menu.&nbsp; I could not remember what the tool was called when I submitted this request.&nbsp; I was pretty sure that the tool
 would allow me to have the boot menu change where it looked for the Windows7 installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I found the name of the tool, it is called BCDEDIT.EXE.&nbsp; It allows you to safely edit the menu file, and the boot locations look like the old boot.ini file from WindowsNT days.&nbsp; Here is what the tool produces on the command line.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I had looked into this feature before but I never located the Power Meter option to turn on in the "<strong>Select which icon appears on the taskbar."</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please note that this is a desktop PC, not a laptop so it may not be installed whatsoever. Plus it's a custom built PC, not a premade, with retail Windows 10 Home, so that may have something to do with this. Or it could simply be that a mistake was made
 during windows components installation.</p>

    <title>Outlook Express, loss of input emails - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john m mills  say:</h3>
<h2>            Outlook Express, loss of input emails</h2>
                    <p>Outlook Express, 3 new emails were being viewed, and then all previous read and non-read emails disappeared by just clicking on the next email. The 3 latest emails remained and everything else was lost.</p>
<p>On 'searching' for '.dbx', found 'inbox (1). dbx', containing the 3 current input emails, and 'inbox.dbx' which seemed to contain all the lost emails.</p>
<p>How can one retreive all 'input' email messages? No files lost from any other element, and no files added to 'delete'. Would an 'Outlook Repair Kit' software solve the problem?&nbsp; If so which one? System uses - Windows XP Professional SP3, &nbsp;and Microsoft Outlook
 Express 6.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Close OE and rename the Inbox.dbx with the missing messages to Inboxold.dbx and then drag it to the Desktop.</p>
<p>Open OE and create a folder with the *exact* same name as the one on the Desktop, Inboxold.. Open the new folder and then close OE. (You must do this). Go to Windows Explorer and locate the Message Store folder for your OE identity, but don't open it. Click
 on the Desktop and drag the file from the Desktop in the right hand pane to the OE store folder in the left pane. Prompt - "Do you want to overwrite......."? Click Yes.</p>
<p>*Note* If you have moved the Outlook Express store folder from it's default location on drive C to another drive, drag the dbx file to a location on that drive and not the Desktop.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p><br />
If this method fails, you will need a tool to extract the messages.</p>
<p><strong>DBXpress<br />
</strong><a href="http://www.oehelp.com/DBXpress/Default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.oehelp.com/DBXpress/Default.aspx</a>
</p>
<p>You may need to run it in the Extract From Disk Mode if its normal recovery mode fails to find the lost messages.
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>To help prevent this in the future:</p>
<p>Do not archive mail in the Inbox or Sent Items. Create your own user defined folders and move the messages you wish to save to them. Empty Deleted Items folder daily. Although dbx files have a theoretical capacity of 2GB, I recommend about a 300MB max for
 less chance of corruption.</p>
<p>Information about the maximum file size of the .dbx files that are used by Outlook Express:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=903095" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=903095</a></p>
<p>After you are done, follow up by compacting your folders manually while working *offline* and do it often.</p>
<p>Click on Outlook Express at the top of the folder tree so no folders are open. Then: File | Work Offline (or double click Working Online in the Status Bar). File | Folder | Compact all folders. Don't touch anything until the compacting is completed.</p>
<p>Turn off e-mail scanning in your anti-virus program. It is a redundant layer of protection that eats up CPUs and causes a multitude of problems such as time-outs and account setting changes. Your up-to-date A/V program will continue to protect you sufficiently.

            <p>You can right click on the inbox in the folder list and go to Properties to see what actual file OE is using.&nbsp; It sounds as if the original inbox.dbx got corrupted, so OE made a new one called inbox (1).dbx which it
 is now using.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before you do anything to the inbox.dbx file, make a copy of it in case the messages are still in it.&nbsp; Then you can try importing it as Bruce suggested (see also
<a href="http://www.oehelp.com/backup.aspx#imp1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.oehelp.com/backup.aspx#imp1</a>).&nbsp; But if you try and import it that way and its corrupted and has messages in it, OE may just wipe out the contents, so make sure you make a backup first (you should backup
 the entire message store at this point).</p>
<p>Also check your Recycle bin and the message store for an inbox.bak file that is a backup if it exists and might contain the lost messages.&nbsp; See
<a href="http://www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.oehelp.com/OETips.aspx#2</a>&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>Otherwise see Bruce's response.</p>
