<h2>            Skype Number not working</h2>
                    <p>My Skype number does not connect. When you call it says the number is incomplete. I am in Australia. Anyone else having an issue with their Skype number? I can't find a way to contact Skype support direct. Their FB messenger reply keeps directing me to the
 community page. Anyone know a contact number for Skype support in Australia?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Windows folders are protected with the trusted installer. Do you want to delete such folder? Also note,<strong>with the UAC</strong> you have
<strong>standard user rights</strong> (filtered token),<strong>NO admin rights</strong> .

<h2>            Internal Microphone not Working on Dell Inspiron 1521</h2>
                    
<p>I upgraded to Windows 7 a few months ago and have tried everything I can think of to get my Microphone working but to no avail. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is an internal array, so I don't need to plug into the jack.</p>
<p>I have installed the SigmaTel audio drivers.</p>
<p>The device shows up as enabled and set as my default device.</p>
<p>The microphone is not muted, but when I go to a recording program, it reads that the microphone is not picking up any sound at all.</p>
<p>The Windows Troubleshooter doesn't know what to do either, does anybody have a fix?</p>

<p><strong><span><span>Hi MauriceX,</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>On my research, I found that updating the Audio drivers should fix the issue you are experiencing. Many users have come across similar kind of issue and it has been best described
 in Dell website, please go through it:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://en.community.dell.com/forums/t/19299245.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://en.community.dell.com/forums/t/19299245.aspx</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>I see that the Audio drivers are applicable only to Vista. Let’s install it in Compatibility Mode.</span></p>
<p><span>Access the below link to install the right drivers for your Audio device:</span></p>

</span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the steps below to install this software in Windows Vista SP2 Compatibility mode:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Right click on the setup file.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Go to properties.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Click on Compatibility mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Place a check mark the box in the box in front of “Run this program in compatibility mode for” and from the drop down menu choose Windows Vista
 SP2.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. Place a check mark on "Run as an Administrator" under privileges level and click on Apply and then Ok.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6. Now double click on the setup file to initiate the install.</span></span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 Pro - Backup and Restore &#40;Windows 7&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rjefferywhite  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Pro - Backup and Restore &#40;Windows 7&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I had the issue where the update&nbsp;2108-01 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1709 for x64-based Systems (KB4058258) repeatedly failed to install.&nbsp; I used the Kris Ver's post (2/2/2018) on the subject and resolved the issue by doing an In-Place Upgrade
 with guidance from PaulSey...'s Article (8/9/2017, used on 2/11/2018 - but apparently updated today).&nbsp; Today (2/13/2018) there were more updates, and my laptop&nbsp;(Dell Inspiron 15 2-in-1 with CORE i7 processor) says it is up to date.&nbsp; (See my reply to Kris Ver's
 post - thank you very much!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been using Windows 10 Professional's Settings/Update &amp; Security/Backup/Go to Backup and Restore (Windows 7) feature every Sunday night for over 2 years to do a scheduled&nbsp;complete backup (including system image) to my WD MyCloudMirror (Wi-Fi RAID) on
 my home network, and I manually did the same "Back up now"&nbsp;as soon as I realized Windows Update was broken.&nbsp; So after the In-Place Upgrade, and several iterations of Windows Update - when I got my first "Your device is up to date", I attempted to manually
 do a new "Back up now" - which failed saying some volume didn't have enough space.&nbsp; Today (2/13/2018) another set of updates came in and successfully updated, and my current latest update is "2018-02 Cumulative&nbsp;Security Update for Windows 10 Version 1709 for
 x64-based Systems (KB4074588)", plus some Office 2010 updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I run Back up now I get:</p>
<p>========================&nbsp; Back up now&nbsp; ========================<br />
{Window name:}&nbsp; Windows Backup: Troubleshooting Options</p>
<p>Check your backup</p>
<p>Windows Backup skipped backing up system image because one of <br />
the critical volumes is not having enough free space. Free up some <br />
space by deleting unnecessary files and try again.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; { Try to run backup again }<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; { Change backup settings&nbsp; }</p>
<p>
</p><p>{^} Hide Details&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; { Cancel }</p>
<p>Backup time: 2/13/2018 3:18 PM<br />
Backup location: \\WDMyCloudMirror\jeff\Jeffs-Laptop-Backup\<br />
Error code: 0x81000033</p>
<p>
</p><p>And when I run "Create system image" I get:</p>
<p>
</p><p>=================&nbsp; Create a system image&nbsp; =======================<br />
{Window name:} Create a system image</p>
<p>{ full width progress bar - totally red }</p>
<p>There is not enough disk space to create the volume shadow copy on the storage location.&nbsp; Make
<br />
sure that, for all volumes to be backed up, the minimum required disk space for shadow copy
<br />
creation is available. This applies to both the backup storage destination and volumes included in
<br />
the backup. Minimum requirement: For volumes less than 500 megabytes, the minimum is 50
<br />
megabytes of free space. For volumes more than 500 megabytes, the minimum is 320 megabytes
<br />
of free space. Recommended: At least 1 gigabyte of free space on each volume if size
<br />
is more than 1 gigabyte. (0x80780119)</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my RAID device, the file backup part of the backup looks normal (although I haven't attempted to recover files yet), but the WindowsImageBackup directory has not changed since 2/8/2018.&nbsp; I don't see any clue about what volumes are backed up in the&nbsp; Back
 up now system image, but the Create system image indicates that it includes:&nbsp;"EFI System Partition" that is within the requirement, "OS (C:) (System)" that is within the requirement, and "Windows Recovery Environment (System)" that is 450.00 MB and contains
 419.49 MB of data.&nbsp; (For the record there are almost 2TB of free space, and there are no quotas applied or other reason to think the destination is lacking space).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using diskmgmt.msc, I see the right size Volumes for EFI System Partition and OS (C:).&nbsp; However, I see 3 volumes (Volumes 4, 6, &amp; 7), all called "Recovery Partition".&nbsp; It says C: is 53% free (agreeing with Windows Explorer), but all of the other Volumes
 are shown as 100% free - which doesn't agree with the data shown in the Create system image procedure.&nbsp; Volume 6 is the only 450 MB Volume of the 3 and Volume 7 is 7.51 GB.&nbsp; In the diskmgmt.msc display it appears that Volume 6 is physically contiguous with
 Volume 7, but C: is between 750 MB Volume 4 and Volume 6.&nbsp; I have no clue how the disk got partitioned this way, but I assume it was like that coming from the Dell factory (since I bought it already set up (I did the update from Windows 8 but don't have the
 knowledge to decide, so no doubt let it go as it was).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, getting to my questions finally:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Do I really need 3 Recovery Partitions?&nbsp;&nbsp; If so, can you tell me how to get access to files in Volume 6 and which files I don't need?</p>
<p>2. If I don't need them can you tell me how to grow Volume 6 to include at least enough of Volume 7 to meet spec?</p>
<p>3. Is there something else I can try?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p />

            Hi Jeffrey.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Please post a screenshot of Disk Management, which we read like a doctor reads X-rays:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/post-a-screenshot-of-disk-mgmt/04a8ef8c-c882-404e-a26b-89867c4ddf55?tm=1441932228382">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/foru...</a>
<br />
<br />Tell me what is on each partition as best you know and what you want to do. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Windows 7 Backup is being phased out along with backup imaging, and has considerable problems.  I would not run it but instead use a more flexible and reliable imaging app like the expert's choice free Macrium.  It just works:  <a href="http://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW/Backing+up+files+and+folders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://knowledgebase.macrium.com/display/KNOW/B...</a>

<br />
<br />You don't need any except the latest recovery partition containing the bootable repair tools which in previous editions were on C:.  But it can be hard to tell so if you want to delete them make your Recovery drive or Bootable Installation media so you have a bootable method to do repairs if needed.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Windows 10 Backup utlities that are in built to Windows 10 are deprecated and Microsoft plans to remove them in a future release. I suggest moving over to a 3rd party solution instead.

            File History, System Image, Backup and Restore in Windows 10 are partially broken and they are not being actively maintained or developed. Microsoft is planning to remove them in a future release. You are seeing the effects of this. You should switch to a third party solution such as Macrium Reflect (Free).

<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the info on deprecation of Backup and Restore - too bad because that system image feature has saved my bacon a couple of times when hard drives flamed out on me.&nbsp; I'll be choosing an alternate 3rd party solution soon, but I really would feel better
 if I had a final image (now that Windows Update apparently is working) - just in case I blow it getting the replacement solution up and done a test restore.&nbsp; I only have this one PC to work with and have enough bad experiences to not trust any backup&nbsp;that
 I haven't personally&nbsp;done a successful restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Greg, here is my screenshot:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7e7e9849-3945-43b0-8290-7b15457f2bbe?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7e7e9849-3945-43b0-8290-7b15457f2bbe?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>While I was fooling with diskmgmt I also found&nbsp;diskpart, which seems to get my head straight a bit better.&nbsp; I was using the complete backup functionality of Backup and Restore (Windows 7), which includes a system image, but haven't found any details about
 what is included.&nbsp; However, if you select the&nbsp;"Create a system image" button, you get some interesting info and choices.&nbsp; So I included that in my screenshot as well.&nbsp; It seems legible to me, hope you can make it out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read somewhere that most Windows system disks have 3 volumes for the EFI Partition, the Recovery Volume, and the System Drive (C:).&nbsp; There are 3 grayed out choices on the "Create system image"&nbsp;window, so going from the sizes of those 3 things I'm
 thinking they are Partitions 1, 6, and 6 (Volumes 1, 3, and 0 respectively).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, the only one that doesn't meet minimum size for "Create system image" is Partition 6, so if I could expand that one then I could probably make my final image and get on with
 selecting and testing the new solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears that Volume 4 (Partition 7)&nbsp;is a PBR Image, which (if I get the gist of I) is there so one can restore the factory delivered system image.&nbsp; I bought this laptop new from Dell in July 2015, and it came with Windows 8.1 Pro installed.&nbsp; As soon&nbsp;as
 possible after it became&nbsp;available I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; I have no interest in going back to the factory delivered configuration.&nbsp; If I would delete Volume 4, wouldn't I be able to expand Volume 1 using diskpart?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alternately, I have visibility to Volume 2 (Partition 4) and it hasn't been accessed since October 2015 (at least not the visible files in Windows Explorer - I think system files are hidden).&nbsp; I have no ides what that is, but I'm guessing it is a remnant
 of Windows 8 from the dates.&nbsp; It sounds tricky to me, but perhaps that could be deleted and the Recovery Volume moved down to its Partition somehow?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lot for your help!!</p>

            Hi amirk63,<br />
<br />
Have you enabled Windows search? If not, Check for the status of windows search service and enable it.<br />
<br />
Then, include Outlook PST files in the index by following the steps given below.<br />
<br />
The default index location is : C:\ProgramData\Microsoft<br />
<br />
If you use an unusual file type that's not currently recognized by the index, you can add it to the index so you can search in Windows by that file type.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Open Indexing Options by clicking the Start button, and then clicking Control Panel. In the search box, type indexing options, and then click Indexing Options.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Click Advanced. Administrator permission required If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. In the Advanced Options dialog box, click the File Types tab.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. In the Add new extension to list box, type the file name extension (for example, "txt"), and then click Add.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Click Index Properties Only or Index Properties and File Contents, and then click OK.<br />
<br />
<br />

            PST is in the index file types but only under "index properties", when I try to change it puts it as indexed for as TXT. Given that PST archive are so common, this should have been more clear how to do that. Any clue?

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder that it should be with the extension search</p>
<p>
</p><p>PST file is a Personal Storage Table but it is kinda extension format file. so if you dont want to remember or dont remember the name of PST file, as you have several PST file. so you can do is to use (Dot)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the searching area box you need to prefix dot for example - <strong>.PST</strong> file</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just tried and got all PST file in frond me as result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will work buddy.</p>

            Hi there.&nbsp; I will explain to you how I solved this problem.&nbsp; I recognize this may be different but who knows.&nbsp; I am running on Vista x64 premium.&nbsp; I had the exact same error you described on the exact same piece of hardware.&nbsp; The part that may be different
 is that I know what caused my hardware to stop functioning, I had inadvertantly disabled it.<br />
This is how I fixed it (I tried updating driver, system restore points, uninstalling and reinstalling and kept getting error code 10)<br />
<br />
1. Go to control panel<br />
2. I choose classic view, and I chose "Sound"<br />
3. I right clicked with my mouse where my devices are all listed and selected "show disabled devices" and "show disconnected devices"<br />
4. After this my hardware reappeared and I enabled it and it is working fine.<br />
<br />
I realize this might not be what happened to you, but I thought I would try in case it was<br />
<br />

    <title>Skype Mutual Contact Feature - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> luigi vincenzo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype Mutual Contact Feature</h2>
                    <p>I know this has been mentioned before here, but this feature is seriously, seriously bothering me. I *do not want* my friend to know my mutual contact list. Many people on my Skype contact list who I communicate for work related issues only have 1 or 2 contacts
 themselves. If they go into the discover contacts section they can essentially see my contacts.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is completely unacceptable and many people I know who also use Skype are equally troubled by this feature, please at least add an option for us to opt out of this, it is a ridiculous invasion of privacy and if this doesn't change then I will have to
 find another platform (as will many others).</p>

<p>Really? No way of knowing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So riddle me this Sherlock, when I suddenly see a long list of Dutch names on my Discover people list - there is no way of me knowing those are obviously the contacts of my 1 Dutch friend?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A friend that I met gaming and I have zero use of knowing the Skype info on his family and his other normal day-to-day friends.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You keep saying it makes it easier to connect with ''the right people'' - I don't wanna connect with my little brother's friends though! It is none of my business who my brother talks to on Skype and it is none of his business who I talk to - cause he will
 now be ''featurely'' connected to that Dutch friend who will show up on my brother's list as 1 mutual friend.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a terrible feature and needs an on/off click box that says ''Do not share my contact list with anyone''</p>
<p>
</p><p>We already have Facebook for this nonsense, just in case I want to meet up with my grandmother's needlepoint group or have a sudden urge to know all my uncle's veteran army buddies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This feature mixes your family, friends and professional contacts in a way that is completely useless, because Skype does not know who ''the right people'' are for me.&nbsp;</p>

            <span><span>Согласен . </span><span>Facebook - это сеть, в которой у многих есть только друзья в семье.
</span><span>Но большинство учетных записей являются виртуальными друзьями, их нельзя спутать с семьей.
</span><span>Вы организуете множество скандалов в семье с их новыми функциями.
</span><span>Поэтому очень легко следить за своими первыми мужьями (женами) и их новыми друзьями - это ужасно.

<p>Hi HelpforthePC,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont know how many times before that you have asked Microsoft to resolve an issue which generally had been caused by one of their updates or upgrades and if you have whether they in fact supplied you with a resolution that worked, my experience over several
 problems submitted to them is that their advice / resolutions have been either nothing to do with the problem you are experiencing or they have given the "clean install " option, not even considering the inconvenience that this can cause re-installing loads
 of programs and settings already installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sorry but I myself can give you no practicle advice as I have (as yet) not experienced that issue but would suggest that if it is a great inconvenience doing a clean install wait for one of the "user geeks" who have experienced this problem to come
 up with a suggested fix or keep Googleing it as it is the only way I have ever got any help with a problem that worked,&nbsp; Microsoft "Tech Engineers" are a waste of time.</p>

            <p>I have had this problem since I switched from Win 8 to Win 10. Like most there is no way to find a help on this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Help on Windows 10 has been pretty bad generally anyway.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your suggestion is not practical - as it does not identify the cause to be fixed and assumes installation to be the cause.</p>
<p>In my case I have upgraded to Win 10 and even bought the pro version.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore your suggestion is also not practicable as that means I need to start a clean install from windows 8. It means a lot of issues to deal with and my question to you would be what would be the next question that you ask if I still face issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your suggestion also indicates the same support issue around windows 10. A lack of knowledge base for the heaps of issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An option I tried did not help and I do not face this issue always.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>How do I remotely change a local account password of a pc that - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How do I remotely change a local account password of a pc that can&#39;t be logged into&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>I am currently based in London. I have an issue with a staff's laptop based in Africa. We built the laptop and shipped it to them. As part of the build we put on our standard administrator account and then made a local account as they are not connected to
 our domain.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The user in this Africa office changed the local password of his account and now can't remember it therefore making the PC unable to be logged into. I do not want to tell him our administrator password because it's the same for all our PCs worldwide. I have
 researched many things to try and connect to the PC but it is now possible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:<br />
<br />
1. Browsing to the machine from another pc on the network using explroer and I can see the C Drive.</p>
<p>2. I tried running this command but I just keep getting error 1219: net use \\pcname\ipc$ /user:pcname\administrator *</p>
<p>3. RDP will not work, it just won't connect.</p>
<p>
4. The PC I am using is Windows 8 home edition and not business which I notice is a problem as computer management does not have users and groups it appears. The remote pc is Windows 7 Enterperise.<br />
<br />
So at the moment I just have a laptop that is stuck at the login screen.

</p><blockquote>I guess I am doomed then? </blockquote>
<p>No, you're not doomed. I gave you a recipe to solve your problem. Giving the person an admin password for a few minutes does not jeopardise the integrity of the machine, provided that you then reset this password within a few minutes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this person can burn a System Repair CD on some other Windows 7 machine then he can use it to boot the machine into Windows Repair Mode. From there he can use System Restore to set Windows back to a point before he changed the password. You would need
 to practise this on your own machine before guiding him through the process.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Password Reset Key problem</h2>
                    I created a Windows 7 password reset key on a jump drive according to instructions. When I tested it, the computer labeled it as being in drive F, but it only gave the options of inserting it into drive G or H. The only way I could get it to work was to
 use two jump drives. Then it would see the reset key in drive I and allow me proceed. How can I fix this?

<div>4. Are you getting any error message while trying to login to the Microsoft account?</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Let us try to perform a system restore, and check if you are able to get back the User account.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>System restore: This option takes your PC back to an earlier point in time, called a system restore point. Restore points are generated when you install a new app, driver, or Windows update, and when you create a restore point manually.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Restoring won’t affect your personal files, but it will remove apps, drivers, and updates installed after the restore point was made.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Refer to the section "Use installation media to restore or reset your PC" in the following article to perform system restore:</div>
<div><br />
Recovery options in Windows 10:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/windows-10-recovery-options</span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If you don’t have an installation media, you have to create an installation media for that.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may download an ISO from the below link:<br />

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Though it is said that System Restore does not affect your personal information such as email, documents, photos, videos, etc., but there is highly possible that some of your personal files are deleted while system restoring.
<div><br />
During System Restore, there may be errors and such errors may cause damage to the files that are present in the system. And, computer shutdown during restoring process may also lead to file loss. Sometimes when System Restore is failed, it may lead to loss
 of important files as well.</div>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Im using Microsoft Windows&nbsp;7 Ultimate x86, and Im wondering if I could speed up Windows Update Agent, because Its really slow on my ocasion! Its using only 0.73% of my Internet connection bandwidth while the only processor using that is "Host Process for
 windows Services".</p>
<p>Is there a way?</p>

            <blockquote>[1] Its exactly opposite of your explanation sir. WUA do not consume enough amount of bandwidth while there is plenty of it! Only 0.73% as an avarage. Its slow on download not on installing updates.<br />
<br />
[2] "Alert me" Option did not work! Why Hotmail did not warn me about new replies!!</blockquote>
<p>A1. You have no control over when or how quickly Automatic Updates downloads installers for updates. You will find this happens more quickly in months where only a few updates have been released. (The number of updates released in October 2010 was an all-time
 record so it was a very&nbsp;usual month.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you wish, you can bypass Automatic Updating and install updates manually (see
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/How-can-I-tell-if-my-computer-is-up-to-date" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/How-can-I-tell-if-my-computer-is-up-to-date</a>) but I would strongly encourage you&nbsp;NOT to disable Automatic Updates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A2. Maybe your Hotmail account's scr3wed up, too?</p>

    <title>GFWL installer does not install xlive.dll to System32 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joequincy  say:</h3>
<h2>            GFWL installer does not install xlive.dll to System32</h2>
                    I purchased Batman: Arkham City via Steam, and ever since I ran it for the first time (and thus, Steam executed its installation procedure, including some sort of GFWL step), all GFWL games crash on launch. Luckily, I've gotten an error that shows me that
 at least part of the problem is a File Not Found: Windows/System32/xlive.dll
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So of course, I looked and it is indeed missing... but here's the part that buggers me: Every solution I've found suggests installing the GFWL Marketplace client... which I already had installed. The first time I ran the installer, it immediately jumped
 to the "done" screen, so I went to the Programs and Features pane of Controle Panel, and uninstalled the GFWL Marketplace and the GFWL Redistributable, then ran the installer again. It successfully installed xlive.dll to my SysWOW64 folder, but there is still
 no file present in the System32 folder.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>What can I do?</div>

            To clarify, my question <i>has not been answered</i>. The GFWL installer is not installing xlive.dll, and without it, no GFWL games are able to run.<br />
<br />
While I asked on the gaming forums linked above, I have received no replies, even though the question has been active for more than a week. That particular community seems to have an extremely low level of participation from anyone with more than anecdotal
 knowledge, and I do not expect to receive any kind of help there.<br />
As well, the Batman: Arkham City forums have proven to receive negligible visits and zero support from Rocksteady staff, and I do not expect that I will receive any kind of help from them either.<br />
<br />
Please, if you are at all familiar with getting xlive.dll properly reinstalled, share what you know. I will greatly appreciate your help!

            <p>Can't you just copy xlive.dll from SysWOW64 folder to Windows/System32/?</p>

Strange as it may seem many of the files in SysWOW64 are the same<br />
as in System 32, and this is one of them.<br />
<br />
Not sure why the GFWL client did not install the xlive.dll though.<br />
Maybe your Anti-Virus blocked it. AV's do strange things from time to time.<br />

The xlive.dll in SysWOW64 is not, in fact, the same as the one in System32. The former is a 64-bit DLL, and the latter is a 32-bit DLL. This was the very first thing I tried. (I run MSE for AV. I highly doubt it's the culprit.)<br />
<br />
A subsequent update to the GFWL Client (and the reason I stopped bumping this thread) removed the requirement for the 32-bit version on 64-bit systems. The DLL was never installed to System32, but after the update it ceased to be an issue.<br />
<br />
Obviously I'm not from Microsoft, but I'd venture a guess that because GFWL is a separate client, and not actually embedded in whatever game is being played, Microsoft realized that they do not need 32-bit compatibility on a 64-bit system. The game can be 32-
 or 64-bit and still communicate with GFWL via the API.

            I thought from your first post that you had reinstalled GFWL&nbsp; and were still having issues. So it just needed an update after installing then ?<br />
<br />
<br />
[[EDIT: It looks like my version of GFWL was aging (once I install a GFWL game<br />
I go off line to play thereafter ) , so my System32 folder still had an xlive.dll which, going by the size, is the same file as in SysWOW64. This may well have been an incorrect assumption.]]<br />
<br />
No one on the forums are either. Even the ones with fancy titles like 'system engineer' are just community people. No Monopoly$oft employees in sight.<br />
&nbsp;Maybe GFWL is not embedded in games, but it is a form of DRM, and as such is somewhat integrated into the game, and it does cause lots of issues.<br />
You certainly cannot run the game without GFWL (except for using a crack).<br />
<br />
<br />
Not sure what you mean. There is only one installer for GFWL client unlike say, graphics drivers which have both 32 &amp; 64bit versions. I guess the installer could<br />
have instruction to install into only one of the two instead of both System32 and<br />
SysWOW64.<br />
<br />
Fair enough, but when we don't know which one is in use the suggestion to<br />
disable is a viable troubleshooting exercise. The biggest culprits are <br />
Norton, Kaspersky and Mc Afee, but all of them have potential for silently <br />
blocking something at one time or another.<br />
It can be something simple. In my case Avast caused the 3D settings in<br />
Nvidia Control Panel to load very slowly. This was only for a period of a month<br />
or so, but is just one of many examples of the strange things that AV's can do.<br />

            I'll clarify :
<ul>
<li>The crash happened during the initialization of the GFWL client when starting Batman: AC (which is why the original question is posted here, and not on the Rocksteady forums).</li></ul>
<div><br />
<ul>
<li>The GFWL client has been updated since I posted the question. There is no longer a requirement for the xlive.dll in System32 on 64-bit systems. The DLL is not installed, and the client does not check for it.</li></ul>
<div><br />
<ul>
<li>It appears that there was a GFWL client update very shortly <b>before</b> my issue which removed the 32-bit software from 64-bit systems,
<i>but did not remove</i> the code where the client loads those DLLs, which was the cause of the crash.</li></ul>
<div><br />
<ul>
<li>Games that use GFWL do not run the client as an embedded tool, but rather instruct Windows to initialize it as a separate process, and then communicate with it using an API (that's the quick and dirty explanation). Because of this, it does not matter whether
 both the game and the GFWL client are 32-bit or 64-bit. As long as the API is used properly, information can move between the two pieces of software regardless of the instruction set being used by either.</li></ul>
<div><br />
<ul>
<li>(The GFWL installer is capable of determining whether to install the 32-bit version or the 64-bit version, as you theorize. Also, I mentioned MSE only so that you'd know I hadn't discarded your AV suggestion out of hand. I didn't mean to imply it was an
 unreasonable suggestion.)</li></ul>
<div>Edit to add: Since this question has been resolved by the GFWL client update, I'll be deleting the question soon. Thank you to all who provided suggestions!</div>

            Nice response. Informative, and I've learned something about GFWL&nbsp; and it's newer version.<br />
<br />
No - don't delete your OP please, as this thread is informative, and<br />
your first post is a good lead in to what you did to solve the problem.<br />
