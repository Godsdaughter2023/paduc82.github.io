            Do a reset of the PC.
<br />This is the best way to give a machine to someone else removing all your apps and data.
<br />Go to start - settings - update and security - recovery
<br />Click get started under reset.

<h2>            How can I tell which window has the keyboard focus, by looking&#63;</h2>
                    <p>How can I tell which window has the keyboard focus, by looking?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Used to be there was a difference in appearance between the window with the focus (activated) and other windows. With two large monitors, and generally 20 or so windows open, it is very hard to "guess" or "remember" which window has the focus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I've seen so far, if I look really close, is the 1px border around the active window is a different color than other windows. But that is extremely easy to overlook.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I lose the mouse, I can figure out where it is because I turned on the option to draw a circle around it when I hit the Control key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there some similar way to figure out which window has the focus? Or better, some setting that changes the color of the active window's title bar to be different than inactive windows, like it used to be?</p>

            <p>1. Two large monitors with maybe 20 windows open, and maybe 5 windows are fully visible on the monitors, with the other partially or fully hidden. When I walk away and come back, I look at the screen and wonder which window has the keyboard focus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Ever since Windows was created, there has been one window that has the keyboard focus. That is the window to which keystrokes are sent, when you type on the keyboard. You know, the keyboard is the thing that gets in the way of moving your mouse around,
 especially to the left. Another description for the window that has the keyboard focus is the activated window, or the "top of the Z order".</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. In prior versions of Windows, the title bar of the window with the keyboard focus had a different background color than any of the other windows. In Windows 95, the window with the keyboard focus had a blue background color for the title bar, and all
 the others had grey.&nbsp; This was an easy thing to spot. Newer versions of Windows have used colors that are less and less different, but it was still fairly easy to distinguish the one window that was different than the others. With Windows 10, the background
 color for all windows seems to be white.&nbsp; This makes it very hard to distinguish which window has the keyboard focus. This is a new issue, encountered within the last few days when I upgraded to Windows 10. The purpose of my question is to find a solution
 (one or more) so that I can try them. If there is a solution, I haven't yet found it by Googling. Most items I have found by Googling are just the complaints by other people about the same issue. If you have solution to offer, please suggest it.</p>

            <p>I have the same issue as DisgustedWin7User. I just upgraded to Win 10 last week from Win 7. The very first thing I noticed was there was no way to distinguish the active window (the one that has keyboard focus) from any of the others. The second thing was
 how ugly the windows looked with all white title bars.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My first step was to go to the personalization settings to change to the Windows Classic Theme. OK, that wasn't there, so I then looked for a way, as I did in past Windows versions, to change the Active Title Bar color. Nope, that wasn't possible either.
 The best I could do was change the title bar of all windows to a color other than white, so at least the windows looked better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what I'm asking Microsoft to do is bring back the feature which allows one to distinguish the active window (the one which has keyboard focus) from all others. This is a very important usability feature.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Tim</p>

            <p>I just noticed something that sort of solves this problem. As I mentioned in my prior note, I applied a method discussed
<a href="http://www.intowindows.com/how-to-change-title-bar-color-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a> to add a color of my choice to the window title bar. I used </p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ColorizationColor=0X12C1FFFF</p>
<p>
</p><p>to give the title bars a pale green color. What I just noticed today is the <em>
<strong>Close</strong></em> control (X on the right of the bar), turns red when the window is active (has keyboard focus). In all other windows the Close control is the title bar color. This is at least a good visual clue, though I'd much prefer it if the whole
 title bar turned red for the active window. If the active window has been pushed far enough to the right so the Close control is off the screen, it won't help. I know that's somewhat pathological, but I sometimes move windows around like that so I can see
 portions of two windows at the same time.</p>

            <p>If you have more than one program window open, and if they're not full-screen, it is sometimes helpful to know at a glance which window is the one with focus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By "focus," I mean the activated window, the one at the top of the Z order, the one in the foreground, the one that's going to accept keystrokes from the keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally, that window will be the one in front, but if your windowed programs are not overlapping, you can't tell which one is set to receive keyboard keystrokes until you start typing. Very occasionally, a window will appear on screen
<em>in front of</em> the window that is set to receive keystrokes. (This can still happen even&nbsp;when your program windows are all full-screen, by the way.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>In earlier versions of Windows, since Windows 2.0 or 3.0, the user could tell which window had focus by looking at the title bars of the windows. The window with focus would have a unique color; all other windows would share a different color.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are in the habit of always clicking a program window with your mouse before typing, or if you only ever use one program at a time, you'll never see the issue. But those who use Windows as it was designed, to run multiple programs at once, find it
 necessary to know which window has focus. Microsoft did us no favors by removing the only visual cue. We need to have that back.</p>

<p>Are you facing the issue only with Forte’s agent?</p>

<p><span>Internet Explorer 9 utilizes much of graphics and performance sub-layers that were introduced with Windows Vista and carried forward
 to Windows 7. Hence Windows XP does not support Internet Explorer 9.</span></p>

<h3> timpolsfoot  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I change the Microsoft Account email login on my Win 8.1 laptop</h2>
                    <p>I've read the other post and did not find any that addresses my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I bought a new laptop with Win8. I created the admin account using my current email account at that time. I have used the PC for a couple of years now and have several customizations such as desktop icons, installed programs, etc. I want to change the admin
 login account email address to one I now use. The original one is not even active anymore.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that every time I try to change the login email I end up with a brand new generic desktop with all of my icons and programs gone from the desktop.&nbsp; I want to correct the login name, old email account, to my current email and still get the same
 desktop I have created over the past two years. I am not new to computers and feel I am missing something simple in resolving this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know someone will come through with the solution to my problem</p>

</p><p><strong>Follow these steps:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: Switch to local user account:</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />

<p>
</p><p>a. Press “Windows key +W”.<br />
b. Type “users” without quotes in the search box.<br />
c. Then select “Users” from the left panel.<br />
d. You will get an option “Switch to a Local account” right below your user account name.<br />
e. Select “Switch to a local account” option.<br />
f. Enter the required details.<br />
g. Then login to the local account and check how it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: Switch back to Microsoft account</strong></p>
<strong>
</strong><p><strong>
</strong>
</p><p>
</p><p>Follow these steps to create a “Microsoft account”.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Press “Windows key +W”.<br />
b. Type “users” without quotes in the search box.<br />

    <title>Edge is RUINING my PDFs for school notes &#43; Constant freezing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> benhaberer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Edge is RUINING my PDFs for school notes &#43; Constant freezing</h2>
                    <p>First, I have to say that I am not a fan of using Edge for PDFs. Microsoft removed their Reader app across the board last year. The Reader app was wonderful and simple- never had any problems.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My current issues,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a 3 month old SP6. It has been plagued with bugs from day one, but Microsoft seems to be actively fixing them. My current bug involves PDF editing with Edge. I start annotating PDF documents of slides for school with the Surface Pen. At the end of
 class, I save the document (usually a PDF of PPT slides, six a page). When I go to open the document I just saved, 90% of my writing is gone! All that is there is scattered handwritten letters all over the page! Most of my work has disappeared! I have found
 that doing a Print to Pdf before I save the document saves all of my notes, but it is very annoying to edit down the road.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly, my SP6 has frequent "absent seizures" where the screen just freezes. Sometimes it is just for a few seconds, sometimes it lasts until I press the power button to turn off/on the screen. I notice it most often while using Edge.&nbsp; Interestingly, audio
 continues to work during the freezes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My device is up to date on updates, hasn't been dropped or been wet. I've tried the usual troubleshooting and Refreshed the PC. Problems still persist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else have similar problems? Any solutions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks all of you wonderful people in the Microsoft Forums!!!!!</p>

                    I downloaded some pictures, and they came out fine. Recently, I went to view them, and I opened my pictures folder and i noticed the preview thumbnails have gone black. I went ahead and opened one, and it displayed fine, then I hit the next one,and it
 was black, as were the rest of them in the folder (including the one I had originally opened. I tried to find a topic for this online and could not find anything. I am running Windows 8.1.<br />

            Its likely a corrupt download. 
<br />
<br />I would try downloading another copy.
<br />
<br />Also, use 7-Zip or WinRAR to extract it.
<br />
<br />Also do the following:
<br />
<br />Open Windows Defender Security Center
<br />Click Virus &amp; threat protection
<br />Click Virus &amp; threat protection settings
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Controlled folder access
<br />Toggle it off
<br />
<br />Also in Windows Defender Security Center
<br />
<br />Open App &amp; browser control
<br />Set 'Check apps &amp; files' to off

            Hello. 
<br />
<br />Are you using the default Windows extracter? 
<br />
<br />It might be better to use a third party app like 7zip or winrar to extract the file since windows is saying it is corrupt.

            Hi  旭照丁,
<br />
<br />Most likely the archive you downloaded is corrupt . . 
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download a tiny free utility caled Universal Extractor - if anything can extract that archive it will !!
<br />
<br />Install that - it will just sit on the right click menu in file explroer
<br />
<br />Don't work from your Desktop - that file would be too big for your Desktop,
<br />
<br />Right click the archive and use Universal Extractor to extract that file to some other location other than your Desktop
<br />

<h2>            Blank message body in WIndows Live Mail from one specific sender</h2>
                    <p>I have to say <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/f56d9012-0474-4f54-b2f6-e10490146e0b" title="¡Firedog">
<span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">¡Firedog</span></a> seems to be the only person with an explanation for this problem. I have also started having the same issue reported for Windows Live Mail 2012 by Colenbrander, in that emails received from a specific sender (Skype
 Customer Service) have an invisible message body. I&nbsp;also have IE 11 on a Windows 7 64 bit system. Windows Live Mail 2011 &nbsp;(Build 15.4.3555.0308), will not display anything in the message body for emails sent from Skype Customer Service, of all things. Since
 Microsoft now owns Skype, this is particularly troubling. I can read the emails on my android phone, and on Outlook 2007, but my default client is Windows Live Mail. If I reply to the blank message, the text becomes visible. If I go to options and select "Read
 all messages in plain text", it becomes visible. This behavior is a pain, and is the exact same thing reported in the prior question. I can see I am not the only person experiencing the issue, but it also seems that nothing has been posted as a solution. If
 it's the result of XML markup handling by Windows Live Mail and it's messages from Skype doing it, shouldn't Microsoft be able to provide a fix? How about changing the problematic XML generated by the Skype system and use something that works in their email
 client?&nbsp;I appreciate <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/f56d9012-0474-4f54-b2f6-e10490146e0b" title="¡Firedog">
<span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">¡Firedog</span></a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;his thoughtful explanations. I jumped that thread a bit, but I would really like a solution to be posted that doesn't result in a total rebuild of either my OS or email client when it's a self-induced problem
 with two Microsoft products. I am following up my jump with this question. Is there a solution that corrects the behavior without resorting to reading all emails in plain text or blindly replying to blank message bodies?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>Windows 8 Windows Update fails with error 80244FFF - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> olivers dad  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8 Windows Update fails with error 80244FFF</h2>
                    I have just upgraded to windows 8 and windows update now refuses to check for updates stating that it "could not search for new updates" with an error code of 80244FFF.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>a) performing the upgrade in place following the steps in the upgrade assistant - no change.</div>
<div>b) performing a clean install from a USB drive - no change (this should work as it is a fresh install on a clean drive with nothing else installed to interfere).</div>
<div>c) running the troubleshooter (which simply stops/starts two services and pretends to have fixed something).</div>
<div>d) reatarting (well, you never know)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I am a developer who has installed all of the preview releases and can safely say that so far the final version has been the most unstable and frustrating - a new OS should just work out of the box with the exception of some esoteric drivers. &nbsp;All of the
 information online simply states that you need to run the troubleshooter or perform a clean reboot - neither of which solve anything. &nbsp;I can update Windows defender through its own GUI so it cant be a connection to the update servers.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help greatly received.</div>
                </div>

            Oddly, my problem turned out to be a bad disk drive. I ran diagnostics on my entire system, nothing was noted to be a problem. I read many posts around the web that talked to disk write problems, or the Windows Update database may have become corrupted.<br />
<br />
I decided to take a chance and replace my system drive and VOILA. Problem is gone. I should note I was also experiencing hangs and slowdowns with my system that have also disappeared with the replacement of the drive.<br />
<br />
So, even though the drive passed all self checks, something definitely went wrong with it. I was able to prove that by inserting it into an external eSATA bay and I immediately had problems trying to do anything with the drive. Disk Manager especially. It would
 hang trying to read it. It was a very "Twilight Zone" problem I had not previously experienced.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying this is the fix for everyone, but it was the fix for me.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Rob<br />

            <p>I had the same issue.&nbsp; Found out it was not the OS drive, but my secondary drive.&nbsp; Everytime it was plugged in, tons of problems, once I disconnected it, everything would work fine.&nbsp; That was the only difference between my two Windows 8 custom computers,
 that one drive messed up my one computer where the other computer was fine.&nbsp; I deleted the partition and reformated the drive in an old Windows 7 computer that I have (i could not even start up windows 8 on my main computer) and then put it back in the Windows
 8 computer, everything work fine.&nbsp; Just a bad secondary drive that needed to be reformated.</p>
<p>Who knew....</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks goes out to the Microsoft Community for all your help and support with this issue...</p>

<h2>            It now takes two attempts to sign in to my computer</h2>
                    On Wednesday November 1, 2017 I received a message saying that Windows wanted to download and install an upgrade to my pc. I allowed the download and upgrade to proceed. Now it takes me two attempts to log in to get to my computer's desktop. The first
 attempt takes me back to the sign in page. The second attempt allows me to log in and use my pc. Is anybody else having the same problem? I tried contacting Microsoft support via an online chat, but the Microsoft agent I was in contact with apparently was
 not fluent in English. It took more than 15 minutes before he knew what problem I was referring to. At that point I gave up. Any ideas or suggestions? I am running Windows 10, 64 bit with an Intel i3 processor.

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Troubleshoot camera connection problems<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Troubleshoot-camera-connection-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Troubleshoot-camera-connection-problems</a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You probably need to reload the camera drivers&nbsp;and any camera control software (usually included<br />
with the drivers and&nbsp;installed at the same time).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Logon as Admin.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Imaging - write down make and model of camera - double click<br />
on it and on driver's tab get version. Now click Update Drivers (which may not do anything as MS<br />
is far behind certifying drivers). The RIGHT CLICK on the camera - UNINSTALL - REBOOT - this<br />
will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site and download the latest camera driver and other related camera<br />
software (if no newer get the same ones).<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to them and RIGHT CLICK - RUN AS ADMIN - reboot after each driver.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers.<br />
<span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />

</span><span><br />
Then leave windows updates on however stop it from loading drivers which are often older than the<br />
ones you have installed. If Updates suggests a driver then HIDE it and look manually to see if their<br />
really is a newer one (at both system maker and device maker's sites).<br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about your issue with signing into online apps. Are you able to get updates through Windows Update? If so, do you have all the current updates for your device? Are you logging into your Surface or the apps with your Microsoft linked account?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please try the following article on setting up your Surface to a <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-gb/support/networking-and-connectivity/connect-surface-to-a-wireless-network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
wireless network</a>. Also, please check the time/date and time zone on your device. If it is not set to your local zone, time/date, you may not be able to connect to the services.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If that does not work, please respond with the following information:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What type of network are you connecting to (Wired/Wireless, broadband, DSL, dialup)?</p>
<p>If wireless, what is the band you are on (802.11b, 802.11g, etc.)?</p>
<p>What is your internet connection speed?</p>
<p>When logging into your Surface, are you logging into it with a local account or Microsoft Account?</p>

<h2>            Should I be worried about total system failure</h2>
                    <p>Hey, guys,</p>
<p>&nbsp; I use this tool from Piriform.com called Speccy, which is a tool that shows you what's inside your computer. &nbsp;The area that I am concerned about is the part of this tool displaying information about my graphics/monitor. &nbsp;I just noticed something that told
 me it is unsafe, and I have no idea what that means. &nbsp;Here's the info:</p>

<p>My laptop (the one I am typing this message on right now) is working fine. &nbsp;But with respect to the graphics part of my device, the part that I have in bold is what has me worried. &nbsp;I have no idea what is wrong with my computer (if anything at all) and I
 would rather not ignore it if this is something I should be worried about. &nbsp;Yet, I don't want to trash this laptop if it is still working fine for me.</p>

            <p>As is often the case the wording makes problems far worse than they are. Referring to your title "total system failure" is not going to happen on the basis of this report.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a discrepancy between the current and working resolution according to the report. Check the specifications for your&nbsp;display and make sure that the graphics configuration is correct. If you have installed AMD drivers reinstall the ones from Toshiba</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then uninstall Speccy and don't worry about it, problem solved.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 tablet mode command prompt - keyboard</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP Stream 7 that I have upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp; So far so good except the command prompt.&nbsp; The issue is that in tablet mode Windows does not seem to see the command prompt window as a text input box and fails to bring the virtual keyboard up.&nbsp;
 I am having to switch off of tablet mode so I can get the keyboard incon in the task bar so that&nbsp;I can manually invoke the keyboard.&nbsp; This is not a huge problem, but it is a rough spot that could use a bit of polish.&nbsp; Does any know of a setting that may need
 to be changed on my part to correct this?&nbsp; Or, can I get the keyboard icon to stay in my tray while in tablet mode so I don't have to switch modes?</p>

            <p>This may be due to the fact that the updates were not installed properly I suggest you check the status of these updates in update history by following these steps:</p>
<p><b>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></b>Open the&nbsp;Control Panel and click on the&nbsp;Windows Update&nbsp;icon</p>
<p><b>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></b>Click on the&nbsp;View update history&nbsp;link.</p>
<p><b>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></b>To&nbsp;View Details&nbsp;of a Single Windows Update</p>
<p><b>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></b>Select and right click on a listed Windows Update, then click/tap on&nbsp;View details.
</p>
<p>If the status of the update is successful then cancel the automatic update. If not run the update troubleshooter and if the issue still persists then manually install the updates.</p>

            <p>Assuming you are using the latest version of Windows Live Movie Maker (15.4.3555.0308) which you can check by going to the blue
<strong>File</strong> menu (<strong>Alt+F</strong>) and choosing <strong>About Movie Maker...
</strong>then you have several AutoMovie themes, some canned transition, effects and titles.</p>
<p>In terms of add-ons, the only things that are available in this version are add-ons for uploading to various different video hosting sites.&nbsp; There are no additional themes or "roll-ins".&nbsp; If you would like to suggest this, send feedback via feedback.live.com.</p>
<p>As for prior versions of Movie Maker (e.g. <a href="http://goo.gl/B1eRC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
WMM 6.0</a>), there are quite a few <a href="http://goo.gl/jLyuG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
community developed add-ons</a>.&nbsp; I'm personally still waiting for Microsoft to provide a published API for add-ons in Windows Live Movie Maker, so until then you have to enjoy what is already provided in Windows Live Movie Maker, wait for Microsoft to publish
 some add-ons, or install a copy of the "classic" Movie Maker (WMM 6.0).</p>

            <p>First of all, I assume that you have XP Pro and not XP Home.</p>
<p>This behavior is usually set by group policy.&nbsp; If you have administrator privilege, you can start up the Group Policy Editor (Start -&gt; Run -&gt; "gpedit.msc") and navigate to:</p>
<p>&nbsp; User Configuration -&gt; Administrative Templates -&gt; Control Panel</p>
<p>and on the right side, double-click on "Prohibit access to the Control Panel" and change it to "No".&nbsp; If you find that it is grayed-out and/or you can't change it, that would indicate that there is a Domain Policy in effect that will not permit this operation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You *might* be able to affect this behavior by using Regedit to delete the following registry value:</p>
<p>&nbsp; HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\Explorer value=NoControlPanel</p>
<p>but if it is set by Domain Policy, the effects may be temporary at best.&nbsp; The usual warnings about using Regedit apply...&nbsp; make sure you have a backup of your registry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HTH,</p>
