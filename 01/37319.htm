<h2>            Storage full - System &#38; reserved.</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I have an older laptop with 128gb SDD, I am a home user.&nbsp; The machine had Windows 8 installed upon purchase and has since been upgraded to 8.1 and then 10.</p>
<p>I have been short of storage space for a while but now need to get it sorted out as the laptop is going to be used much more.&nbsp; I have done the usual Disk cleanup and tidied up my apps.&nbsp; However, the System &amp; reserved is showing as 57.1gb.&nbsp; This seems a lot
 but I really have no idea what this figure would be on a new laptop or an even an older machine that had Window 10 installed on day 1.</p>
<p>So, please can someone confirm if 57.1gb is normal or huge and what I need to do to reduce it as much as possible.</p>
<p>I also have 17.2gb of 'other' including two esd files of 3gb each.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

            Hi Ian.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to both manage smaller drive storage and perform version Updates on them manually by the most stable method that requires much less space than Windows Update.  
<br />
<br />First here are tips here for managing smaller drives: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows/more-space-how-windows-10s-storage-analysis-helps-you-free-up-your-hard-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-storage-Space-low-capacity-windows-10-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-stora...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/jan/05/what-is-the-best-way-to-deal-with-windows-10-updates-on-a-32gb-netbook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/...</a>
<br />
<br />This should make enough space to install Windows Updates.  But for now I'd focus on the latest Version 1803 since successfully installing it will bring along all Windows Updates and also resolves almost all other problems since it reinstalls Windows keeping your files and programs in place. 
<br />
<br />Install the Media Creation Tool on another PC to create bootable media or download the ISO to stick or disk, transfer it back to the target PC to open the media or click to mount the ISO, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  This avoids needing the space to download the Upgrade and it's staging files.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If the  Upgrade Assistant  has already been installed by WIndows Update then I'd remove it and it's staging files first to recover that space:
<br />
<br />First turn off Windows Update service to regain control:
<br />
<br />Type services.msc in Start Search,  Open Services applet.
<br />
<br />Scroll Down to Windows Update Service and click on it, Stop service and set to Disabled.  Now it should clear the queue of Version and other Updates until you turn it back on and Check again.
<br />
<br />Uninstall Upgrade Assistant In Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features.  
<br />
<br />Clear out any Upgrade folders in C: drive root.  Restart PC, try Upgrade again.
<br />
<br />Delete the esd files which are for the Update and taking up space.  If necessary take ownership:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option-in-file-folder-context-menu-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option...</a>
<br />
<br />Another option is to do the the best possible Clean Install in this link which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br /> 
<br />This will give you back all but 15gb of the drive so you can slowly reinstall programs to see how they affect performance, move your files to another drive if possible or offline into OneDrive in the cloud with On-demand access to them only:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also turn off or block Updates if they are bothering you.  
<br />
<br />There are ways to block Updates here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want you can set a Metered Connection per the above tutorial, then when ready turn it off to install Updates.  You can even wait until the twice-yearly Version Updates to run manually from Media Creation Tool which is a more stable method than Windows Update and includes all previous updates rolled into it.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved

            <pre>Problem 1: Lack of free space.
Press Windows key + R
Type: C:\Windows\Logs\CBS
Hit Enter
Delete any log files found in that folder.
Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; System &gt; Storage
Under Storage sense, click Free up space now
Wait while it scans for temporary files.
Check any location with large amounts of space.
Click Remove files.
Also see how you can use TreeSize to find and free up space:
https://www.groovypost.com/howto/map-hardrive-usage-find-hidden-files-windows-10-treesize-freeware/
Search through any folders that might be on your desktop that might be taking up space. 
Options for freeing up space:
Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space inaddition to improving overall system performace.
Having enough disk space is especially important if you are performing task such as upgrading to the new Windows 10. It is one of the the first things Windows setup checks before it starts copying files. Large programs too will often require that you have enough disk space available.
Lets start.
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
Then hit Enter
Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
Location/Type 	Description 	Safe to Delete
Downloaded Program Files 	Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. 	YES
Temporary Internet Files 	The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster. 	Keep It
Offline Webpages 	Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. 	Keep It
Recycle Bin 	The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. 	YES
Temporary files 	Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you don’t want to redownload it every time. 	YES
Thumbnails 	Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I don’t see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. 	YES
Debug Dump Files 	When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. 	Keep It
System error memory dump files 	Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur in Windows. 	Keep It
 The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from previous version of Windows 10 or clean install, Windows 10 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.
http://notebooks.com/2010/11/09/how-to-recover-documents-music-and-email-after-upgrading-with-the-windows-old-folder/
Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
System Restore – System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 10. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of  disk space to keep System Restore Points.
Configuring System Protection settings
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated. 
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file. 
Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn’t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It’s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.
There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.

            <p>Likely a corrupt download. I downloaded a copy of iTunes 11 64 bit and I have it installed on 3 computers running Windows Vista 64 bit, Windows 7 64 bit, Windows 8 64 bit.</p>
<p>Try downloading again and see if it resolves the problem.</p>

<p>i have 2 xbox 360s in my house 1 is mine and the other is my sons and we some times like to play games together on the same box but having to copy things from 1 box to another is not really the best way to do this shorely ! seeing as i have an account that
 is recorded online with microsoft and everything that is used through any xbox is surely recorded by them ! anyone know a better answer to this very frustrating question and i can not recover my tag as this takes over 1 hour to gather the info !</p>

<p>You can also save your profile on a flash drive and move it back and forth that way. Otherwise, there is no way around it. A profile can only be on 1 console at a time.</p>

<p>An easy way to get past this is to get a small USB flash drive (1-2GB is more than enough) and transfer your profile onto it. All you have to do then is to unplug the flash drive from one Xbox and plug it into the other to use it, no account recovery needed.</p>

<p>Hello Pahan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would like to clarify that the issue consists of not having the parent account on the console, so there is no way to approve access for the child account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, our best suggestion would be to try as best as possible to remember the information used to sign into that specific parent account, and if this is not possible it would be best to reach out to our
<strong><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">customer support team</a></strong> to further investigate into the matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This recommendation is based on the forums community not carrying the tools for reviewing the account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We hope this information helps and if further assistance is needed, feel free to reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best wishes!</p>

<p>You can use Parental controls: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Set-up-Parental-Controls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Set-up-Parental-Controls</a>.&nbsp; To block access, just set the time limits to whatever you choose (none if you want to completely block access).&nbsp; Remember to login using the account you want to block and it has
 to be only a standard user account because any administrator can access the settings and change them to regain full control.&nbsp; There are other options you can set with Parental Controls (like blocking internet sites by rating or preventing access to programs
 on the system and some others - but what I explained above will do what you specifically requested.</p>

    <title>unable to join game together in Destiny with friend - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            unable to join game together in Destiny with friend who&#38;&#35;39&#59;s on xbox 360 while I am on xbox one</h2>
                    
<p>I am unable to invite an online&nbsp;friend in Destiny who's playing on an XBOX 360 while I am playing on an XBOX One. Is this a known limitation with cross platform friend games for Destiny or is there another reason why we can't play in the same game? When
 I try to invite him, I can never "see him in the list of friends", but we are able to send messages back and forth so he is clearly online.</p>

<p>Backwards compatibility isn't available to "EVERY" Xbox 1 owner. I think it's in Preview Testing or something maybe if you're in the Preview Program thingy you can experience it. Well, Microsoft lets us exchange VOICE messages between Xbox 360 and Xbox 1,
 when Microsoft provides us the ability to verbally communicate using voice messages between Xbox 360 and Xbox 1 (which you can already do), maybe you'll be able to communicate verbally later. Microsoft are coding and software experts after all, they do make
 operating systems for PCs. </p>

<p>Good question Murder..i have never come across the more costly cards as i do all my subscriptions from credit card so a right answer i wouldn't be able to give.I do know though the cards that have expired on me in the past all had expiration dates on the
 back if that helps any.I would say if you don't see anything involving a expiration on the back that you would be able to save that card for rainy day.Most likely if you called X-Box support they would be able to give you a fast and accurate answer.</p>

<p>I bought a 12 month Live code close to two years ago now and used it about two or three months ago for another account. I'd say they don't expire unless they're used or someone gets lucky and activates the code without actually seeing it.</p>

    <title>Microphone Emitting Static Noise When Controller Vibrates - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> warfang23  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microphone Emitting Static Noise When Controller Vibrates</h2>
                    
<p>So, a little earlier, I was in a party with a buddy, and I kept hearing an annoying, static-like, buzzing sound every now and then. I asked my buddy if he could also hear it, and he said he could. I saw that it was coming from my microphone, (was playing
 Black Ops 2 and it kept showing my microphone making a noise in-game) and I noticed that it only made the noise when I fired a gun, or did anything in the game that caused the controller to vibrate (close explosions, getting shot, etc.). I turned the vibration
 off, and it stopped making the noise.</p>
<p>I've had this controller (black) and the microphone (Earforce XC1) for about a month, (bought them at the same time) so they're fairly new. The noise just started happening today, and I was wondering if there's any other way to deal with this problem than
 by turning off the vibration. I've searched around the internet for others who are experiencing the same issue, and most people have said that the problem is in the controller's wiring, (a faulty controller, essentially) and there's no way to personally remedy
 it other than by turning the vibration off while wearing a headset. Is this true?</p>

<p>I have to say that the controller is guilty when hearing that noice, but if you have another controller you can try it on that one or on one of your friend's controller. If you don't hear the noice by then, your controller is guilty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another option that I experience with a combination of wireless controllers and wired headsets (mic) is that the battery may be low. If you own a wireless controller, please check your battery status or put some new charged in your controller and see of
 the problem will disappear.</p>

<h2>            Lost administrator rights in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded my laptop last year to Windows 10 and up until today has run perfectly.</p>
<p>Today I lost all administrator rights and am unable to recover. When I try to enable the 'hidden' administrator UAC just keeps asking for an admin user name and password. It did run an update first thing and after that I lost the start menu but after reinstalling
 the Windows apps the start menu came back but rights went. I do not get the option to 'run with administrator rights' anywhere.</p>
<p>Can anyone point me in the right direction? I am not tech savvy, which probably shows!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Since there is no simple solution for your problem, you probably need to ask a computer-savvy friend to do this for you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ask a friend to create a bootable USB recovery flash disk on his Windows 10 machine, using the command
<em>RecoveryDrive.exe</em>.</li><li>Use this disk to boot the machine into Windows Repair Mode.</li><li>Use System Restore to set Windows back to a point when your admin account worked as it should.</li><li>Create, test and document a spare admin account, same as you have a spare house key. If you had this account right now then you could solve your current problem in less than five minutes.</li></ol>

            Hi. I don't believe Microsoft sells just a transceiver alone for your specific issue. However Microsoft has said before that any universal 2.4GHz USB transceiver will work from just about any retailer. 
<br />
<br />The best way to find one or figure out what you need would be to call Microsoft directly or chat with support 
<br />

    <title>Safely Remove Hardware tool - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> murraysugden  say:</h3>
<h2>            Safely Remove Hardware  tool</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>I have had Windows 10 since the free copy was installed a couple of years ago. I have never had the 'Safely Remove Hardware' icon appear on my tool bar or in the hidden icons area. I thought Microsoft had done away with it. Then my wife got her copy of 10
 and damned if she didn't have the icon on her machine. I have searched on and off for the reason I do not have this facility and have not been able to find any way of safely remove an attached drive except to turn off the computer. This is what I have done.
 If I have an external drive or a USB installed I try to remember to take it out in the evening when I shut down my computer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to use 'RunDll32.exe shell32.dll,Control_RunDLL hotplug.dll'. I get a nice tidy little box that is suppose to have the hardware I have connected in it, but the box is blank. No USB, No external drive. These both show up on Windows Explorer so
 they are being detected. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to go to Windows Explorer, right click on the drive in question, click on properties. Here is where I run into problems, the next step is to click on properties again. There is no second properties button on the external drives. On the USB's
 there is and when I click on it the next step is click on the policies button. Nope, does not exist. My quest ends there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran 'Troubleshooting' and the results were, no troubles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The drivers are up to date according to the Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In 'Settings', under 'Personalization', under 'Task Bar' I go to 'Select which icons appear on the taskbar'. I get all these wonderful icons, most of which I don't give two hoots about, but there is no 'Safely Remove Hardware' icon. As a matter of note this
 icon does appear at this spot on my wife's computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone to 'Control Panel', 'Programs and Features', then to 'Turn Windows features on or off' and looked for ' UPnP User Interface' to untick but to now avail. (This was suggested on a non Windows site.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have gone to My Computer, Manage, Services and Applications, Services, found 'Plug and Play' and changed the start up to 'Automatic'. Then restarted the computer. This did not work so I changed it back as I don't really know what this did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did find one thing that worked but only for the USB's, NOT the external drives. I went to file explorer, right clicked on the drive and clicked on eject. For the USB's this worked OK but there was no eject option when I right clicked on the external drives.
 This is still a hassle as it requires going to a different screen. I would rather just have the icon available on the task bar.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>

            I assume you have a USB device connected otherwise the icon doesn’t appear so try this fix:<br />
• Press keyboard "win + R"<br />
• Type "regedit"<br />
• Search the value "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Notification\Settings\Microsoft.Explorer.Notification.{...}"<br />
• If you REG_DWORD 0x00000001(0) set "0" you can double click on value. Set the value data to "1"<br />
• Click "OK"

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Thanks for the answer. </p>
<p>First, yes I have run trouble shooter. Negative results. Second, there is only one user account on this PC. On our network my wife has her computer and the icon appears on hers. Third, I have installed a new mother board, but I THINK it was before I installed
 Windows 10 although that was more than a year ago and the exact timing is not clear to me. So it is possible I installed the motherboard after the windows 10 install.</p>

<h2>            Windows Partition Not Properly Fragmenting, Status Stuck At 12&#37; Fragmented Needs Optimisation, Windows 10 Home</h2>
                    After manually optimizing my hard disk drive the partition on which windows is installed still shows 12% Fragmented. After restarting windows its current status was on 13% Fragmented and when I defragmented the partition it showed 12% Fragmented. All other
 partition after defragmentation show 0% Fragmented. I checked the drive for errors but it is working normally and in Windows 8.1 drive optimization would show 0% Fragmented. Why is Windows saying that (C:) Drive needs optimization?

            I tried to defragment C Drive on in a clean boot but there was no difference. I ran chkdsk on C Drive and it reported no errors. I checked disk management which reported all drives to be in a healthy state. I ran a hard drive diagnostic test through UEFI
 in BIOS and left the computer on and went to sleep, I woke up in the morning and BIOS reported that my hard drive passed all tests. My computer is only one year old so hard disk failure is not likely to happen. When I tried windows optimization after the test
 it worked and reported 0% fragmentation, I tried defragmenting (C:) again after using my computer for a while and it worked fine. So did leaving my computer on for over 12 hours fix it? It can't be my hard disk I think it's still under warranty, I would like
 to know what was the cause of it and what I should do to prevent it.

            Lol ... you've spent far, far, far, far more time trying to defragment than you will ever save by being defragmented. It will take many lifetimes to break even. You have achieved the opposite of what you were trying to achieve.

            Hi Goutam2000, this is a strange error, try booting into Safe Mode to see if this can be fixed .. .
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Command Prompt
<br />
<br />Run this command and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />sfc /scannow
<br />
<br />Wait for that command to complete, then run this command and hit Enter:
<br />
<br />dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth
<br />
<br />That command will take time to complete, when it does, boot back into Windows normally and see if this is resolved       
        </p>

<br />Make sure your display driver is up-to-date.
<br />
<br />Also run SFC /SCANNOW command at administrative Command Prompt and see if that helps.

            Hi Goutam2000,
<br />
<br />It sounds like your keyboard is not working in Command Prompt . .. 
<br />
<br />From that Windows Recovery Environment:
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally       
        </p>

    <title>Unable to Fix winload.exe corrupt error using bootrec - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> curaustin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to Fix winload.exe corrupt error using bootrec</h2>
                    <p>Summary:</p>
<p>After a fresh installation of Windows 7 on a machine that had Windows Vista, I am unable to boot and keep getting an error that Windows failed to start due to corrupt winload.exe. Neither the Startup Repair using the Windows 7 installation CD, nor bootrec.exe
 have fixed the issue.</p>
<p>Objectives in order of preference:</p>
<p>1. Repair Windows 7 so that it boots and retain Windows Vista (once the machine is able to boot and respond to software) in a new partition</p>
<p>2. Repair Windows 7 and retain access to old files</p>
<p>3. Repair Windows 7 and forget the old files and programs</p>
<p>4. Revive Windows Vista and go back to old state</p>
<p>Background:</p>
<p>I have been running Windows Vista on a Sony VAIO VGN-NR240E. I attempted to shrink volume so as to add a partition using Paragon software. The process did not complete and the machine turned itself off during this process, after which the machine would not
 boot (likely due to moved files during the shrink attempt), and could not be repaired with the Vista CD.</p>
<p>After unsuccessful attempts with other software to shrink volume and create partition to install a second OS, I simply installed Windows 7 on the machine without partitioning. During the installation, it prompted about existing files, which were then put
 in directory c:\windows.old. Also during the installation, it kept giving messages about old files that were corrupt or which it could not resolve, and suggesting to check the disk.
</p>
<p>The installation worked and upon first boot, I saw a very dim, barely visible display (I mention this point in case it suggests any conflict with video). I rebooted and this time Windows 7 launched with no issues with the display. Another reboot led to the
 same display issue, which I again fixed by rebooting. I connected to the internet and walked away as Windows 7 updates were being installed. When I returned, it had rebooted and was running checkdisk, going through a large number of files to recover and repair
 orphan files, fix indices, etc.</p>
<p>When I next returned, it displayed the following error: Windows failed to start.</p>
<p>File: Winboot.exe</p>
<p>Status: 0xc0000098</p>
<p>Info: The selected entry could not be loaded because the application is missing or corrupt.</p>
<p>I restarted the machine using Windows 7 CD and clicked on Repair Your Computer. It lists Windows 7 as the only installation.</p>
<p>When I click on Startup Repair, I get the following message: Startup repair cannot repair this computer automatically.</p>
<p>Startup Repair Diagnosis and Repair Log:</p>
<p>System Disk: \Device\harddisk0</p>
<p>Windows Directory: c:\windows</p>
<p>AutoChk Run = 0</p>
<p>Number of Root causes = 1</p>
<p>The following 8 tests complete successfully with eror code = 0x0.</p>
<p>1. Check for updates</p>
<p>2. System disk test</p>
<p>3. Disk failure diagnosis</p>
<p>4. Disk metadata test</p>
<p>5. Target OS test</p>
<p>6. Volume content check</p>
<p>7. Boot manager diagnosis</p>
<p>8. System boot log diagnosis</p>
<p>Root cause found:</p>
<p>Boot manager failed to find OS loader</p>
<p>Repair action: File repair</p>
<p>Result: failed, error code: 0x4005</p>
<p>Repair action: Boot configuration data storage repair</p>
<p>Result: failed, error code: 0x490</p>
<p>I then used bootrec using the command prompt per the relevant Microsoft knowledge base entry ( http://support.microsoft.com/kb/927392/en-us ) and obtained the following results:</p>
<p>/ScanOs</p>
<p>Total identified windows installations: 1</p>
<p>[1] c:\windows.old\windows</p>
<p>This operation completed successfully.</p>
<p>/RebuildBcd</p>
<p>Successfully scanned Windows installations</p>
<p>Total identified windows installations: 1</p>
<p>[1] c:\windows.old\windows</p>
<p>Add installation to Bootlist?</p>
<p>(I enter N.)</p>
<p>This operation completed successfully</p>
<p>/FixBoot</p>
<p>This operation completed successfully</p>
<p>/FixMbr</p>
<p>This operation completed successfully</p>
<p>Upon rebooting, I continue to get the message about the missing or corrupt Winload.exe.</p>
<p>I am hesitant to add Windows Vista found under bootrec /RebuildBcd to the bootlist because I do not know what the effect will be, and how I would undo this step if it creates an unwanted result.</p>
<p>Based on an article about this issue ( <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/32523/how-to-manually-repair-windows-7-boot-loader-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/32523/how-to-manually-repair-windows-7-boot-loader-problems/</a>&nbsp;), I also tried bootsect /nt60 all when the steps above did not work. The same error remains.</p>
<p>During my first attempts, I had a wireless mouse connected to the system. Removing it did not help.</p>
<p>I would appreciate any suggestions.</p>

            To add to the above, I went ahead and added Windows Vista to the bootlist using bootrec /rebuildbcd. Now when I select Windows Vista from the bootlist, it has me log on and tells me it's preparing my desktop. Whatever step it takes then stalls. The screen
 that displays "Preparing Your Desktop" with the hourglass fades to a blue screen that remains blue. If I hit Ctrl-Alt-Del, it takes me to the log-off window that allows me to select Task Manager. There are no applications running but it shows various process
 and services (some services are shown as running, many as stopped).

            Hi,
<div>Rebuild BCD (Boot Configuration Data) store and check for the issue. </div>
<div><br />
<br />
a. From the system recovery options mentioned in this article, select command prompt.</div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7</a><br />
<br />
b. Type Bootrec /RebuildBcd, and then press ENTER. </div>
<div><br />
<br />
Ø If the Bootrec.exe tool runs successfully, it presents you with an installation path of a Windows directory. To add the entry to the BCD store, type Yes. A confirmation message appears that indicates the entry was added successfully.<br />
<br />
Ø If the Bootrec.exe tool cannot locate any missing Windows installations, you must remove the BCD store, and then you must re-create it. To do this, type the following commands in the order in which they are presented. Press ENTER after each command.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong><br />
Bcdedit /export C:\BCD_Backup<br />
<br />
ren c:\boot\bcd bcd.old<br />
<br />
Bootrec /rebuildbcd</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
c. Restart the computer.</div>

                    <p>Hi all, I own 2 Xbox One, 2 copies of Dead Space 3 and 2 Xbox Live Gold account, and I've tried to play the game in co-op on the Xbox One in the same local network, at home, but when I start the game, on the first console I can connect to the Electronic
 Arts server, but in the second one I can start the game but I'm result offline... so I can't see and join to the match started on the first one.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've a Xbox 360 too, and on every console I can play the game online,&nbsp;but only in a single console (started for first).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The NAT is open, and I can play other game in multiplayer, like Fortnite. Maybe I must change the port number 3074 for the multiplayer on the second console?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Cannot connect pocket projector to PC in Windows 10. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot connect pocket projector to PC in Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Asus T300 Chi Running Windows 10 Does not detect HDMI Projector</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently purchased a Brookstone HDMI Pocket Projector which I have tested and works well with my desktop computer also running Windows 10. However, when I tried to use the projector via my Asus T300 Chi notebook, the projector did not detect a signal.
 On the laptop end, the computer could tell it was plugged into something (detected as generic PnP monitor, slight adjustment in resolution) but it did not detect it as a second display. I have updated all pertinent drivers (I believe) and still no change.
 Is there anything I'm missing or could these two devices simply be incompatible? Thank you in advance for your help.</p>
