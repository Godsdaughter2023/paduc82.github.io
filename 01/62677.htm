    <title>System Image Restore fails even though hard drive replaced was exactly - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            System Image Restore fails even though hard drive replaced was exactly the same</h2>
                    I had a hard drive fail on me. I had done a full system image backup of that drive on an external USB HD. I got a new drive from the manufacturer, precisely the same model and size. Hooked it up, even installed the manufacturer's base image again on the
 disk and it works. I then went and tried to restore the image from the external hard drive so I could get back to precisely where the system was when I created the backup. This consistently fails. The hard drive is recognized by the restore boot utility disk
 (booting off a CD restore disk I created), it correctly finds and identifies the external drive's system image, but when it goes to actually do the reimage, it almost immediately fails and gives a completely unhelpful set of possible causes, none of which
 I believe apply. Can anyone help me understand what is going on and how to solve it? It would seem this is the precise scenario that this tool was created for, and yet maddeningly it is failing to work.

            Please give us more information to help understand the problem.&nbsp; What exactly does it say when the reimage fails?&nbsp; What are the unbelievable causes?

<p>-Boot from "Win7 x64 Repair Disk" (CD) - success</p>
<p>- Searches for Windows Installations and finds Manufacturer's Win7 Image that I put on the replacement HD, volume Drive D:. Clearly it's talking to the HD successfully to get this info.</p>
<p>- Select "Restore your computer using a system image you created earlier"</p>
<p>- Select the System Backup: finds my external backup USB drive on G: and finds the latest (and only) full system backup on that drive.</p>
<p>- I "Use the latest avalable system image"</p>
<p>- On "Choose additional restore options" dialog, "Format and repartition disks" is&nbsp;selected but disabled&nbsp;though I'm not sure why. If I go into "Exclude Disks", the hard drive does show up as expected and is unchecked (NOT excluded). I keep it unchecked.
 Next.</p>
<p>- restore info: Date &amp; Time: "5/1/2010 1:40:30AM (GMT-8:00)", Computer: "Fry", Drives to Restore: "\\?\Volume{bd3de1e4-da1f-11de-92c7-806e6f6e6963},C:,D:" - Finish</p>
<p>- Yes, confirm reformat</p>
<p>- "Preparing to restore your disks"</p>
<p>- "The system image restore failed. No disk that can be used for recovering the system disk can be found. Details."</p>
<p>- Details-&gt; "No disk that can be used for recovering the system disk can be found. Try the following: 1) A probable system disk may have been excluded by mistake...(etc. as detailed above this is clearly not the case), 2) A USB disk may have been assigned
 as a system disk... (etc., all suggestions for this case have already been tried incuding not having the external HD plugged in until after going through the steps to get the selecting the restoration image, all with the same results), 3) An invalid disk may
 have been assigned as a system disk...(etc.) (0x80042412)"</p>
<p>From reading some other threads and online resources, I'm thinking the cause may be that in the "Drives to Restore" signature, there is a Volume GUID, and being that I have a replacement disk that, while identical in every way to the old one, may have a
 different Volume GUID, this may be the cause. If that is the case, then how can I either get the disk's GUID to match the backup, or get the volume GUID from my new disk and somehow update the backup to point to that new GUID instead? Given that the disks
 are precisely the same in every way, there is no reason I shouldn't be able to use this image on the new disk if I can just fool the restore system into letting me do it!</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>You'd think that Microsoft's support engineers, and the moderators would jump in and try to get all of us some HELP.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's strange I have read threads that people have gotten the imaging to work, and then there those like us that are having a heck of a time getting it to work. There has to be a trick in there someplace to getting it to work.</p>

<p>You must be psychic, IPwizard. I was just looking for software to clone my hard drive. When I had problems with Vista, it was suggested I make a system image. I then found out that only the more expensive versions had this option ( I had Home Premium ).
 Software that would clone my HDD was recommended and it was a free trial. I used it to make an identical HDD for a spare. Just to be sure, I removed my current drive, switched it with the duplicate, and it was a perfect bootable image. I can't seem to find
 this software again. It would save me a lot of worrying, even if I had to pay for it this time. I'm wondering if the Image Restore isn't working for me because I only have the Home Premium version.</p>

            You might have been using Acronis TrueImage (which is not free). It is certified for operation under Windows 7, it has a lot more features than its Windows equivalent and it does not exhibit any of the temperamental traits that the Windows imaging facility
 has.<br />

            The name sounds familiar, but whatever I used last September had a free trial period and the image it created for my back-up drive was a perfect image and the exact same size, bit for bit.

<p>I know&nbsp;I could go out and buy a third party tool to do it. Heck there are even free disk imagers out there that use a flavor of linux to do the imaging BUT I would like to have MS FIX the issue with windows 7/vista. Or at least give us little people some
 advise.</p>

<p>I might send our MS TAM an email to see what she has to say about it.</p>

            I would like to have them fix the issue too. In a parallel thread I proposed that if enough users got together collectively that we could bring a class action anti-trust lawsuit against Microsoft for false advertising. Microsoft has multi-million dollar
 law firms on their payroll. It may be time for them to earn their money. Sometimes it takes a massive lawsuit to get someones attention, especially when all they care about is money and they already have yours.

<p>A few years ago lots of people screamed "foul play" when Microsoft bundled Internet Explorer with the then version of Windows, thus effectively killing Netscape. Perhaps MS is trying to play "nice" this time by offering an inferior product that is no match
 for the existing fully developed imaging and partition managing tools.</p>
<p>Be careful when using imaging products that are not certified for Windows 7. Many of them cause irreparable damage which then causes the hapless user to ask for help in this forum. It's usually a lost cause.</p>

<p>"You must play or have played Grand Theft Auto Online at any time during the month of October 2013 in order to qualify for the GTA$500,000 deposit in your in-game bank account.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Players will first have to install a forthcoming GTAV title update which we expect to happen next week. That title update (1.04) is expected to fix the remaining instances of issues that have caused vehicle purchase loss and will also enable the functionality
 through which we’ll be providing this GTA$ stimulus cash to players.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>We will announce at the Rockstar Newswire when each deposit is made.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Each of the two GTA$250,000 deposits will be made by Rockstar and should automatically appear in the in-game GTA Online bank accounts of eligible players. Beyond downloading the forthcoming title update mentioned above, there should not be any additional
 special action required by eligible players to redeem. "</p>

    <title>importing photos with SD card on windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ma wb  say:</h3>
<h2>            importing photos with SD card on windows 10</h2>
                    When I import photos through my camera, I have the option to "import photos and videos" which allows me to name the photos and folders where I want them to go. I am used to doing it this way from Windows 7. When I try to import photos using the SD card,
 I do not have this option and the photos come in from the DCIM with random numbers that have no meaning and make it difficult to identify the photo. How can I get to the "import photos and videos" option using the SD card?

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>- What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to visit the computer manufacturer website and download the latest chipset drivers and then download/install the relevant device driver from the website and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, go to Device Manager and right click on the device that does not have drivers and select Update driver software.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 compatibility Center tell me that nvidia geforce 7300gs graphic card is compatible but windows 10 upgrade chec</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 compatibility Center tell me that nvidia geforce 7300gs express graphic card is compatible but windows 10 upgrade check says my computer can not be upgraded due to this video card. It is the same machine where I have installed all the insider
 preview's all builds. </p>
<p>Microsoft backtracked on insider previewers already. Microsoft is seeking other excuses to prevent legitimate Windows 8.1 users from upgrade. All along they said that windows 7 and windows 8.1 devices would get the upgrade free-Now Satya has become Asatya.
 It means -truth is no longer true. I don't play games on computers. It does matter to me if my graphic card does no play Xbox or other games or Nvidia did not upgrade driver for this card. If the insider preview ran fine on this machine release version will
 run fine too. Where is the free upgrade for me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you say it then you have to do it. If you don't want to do it then don't say it. This is the rule of any integrity data or moral</p>

            <p>I take my words back. Satya remained satya- meaning truth is still true. I was able to upgrade to windows 10 by using media converting tool. It helped me download the iso and do in place upgrade on my machine from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10. Microsoft's compatibility
 check tool was only seeing one video card that was not compatible. Other video card Geforce 8400 gs 512mb that was not seen got installed with the upgrading to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Real problem I had with all builds and final release as well was the RealTech Audio card/chip AC97 for which Microsoft's driver RTKVAC.sys &nbsp;was crashing the install by Kmode exception not handled. Disabling the that card during install as suggested by Andre
 originally did help me complete the install in all situation. Installing old driver &nbsp;after upgrade eventually restored the functionality of that audio card too.</p>

    <title>How to get access to Users folders on an old hard drive after - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hunterdust  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to get access to Users folders on an old hard drive after installing on new drive&#63;</h2>
                    Last week, Windows 10, in its infinite ineptitude, decided to irreparably corrupt itself during an update. I decided that since I was going to have to install it again anyway, and go through the process of ridding myself of as much Windows 10 crap as I
 could, I may as well take the opportunity to get an SSD drive. I also did this because I wanted to make sure that none of my files on my old hard drive were lost, and I don't trust Windows to not delete things even when I tell it to not during a Reset.<br />
<br />
Anyway, all went fine, I installed Windows again, and took the hour or so to turn off all the "GIVE US ALL YOUR DATA!!!!" settings! And to get Coratana to stop telling me that the nearest Italian restaurant was 200 miles away. Gee, Microsoft..did it never occur
 to you that other than mobile devices (of which, Microsoft pretty much as a ZERO percent market share), people using Windows don't have GPS on their device, and that the cable providers IP does not point to your address?<br />
<br />
So, after going through all that, I set out to reinstall some programs. I purposely left all the installed programs in my old Downloads folder for just this very occasion. However, when I tried to click down to that folder...again..on my OLD hard drive that
 has nothing to do with Windows anymore, it refused to let me into my old Users folder. Saying I needed permission. It said to click to get permission, but when I did, the little green bar slowly went across the top of the window, before doing...NOTHING. I
 click again, and get he same error about now having permission.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I tried right clicking to get to properties and adding my new user (which is the same name as the user was on my old set up) and it allowed me to choose Full Access for my user. and yet it STILL won't let me open pretty much any folder on my old C: partition.
 Which of course, includes the folders that Microsoft...who knows what's best for me because it thinks I'm a child...uses as default. So, my documents, my videos, my downloads, etc. Are all cut off from me.<br />
<br />
Now, to be clear, my user account has Administrator permission and is the only user account. But it still won't let me in. I CAN get in by enabling the main Administrator account, but running as full administrator is not a good solution. Microsoft has been
 hammering the point home that that is BAD for security for years. So now it seems like if I want to rescue the files that are being held hostage, I have to forfeit security and use my computer with full
<br />
<br />
Am I wrong? Is there any way to be able to access these files? I could try copying the Users folder&nbsp; to my new hard drive (while as Administrator) but won't that copy over the permissions settings? So either way, if I ever try to go back to my regular User
 account (with administrator privileges), I will always get that problem.

            Hi HD.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What is the antivirus? I'd uninstall it and use built-in Defender to troubleshoot this.
<br />
<br />If you type Defender Security Center in Start Search, open it, then choose Virus and Threat Protection Settings, is Controlled Folder Access turned On?  Turn it off.
<br />
<br />Also in Security Center under App and Browser Control, is Check Apps and Files set to Block?  Change to Warn.  
<br />
<br />Is Device Guard enabled?  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/68913-enable-disable-device-guard-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/68913-enabl...</a>
<br />
<br />Check if the drive has Read-only Access:
<br /><a href="https://www.easeus.com/storage-media-recovery/fix-read-only-error-on-hard-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.easeus.com/storage-media-recovery/f...</a>
<br />
<br />This may have been caused by Windows Updates.  Check which Updates were installed right before the problem began, and if necessary uninstall them from Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History.
<br />
<br />You can also try to roll back using System Restore to a point before this began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Then if the Update installs and causes the same problem again uninstall or roll it back again, then immediately hide it using the Hide Updates tool from Method Two here:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a>
<br />
<br />If necessary try taking ownership of any folders that won't allow access:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option-in-file-folder-context-menu-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            I am using Defender...for now. (That will be changed soon, as it if the least secure of all the free AV programs..by far.) But it is definitely not an AV issue. It is treating it as if I don't have access rights to view a folder on a drive that has nothing
 to do with Windows, simply because it used to be a Windows user folder. That's why I CAN get to it if I log on as the Administrator account after unhiding it. The problem is, though, that I don't want to use the Administrator account as my every day account.<br />
<br />
I don't think you understood my situation...This is a brand new installation of Windows on a totally separate drive. My old one had an irreparable problem with Windows. (Which WAS caused by Windows Update..but in a way that could not be fixed.) And, once I
 realized I was going to have to reinstall all my programs from scratch again anyway, I decided to order an SSD drive and install that as my Windows drive and start totally from scratch. So, there is no system restore point to go back to.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Basically, what WAS my C:, D: and E: partitions on one HDD drive (with Windows being the C: partition) last week, is now my D:, G: and H: drive (Not sure why Windows assigned the other two partitions after the VD drive, but that is not a big deal.) So...last
 week when they were still my main drives, those folders WOULD have been protected against a new user trying to open them. So, had I created a new Windows login account and then tried to go to Users/Tom with it, I understand why it would not let me.&nbsp; But I
 don't see why it won't let me now. I don't get why Windows still sees it as a Windows partition...as if my computer has two Windows partitions.<br />
<br />
I opened Windows Defender Security Center. Controlled Folder Access is Off, and Check Apps and Files is set to Warn.<br />
<br />
Like I said, I can get to them as Administrator...but not as a user with Administrative Permissions. I don't know if I could just copy the entire Users folder to another drive and be able to open them there, or if those restrictions will just follow it wherever
 it goes. But because I don't want to use the Administrator account as my every day account for security reasons, I also am stuck not being able to get everything set up the way I want it, between the privacy settings, and just installing my programs again.
 Because if I am able to figure out how to view it as a regular account, I would then have to do it all over again. This has already been a long 3-4 days, since this was an unexpected (and therefore, not prepared for) clean install of Windows after 2 days of
 using a Linux boot flash drive to try to tide me over until the SSD arrived. And I know I have several days of getting things just right anyway...so I don't want to double up that time by having to do it all over again. Not to mention, the folder that I can't
 get o has the install files of any of the programs I want to reinstall, and I want THOSE install files because I don't want the newest version of many of the files. Which is another reason why I did keep all those in one central folder to make it easier in
 case this happened.

            Defender is perfectly adequate and assures best Windows performance, as most others cause problems we have to resolve here regularly.  See chart below.  
<br />
<br />There is no reason to run a Standard Account since Admin is what Windows assigns when installed because it assumes you're the owner.  Otherwise you'll be prompted  for Admin permission for everything you want to change, and all this duplicative second-guessing doesn't protect from intrusion - which is handled by UAC that would block intrusion anyway even in an Admin account.  
<br />
<br />Did you install to the SSD with the hard drive unplugged?  
<br />
<br />Please post a screenshot of Disk Management, which I read like a doctor reads X-rays.  Follow the steps here so I can see everything needed to advise you:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/post-a-screenshot-of-disk-mgmt/04a8ef8c-c882-404e-a26b-89867c4ddf55?tm=1441932228382">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/foru...</a>
<br />
<br />The best way to use an old Windows drive for data is to move the data off and wipe the drive with at least Diskpart Clean Command to wipe boot and partition code that can interfere like you're experiencing.  Then repartition in Disk Management.

<br />
<br />Otherwise you can try taking ownership of the old drive's User folders:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option-in-file-folder-context-menu-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option...</a><br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4f81b184-1985-4630-86f3-71056b55a716?upload=true" />

<p>I'm fine with running an Admin account, but most security people say that is bad since it allows anything bad to take down the entire system. Especially since I have to respectfully disagree with you about Defender. Every single INDEPENDENT test shows Defender
 being middle of the pack, at best, for protection, especially for zero day exploits. And UAC doesn't stop many virus behavior. But hat''s a moot point anyway, since like most people, I turn off UAC because I want a protection scheme that treats me like an
 adult and doesn't nag me with "are you sure" after every decision I make like its my mommy and daddy. But one that also protects me from things that I DON'T choose to do. And Windows/UAC fails at both those. It nags, while doesn't protect as well against things
 that try to come in without me knowing. This would be why when I borrowed an older woman's laptop to help organized things while waiting for the SSD to arrive so I could get back on my computer, her system was absolutely trashed with viruses and malware. She
 relied on the Highest setting for UAC and Defender for her protection. Whereas, despite going to far riskier sites than her, I have never had a single virus infection and the only malware hits I get in scans are typical advertising ones, though even most of
 those I can take care of with a good HOSTS file (which reminds me that I need to copy that over.)<br />
<br />
For the record, my old hard drive was totally disconnected when I installed Windows on the SSD drive. I'm guessing that the problem may be that it still has all the hidden Windows partitions on it, plus, obviously, that users folder WAS limited to my old user
 account (which has the same name as the one that I started with now) before, obviously. That's why I have no problem getting into the G and H folders now, which, even though the G was labeled Programs, did not contain usual programs that would be installed
 into the registry or anything. In fact, many of them are fully functional now. So my last Windows installation wouldn't have put any ownership onto them, so like the Media folder, they may as well be photos as far as Windows in concerned. And even the D. drive
 is available to me now...except the Users folder. Of course, all the other stuff is meaningless now since they ARE programs that have to be reinstalled. But the Users folder contains downloads, plus things I kept on my desktop.<br />
<br />
I can copy them easily by booting Ubuntu again with the flash drive, but before I go trough all that hassle, I want to be sure that the permissions aren't also on each file and that hey won't be just copied over. Plus, when I get a mounting bracket tomorrow,
 I will have a second HDD installed as well. (I think that's why there is a Disk 2 showing noting. I may not have unplugged the SATA cable when I realized I accidentally ordered a 2.5 to 3.5 mount adapter instead of a 2.5 to 5.25 for the SSD drive.) This entire
 other drive also shouldn't cause any issues since it did not have any folders that would be "owned" by certain users. Although, ironically, it SHOULD have. When I changed to my current computer, I took the hard drive out of my old computer. But unlike this
 time, I never had any problems going to THAT drive's User folder, even using a normal User Account (with administrator privileges) before the Windows crash. I don't know if that was because the old computer was Windows 7 and maybe it handled the User folder
 permissions differently, but it never gave me a problem, and turned out to be one of the only folders from that old drive that I didn't delete in the year and a half of using my current computer, because, again, my downloads and desktop folders on that were
 the ones that had the most stuff I wanted to recover.<br />
<br />
I do intend to reformat that drive, and likely remove all the partitions. But that is really a moot point now. This was not a planned switch, so I could not do that before the reinstall.</p>

<h2>            DOOM Digital Deluxe Edition Problem</h2>
                    
<p>I Recently Bought the Digital Deluxe Edition of DOOM from the "Xbox LIVE Store" on the 22nd of April 2016. I got the game "But" unfortunately I did not get the
<strong>Season Pass</strong> &amp; the <strong>Demon Multiplayer Pack</strong> that was supposed to come with it, so either I get my content or I end up Demanding a Refund.</p>
<p>My order number for the DOOM Digital Deluxe Edition is as follows:&nbsp;<strong>567453557651096777</strong></p>

<p>Grim Hallowed, </p>
<p>Please do not share specific info like order numbers here publicly on the forums in the future. As for your question about the DOOM deluxe content, if you did pre-order the content then you should see the Demon Multiplayer Pack. Because this is an in-game
 consumable, this content would be propped in game most likely. It appears that the folks over with DOOM are aware that there are some issues getting to this content. Here are some examples:
</p>

<p>For further information regarding that multiplayer pack, it might be best to reach out to Bethesda Support about it:
<a href="http://help.bethesda.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://help.bethesda.net/</a> </p>
<p>As for your issue with the Season Pass, Kill Kayt is correct. Traditionally, Season Pass content isn't propped and ready to be used right at release. Usually that just gives you access to future, cool content. I'd give it time for announcements of season
 pass content releases for attempting there. :) </p>

            Actually, it turned out that Canadian English wasn't properly installed - I'm on a pro version upgrade of the trial version.
<p>

<p>
</p><p>After that, it's all fixed except my display language is still English (Great Britain).&nbsp; It's possible that English (Canada) doesn't exist as an option.</p>

<p>I Recently upgrade to Windows 8 professional 64bit&nbsp;from Windows 7 Ultimate 64bit on my DELL INSPIRON 17R, everything is going really smooth except from something that happens whenever&nbsp; I disconnect A/C or Connect&nbsp;adapter&nbsp; (This depending on whether I turned

The Adapter is running normally according to Dell's Software, I've uninstalled and reinstalled the display drivers and it still flickering. Is not a horrible flickering, but it does bothers me from time and time when I'm studying or working on a presentation.</p>

            <p>Drivers seem to be the problem in your case and I suspect the drivers you are uninstalling and reinstalling are not Windows 8 compatible.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had similar issue with a HP Pavilion.&nbsp; Although it was not associated with the A/C adapter after installing&nbsp;Windows 8&nbsp;(a clean install ) my screen would flash&nbsp;off and on&nbsp;quickly from time to time.&nbsp; It seem to be connected to screen refresh when an application
 like Outlook or Word would open an email&nbsp;or document and would refresh the screen.</p>
<p>I knew it was video drivers but HP did offer drivers for this machine&nbsp;beyond Vista (bad HP).&nbsp; However&nbsp;HP did supply drivers&nbsp;via Microsoft Update (go figure) as I had seen the display drive listed in the update history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;did a clean install of windows 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;Forced updates until Windows reported&nbsp;No Further&nbsp;Update existed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure enough during these updates there was an update to the NVidia GeForce drives.&nbsp; Then I&nbsp;performed&nbsp;Windows 8 install via update option.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After reinstalling software no more issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a&nbsp;round about way of getting drivers compatible with Windows&nbsp;8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this help you find a solution.</p>

    <title>file history stops working... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> franksummers  say:</h3>
<h2>            file history stops working...</h2>
                       So this is extremely frustrating as File History in Win8 is supposed to backup my docs without me having to do anything. However, every once in a while I open up the Control Panel to check up on File History, and it will show me that it hasnt been run sometimes in a weeks. This scares the **** out of me as I depend on solid backups in case of hard drive failure. I'll check a file that, say I did a few days ago and wasn't included in the last tiem File History was run, and its not there.  I have to hit "Run Now" and it then it starts to do its thing. 



   There is plenty of space on the target eternal backup drive and it is available (i.e. I can copy files to and from it). One of the big selling points for Win8 was this backup utility and its failing me. This has happened a few times now since I purchased Win8 back in Nov, and to me its unacceptable. What's the deal here?

            Hah yes. It is On. When I go to check up on it, it says that it is On, but when I look to see the last time it ran, it will at times say that it it hasn't ran in almost a week.

            Everything is set to default in Advanced Settings. I have changed nothing there. It just decides to stop working for some reason after a few days, and I have to check up on it to make sure its still running. Only then do I find that it hasn't backed anything
 up in days. This has happened maybe three or four times now since Nov.

            <p>This may resolve your problem with File History without you knowing it:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boot from your system recovery disk</p>
<p>Choose Troubleshoot</p>
<p>Advanced Options</p>
<p>Automatic Repair and follow the screen instructions.&nbsp; This may take a while.&nbsp; Once completed, reboot your system normally and see if File History functions normally after a couple of hours.</p>

            So this problem is still persisting. Out of curiosity, I decided to check up on File History and to my horror is says it hasnt backed up anything in almost a month. There was a good stretch that it was performing correctly, and it actually saved my bacon
 at one point in May, but this is just unacceptable. The target drive is online and available because I can read/write to it. I just manually told File History to "Run", and then it starts backing my work up. it will most likely perform as intended for a few
 days until it will suddenly and without my knowledge stop working.
<div><br />
<div>My understanding is the once you set up File History, it will run and make backups of my work without me having to do anything. It is not working as advertised.</div>

            I have exactly the same problem - nothing in the file history event logs to say why, just that after running fine for a few weeks it last ran on June 20th. Anyone have any suggestions?

            I can confirm the problem on my unit as well just as FrankSummers describes it. Once I run the file history manually then it runs properly for a few days and then stops again. I have taken to checking once a week to determine if it is running properly.
 It was running already on Tuesday but now it is Thursday and it last ran Tuesday evening.

            Same problem here. &nbsp;Worse is the fact that when I re-activate it manually, it starts taking new copies of everything, also the files that didn't change since the last backup. &nbsp;That means that my backup almost doubles each time. &nbsp;So reactivating implies
 for me that I have to clean up afterwards. Anoying and very bad since it also cleans away the files that I want to keep history of older versions from.

                    <p>Hi, I have an Acer Spin 3 and when I go to the Pen &amp; Windows Ink panel in devices, there is no Pen panel displayed. Is this something that has to be activated or is it just not available? I have a Bamboo Ink which will pair and open the workspace but will
 not write on the touch screen. I have switched the settings on the pen itself. writes with finger. Any Ideas?</p>

<h2>            Windows Button &#40;and other stuff&#41; not working</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell Optiplex 380 originally running Windows 7. I accepted the offer to install Windows 10. The full specification is now:</p>
<p>Edition: Windows 10 Pro</p>
<p>Processor: Pentium® Dual-Core CPU E5300 @ 2.60GHz 2.60GHz</p>
<p>Installed RAM: 4.00 GB (3.25 usable)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This ran fine for some weeks until, when I clicked the Windows Button (bottom left), I got a message: "Critical Error. Your start menu isn't working. We'll try to fix it next time you log in."</p>
<p>After a restart, the problem was not fixed. In fact things were worse:</p>
<ul>
<li>Left click on the Windows Button or clicking the Windows key alone takes me to the same critical error message</li><li>Left click on the Search button does not respond</li><li>All the pinned applications on the task bar (bottom left) have disappeared, except for Task View, which works</li><li>Right click on Windows Button (or Windows key + X) gives me a pop-up menu with most of the useful things on it - but clicking on Search does not respond</li><li>Left click on the Notifications button (bottom right) does not respond</li><li>Right click on the Notification button then left click on Open Action Centre does not respond</li><li>Windows key + I gives me settings and those all seem to work.</li><li>Initially, because the pinned applications had disappeared I had no way to open Outlook, or other Microsoft Office applications (I am running Office 2010, except that I have Outlook 2013 and OneNote 2013). I have found I can open Outlook with Run - outlook.exe
 and Excel with Run - excel.exe. Similar entries for Word or Access do not work but I can open these by clicking on an existing document. When I do get an Office application running the icon appears on the task bar but I have not found a way of pinning it to
 the task bar.</li><li>I tried opening a command prompt as Administrator and typing sfc /scannow and that gave the answer 'No integrity violations'. I haven't tried any of the other fixes you can find in internet searches.</li></ul>
<p>Looking in the Settings, there is a suggestion to do a Restart to re-install Windows 10. I would much prefer to do this with the 'keep your files' option - I would prefer not to have to re-install all my applications but I have been told that it might be
 necessary to do what I have heard called a 'flat install' - losing all my applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can do all I need to even with this error but it is very inconvenient, and it is worrying that I cannot access Notifications or the Action Centre. Also, I use the 'Snipping Tool' quite often and I can't find that because Search is not working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I have to, I'll do a restart, even a flat one if necessary. But it would be great if someone could offer some less dramatic options first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do&nbsp; like Windows 10 but I am feeling a bit let down over this. I will certainly think twice about upgrading my Windows 7 laptop when the offer for that comes through.</p>

</p><p><span><span>If the issue still persist, I suggest you to try automatic repairing the Windows and check if it helps. I suggest you to download the Windows 10 ISO and create a Media Creation tool and then perform Automatic Repair. Refer to the following link:</span></span></p>

</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>(Refer to the section "Installing Windows 10 using the media creation tool” in the above article for creating the tool).</span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
<span>Once you have the installation media, follow the steps:&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
<span>1) &nbsp;Start your computer from the installation media. Insert the disk or USB stick and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to “Press any key to boot from DVD,” do so. If you don’t see the message, you might need to change the boot order
 in your computer's BIOS settings so that it first starts from the disk or USB. When you see the 'Install Windows' page, tap or click 'Repair your computer' link to start the Windows Recovery Environment.<br />
2) In the Windows Recovery Environment, on the Choose an option screen, click 'Troubleshoot'.<br />
3) &nbsp;Click, Advanced Options and then click on 'Automatic Repair'.<br />
4) &nbsp;After this complete the repair and see if you are able to boot in to your computer.</span></span></p>

            <p>A helpful reply but I'm afraid it has not worked.</p>
<p>Method 1 looked encouraging at first:</p>
<p>dism said "The restore operation completed successfully"</p>
<p>sfc said "Windows restore protection did not find any integrity violations"</p>
<p>But the problem was still there, although the 'Critical Error' message had gone away.</p>
<p>Then I ran the PowerShell script - I have never seen so many red error messages!</p>
<p>I have now gone on to Method 2. I downloaded the Windows 10 ISO to a DVD and have now booted from it.</p>
<p>I got as far as the 'Troubleshoot' screen and the 'Advanced Options' but I could not see an 'Automatic Repair' option. There was a 'Start-up Repair' option but when I ran it the result was that it could not repair my problem.</p>
<p>I think I now need to go to the Reset option to get a complete clean version of Windows 10 but I note that, even with the 'Keep your files' option this says that I will 'loose apps and programs that did not come with the PC'.
</p>
<p>Does this mean I will loose Office, Acrobat and so on? I'll do this if I have to because, in spite of the problems, I actually like Windows 10 and I can see this as a way forward.</p>
<p>This might even be a good opportunity to 'spring-clean' the PC. I won't do anything for a bit while I check what I need to keep and make sure I have the means to re-install it. I might take this opportunity to upgrade to Office 2013, perhaps using Office
 365.</p>
<p>Any thoughts on my way forward, or alternative suggestions, would be appreciated. Also, why did this happen, and could it ever happen again?</p>

            <span>If you have forgotten your password, if you have another user account with administrative privileges you can log into that account and change your original user account's password from the User Accounts applet in Control Panel.
 If you don't have another account like this set up or don't have the password to it, you'll need to log into the built-in Administrator account. In XP Home, boot the computer into Safe Mode. Do this by repeatedly tapping the F8 key as the computer is starting
 up. This will get you to the right menu. Navigate using your Up arrow key; the mouse will not work here. Once in Safe Mode, you will see the normally hidden Administrator account. The default password is a blank.<br />
<br />
In XP Pro, you do not need to go into Safe Mode. At the Welcome Screen, do Ctrl-Alt-Del twice to get the classic Windows logon box. Type in "Administrator" and whatever password you assigned when you set up Windows.<br />
<br />
If you have XP Pro or Media Center and were using the built-in Administrator account for your regular work and it is therefore the only user account on the system, there are ways to change the password for that account to a blank. Microsoft doesn't permit us
 to tell you how in these forums. Their house, their rules. Use Google or ask a local computer tech (not a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place).</span>

    <title>Redeemed game code was successful but while it appears in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> panzrammer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Redeemed game code was successful but while it appears in Orders&#47;Billing, doesn&#39;t on Xbox.com account nor console</h2>
                    <p><span>Recently I purchased an Xbox One X from Costco. It came with a game code for Forza Horizon 4. The code was redeemed successfully during the setup process of the console (along with game pass code) but the Forza game only appears as owned from
 my orders &amp; billing history on my Microsoft account (on my PC). It does not appear on my Xbox nor my Xbox store on console as being owned (says to buy it) nor does it appear on my account via my computer at xbox.com for games owned.
<br />
<br />
I have been able to play Forza but only because it is on my temporary game pass subscription that had no issues with the code for it. I can only play Forza at the moment because I was able to download the game I permanently own using game pass. My Xbox thinks
 I still need to purchase it. <br />
<br />
If later I decide to no longer use game pass or some other game pass change/issue, I will not be able to play this game that I own. Where do I go for help on this? I tried Xbox help on Twitter but to put it short, that employee thought it shouldn't matter to
 me that don't have it as owned (except on Microsoft.com account under orders &amp; billing). Also, while Tweeting to the employee, I thought it had fixed in a round about way but now I realize that was not correct. The employee had that stance on my problem (that
 I should not care), even with trying to show screenshots of the issue, because of my 3 month game pass subscription.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Can anyone able to steer me in the right direction to fixing this?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>My owned digital games listed, notice it's missing Forza:</span></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e5f91018-ef6a-416b-8c62-7803149a5d12?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e5f91018-ef6a-416b-8c62-7803149a5d12?upload=true" /></a><br />
<br />
Proof that it does appear in orders and billing as a game that should appear in the screenshot above but doesn't.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9fb76285-2582-4fe2-8a29-6d4e527638a8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9fb76285-2582-4fe2-8a29-6d4e527638a8?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
This is how a game appears in my account that isn't having this problem, notice "Install on my devices" and "Buy as a gift" buttons instead of buying it buttons.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a4c6c5a8-14bc-424d-93f1-0cbb2698a3e8?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a4c6c5a8-14bc-424d-93f1-0cbb2698a3e8?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><br />
This is how Forza appears even though you can see in the screenshot above that the code was redeemed successfully. Notice "Buy to own" ("install/play is because I'm having to use game pass 3 month pass for now).&nbsp;<br />

<p>That is weird that it is not showing up on the Xbox.com and that it is showing that you need to buy it on the game page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only people that can give you any answers are the Xbox support team we are just a community of fellow gamers and do not have access to your account information like the Xbox support team does the best way to contact them is by going to support.xbox.com/contact-us</p>

            I will try that link. I am new to all this. I'm coming from a PS3 for a latest system. I tried on Monday on Twitter with their Xbox Help official account but the employee tried to tell me it shouldn't matter because of game pass. I even got a call back
 on the phone but because I'm new and learning, I thought I had found a work around and they didn't even check to notice that was wrong. The person on the phone was basically like since I found a work around using my computer (I later learned I was wrong),
 they basically didn't care about it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I'll try again but so far, support team has not been supportive. Maybe 3rd time will be a charm though, especially being I understand this a little more and can insist more on specifics.&nbsp;

            If anyone is curious, Njal the Blue may be correct for my problem. <br />

I thought that issue mentioned was one that started a day or 2 ago. After some time with a support person in the live chat, a person that was much better than the last two people (Twitter &amp; Phone) and trying some various things she told me to do that didn't
 fix it, she believes it could be this problem affecting many people's accounts regarding codes. So for now it's wait and see if that fixes it, when they fix their systems with that problem.<br />

<br />
She told me that for some odd reason, she admitted that this was strange, the license key that the code is for isn't associating itself with my new XB1X though it shows it redeemed successfully on my account.

I appreciate the few people that chimed in right away, so quickly, to try to help me out, thank you.&nbsp;

            If it's in your purchase history then its definitely redeemed. I would try a power cycle or maybe just search the game in the Xbox store. Anything you own will show as owned and you can download it there. I would also make sure you're on the same account
 you redeemed it on. Sometimes people forget they are signed into another account.&nbsp;

            I already had tried a full system reset &amp; restore with an agent in text chat who told me to try that. They admitted to seeing the same as I do in this problem. Even when I clicked the game in the store (prompting me to purchase it), the person said it
 showed for them that it was telling me to purchase it, though my account shows the code was redeemed for the game.
<br />
<br />
BTW, I only have this one account and I live alone. It was deemed by support for me to wait and see if when this was fixed when a problem they were having was fixed. You can see their problem is now showing fixed from this link but my problem remains as you
 can see in the photos above.&nbsp; https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status?xr=shellnav<br />
<br />
I was told the code shows that while it was redeemed on my account, the license for the game isn't associating itself with my system running on that account. I don't know if that is correct or not as I don't see it from my computer either in the store (only
 in the order history section using my PC) I know only Microsoft can fix this and I hope they do.&nbsp;

            A similar problem happened to me with Battlefield 1 and EA Access. I had to delete BF1 from my harddrive and when I went to reinstall it recognized that I owned the game. Not sure if this would work since your problem isn't with EA, but with Gamepass but
 is worth a shot.
