<h2>            How to recover a forgotten wifi network on windows 8.0</h2>
                    Hello I am looking for a simple answer!?!? How on windows 8.0 do I reconnect to a forgotten network. See I thought I was disconnecting from the network when I clicked forget this network instead. That plain and simple. All my other devices detect the network
 so it is there and they are connected to it. But my 8.0 windows computer does not list it in the wifi category .<br />

    <title>Spatial Sound Format Speaker Properties - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> browneyedgirl54  say:</h3>
<h2>            Spatial Sound Format Speaker Properties</h2>
                    I recently had to replace my original to my computer monitor (a first for me) and thought all I had to do was get another monitor with speakers built in, like the old one.&nbsp; Little did I understand then that selecting a decent monitor with built in speakers
 would not be just so cut and dried?&nbsp; Boo me.<span>&nbsp; Long story short, the sound is low quality and so was experimenting a bit with the speaker properties, and came across the spatial sound setting on my speaker properties.&nbsp; It is turned off because
 it only works for sound enhancement on headphones? I ask because 1) I don't know about spatial anything and b) I don't have any headphones. &nbsp; Thank you for your time and informative explanation.</span>

            I thought you wanted to know what spatial sound was. I found the best tutorial for you to try to understand it. I do not think it will apply to your monitor speakers, however. As I said these are generally not good quality speakers. But make sure you have the driver from the manufacturer support downloads web page or keep checking for Windows updates until it is delivered.

<p>Just ignore the Spatial sound and its settings. As for monitor speakers, they usually are garbage just like TV speakers are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this is a PC or Laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because if it is a PC, do you not have speakers plugged into 1/8" jack in front or into your sound card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a Laptop with or without 2nd monitor, then I would get me some Logitech 1/8 Jack speakers and plug into jack input. But when shopping for speakers, make sure you get higher wattage speakers and definitely ones that have a volume control on the speakers
 too. Because you may not get the output you want from speakers without volume control on speakers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never get USB speakers, they suck and then you have to switch sound settings every time you use them. Jack speakers, you just plug&nbsp;in and they work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Logitech&nbsp;is the best for Mouse/keyboard, webcams and speaker systems.</p>

            I do appreciate your time...I'm just thick headed when it comes to computers...the more I know, the less I know.&nbsp; What I'm getting out of conversations is that I made a huge mistake and should have looked more into decent speakers for my monitor.&nbsp; If one
 doesn't know about something, it's very difficult to ask even semi intelligent questions, which I'm sure I didn't do to begin with.&nbsp; Thanks again.&nbsp; Guess I'm stuck with what I've got.&nbsp; Can't afford to buy another new monitor.&nbsp; Oh well, live and learn.

    <title>Help with Account Clean-up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeffmomm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Help with Account Clean-up</h2>
                    
<p>I am hoping someone from Support can contact me and assist in cleaning up my account security.&nbsp; A little background info: about a year ago, I changed all of my Microsoft account info from a Yahoo.com email address to an Outlook.com email address.&nbsp; Everything
 with that has been working fine and I have not seen my Yahoo.com email address anywhere in my account info since.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>So,&nbsp;today I&nbsp;called into Support and was told my email address for security purposes was a Yahoo.com address.&nbsp; I told him that this was incorrect, and all of my account info was updated to an Outlook.com email address.&nbsp; He said no, it was the Yahoo.com email
 and that is what I must be using to sign into my account.&nbsp; I told him absolutely not, I have been using Outlook.com since I changed it.&nbsp; And then, later in the call, he told me I needed to sign in with my Outlook.com email b/c that is my account ID.&nbsp; It makes
 me very nervous that my account info seems to be split between the 2 email addresses.&nbsp; So, even though the Yahoo.com email is not set up as a security proof anywhere, AND he knew my account used an Outlook.com email address, he said the email had to go to
 Yahoo.com.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>After that fiasco, he sent me to a Verify Me page where I signed in successfully with my Outlook.com email and gave him the code, which he said didn't match his records.&nbsp; He said I needed to sign into the page with my Outlook.com, to which I told him that's
 what I used.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Next, he said he could send a text, however the number I signed up with originally is a land line.&nbsp; I said I have my cell number listed as a security proof, but he said he didn't see it.&nbsp; And he wasn't allowed to use the number I gave him over the phone.&nbsp;
 After a few more rounds with him (he was quite rude and unhelpful which is why I am trying the forum support now), I was able to log back into my Yahoo.com email account and find the code he needed.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>(Side note: as an Ambassador, I now understand the complaints I get about calling into Support.&nbsp; This was the first time I needed to do it, and it was unhelpful and not a pleasant experience.&nbsp; I can see why so many people are so frustrated chatting with
 me after calling into Support.)</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>All of this made me realize that my account info is royally messed up in Microsoft's records and I would like some help in cleaning it up.&nbsp; Here's the various topics I would like to resolve:</p>
<p>1. Get rid of all Yahoo.com email references and use my Outlook.com email.&nbsp; I was amazed I remembered my Yahoo.com password to even do this!</p>
<p>2. Update all of my phone info so that the cell number I have listed as a security proof is actually able to be used as a security proof.</p>
<p>3. He kept mentioning a number of accounts linked to my account which I didn't question because I have child accounts.&nbsp; However, after all the confusion with emails and phone numbers, it sort of feels like I have 2 different account histories in there.</p>
<p>4. I have 3 child accounts however on the console, only 2 of them show up as being children.&nbsp; How can I fix the 3rd account, so they are all the same?</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I really don't feel comfortable that my account is secure given all the misinformation I got from the Support agent on the phone, and I want to tie up any loose ends.&nbsp; Thanks in advance for your help!</p>
<p>- Jeff</p>

<p>To put it bluntly, you got a terrible agent. Assuming your story reads in the order it happened, he released information to you he shouldn't have. Outside of that, the story is quite long, give me a minute to read through it and I may be able to give some
 advise.</p>

<p>What it sounds like might be your first problem is you have two possible Microsoft accounts, one for the yahoo, and on for the Outlook. This is of course as it should be, being you created one for the yahoo and the outlook automatically is one, being microsofts
 email. Make sure the gamertag (I am guessing this one you posted on) is on the correct email to log in with. The only way to change it is on your console, under account security change Microsoft accounts. If you didn't do that, then the gamertag may still
 be on the yahoo email. The easiest way to find out, under account security on the xbox, turn on "display Microsoft account" and see which email it shows.</p>
<p>As for your interaction with the agent, that sucks. I can assure you they aren't all like that, you just got a bad one (as I said earlier). I have nothing but praise for the ones I've had to deal with.</p>
<p>1. There are a few major places this info can show up, and they can send the code to any of those you use, unless you changed some option somewhere. There are contact emails, billing emails, security proofs, account aliasas, the log in email itself, and
 of course, anywhere it shows "alternate email." The main ones they would send emails to are the account log in/aliasas, billing, and proofs. Make sure those all show the outlook, not the yahoo. Just to make sure, I would double check on account.live.com and
 try logging in under both the yahoo and the outlook, unless of course you've confirmed the log in as I said earlier.</p>
<p>2. Same as number 1, but with the phone numbers you see.</p>
<p>3. As I said, you do have two Microsoft accounts, the yahoo one and the outlook one. Plus all the child accounts linked to them. You can't merge the two, just get the above worked out and ignore the rest.</p>
<p>4. If one of your "child" accounts was created. and at the time it was given a birthdate showing an age over 18, its an adult account, not a child account. You can't change that and downgrade an adult account to a child account. You need to make a new account.
 Alternatively, you can just adjust some of the settings on the xbox, but they can just change them back. I would suggest a family passcode on your xbox. You can find more info about that here:
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/billing-and-subscriptions/parental-controls/xbox-live-parental-control" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../xbox-live-parental-control</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As one last piece of advise in two parts;</p>
<p>1. If you still have his name, call back to support, let them know you want to talk to a manager to complain about a previous agent. You have that right, and notes will be taken that go around until it gets back to the right person. Also, the new agent should
 be a little more helpful, and a little less rude.</p>
<p>2. Keep your eyes on your email (especially if you don't call back). You should see a survey in a couple days. FILL THAT OUT. It matters. If you call back, remember that the survey will be for the new agent you get, not this one.</p>

<p>Hi Yezzmina,</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Thank you for the thoughtful reply. &nbsp;My account most definitely uses the Outlook.com address. &nbsp;I did a "change Microsoft account" back when I first set this up. &nbsp;Just to be sure, I verified it on my console. &nbsp;So, I only have 1 Microsoft account, which uses
 the Outlook.com address. &nbsp;The Yahoo.com address does not appear anywhere under any account settings, including the Xbox console itself and the account.live.com. &nbsp;I even tried the forgot password link with my Yahoo.com email and it said the account doesn't
 exist. &nbsp;So, the Yahoo.com email address should not exist anywhere, except maybe in the history of my account as it was originally set up with that.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Regarding the child account, I already have family passcode set up. &nbsp;The child account in question has a 2008 birth date, so it is definitely a child account. &nbsp;I set all 3 of them up at the same time, but when I go to Settings --&gt; Family, only 2 of the 3
 show up there. &nbsp;The 3rd is definitely linked b/c it requires my 4 digit passcode, but does not show up as a child on my account. &nbsp;So, there's something wrong with the linkage somewhere.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Again, I really appreciate you reading through my long-winded message and replying to each point. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I really think I need someone from support who can see how things are set up behind the scenes to help fix all of this.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Jeff</p>

            <p>Hey there JeffMomm!<br /><br />Just to keep things as simple as possible and have one agent helping you rather than several (as it would be on the forums), <strong>I suggest calling phone support again (you can use the <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Us</a> page to set up a support call and skip waiting on hold, if you'd like) and ask to be escalated to the Advocacy Team.</strong> They'll be able to walk through your account with you and get things sorted.<br /><br />I truly hope this helps. Let us know if you have any questions. ^_^</p>

<p>I might also add here that Microsoft emails can't use themselves as a security email. &nbsp;Outlook, Hotmail, and LIVE emails exempt themselves from receiving security codes if they are the same email used to login to the account in the first place. &nbsp;I would
 recommend adding a secondary security email to the account.</p>

<p>Hi Klokkwork, do you have a source for that info? &nbsp;I have been using the Outlook.com email address for about a year, and I get all of my security codes sent to that email address. &nbsp;In fact, just now when on the phone with support, they sent a security code
 there. &nbsp;I am not doubting your intent, but want to make sure accurate info is out there for others.</p>
<p>.</p>

<p>Sorry, I should clarify, I mean when you are receiving security codes at xbox.com. &nbsp;I could potentially be wrong about the outlook domain, but I was pretty sure it was included. &nbsp;LIVE and Hotmail I'm positive don't do it, because when you sign into the account
 on xbox.com, and attempt account management, and it needs to verify you are you, it would be pointless to verify the person by sending it to the same email used to login, because if that email was compromised, it would be a self defeating security check. &nbsp;You
 can, however, receive the website verification code at a different Hotmail or LIVE email than the one you're logging in with. &nbsp;I'll have to research a bit more to confirm this for outlook emails.</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your connected drives change or go away or you just don’t want them connected anymore,&nbsp;you may&nbsp;have to go ahead and unmap or delete the connected locations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 8 has a very simple utility that helps you with removing mapped drives from your system. There are two easy ways to access this tool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: <br />
</strong></p>
<p>First, you can search for <em>"<strong>Computer</strong>"</em> from the <em>Start</em> screen. Right-click or long-press
<em><strong>Computer</strong></em> when it appears in the search results and then click or tap
<em>"<strong>Disconnect network drive</strong>."</em> This will take you to the <em>
<strong>Desktop</strong></em> and launch the tool.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Follow the steps from Windows Explorer. </strong></p>
<p><br />
a. If you’re already on the Desktop, you can open <strong>File Explorer</strong> by clicking the folder icon on your taskbar. Click or tap Computer from the left pane and click or tap "<strong>Map network drive</strong>" on the ribbon. Next, click or tap "<strong>Disconnect
 network drive</strong>."<br />
&nbsp;<br />
b. The resulting window displays all networked shares your have mapped to your local computer. To remove one, select it from the list and
<strong>click or tap OK</strong>.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
c. If you’d rather manually <strong>disconnect </strong>the mapped drives, open <strong>
File Explorer</strong> and <strong>click or tap</strong> <strong>Computer</strong> from the left pane.
<strong>Right-click or long-press</strong> the <strong>mapped</strong> drive in question and click or tap Disconnect.<br />
</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. Reply with the status so that we could help you further.

            I figured this out go to file explorer then go to the network tab and click on it and hit properties and it will take you to a prompt and on the left side in a column click change network and privacy settings and then click on the one that says network
 drive and click in the bubble that says turn of network discovery

<h2>            Keyboard volume control shortcuts don&#39;t work when headphones are in</h2>
                    <p>What it says on the tin. &nbsp;I have Windows 7 and the keyboard shortcuts for volume control function perfectly when I'm using the speakers in my laptop, but the instant I switch to headphones, none of them work. &nbsp;I've screwed around in the Control Panel Headphone
 settings, but there's nothing relating to keyboard shortcuts. &nbsp;I've tried looking for a program by the name of Keyboard, but there is no such thing on my laptop. &nbsp;There's only a descriptive window in the Control Panel that does diddly other than tell me that
 yes, I do in fact have a keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Where am I supposed to look to fix this?</p>

<p>However, there is now some uncertainty as to whether this could repeat itself. Why did it happen in the first place and will this method always work?</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>
<p>

 work.</p>

            Hi, 
<br />I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Advisor, 18 years experienced windows guide. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />Windows may not recognize LAN adapter during installation for some PCs/Laptops, 
<br />
<br />We need to manually install drivers for LAN adapter after installation, which may get you some stability issues with BSOD.   
<br />
<br />Troubleshoot Compatibility provides a simple way to make older drivers work under modern versions of Windows by making the driver believe it is being installed on a supported version of Windows.

<br />
<br />Please Run DISM command. 
<br />
<br />Kindly follow these steps:
<br />- Type in the command prompt 
<br />
<br />DISM /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth 
<br />
<br />- press Enter.
<br />- Restart windows and check for errors.
<br />
<br />Also, you can run chkdsk command to fix corrupted files: 
<br />1. Boot from Windows installation DVD.
<br />2. Select "Repair Your Computer".
<br />3. Choose Command Prompt, in the recovery tool panel, .
<br />4. Run chkdsk C: /f /r (for C drive)

<br />Windows 10 uses troubleshooters to help you solve problems with your PC. To run a troubleshooter.

            If sfc and DISM commands don't work then a repair or clean install is the only option. Perhaps there is something else wrong, have you been able to run a memory check?

<h2>            Windows Media Player Streaming turns off after reboot</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am having a problem with Windows Media Player 12 (Win 7 x64). After rebooting the PC, everytime I have to re-enable Streaming, before WMP will stream to anything. This has been going on for a little while, was working fine to start with.</p>
<p>Also recently it will not stream unless, even after enabling streaming, I leave WMP12 open on the PC. I am streaming to an Xbox 360.</p>
<p>Can anyone offer any advice? If it is not fixable is there anyway of scripting enabling media streaming, so I can run this on startup?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>
<p>Jon</p>

<h3> blackpredator72  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sound Blaster Tactic3D Rage Wireless headset on Xbox One</h2>
                    
<p>I've got a Sound Blaster Tactic3D Rage Wireless headset but I think it's not supported yet ? It's working on Windows 7 and 8.</p>
<p>I put the wireless stick in the USB port and push the connect button on the stick and the headset. I hear a sound that it's connected</p>
<p>but no sound through the headset. If it was working is there an option to change the output from SPDIF to the headset in the settings somewhere or</p>
<p>should it change automatically ? I already tried to restart the Xbox One with the headset turned on and the SPDIF disconnected but without success.</p>

<p>Toppie! Ik hoop dat het wat helpt. Anders zou ik ieder die ook deze headset heeft willen aanraden het zelfde te doen om ze een mail te sturen. *** meer mensen er mee komen des te meer er wat mee gedaan word.</p>

            What is the make and model of the keyboard?  It should have a way to reset itself to defaults.
<br />
<br />One method to do this is here:  
<br /><a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-keyboard-settings-default-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/reset-keyboard-se...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also run the Keyboard Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />
<br />You can also reinstall the keyboard in Device Manager:  Right click Start button to access Device Manager, choose Keyboard device, on Driver tab choose Uninstall.  Restart PC using mouse. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Promotion: FREE Snoopy Flying Ace with 1 year subscription to XBL Gold</p>
<p>Date: Jan 1, 2011 - Jan 11, 2011</p>
<p>Promo Item(s): Snoopy Flying Ace</p>
<p>It's now been over 7 months since this promotion ended. &nbsp;I never got the code for my free game. &nbsp;I checked my email thoroughly and even checked the spam folder, but there was no code to be found. &nbsp;I called 1-800-4MY-XBOX and they confirmed that I should
 have gotten the code, but that I should post here. &nbsp;Seems like a really inefficient way to handle the problem, but here I am. &nbsp;At this point, I'd just rather have the 800 pts to get a game that isn't so old... :-(</p>

<p>Wow, this is a terrible way to resolve issues. &nbsp;A forum post? &nbsp;I didn't even get an email stating that someone had replied to my topic! &nbsp;I find myself spending way too much time and energy to get what I was promised months ago: an old 800 pt XBLA game that
 should have been given to me ages ago! &nbsp;If this is the way that MS is going to handle "bonuses", you can count me out. &nbsp;I will never fall for this "bonus game" chicanery again. &nbsp;I should get 800 MS points to spend how I choose. &nbsp;This is utterly ridiculous.
 &nbsp;I've been a loyal XBL member for 8 years... since Day 1 that XBL went live. &nbsp;Why should I have any faith in MS following through in the future? &nbsp;Someone please resolve this without making me jump through any more hoops!</p>
<p>*sigh* to answer your question: 1/4/2011 is the date I renewed my subscription. &nbsp;The person on the phone already verified that I was due this game weeks ago. &nbsp;I'm not sure why you all have such a disconnect.</p>

<p>I *STILL* have not received my free game! It's been what now? A year plus? It's not even about the silly Snoopy game anymore. I think I deserve MS Points in lieu of the game considering the horrendous turnaround time ( and support hoops I"ve had to jump
 through. This should have been resolved with 1 phone call to a 1-800 number. (Obviously, this shouldn't have been an issue in the first place, but I understand that mistakes can happen.) But making me wait this long is completely unacceptable.</p>

<p>Katsu, you may want to PM Miss Portia with a link to this thread. They have recently changed the support on these foruns so there is actually a different forum for dashboard promotions. A PM should keep you from having to repost the issue.</p>
<p>@MetalGear- they re-did these forums at the beginning of the month. The new rewards team is still trying to catch up on posts.</p>

<h2>            My Dell lattitude E6230 Charging problems&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Well anybody out there that can help me with my computer. It has refused to charge for the past week and now is running off the charger and stuck at 6% Battery life so I have tried everything that I know to try and get it working again but have failed dismally
 I am afraid. As far as I can tell the charger is working fine and I have bought a new battery for it but still no luck. It did cure itself for a few hours the other day but has now gone wrong again. So I am at a loss to know what to do as Dell want to charge
 me about £200 to take it back in and fix it but that is about what I paid for the Computer in the first place about 18 months ago, so this is not an option!</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Anybody got any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>With many thanks for any suggestions,</p>

Laptops should charge regardless if Windows has started or not. It is best to contact you computer manufacturer for further assistance.<br />

<p>Well hello there John and thank you for your message. Basically I know that the computer should start charging as soon as it is plugged in to the charger but basically mine doesn't it did up until 3-4 days ago but just stopped..... I have tried a different
 charger but this hasn't helped...The only thing that I can think it might be is a software issue but have tried doing everything on the setup on here and it says that a charger is plugged into it but it say's 6% available ( plugged in, not charging ) I have
 put a meter on the output leads from the chargers and they all say about 20 Volts so that is not the problem. I am at a loss to know where to turn to next!</p>
<p>
</p><p>With many thanks for your help here,</p>
<p>

<h3> arthur h  say:</h3>
<h2>            Downloading ccleaner from filehippo does not show in the saved directory. </h2>
                    I have downloaded twice to the same directory, downloaded to another directory, then from my desktop Vista I emailed to my laptop then saved ccleaner to 2 different directories.<br />
<br />
This has never happened before.<br />
<br />
Anyone have some ideas.<br />
<br />
My laptop is Vista home edition, plenty of HD, 4G Ram, Pc about 1yr old<br />
<br />
Thanks Arthur H<br />

            Rob,<br />
<br />
While I really like the free version of PrevX you recommended, I have discovered that when I try to download .rar files from deviantART website, I have to turn PrevX monitoring off and set it to 'enable in 5 minutes.'&nbsp; I guess it's some kind of built-in browsing
 security feature.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
At first I thought the files were downloading, and&nbsp;I just couldn't find them.&nbsp; It wasn't until I noticed the 'save to' box wasn't coming&nbsp;up, that I&nbsp;thought to check if&nbsp;PrevX was blocking the download(s).<br />
<br />
Depending on what internet security program(s) you have installed, <strong>arthur h</strong>, you may want to check to see if something like this is causing your downloads to not save (they may just not be on your computer.)<br />
<br />
Good luck.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Its best to download it direct from the author's site :<br />
<br />
CCleaner - Free<br />
<a href="http://www.ccleaner.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ccleaner.com/</a><br />
<br />
Where did you save it? Try C:\Users\YourUserName\Downloads<br />
<br />
<br />
============================================<br />
<br />
If you have trouble with downloads :<br />
<br />
Make another account with your same password - set it to ADMIN Level - REBOOT (do not just logoff) and<br />
logon to that account - can you download using it? (make two ADMIN accounts - one in case you have to<br />
migrate to it and another to test and fix).<br />
<br />
While in the new account use it to LOWER your regular account APPLY / OK as needed&nbsp;- and then raise it back<br />
to ADMIN - repeat&nbsp;a few times - lower - raise - go back in lower - raise - repeat. This helps to clear corruption.
<br />
Make sure you leave the account as Admin.<br />
<br />
Try your downloads in the new account.<br />
<br />
If needed later this is the process to fix a corrupted account or migrate to a new one.<br />
<br />

<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Then logon to&nbsp;the old account and try these to clear corruption and repair/replace damaged/missing system files.<br />
<br />
Run DiskCleanup - Start - All Programs - Accessories - System Tools - Disk Cleanup<br />
<br />
Start - type this in Search Box -&gt;&nbsp; COMMAND&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top and RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; -&nbsp; RUN AS ADMIN<br />

<br />
Then reset IE <br />
<br />
What antivirus/antispyware/security product do you have on machine? Include any you have EVER has on this<br />
machines including those you uninstalled (they leave remnants behind which causes issues).<br />
<br />
Start - All Programs&nbsp;- Accessores - System Tools - IE with no Addons - does this work better?<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Advanced Tab - click Restore&nbsp;Advanced Settings&nbsp;and then click RESET - APPLY /&nbsp;OK<br />
<br />
IE - Tools - Internet Options - Security Tab&nbsp;- click Reset all zones - APPLY / OK<br />
<br />
Close and restart IE and/or IE with no addons<br />
<br />
Start - All Programs&nbsp;- Accessores - System Tools - IE with no Addons - does this work better?<br />
<br />
IE - Tools&nbsp;- Manage Addons (for sure disable SSV2 if it is there, this is no longer needed but Java still installs it<br />
and it causes issues - you ever update Java go back in and disable it again.) Look for other possible problems.<br />
<br />
Windows Defender - Tools - Software Explorer - look for issues with programs that do not look right. Permitted<br />
are usually OK and "not permitted" are not always bad. If in doubt about a program ask about it here.<br />
<br />
Could be a BHO - BHOremover - Free - standalone program, needs no install, download and run - not all<br />
are bad however some can cause your issue. (Toolbars are BHO's)<br />
<a href="http://securityxploded.com/bhoremover.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://securityxploded.com/bhoremover.php</span></a><br />
<br />
Startup Programs<br />
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/79612-startup-programs-enable-disable.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/79612-startup-programs-enable-disable.html</span></a><br />
<p>Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect malware&nbsp;UPDATE it and then run it as<br />
a scanner.&nbsp;<br />
<a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/</span></a><br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

            Hi, Bru,
<br />
<br />What is the make/model of the computer?
<br />Try using a different USB keyboard and mouse?
<br />Do the secondary keyboard and mouse work?
<br />
<br />You may have to use a Recovery USB to reinstall Windows 10. Create the Recovery media using this tool.

            Hi Brij
<br />
<br />Try these steps to see if they help:
<br />
<br />Mouse:
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Mice and other pointing devices.
<br />Right click on the Mouse and click uninstall
<br />
<br />Press Alt + F4
<br />Press the Windows key + X
<br />Press the letter U
<br />Press the letter R
<br />
<br />Restart in Normal mode and see if the mouse works.
<br />
<br />It was an issue with the Synaptics drivers for my touchpad. I had to disable some Palm Check sensitivity, which I had read about a few days ago, but could not find the option.
<br />
<br />OR
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Press the 'M' key
<br />Press tab once
<br />Use the down arround to select Mice and other pointing devices.
<br />Press the right arrow to expand Mice and other pointing devices.
<br />Use the down arrow again to select your HID-Compliant mouse
<br />Press the right click menu key on your keyboard (usually located between the Alt and Control keys)
<br />Select uninstall
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Press Alt + F4
<br />Press the Windows key + X
<br />Press the letter U
<br />Press the letter R
<br />
<br />Restart
<br />
<br />Other things you can try.
<br />
<br />Method 1: Run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter. This troubleshooter finds and fixes common problems with devices on your computer.
<br />
<br />Click Start.
<br />Type Troubleshooting, and select Troubleshooting in the results.
<br />In the new window, click Hardware and Sound.
<br />In the list of options, click on Hardware and Devices.
<br />Click Next and follow the on-screen instructions.
<br />
<br />Method 2: Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files. This allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />Also run the System File Checker utility:
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow
<br />
<br />This will check for any integrity violations
<br />
<br />Restart your system
<br />

 you have Creative SoundBlaster sound card on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Both the files are associated with Creative (SoundBlaster) sound card.</span></p>
<p><span>If you have Creative SoundBlaster installed on the computer I would suggest that you visit the Creative website download and install latest drivers
 for it, check if it works.</span></p>

            A small window opens when I log onto Windows 7. The title is "CTXfiHlp MFC Application has stopped working ". I close the window and everything appears to work just fine. It has been doing this a while and I decided to try and find out how to get rid of
 it. I saw the response above and figured maybe it is Sound Blaster so I tried to update the drivers but Windows says they are up to date.&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 10 start &#38; restart takes 25 minutes</h2>
                    I have a Dell Latitude E6430. Upgraded it from Windows 7 to 10 using Media Creation Tool on 4/16/16. After logging in on start or restart it hangs up on the Welcome screen for 25 minutes.

            <p><span>Hi Earl,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand the inconvenience caused. To better assist you, do let us know if you see the "<strong>power</strong>" button in the login screen. If so, I would suggest you to check if you are able to sign in through safe mode by following the steps
 below:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on the <strong>power button</strong>.</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hold the shift key and click "<strong>restart</strong>" to enter Windows Recovery Environment.
</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After your PC restarts to the Choose an option screen, select
<strong>Troubleshoot</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced options</strong> &gt;<strong>Startup Settings &gt; Restart</strong>.
</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">After your PC restarts, you'll see a list of options. Select 4 or F4 to start your PC in Safe Mode. Or if you'll need to use the Internet, select 5 or F5 for Safe Mode with Networking.
</p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>If you are able to sign in through safe mode, I would suggest you to place your computer in clean boot state.
</span></p>
<p><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 188, 1)">How to Perform a Clean Boot?</span></a><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;(</span></strong><span><span><em>Applies to Windows 10</em>)</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: Once you are done with the troubleshooting, perform the steps in "How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot" to reset computer as usual.
</span></span></p>
<p>
