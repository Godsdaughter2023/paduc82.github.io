    <title>Customer Service Complaint - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> erinconnery  say:</h3>
<h2>            Customer Service Complaint</h2>
                    <p><span>My Surface 2 was malfunctioning. Since the device was under warranty, store associates were able to assist me in processing an Advance Exchange on my device. This process involved Microsoft
 putting a hold in the amount of my device on my credit card, until they sent me a refurbished device, and I shipped the damaged one back to the warehouse. This should have been a seamless process.
</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>I am sitting here over a month later, and Microsoft has still not refunded my money. I have spent HOURS on the hotline explaining my case to multiple representatives. The case has been "escalated"
 twice. When trying to respond to email correspondence from agent handling the case, my emails are returned to sender. Every time I have to call&nbsp;to follow up on the case, I am speaking to a brand new representative, starting from square&nbsp;one- and Microsoft cannot
 provide a direct email or&nbsp;extension to avoid this redundancy. I would just like one person to take ownership and accountability of this case, so it can be resolved. Posting on this forum is my last resort, as I cannot get a customer service email to save my&nbsp;life.
 So I guess I have to go public with this.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Has anyone else had a similar issue? I am so disappointed with the lack of ownership and professionalism with this. I am at a loss of what to do. Here is the timeline of this case.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong><span>10/14</span></strong><span> Advance Exchange Processed on Microsoft.com- funds put on hold on my credit card account. Microsoft
 shipped me new device. I returned damaged device.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>10/28</span></strong><span> Damaged device was delivered and signed in by Microsoft. Refund processing time quoted 3-5 business
 days (11/4 latest expected&nbsp;refund date)</span></p>

<p><strong><span>11/9
</span></strong><span>Still had not received refund. Called Microsoft Hotline. Was transferred to service, and put on hold for
<strong><span>1 hour 18 minutes</span></strong>. Finally hung up and called again.</span></p>

<p><span>Called hotline again. Was transferred to store department, then online store department. Representative I was transferred to was rushed and rude. He texted me a confirmation code. After I
 provided that for him, he put me on hold, which I was never taken off of. This call lasted
<strong><span>40 minutes</span></strong>.
</span></p>

<p><span>Called hotline again, and was put on hold for extended period again. A representative named Jane picked up finally, and was asking me irrelevant questions. I finally made it clear that I just
 wanted confirmation that my returned device was accepted and that the refund would be processed. She told me that the refund was processed on 11/8 (a Sunday)- and that I would need to deal with my bank at this point. I requested a receipt/proof of refund transaction
 so I could follow up with my bank. She said she would email this info- but never did. This phone call lasted
<strong><span>37 minutes.</span></strong></span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>I waited as few business days to see if the refund would post to my bank.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><strong><span>11/12
</span></strong><span>Called Microsoft Hotline, and held for representative. Cathy picked up. I requested a supervisor. I was transferred to accounts payable, then transferred to the service department,
 then transferred to Ron in tech support. I requested to escalate the issue. A new case was created. A new text confirmation code was texted to me. He validated that the refund was released on 11/8, and that I needed to work with my bank. I requested a receipt
 again. I was on hold while they partnered with support to get me an invoice/receipt. The email that was sent to me was useless. It was an email from Microsoft that said a refund was process on 11/8. No transaction number, no tracking number, no contact for
 support. While representative was giving me the new case number, we were disconnected, and they did not place a call back. This call lasted
<strong>57 minutes.</strong></span></p>

<p><span>Called my bank. No record of this refund being attempted. They said it can take 7-10 business days, so I should wait until 11/20.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>11/25
</span></strong><span>Funds still not available on my credit card after giving plenty of time to process. I call Microsoft Hotline again, and request supervisor. Have no patience to explain case to
 representative after representative as I get transferred and put on hold again. Shane comes back on the line after trying to get supervisor to inform me that he sees in his system that the refund has been processed and that the case is closed. No. After continuing
 to hold, finally get to speak to supervisor, Nell. She confirms my Microsoft account. Confirms the credit card info is correct, and double checks the records/database. I plea with her to cancel the last transaction that was supposedly processed on 11/8, and
 issue a new refund. I am not calling my bank again. And I am not calling Microsoft again. Nell puts me on hold. Returns saying that I can check the processed orders on my Microsoft account to see the refund. I request she stays on the line with me as I follow
 the link provided. Sure enough- the refund is not showing. I am not sure what the discrepancy is between what they are seeing, and what is really going on. She puts me on hold again so she can get her manager- and to escalate the case again. This is the highest
 point of contact I am able to receive on the hotline. The care team is going to investigate the delay, and will resolve ASAP. They promise they will return the call in 24-48 hours. I am given a new reference number for my case. This call lasted
<strong>1 hour and 6 minutes.</strong></span></p>

<p><strong><span>11/27
</span></strong><span>No call back as promised. I call the Microsoft Hotline. They inform me that a representative named Jorbie has emailed me. I receive an email from Jorbie, an analyst from the Global
 Escalation Service team. She assures me that the refund was processed on 11/26, and funds would be available same night. She says if I have any issue, to email within 7 days, or I will need to go through the hotline. She says she is closing the case. I try
 to respond to the email to thank her, and ask her not to close the case until the funds actually go through. This email gets bounced back to me as undeliverable. There is no email or phone number in her sign off on the email. I try livechat on Microsoft.com
 to see if they can provide an extension or email. No luck. This phone call lasted
<strong>25 minutes.</strong></span></p>

<p><span>I don’t know what to do. I would like a reliable contact at Microsoft who I can reach, and who can see this case through to the end. I would like some information
 and answers as to why this process has been such a nightmare. I would like some sort of goodwill gesture to make up for the hours of time I have wasted on this. I would like my $580 that Microsoft owes me.
</span></p>

    <title>After a clean re-install of Windows 10, no audio devices are detected. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rickjor  say:</h3>
<h2>            After a clean re-install of Windows 10, no audio devices are detected.  How can this be fixed&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Before the clean install, the following two sections existed in Device Manager:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Audio Inputs and outputs</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Microphone (Realtek High Definition Audio)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Speakers (PlayOn Virtual Audio Device)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Speakers (Realtek High Definition Audio)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sound, video and game controllers</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - High Definition Audio Device</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - PlayOn Virtual Audio Device</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; - Realtek High Definition Audio</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the clean install, both sections were totally missing from Device Manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, in the "System devices" section, the High Definition Audio Controller wouldn't start.&nbsp; I couldn't find any device driver that would correct this situation.&nbsp; Installing a clean set of Reaktek drivers had no impact on the problem either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, under <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Sound</span> in <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Control Panel</span>, no audio devices are shown on any of the tabs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer is an ASUS K73E laptop, and Windows 10 had been running successfully since the O/S was upgraded last July.</p>

            <p>Solution found -- "downgraded" the Intel Chipset Driver using Intel's driver upgrade utility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently, the problem was caused by the Windows 10 "clean install" when it selected an inappropriate chipset driver. Intel's own driver update utility indicated that although the installed driver was newer, it wasn't the correct one. Installing the recommended
 but "older" driver completely solved the problem.</p>

<h2>            Lenovo ThinkPad Won&#39;t Boot</h2>
                    Hello, I am having an issue with my Lenovo ThinkPad T520 running Windows 7 Professional 64-Bit. It has an Intel Core i5 vPro 4GB RAM and a 500GB HDD. It has worked fine up until this point. Here is what happened. &nbsp;It all started when I was surfing the
 web tonight and it froze. I couldn't click the "X" button, use Alt+F4 or Ctrl+Alt+Del. So I decided to hard boot. I held down the power button until it shut down. When I boot it up again, it froze on the starting Windows screen. I waited for about five or
 ten minutes and hard booted again. That time it asked me which start-up option I wanted to use. Start Windows Normally or something like error recovery. I tried the error recovery option but it was to no avail. I booted it again and it still froze. It is still
 running right now. Help, tell me what I should do. I hope it doesn't have anything to do with hardware because the PC belongs to my work. &gt;_&lt;

            <blockquote>Regardless of the fact it belongs to my work I am a system administrator.
</blockquote>
<br />
Are you the job in question's system administrator by title?&nbsp; If so,&nbsp;you should troubleshoot the issue.&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; Or are you just an administrator on the system in question?&nbsp; Having administrative rights doesn't make you a system administrator by title.&nbsp; *grin*<br />
&nbsp; <br />
No offense meant, but the phrasing of your question sounded more like an end-user explaining than a system administrator explaining.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Can you boot into Safe Mode?&nbsp; If so - how does it work?&nbsp; Can you boot into Safe Mode with Networking?&nbsp; If so - how does it work in that mode?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
So you are saying nothing changed between it working and not working other than the freeze?&nbsp; No updates, no new hardware or software installed, etc?<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Have you tried using System Restore to go back to a point before the system had issues?<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Can you utilize an Ubuntu boot CD and run it from the CD drive to see if the machine will boot like that and be usable?<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Do you have the recovery media/method for the system in mind and do you have a backup of the data you might need from the machine (or a method in place, if you are a system administrator, for backing up an entire system so you can pull data out of said backup
 after a recovery?)

            What model computer? When does it happen? Did you click on the volume icon in the lower right corner and adjust it? Use the Mute key on the keyboard to stop all sound. It's on the top row with an icon with a speaker and an X on many laptops. That key is
 handy when on the Internet using your browser. Some web sites will have loud sound. See if the web site has a volume adjustment you can use.

<p>
</p><p>In Windows 10, your device is always kept up to date with the latest features and fixes. Updates and drivers are installed automatically, with no need to select which updates are needed or not needed. &nbsp;In rare cases, a specific driver or update might temporarily
 cause issues with your device, and in this case you will need a way to prevent the problematic driver or update from reinstalling automatically the next time Windows Updates are installed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>So to avoid a problematic update from reinstalling again n again in your system you can use
</span></span><span>wushowhide.diagcab as given the link which you where referring to.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However if you wish to hide updates in Windows 10, refer to the link below:</span></p>

            <p>The best way to stop an automatic driver installation is to use gpedit.msc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Computer configuration &gt; administrative templates &gt; system &gt; driver installation &gt; device installation restrictions &gt; prevent installation of devices not described by other policy settings</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then set "prevent installation of devices not described by other policy settings" to "enabled"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, uninstall the faulty device driver or the driver you want windows to stop updating automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, you must re-install the device using your own driver but you got to do it fast.&nbsp; Quickly set "prevent installation of devices not described by other policy settings" to "disabled" or "not configured."&nbsp; Now you have a few seconds before windows starts
 to automatically install the driver again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Proceed to installing the driver of your choice.&nbsp; After it's complete, set "prevent installation of devices not described by other policy settings" back to "enabled."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Be sure you set "prevent installation of devices not described by other policy settings" to "disabled" or "not configured" whenever you want to install any other drivers for other devices.</p>

<p>
</p><p>This error means that the Windows Store has failed to download the update and it has an invalid app cache. We suggest to run the following PowerShell script to re-register the Store and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type <em>cmd</em> on the search bar and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Enter the following command on the Command Prompt window<em>: </em><em>PowerShell -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Command "&amp; {$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.WindowsStore).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode
 -Register $manifest}</em></li><li>Reboot your device.</li></ol>

<h2>            My Account is blocked or restricted, what can i do&#63;</h2>
                    <b>Technical Level</b> : Basic
<br /><br /><b>Summary</b><br />Instructions on how to recover blocked or restricted accounts
<br /><b>Details</b><br /><p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are creating this thread because many of our community users are encountering account-related issues, and we wanted to walk you through how to get unstuck in these circumstances.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A lot of reasons can cause an account to get restricted or blocked: suspected compromised accounts, abuse reports, checks requested by our payment providers, etc. We know they are annoying to deal with and our recovery flow is still not optimally built to
 deal with all possible scenarios. While we are working to improve this experience, due to the complexity of account management, we need to be diligent in our account recovery processes so that we do not inadvertently expose your data to anyone who should not
 have access to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before we proceed, there is a lot of confusion as to what is a Skype account and what is a Microsoft Account. Let’s start by saying that all
<a href="https://aka.ms/skypemicrosoftaccount" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Skype Accounts are Microsoft Accounts</span></span></a> since October 2016.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Blocked accounts:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First and foremost, anyone who is having this issue should at least review <a href="https://aka.ms/accountrecoveryfaq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">this FAQ</span></span></a>&nbsp;(link will open in new window). If you haven’t done so, please make sure you do.</p>
<p>More often than not, the issue is simply that your email address has been leaked by another website. Our systems then act with an air of caution and will force you to reset your password to ensure the integrity of your account.</p>
<p>There are other reasons, but they are too lengthy to explore in detail here.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>How do I get it fixed?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Visit the <a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Microsoft Account Diagnostics
</span></span></a>page and it will take you through the appropriate steps to recover your account. Admittedly, some of the information we ask on our forums can be lengthy and hard to remember, however (and bear with us now) that is the point. You are
<em>far more likel</em>y to have that information than any 3<sup><span>rd</span></sup> parties trying to gain access to your account and, we need to make sure it’s you to protect your account and personal data.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Restricted from using Skype's paid for services?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This occurs for many reasons: invalid payment details, checks required the card issuer, etc. We need to ensure that you are the owner of the payment method used on your account. This process is designed to protect you from fraudulent use of these payment
 methods with our services.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To recover your account please visit our <a href="https://aka.ms/PartialBlock" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">partial block recovery</span></span></a> page.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Ok but I have tried all that and it didn't work, what can I do now?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If your account is blocked and you can’t login, then you can <a href="https://aka.ms/msagethelp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">contact support</span></span></a>&nbsp;here. If you scroll down to the bottom you will get two options - to email or to chat with support. Please make sure you tell the agent that you cannot login
 to your account because it is blocked, and when asked for your Microsoft Account, give the username you use to sign into Skype.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have a partially blocked account then you can <a href="https://aka.ms/contactskypesupport" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Contact Skype Support</span></span></a>. From the drop menu, select Account &amp; Sign-In and in the second box select "cannot access paid services." Scroll to the bottom and click next, and on
 the next screen you will see an option to Contact Skype Support.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>I have spoken to support, they have been unable to verify me or have advised me to create a new account what can I do?</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Occasionally we are unable to verify account ownership. While we understand this is frustrating, to secure your account data, we will not be able to assist you in unblocking your account. Clearly this is not the preferred resolution&nbsp;and so&nbsp;we&nbsp;encourage all
 users to ensure their Skype Account /&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;Account is up to date with the correct date of birth, home address, phone number and contact number. If you have not&nbsp;done so already, please take this opportunity to check your account and update any old and
 incorrect information. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi There,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thank the post owner which is really helpful for most of the situations with account restriction but I prepared this comment just to bring an instance of a similar situation where Skype support turns out an authoritarian and not really a mean for support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is a long conversation going on with Skype support with the reference number:&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">SRX1387130523ID&nbsp;</span>where it is clear that the support mechanism
 for Skype is not equipped to handle the situation where an account is permanently restricted and all of it's financials are ceased.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used Skype calling and many other subscription while living in Mexico but returning India after 4 years, suddenly I received a mail from Skype that I made some violation of their policy and My account started showing as Restricted.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 53, 52, 1); font-weight: bold">Your account has been restricted from using Skype's
 paid features.&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.skype.com/go/partial.block.recovery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Fix
 your account</a><span style="color: rgba(51, 53, 52, 1); font-weight: bold">.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed all steps mentioned and contacted support and having a long conversation chain where I found it completely useless and they won't help in anyway to either recover the account or provide further details of the violation. All they informed is that
 my Money held with Skype nether be used nor be refunded and I must create a new account to continue using those Skype features. There is NO consideration about a user sentiment for the user ID, it's linking with other accounts, profiles, social connections
 etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the replies received from Skype support are used to conceit their policies and force me to create a new account forfeiting the existing one which I am using for 13+ years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is like the trials in some Middle-east countries where a person is punished to death even without knowing himself/herself about the crime they committed. &nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>Now I am really ashamed of such enforcement of policies with Skype and convinced of filing up an arbitration request to Microsoft since it feels that no action will be taken by email requests. I really do not want to do that out of my fascination with my
 Skype-ID which was a kind of identity with my friends, colleagues, family, orgnisations and many other aspects. And it was a true shock when advised to crap the account and go for a new one. A policy can not be such unethical and must be reviewed for a better
 business perspective when a user agrees to face the trial even for any mistake done by him/her unintentionally or unknowingly.</p>
<p>

            <p>I appreciate this detailed post, but it has (for me) a dead end:&nbsp; The instruction "Visit the
<a href="https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</span></span></a>page and..." has a link to &lt;https://a.login.skype.com/diagnostics&gt;, which is a sign-in screen that, for me, still results in a failure to sign in!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried the Chat link for people who can't sign in, and the chat fails with the error CV: OFHS5R4/Lm6Ed8ki.0.0</p>
<p>I will next try the e-mail option.&nbsp; Hopefully that will get me somewhere...</p>

<p>
</p><p>and now after 3 request the SYSTEM said it's locked for 24 hours for security reasons?</p>

            I have an account since skype was created. All my contacts are there. Today, when I tried to enter a message appeared " someone is using your account". It shows the correct email to get back the access, but I´ve tried&nbsp;ten times to receive the email and
 it didn´t come. My email is working fine, something is happening in your sending system. I´ve tried&nbsp;the form but you guys suggested to create a new account. Friends, I have at least 10-15 years of relationship there. Please try to really send a recovery email
 to my account fsgordilho.

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>What do I do?&nbsp;
</span>Why my Microsoft accounts get blocked? It happened 3 times already to 3 different accounts in the past two weeks. The first two time while using Skype, I just got kicked off. I was not doing anything unusual from what I regularly had done using Skype
 for 5 years up to that point. Both, the other person and I were quite unhappy about that as we had important business to discuss, yet our conversation was abruptly interrupted.
<br />
<br />
It was impossible to unblock the first account as I do not have a number associated with that account because when it got created I did not have an active mobile number and the email that I used is now defunct. The only thing I remember form the extremely complicated
 Microsoft security questions questionnaire for certain are some contacts I had. My other details, like birth of date and name, were just made up as I saw no reason to give that information to Skype. All I wanted was my Skype back, I did not care about added
 Microsoft services to that account, I never even tried to use them. Yet, alas, I lost all really important contacts and conversation history. Really disappointed!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I desperately needed Skype that worked, I created another Microsoft ID. It seem to work, yet Skype was unavailable and Microsoft website notified that there was an error on their part.&nbsp; As I am using Mac, I thought there might be some compatibility issues
 I asked my trusted friend who was using Windows to create a Microsoft ID so I could use Skype. She did, and using that ID, Skype worked. Though same thing happened as with the original account, it became blocked and after 30 minutes it kicked me off Skype
 telling me that someone else might be using my account, I verified my number, got the code, and it seem to work afterwards. Yet, an hour later, it kicked me off again, asked me for my email and was telling me that my account was used in a suspicious way. I
 barely had 3 or 5 contacts, all close people&nbsp; that I know well, on that account. I just let it go as it was late and the email address associated with that account was my friends who had originally created the that Microsoft ID for me and I was not going to
 bother her about that at such a late hour.<br />
<br />
Next day I tried again to use Skype with the new Microsoft ID that I had created. Skype finally worked with that ID. Well, it took Microsoft 3 or 4 days but they seem to have fixed the issue on their part. Great, i started using e-mail, Skype and other related
 services to that Microsoft ID as I really liked it. Two days later, I try to sign in and it says that it is blocked.
<br />
</p>
Now, I cannot access not only Skype, but my e-mail, cloud storage or anything else online related to the Microsoft account. First time I tried to get the code via phone it just comes up with - "Usage limit exceeded. Try again tomorrow." So there is no way to
 unblock your account. It is crazy, Microsoft is completely ridiculous. What is worse, I found no way to contact anyone to solve this problem. hat can I do? What is going on?

<p>And now, even though I gave the number to MS and I got the message that account is unlocked, I can not log in to my Skype account. The account is locked again. So I want to unlock it via phone number but I did not received any code on my phone. GJ MS with
 wasting my time.</p>

<h2>            USB Mass Storage - Windows Driver Error &#40;Code 52&#41;</h2>
                    <div>Hi, I tried a lot of the suggestions to try and fix (Code 52) and un-successful so far. Try same USB memory stick, USB disk on another Windows machine and works fine, so not memory stick or disk. Disable Driver Signature
 Enforement in Adanced Boot and works fine.<br />
<br />
The difference between working machine/non working machine using same memory stick is:-<br />
1) Working machine, C:\Windows\system32\drivers\USBSTOR.SYS is assign digital signature (Rectangular box left of Driver file)<br />
2) Non working machine, C:\Windows\system32\drivers\USBSTOR.SYS is NOT assign digital signature (Rectangular box is missing left of Driver file)<br />
<br />
Anyone know how fix. FYI, Tried replacing Driver (USBSTOR.SYS, Microsoft driver) and doesn't fix it</div>

<h2>            Error codes and Pages not loading</h2>
                    For the past 5 days now I've been trying to check the Xbox games with gold to see the games that are free this month on my Xbox One S and I just keep getting the same error code code 0x80131500&nbsp; and&nbsp; CV:jezVN6n2wEilcluf&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I have tried cycling the power
 multiple times and doing a hard reset and it still will not load the page it just keeps saying try that again page could not be loaded please try again later and I'm at the point if this doesn't get fixed soon I might just format the whole console but I would
 prefer not to do that

            Try to use the Xbox app if it makes you access the gold month games, I hope it's not a problem of the servers in your area, but it could also be a problem not related to the console.

<p>For those who've owned the game more than a month, would you say you are still pretty into this game?&nbsp; Is it still fun to pick up &amp; play?&nbsp; I haven't played MK since Sega, but picked it up today at BestBuy for $40.&nbsp; I haven't opened it yet, because now I'm
 wondering if I will just get sick of it in a few weeks.&nbsp; It was an impulse buy, I do that every now &amp; then with games.</p>

<p>Personally, if you're a fan of the older MK titles, mainly 1-3 and possibly 4, you'll probably love it. I'm still playing it off and on a bit and enjoying the DLC and I picked it up on the release day. If you're into fighting games and the early MK series,
 I'm fairly certain you'll get your money's worth.</p>

<p>I like this game actually better than its pre-equels. Although wish it would have had more characters in the starting line up and more "new" characters in the game starting out and hopefully we will get more DLC after these four come out initially.</p>

<h2>            Word&#47; XP professional 2009</h2>
                    <p>I am using MS &nbsp;XP with the Word program that came with it. I must use XP because it was the last Windows program that is backwards compatable. Clicking on Word &nbsp;"Properties" does not give me the release date. I have stored data from MS 95 and 98 that I need
 to access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to print a sending address from Word to my NEW &nbsp;HP deskjet 1010 printer. Word is not giving me the correct set up instructions. Is there a fix for this "issue" &nbsp;Thank &nbsp;you Rocky S.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS MS support was NOT helpful because I am NOT a paid subscriber to their help desk.</p>

            <p>Thank you Mr. Lem P. I am using Win XP Professional. It cae with the complete Office suite. My new HP Deskjet 1010 prints great from
<strong>Word</strong> or from the Web. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Word will not let me print envelopes from the address on the letter. Is there come sub routine I have not found? Do I need to find a labeling set up? If yes where is it please? This was the very first time I wanted to print an address on an envelope.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I've unmarked my earlier response to you because it's not really the "Answer" to your problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So ... you have some version of Microsoft Word (it would help considerably if you mentioned which version of Word you have; use Help &gt; About Microsoft Word to find out) and you are having difficulty printing envelopes using the address in a letter that you
 created on an older version of Word.&nbsp; Does that accurately describe your situation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The version of Word that most likely was bundled with a Windows XP system should be able to open documents created in Word 95 and Word 97 (there was no "Word 98" for PCs).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer the following questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; What do you mean that "Word will not let me print envelopes from the address on the letter"?&nbsp; What happens when you try?&nbsp; Please report the complete text of any error message without paraphrasing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Can you open the documents in your current version of Word?</p>
<ul>
<li>If no, what happens when you try?&nbsp; Please report the complete text of any error message without paraphrasing</li><li>If yes, can you print the entire document (don't focus on the address at this point)?
<ul>
<li>If you can't print the document, what happens when you try?</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>3.&nbsp; Right-click on a representative problem document and select Properties.&nbsp; From the "General" tab, please provide the information shown for "Type of file" and "Opens with."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although I'm not a Word expert (for those, you should ask in the Word forum, <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/office/forum/office_xp-word?sort=lastreplydate&amp;dir=desc&amp;tab=threads&amp;status=all&amp;mod=&amp;modAge=&amp;advFil=&amp;postedAfter=&amp;postedBefore=&amp;threadType=all&amp;tm=1445351362084">
HERE</a>), all versions of Word with which I am familiar provide for printing envelopes.&nbsp; The catch is that the way you invoke that function has moved from version to version, which is why it is important that you provide the version of Word that your now have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a Word document that is a letter with an inside address, most versions of Word are able to find the address and automatically fill in the address information in the envelope printing dialog.&nbsp; It may be that in older versions of Word you had to
 select the address in the letter first; I don't remember.&nbsp; Here are some instructions for Office XP --&gt;

            Hi,  PHILLYJOE
<br />
<br />My name is Kathleen and I am an Independent Advisor.  I would be happy to help you today.
<br />
<br />I recommend using SFC
<br />The System File Checker tool built into Windows can scan your Windows system files for corruption or any other changes. If a file has been modified, it will automatically replace that file with the correct version. Here’s how to use it.
<br />
<br />Press the Start key and type the word CMD, right click on the command prompt and select Run as administrator, enter the following commands one by one followed by the Enter key:
<br />•- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth	
<br />•- DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />•- DISM.exe /online /cleanup-image /startcomponentcleanup
<br />•-  sfc /scannow 
<br />

<br />
<br />Let us know if these steps help you to resolve the issue.

<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Universal Serial Bus Controllers at the bottom
<br />
<br />Right click all entries there.

    <title>Windows 10 reinstall on asus t100 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 reinstall on asus t100</h2>
                    <p>Hi All, I recently had my ASUS T100 Transformer tablet die on me.&nbsp; I had installed Windows 10 and all was working ok.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried everything I could think of&nbsp; to bring it back to life, it would not load the&nbsp;windows boot manager.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I eventually did a factory reset and went back to Windows 8.1.&nbsp; Once I had&nbsp;that running I thought I would re-install Windows 10, went through the whole process and thought all was good but on what I am assuming&nbsp;was the last shutdown/restart the machine&nbsp;only
 booted up to the ASUS logo and stayed there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I left it like that for 24 hours and still nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have followed the instructions on creating a Windows 10 boot usb, and&nbsp;yes I changed the boot order in the bias but still the ASUS logo stays on the screen and the tablet does nothing when I start the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could anybody please advise me on what I could try next.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>John</p>

    <title>VGA &#47; DVI monitor conflict&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> macgyver1985  say:</h3>
<h2>            VGA &#47; DVI monitor conflict&#63;</h2>
                    <p>A few months ago I set up dual monitors on my computer, one is hooked up using a VGA cable and the other a DVI-D cable. &nbsp;Everything was working perfectly until this morning. &nbsp;Now the computer is perpetually connecting and then disconnecting to the DVI monitor.
 &nbsp;Both monitors work fine by themselves but as soon as both are hooked up to the PC the DVI connecting/disconnecting cycle restarts (about a second between each connect and disconnect). &nbsp;I changed the DVI cable to a new and shorter cable, I have looked for
 updates, and none were installed prior to this malfunction. &nbsp;I have rebooted the computer with different combinations of the monitors attached and still no resolution. &nbsp;Can anyone help me? &nbsp;I only have one DVI and one VGA port on my PC and only one of the
 monitors has the DVI port. &nbsp;My Display adapter is an Intel 4 series Internal chipset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hi Santosh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the above methods helped, although method 1 found a problem in another area so thank you for that. &nbsp;I didn't upgrade any software or drivers prior to the issue, however I think I discovered the problem. &nbsp;I rebooted my system with both monitors hooked
 up to the PC, after going through methods 1-3 (all display drivers were up to date). &nbsp;When the system came up&nbsp;the monitors were still not working properly, but&nbsp;I noticed an icon in the Notification portion of the taskbar. &nbsp;It was a new Icon for the Intel Graphics
 Media Accelerator, or at least one I had never noticed,<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8892116c-ef92-49f5-8905-526d1daf449f" />&nbsp;. &nbsp;I don't know if something automatically installed over the weekend
 (I usually turn that option off) or if something else started the problem, but I selected that icon and selected
<strong>Graphics Options</strong>, then <strong>Extended Desktop, Digital Display + Monitor</strong> and suddenly the DVI monitor was detected and everything was working properly. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help,</p>

<h2>            Where can I find my wimp files of movie maker&#63;</h2>
                    <p>When I call up Movie Maker, it no longer lists all the wimp videos I have created, but only the one I created in the past few days.</p>
<p>Where are all those others filed?&nbsp; The wmv are all under videos; the wimps no where to be found.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting. I understand that you are having issues finding your .wlmp files. By design, only recent projects will be listed in Movie Maker. As for the location of your .wlmp files, it depends on where did you actually saved those files. What I can&nbsp;suggest
 is for you check the folders where you frequently save your files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should you have other concerns, feel free to post back.</p>
<p><br />
Regards,</p>
<p>Richard</p>

            <p>In addition to what Richard suggested, I would open up Movie Maker, go to the <strong>
File</strong> menu (Alt+F) and look under <strong>Recent Projects</strong>.&nbsp; Place your mouse above one of the recent projects but just let the cursor hover there
<em>without</em> clicking.&nbsp; It should show you the full path where that specific .wlmp file is stored.&nbsp; It's probably pretty likely your other projects are in the same folder.&nbsp; Another way to figure out the folder you've been using is to try
<strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Open project</strong>.&nbsp; It will probably default to the place where you have been saving projects.&nbsp; Alternatively, try
<strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>Save project as</strong> and see if it shows you the folder you have been saving projects into.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last thing to try, if that doesn't work is to go to the <strong>Run</strong> box in the
<strong>Start</strong> menu (<strong>Windows</strong>&nbsp;key + <strong>R</strong>) and type *.wlmp and let it search for files with that extension.&nbsp; Remember that's
<strong>*.WLMP </strong>(as in <strong>W</strong>indows <strong>L</strong>ive <strong>
M</strong>oviemaker <strong>P</strong>roject), not '*.w<strong>i</strong>mp'</p>

<h2>            Download  &#34;Rise of the Tomb Raider&#34; on desktop, error message&#58; &#34;There is a problem, try again&#34; Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Few days ago I purchased "Rise of the Tomb Raider" from the store on my laptop due to an offer and yesterday, when I tried to download it on my desktop PC this message blocked me: "There is a problem, try again", but I've tried again for the whole day and
 nothing happened.</p>
<p>So I've tried to download it on may laptop, just to give it a try, and then the download started without any issue but on my other PC the problem it's still the same.</p>
<p>Can anyone help me, please?</p>

            Hi Axel, <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
I completely understand your concern and feel sorry for the inconvenience this has caused.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Before we proceed, I need more information to help you better:
<div>
<p><br />
1. Are you facing this issue on the Microsoft account or local account?<br />
2. Have you installed all the pending updates and driver updates on your system?<br />
3. Have you made any changes on your system, prior to this issue?</p>
<p>4. Do you have a wired net connection or a Wi-Fi net connection on the desktop?</p>
<div>&nbsp;<br />
I suggest you to sign out from the current user account, restart the PC and login to the either administrator account or the Microsoft account to check, if that helps.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Also, I suggest you to install any pending updates on the PC to check, if that helps.&nbsp; Updates are additions to software that can help prevent or fix problems, improve how your computer works, or enhance your computing experience.</div>
<div><br />
This issue occurs due to the corrupted Windows store components on your system. </div>

            <p>Hello!I'm facing this issue with the Microsoft account, I've already tried to look if there are any pending update but apperently there are none.</p>
<p>On the desktop computer I've made no changes cause I've just installed the OS and on the laptop I've only set a different location(when I purchased the game I've noticed that for some reason it was yet sei in ucraine, due to a precedent experiment I've done
 some time ago).</p>
<p>I've tried both wired and wireless connection but nothing seems to change so now I'm on wired configuration.</p>
<p>I've olso tried to download another app(a free one) and it goes and I tried right now to follow the istructions in the link you've passed me but nothing happened.</p>
<p>I'm wondering: if it's a problem of the store there is any way to disintall the store app and reinstall it(some time ago I've had a similar problem with the google play store on my phone and doing this i've solved the problem)</p>

<h2>            Typing quotation marks and apostrophe.</h2>
                    Hey, I've got an english-arranged keyboard and I have a tiny but bothering problem. While trying to type the quotation marks (shift + ') and then typing a vowel, the vowel gets a diaeresis on it (ë, ä, ï, ü, ö), also the vowels get an accent if I type
 " ' " --&gt; (á, é, í, ó, ú). So I wanted you to give me some advice about how could I solve this.
<div>Thank you.</div>
