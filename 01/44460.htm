            Hi Claudie,
<br />
<br />If you are referring to your Microsoft Account Devices on the Web page, you can only add Windows Devices, you cannot add devices like a Kindle . . .

    <title>Dell XPS 13 had to be restored to factory settings - caused by Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michielhumblet  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dell XPS 13 had to be restored to factory settings - caused by Windows 10 Fall Creators Update&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Last weekend, Windows Update installed the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update on my Dell XPS 13 9360 (Intel Core i7, 16 Gb RAM, 512 Gb SSD, Windows 10 Home 64-bit). The installation went smoothly and the laptop functioned normally after the installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, yesterday evening, when doing a routine restart of my laptop and not having made special changes to my machine since the installation of the Windows 10 Fall Creators Update, suddenly a blue screen appeared, and after the laptop restarted as a result
 of the first blue screen, a second blue screen appeared. I was unable to write down the error message in the first blue screen, but for the second blue screen it was "OS_BOOT_FAILURE".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then the Dell SupportAssist OS Recovery software took over, saying "a failure during system startup was detected". Then a hardware diagnostic was performed (ePSA), but no issues were found. In the next step however, three items (including, for as far as
 I remember, the partitioning (of my harddisk I assume) and registry) were checked, and all these tests returned failures. Then a window appeared in which SupportAssist said "We found urgent issues on your system that can only be fixed by restoring". In other
 words: I had to restore my laptop back to factory settings, whereby all installed programmes and personal files would be erased!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before the restore, SupportAssist said I could back up my personal files, but when trying to do so, I got the error message that back-up was unavailable because my OS was encrypted (?). Fortunately, I still had another back-up, but if I hadn't, that would
 be a serious issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I did not make any important changes to my system in the time window between the installation of the Fall Creators Update and the crash, I now wonder whether the blue screens and the system corruption which occurred are due to or somehow related to
 the Fall Creators Update itself. Did any other (Dell) users experience similar problems? Or is there knowledge about (alternative) causes of this problem?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know because I fear the problem could happen again once the Fall Creators Update is reinstalled on my laptop when it's pushed through Windows Update.</p>

<p>Hi Michiel,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OS_BOOT_FAILURE </strong>occurs when your system is unable to find your operating system or some system files that are required for your
<strong>PC</strong> to boot is either <strong>damaged, corrupted, missing,</strong> or
<strong>encrypted/blocked</strong>. Usually, this BSOD happens because of these factors:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong>SATA cables are either loose or disconnected-</strong><br />
This usually happens on desktops. When SATA cables are loose or disconnected from your hard drive, your PC will be unable to find your operating system, leading to either
<strong>OS_BOOT_FAILURE BSOD </strong>or <strong>I</strong><strong>NACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE</strong> error. If you're using a laptop, it could be incurred by instances like dropping your laptop.</li><li><strong>Bad sectors-</strong><br />
Bad sectors are data clusters on your hard disk that is unreadable. If your hard disk incurred a bad sector on a disk space where some important system files are stored, then
<strong>OS_BOOT_FAILURE BSOD</strong> or other<strong> BSOD</strong>s may occur on your PC and only resolvable by reinstalling your operating system.</li><li><strong>Dismounted system partition-</strong><br />
Some applications could dismount system partitions which could cause <strong>OS_BOOT_FAILURE BSOD</strong> or
<strong>INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE</strong> error. </li><li><strong>S.M.A.R.T. drive reporting is enabled</strong><br />
S.M.A.R.T (Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology) drive reporting is an outdated standard early warning system that detects hard disk issues. In some way, it sometimes causes OS_BOOT_FAILURE BSOD.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>So far, there are no other reported users who encountered this error after installing
<strong>Windows 10 Fall Creators Update</strong>. <strong>Windows Updates</strong> does not corrupt system images too. If an update fails to install, Windows will simply undo the updates as revert back to the previous version, and it will not corrupt any system
 files. So, it is safe to reinstall <strong>Windows 10 Fall Creators Update </strong>
as it is not the one that causes your previous issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you have more questions, feel free to ask.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>Thank you Allan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the factory reset yesterday evening, Windows Update installed the Fall Creators Update again. Unfortunately, the first time the laptop was restarted after the update (about 15 minutes after the update completed and Windows started for the first time
 with the update), blue screens appeared again and eventually Dell SupportAssist took over again as Windows failed to load.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time however, I aborted the diagnostics process and restarted the laptop again. Now the OS booted again normally... I went immediately to the Windows system logs and found the crash back as a "critical event". Below are the details of the event as reported
 in the Windows system log (English translations added by myself in []).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does this tell you anything about the cause of the crash? Dell SupportAssist reports more details on the critical event but I am unable to copy them here. I do have complete screenshots of the Dell SupportAssist output, so is it possible to send these screenshot
 somewhere to enable a more thorough analysis?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>Following my post yesterday, the issue described above seems to be structural. Whenever I restart my computer, a critical event occurs (so far fortunately not leading to a need for factory reset like the first time, but always running this risk when having
 to restart (e.g. after a new application was installed) is obviously not sustainable. However, when I power off the computer and then power it on (instead of restarting), no critical event occurs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For info, I am posting below the output from the Windows logs for the most recent critical event which occured tonight. It's almost identical to the output I posted above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anything that someone can tell me about why these crashes occur and what I can do to overcome the problem? Should I contact Dell as well?</p>

<p>Thank you for taking time translating the message in the event log. The event logs that you've provided means that you are encountering
<strong>Power Kernel 41 Error</strong>, also known as<strong> Kernel Event ID 41</strong>. This error usually happens because of
<strong>Kernel bugs</strong>,<strong> BIOS configuration</strong>, or <strong>hardware issue</strong>. Just to given you a heads up, we can try to troubleshoot this issue if it is caused by Windows itself. If it is caused by a hardware or a BIOS configuration,
 you may need to contact Dell support.</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you, I will check the suggested articles and the suggested actions in there tonight.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two pieces of extra information from yesterday evening:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>During another crash triggered by a (test) attempt to restart my computer, two blue screens appeared with the following descriptions: SYSTEM SERVICE EXCEPTION, and PAGE FAULT IN NONPAGED AREA.</li><li>In the Dell SupportAssist diagnosis of the crashes ("critical events"), it was reported that the crashes were probably caused by, in one case, a McAfee system file (McAfee LiveSafe is my Internet security software), and in another case, a file related to
 Devolo software that visualises and allows me to manage my Powerline devices in the house. I therefore deinstalled the Devolo software, and deinstalled and reinstalled the McAfee software. I will test tonight if this addressed the issue of the crashes or not.</li></ul>

</p><p>In any case, it is remarkable that the crashes, both before and after the forced factory reset, occurred as soon as Windows 10 Fall Creators Update was installed. I therefore continue to think that this update triggered or is at least related - perhaps in
 combination with other applications that experience compatibility issues - to the crashes I experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For info: my laptop is only 1.5 months old. The latest BIOS version recommended by Dell has been installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will keep you posted on further developments. Thank you for your help.</p>

<p>Update from tonight: I have restarted the laptop a couple of times, but no further crashes occurred. Perhaps uninstalling the Devolo software and un- and reinstalling the McAfee software solved the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nevertheless, I still followed up on your advice:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Troubleshooting the Kernel event ID 41: BugcheckCode 59 corresponds to error code 0x0000003B. I ran this code together with the search word "bugcheck" on the Microsoft Support website. This did not result however in usable articles/references.</li><li>Debugging Kernel: I installed the "WinDbg" app from the Microsoft Store and I tried to open the dump file under C:\WINDOWS\MEMORY.DMP as explained in the article under the second link above, but I get a message that I am not allowed to open the file and
 that I should contact the owner of the file or the system administrator. However, my laptop is private and I am the only owner.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>What do you suggest? Should I wait to see whether the crashes reoccur in the coming days or have indeed disappeared, or could you assist me with troubleshooting the Kernel event or debugging my PC to check whether the cause of the problem still exists or
 has disappeared? Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>Since you've issue is already resolved, just disregard the debugging method. The message which says that you are not allowed to open the file is set as that by default for security purposes. If you want to open that folder or if you want to debug that folder
 in case the issue recurs, hopefully not, you simply need to take ownership of it. You can take ownership of files and folders by following these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Browse the location of the file or folder that you want to have full access with.</li><li>Right-click it, and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Under the<strong> Security </strong>tab, click <strong>Advanced.</strong></li><li>Click <strong>Change</strong> beside <strong>TrustedInstaller</strong> and click<strong> Advanced</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Find Now</strong> on <strong>Select User</strong><strong>or Group
</strong>page.</li><li>Select your user account from the result and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Save the changes and exit the window.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Now, you'll need to grant full access to your account:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click the file or folder and select <strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Under the <strong>Security</strong> tab, click <strong>Advanced</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Add </strong>under the <strong>Permissions </strong>tab and click
<strong>Select a principal to add your user account</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Find Now </strong>on <strong>Select User or Group </strong>page.</li><li>Select your user account from the result and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Check<strong> Full control </strong>on <strong>Permission Entry</strong> and click
<strong>OK.</strong></li><li>Save the changes and exit the window.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>For now, just monitor your PC's behavior. If the issue did not recur after a week, it will not recur again.</p>

<p>I had a very similar issue after installing the Fall Creators Update on my&nbsp;Dell Inspiron 13 5379 last week. Initially, all seemed to be working fine, then it restarted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first error message was: "Operating system loader signature not found". Clicked through the troubleshooting, then also got to the SupportAssist OS Recovery and now can't Back Up as (I'm presuming) Windows 10 is encrypted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have the same issues with Partition Table, Boot files, and Windows Health all with 'An issue was detected" then "Repair failed".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd really prefer not to do a Factory Restore since I don't have a back up - is there any way to make one or otherwise fix the issue? Or am I stuffed?</p>

            I think you can avoid a factory reset by just exiting the Dell SupportAssist OS Recovery and rebooting your computer. I did this and eventually managed to get into Windows again. There you can check the logs in the Dell SupportAssist application. In my
 case, the logs referred to two applications which were allegedly the cause of the crashes. After deleting these applications, no more crashes occurred. Good luck!<br />

<p>Unfortunately I couldn't glean anything useful from the logs in Event Viewer, the only "Critical" Event Type was also a Kernal Power 41 one today when I was attempting to repair but that said it was due to a reboot without shutting down first, and no other
 Critical ones in the last 7 days (as far back as it seems I can search, and the initial crash was just before Christmas).</p>
<p>
</p><p>How I managed to get around this was as follows:</p>
<p>1) I found some further advice at&nbsp;http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/laptop/f/3518/t/20012460 by user "Mansoorpataudi" to *Add* a boot option in the Boot Sequence section in the Bios. Selecting File Name&nbsp;/EFI/BOOT/BOOTX64.EFI. This is different
 to the standard Windows Boot Manager File name of&nbsp;/EFI/Microsoft/Boot/bootmgfw.efi</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2) I then made this the only option ticked in the boot sequence., applied changes, and restarted</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) When booting with this Windows requested the recovery key that I could find by logging on to my Microsoft account and putting in long number string.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) All seemed to work okay, except of course I'm now using a different Boot manager option to log on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) I've spent enough time on this today but I'll see if I can get the original Windows Boot Manager to work again (I tried to change it back to the old one and all the original issues were there).</p>
<p>
</p><p>These EFI (Extensible Firmware Interface" files are stored in a separate partition and can't be accessed&nbsp;from, for example, File Explorer. At least now I can get back into Windows and make sure all my critical files are backed up to the cloud!</p>

            It created minidumps in 4 of the crashes. It generated the bigger memory dump file in the other crashes. I did not include the bigger file. Let me know if you need it. I created a copy of the last one that was created at around 9pm local time to make sure
 it will not be overwritten.<br />
Let me know if you also need the ms-info file.<br />
<br />
Thanks for you help!<br />

            I have had similar problems on a Dell Optiplex 745 I was working on. &nbsp;I had similar log file results. &nbsp;It is caused by the mwac.sys file within Malwarebytes conflicting with so called out of date drivers on the WiFi adapter, despite the WiFi adapter drivers
 been up to date in the device manager. &nbsp;I uninstalled Malwarebytes on this PC and found an alternative anti malware program and everything is now running fine now.

</p><p>I had another crash from which the system couldn't recover. I had to re-install windows 10 and in that process disconnected the wifi adapter and after that I didn't have anymore problems.</p>
<p>The customer support from malwarebytes has actually been quite communicative and tried to fix the issue (without success), so I will forward these findings to them, may be they can check what's going on with their software there.</p>

<p>For whatever reason, my 360 randomly restarts itself, some times two or three times in a row. It sits in one of the openings in my entertainment stands openings with nothing else that can cause it to overheat and has plenty of space to get air around it,
 so I don't know why its been doing this as of late. I don't know if anyone else out there is having this issue or has hear of anyone else having it. It happens both in-game and while on the dashboard. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

<p>there are many things that can cause your Xbox to do this, your Hardrive being one or your daashboard has a corrupted file in it or it could the resualt of an E73 Error. you can try taking out your Hardrive and playing a few games on your console to see
 if it does it again! if it does not then you rule its your HDD. if it does then try unplugging everything and pluging everything back in one by one making sure all connections are fitted properly Esp. your Power Brick! if that does not resolve the issue i
 suggest contacting Xbox Customer support at 1-800-4MY-XBOX about a possible Hardware Failure!</p>

<p>When I had this issue it was the fact that I turned display discovery on in the xbox system settings, check to see if you have that turned on, if you do, turn it off and the restarts should stop. My theory is that display discovery has a hiccup, and then
 the xbox thinks the inputs changed, forcing a restart.</p>

<h2>            Deleting files off of Vista that state you don&#39;t have permission</h2>
                    I am trying to install the Windows 7 upgrade, but a program was found during installation noting it is not compatible with Windows 7 and I had to stop the installation to delete the file.&nbsp; When I go into Control Panel to delete the program it states I
 don't have permission to delete it.&nbsp; I tried to delete the file from Windows Desktop and again it states I don't have permission.&nbsp; Other programs I have deleted havent' given me this problem.&nbsp; The particular program is Softex Omnipass which is a program that
 came with a fingerprint reader.&nbsp; I had installed it on my pc, but was not using it.&nbsp; Any help to get this blasted thing of my pc will be appreciated.

            First you can try to uninstall it (you should not try to delete it except as a last resort because that leaves pieces behind in the Windows directory and in the registry) using Revo at:
<a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/reviews/revo-uninstaller/revouninstaller.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.snapfiles.com/reviews/revo-uninstaller/revouninstaller.html</a>.&nbsp; This often uninstalls programs when the normal Vista Uninstall program fails to operate.<br />
<br />
It could also be a matter of permissions:<br />
<br />
<span>To see your permissions, right click the folder/file, click on properties, and check out the security tab.&nbsp; Check to see what permissions you have by clicking
 on your username (or user group).&nbsp; Here are&nbsp;the types of permissions you can have:
</span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-are-permissions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/What-are-permissions</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 You need to be an administrator or the&nbsp;owner to change permissions (and sometimes being an administrator or even an owner isn't enough - there are ways to block even them from access (though a smart administrator knows these ways and can get around them -
 but usually shouldn't because they were denied access usually for a very good reason).&nbsp; Here's how to change folder permissions in Vista:
</span><span><a href="http://www.online-tech-tips.com/windows-vista/set-file-folder-permissions-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.online-tech-tips.com/windows-vista/set-file-folder-permissions-vista/</span></span></a></span><span>.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
To fix this problem with the folders, take <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
ownership</span> of the folders or the drive (as an administrator) and give yourself full rights.&nbsp; Right click the folder/drive, click on properties, go to the security tab and click on Advanced and then click on the Owner tab.&nbsp; Click edit and then click the
 name of the person you want to give ownership to (you may need to add it if it isn't there - or it may be yourself). If you want it to apply to sub-folders and files within that folder/drive, then check the box for replace owner on sub-containers and objects
 and click OK.&nbsp; Back out and now there's a new owner for the folders/drive and files who can change permissions as needed.&nbsp; You can now change them from read-only (even if the main folder says they still are read only - you can have access yourself as the owner).&nbsp;
 You can keep them as read-only for other users and guests and even administrators (though they can take ownership themselves and gain access if they so desire and there really isn't much you can do to stop this except protect the folder with a password using
 a 3rd party product.&nbsp; Here's more information on taking ownership of a file or folder:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67717-take-ownership-file.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/67717-take-ownership-file.html</span></span></a></span><span>.</span><br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, then you may be able to delete the program files.&nbsp; <span>
Try using one of the following free products to delete the files.&nbsp; File Assassin <a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/fileassassin.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.malwarebytes.org/fileassassin.php</a>&nbsp;(with or without Force Delete: <a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2008/12/27/force-delete-cannot-delete-locked-or-in-used-files-or-folders-with-fileassassin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/System-Miscellaneous/Unlocker.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/System-Miscellaneous/Unlocker.shtml</a>.&nbsp; These programs often work when normal Vista delete functions fail to operate properly.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span>

<h2>            Netflix App has Disappeared</h2>
                    <p>Today I logged into my Xbox live account and noticed that Netflix had disappeared from the Home Screen. I went into app channels to see if I could open it up tat way and it is no longer listed as a app channel. I checked my Xbox to see if there were updates available and there were none. I had my wife sign into her account and did not see it listed in the app channels. I then restarted my Xbox and resigned into my account, still no Netflix. Has this app been removed or is there a fix to get it back?</p>

    <title>Restoring back to date before Windows Creator update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> donholmstrom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Restoring back to date before Windows Creator update</h2>
                    <p>Ever since my Windows 10 version was updated to 1703 (Creator update) my computer has been frequently crashing. It crashes up to several times per hour. I believe the Creator update date was performed on 6/16/17.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I create new restore points each Saturday morning following a full security system scan so I have a restore point a few days prior to that update. Can I successfully restore to a date before the Creator update or will that not be possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the update I have had two different service personnel conduct investigation/repair sessions. They both ran System Scan and it did not identify any drivers that were the cause. One of them recommended resetting Windows but there would be more than 50
 programs that require being reinstalled if I did that so I want to avoid it.</p>

<p>I would really recommend against using System Restore unless a last resort, because frequently it causes greater issues that would probably end up requiring you truly do a full factory reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do decide to try it anyway, I'd recommend making a full image backup ahead of time, so you can get back to "this exact point". &nbsp;In fact, I'd recommend making that your normal weekend practice instead of restore points. &nbsp;Image backups are fully complete
 backups, bit-for-bit, exactly what is on the drive. &nbsp;So they are much more reliable and exact, whereas a System Restore is more of a delta change for just a few key files, and isn't as guaranteed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That all being said, if you can give me the error code from the crash, I can try to help you end the frustration.</p>

<p>Shawn thank you for the information. </p>
<p>Two ways to go from here:</p>
<p>1) When the computer crashes is usually just BSOD and no code is shown. sometimes there is a screen that states it is gathering information. I poked around and found a way to open the image viewer but I have no idea of what information from there is useful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I do occasionally create system image backups using the System Image Backup link in the File History tab of the System Settings (Gear Symbol) in case I have a C: drive failure. I just checked and I have one from 5/27 which is after I installed my most
 recent programs but before the Windows Creator update on 6/16. The issue is, I just noticed the files that get created are automatically labeled&nbsp;</p>
<p>"WindowsImageBackup" so I don't know if it is a faithful copy of all contents of the C: drive or just the Windows OS.</p>

            Try this out for me.&nbsp; Open your Start menu and type "reliability" and open the "View reliability history" search result.&nbsp; It will show a recent timeline of failures (please don't be alarmed as there could be many listed, most of which are inconsequential
 or even normal).&nbsp; But look for the date of the most recent blue screen crash, and kindly copy the technical details to me to see.

<p>The Edge one probably didn't bring down the whole PC, but that ESU.exe (Garmin Updater Utility) is a kernel fault and I possibly the culprit.&nbsp; Could you do either of these for me?</p>

            Shawn, thank you again. I completed the uninstall of the Garmin program and next I'll reboot and then cross my fingers. I don't understand one thing though. This Quality view seems to be the key to finding crash problems. During the past week I've had
 maintenance personnel from Norton and Microsoft remotely log in to my computer to fix this and neither of them used this they both relied on the System scan and the event viewer to track problems. The Microsoft guy even suggested resetting Windows but I didn't
 want the hassle of reinstalling so many programs. Why is it that only you seem to know about this awesome tool?

<p>There's really dozens (maybe hundreds) of similar ways to do the same thing.&nbsp; Really this Reliability History and the Event Viewer are basically the same thing.&nbsp; This Reliability History tool actually reads the same logs and database as the event viewer,
 it just formats the results a little easier (the Reliability History tool was meant for more casual PC users, not for advanced technicians and administrators).&nbsp; But they really are basically two sides of the same coin.</p>

            I'm sorry but this last question is a general interest question. On the same day that I was upgraded to Windows Creator (and i'm not sorry I did it) I notice that more than a dozen applications, having nothing to do with Windows were either installed or
 updated. Things like Roxio, WD Smartware, Arcsoft, Videopad editor, Cannon, HP, ... were also updated. Does Microsoft dig up updates for applications that are installed on my computer as part of the Windows update to help prevent issues due to running outdated
 software because if that's true it is amazing. I have about 50 applications listed as updated on that date.

<p>Microsoft facilitates it but they don't really do it completely directly on behalf of those other companies.&nbsp; For programs that come from the Windows Store catalog for example, Microsoft runs the infrastructure that allows those companies to push down updates
 easily and efficiently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "old way" (which is still the most popular way right now but it's on the way out) is when your computer has a separate updater for every vendor.&nbsp; So every time you login, there's background work for things like the Adobe updater, Google updater, Apple
 and iTunes updaters, software checks from the computer manufacturer and dozens more -- all running simultaneously, all trying competing for resources and making the computer slow and sluggish.&nbsp; It's a big reason why a computer starts to feel slow over time,
 because all this junk starts piling up and running all the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The modern way is to use packages where the platform handles all the updates through a common infrastructure (in this case, the Store). &nbsp;So no matter how many programs you have, there's only 1 thing that handles the updates.</p>

<p>I'm sorry but after all of the effort my computer is still crashing multiple times per day, four time in the past 3 hours.</p>
<p>Over the past couple days I documented the error messages. Some of these messages were seen more than once and this is just the variety of messages:</p>
<p>-APC Index Mismatch</p>
<p>-System Service Exception</p>
<p>-IRQL Not Less or Equal</p>
<p>-Kernel Security Check Failure</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the past week I have tried to find any drivers that have not been updated and have updated a couple but no joy.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been unable to complete some of my work that requires continuous operation of the computer during long download sessions. If there is an interruption the download software is not smart enough to restart so an interruption would be extremely - extremely
 frustrating and require many hours to input the data and then check for errors&nbsp;manually
</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was another automatic update today so I'm not sure if the situation will become less a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm convinced that the problem is not directly Windows but I am sure it started after the Windows Creator update almost a month ago so there must still be some driver or app that is misbehaving with Creator. In the end that is not all that important because
 I just need a computer that I can count on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have a system image from a couple days prior to the Creator update and I'm to the point of strongly considering using the image restore to get me back to that point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice would be appreciated!!!</p>

            Try following one by one. Skip a step which you have already tried.
<br />
<br />A. Run Internet Connections / Network / Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooters
<br />Windows Key+I &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot &gt;
<br />1. Click Internet Connections &gt; Run the Troubleshooter
<br />2. Click Network adapters &gt; Run the Troubleshooter
<br />3. Click Hardware &amp; Devices &gt; Run the Troubleshooter
<br />
<br />B. Head to following Microsoft Help Link and execute the steps there
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/windows-10-fix-network-connection-issues" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10741/...</a>
<br />
<br />There are three other actions which you can undertake
<br />
<br />1. Restore from a system restore point to a point when things were working fine
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. If the issue has been caused due to recent Windows update - I would suggest that you uninstall the latest KB update  and hide it so that it doesn't install it automatically and wait for new update to come which will be installed automatically.
<br />
<br />To know which update got installed
<br />Windows Key+i to invoke Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Click View installed update history.  These KBs should be from the below list. Don't uninstall any other KB
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479</a>
<br />Make note of KB and uninstall and block it.
<br />
<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; Type: appwiz.cpl &gt; Enter &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Select the required updates, right click, uninstall.
<br />
<br />Block
<br />Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update
<br />Download the tool from below link
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide
<br />Click Next and follow on-screen directions
<br />
<br />3. Perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repair-install-windows-10-place-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repai...</a>

<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

            Hi Gilbert.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />To troubleshoot Windows 10 Mobile Hotspot not working, see here:
<br /> <a href="https://www.thewindowsclub.com/mobile-hotspot-not-working-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.thewindowsclub.com/mobile-hotspot-n...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service tag from sticker on PC.  Compare the latest drivers with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now. 
<br />
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h3> spaceeunicorn  say:</h3>
<h2>            G27 Wheel Support</h2>
                    
<p>Why is there no support for older Logitech wheels when the g29/g920 is fully compatible, since xbox one is based so much on windows 10, which supports the wheels, I don't understand why the Xbox One can't do the same? Is it some sneaky deal with Logitech
 so that players have to purchase the new wheel in order to use it on their console?</p>

<p>I can't understand where Microsoft is going with the Xbox One and there making a W10 universal app to work with other formats so why don't Microsoft add support for the best steering wheel to date the G27 if it works on a windows PC then it should work on
 the Xbox One. I hope Microsoft reads these comments your making a universal app so it can't be that hard to incorporate, There would probably see a massive rise in sales for the amount of people who still have the G27 steering wheel if I were phil spencer
 this would be my first priority.</p>

<p>It will never happen as Microsoft (xboxone) needs to authenticate any device connected to the xbox, the G27 (i have one too) doesn't have the authentication chip installed, so the G27 will never work on the xboxone, unless its routed through the standard
 controller</p>

</p><p>thank you for the quick response my operating system is set up to receive and install updates automatically. I did follow up your request to check for updates .</p>
<p>Windows update return "your device is up to date". The hard drive has always been a little finicky considering to upgrade to a newer external hard drive I'm still able to use this one and two other PCs.</p>
<p>P.S. forgot to mention that I'm using a wireless keyboard and mouse and I am able to<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;use USB drives.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h2>            Download Manager doesn&#39;t come up for Win 10</h2>
                    <p>I've tried multiple times on multiple days, but the download manager on Windows 10 only shows a "working" icon of a dot moving in a circle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've turned off my firewall and my antivirus.&nbsp; I've looked for mirror download sites.&nbsp; Nothing is helping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The exe file takes a suspiciously short time to load, but I'm downloading directly from Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last time this happened with a program, it was a faulty exe file from Adobe for Acrobat, and I was directed to a mirror site.</p>

            <p>I have re-downloaded repeatedly, and since I'm trying to do an install and it's stuck, there's nothing necessarily to delete, but I have anyway.&nbsp; I also tried downloading on IE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I presume it's an Installation Wizard that is attempting to open, but I have no idea.&nbsp; All it displays is the dot chasing its tail in a circle.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PRECISELY WHAT IS HAPPENING:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hit the Upgrade Now button.</p>
<p>I save GetWindows10-Web_Default_Attr.exe</p>
<p>It downloads in approx. 1 minute.</p>
<p>I run the exe.</p>
<p>A box opens labeled Get Windows 10 and displaying the dot.</p>
<p>I wait ten minutes and close the window.</p>
<p>I delete the exe program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I change or alter something or series of things and repeat:</p>
<p>&nbsp; IE</p>
<p>&nbsp; Antivirus and Firewall</p>
<p>&nbsp; Different save location</p>
<p>&nbsp; Opening from different location</p>
<p>&nbsp; Run instead of save</p>
<p>&nbsp; Closing all programs</p>
<p>&nbsp; Checking for background programs</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have plenty of disk space.&nbsp; I have all the drivers updated and recent disk scans reveal no issues.&nbsp; I have no idea of how to check my RAM, but it's adequate for everything else including some very large and boggy documents in Word, some very intricate
 work in GIMP, and streaming video on YouTube and any other site.</p>

            <p>My experience with this was similar to yours. &nbsp;The download manager would disappear, though, after about a half hour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that I had to be explicitly logged in as Administrator (or other account listed as an administrator) before it would work. &nbsp;Try using "Switch User" to log into an Administrator account and run the download manager from there. &nbsp;You can switch back
 to your normal login and do stuff while it is downloading.</p>

    <title>Win10 domain workstation, &#34;currently no power options - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeremy-k  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10 domain workstation, &#34;currently no power options available&#34;, tied to group security policy and remote desktop connection</h2>
                    <p>Hello Windows community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know there are many threads about the issue of the dreaded "There are currently no power options available." But I haven't found one that fixes my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Initial issue</strong>: Windows 10 Pro PC's, connected to a work domain (Windows Server 2012), get the "There are currently no power options available" message when trying to shutdown or restart the PC.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Action taken:</strong>&nbsp;Group Policy Editor &gt; Computer Configuration &gt; Windows Settings &gt; Security Settings &gt; Local Policies &gt; User Rights Assignment &gt; 'Shut down the system' ... The only way to add the user to the list of users for this policy, is
 to log on to the server itself, go into Group Policy Management Editor, delve into the domain controller, find the policy, and add the user there.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Result</strong>: After restarting the Win10 Pro workstation, the power options are now available from the start menu. Yay... HOWEVER...</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>New issue</strong>: If I use "remote desktop connection" on the workstation, and connect to the server, the user now has the permission to access restart and shutdown options from the start menu for the server itself... Which is not acceptable. We
 can't have people accidentally turning off the server through their remote desktop connection (which is used frequently, in order to access MYOB on the server).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>EDIT Question</strong>: How can I add "users" to this policy for only the workstations, and not when they are connected to the server through Remote Desktop Connection?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Additional&nbsp; information</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>EDIT:</strong> I noticed on <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc960201.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Technet">
Technet</a>, that the defaults for the policy is different depending on whether it is for "workstations and servers" or for "Domain Controllers". The "Workstations and servers" policy includes the group "users", whilst the "domain controllers" policy does not.&nbsp;</li><li>Windows 7 Pro PC's, connected to the domain in the exact same way, do not have the issue. All users on Windows 7 PC's are not added to the security policy, they CAN access shut down options for their local PC, but CANNOT access shutdown options for the
 server during a remote desktop connection. This means it is working as intended for Windows 7 Pro PC's.</li><li>The current list of users and groups that are listed in the security policy is as follows:
<ul>
<li>Administrators</li><li>Backup Operators</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for any help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Jeremy</p>

            Hi Manuel
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />Usually, this means you might need to update your BIOS, chipset driver, especially your display driver. 
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:

            Hi Manuel
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem. 
<br />
<br />If you are uploading Memory.dmp also, please upload it separately as the size of memory dump is very large.
<br />
<br />If you don't get minidump files in above folder, you will need to enable minidump generation. If you need help to generate Minidump - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help.

            Hi Manuel
<br />
<br />This is most likely caused y a corrupt or incompatible device driver, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

<br />
<br />I would also try bringing the system up to most recent release:
<br />
<br />Download the Media Creation Tool Now
<br /><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</a>

<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. If you don’t, review the following article for instructions how to upgrade to Windows 10 Anniversary Update on a system with limited space:
<br />
<br />Please note, you have the option of choosing what you would like to keep, which includes personal files, apps and settings.
<br />
<br />If you want to perform a new install or just keep your files click Change what to keep. Once you have chosen the desired options, click Install to begin.
<br />
<br />This will be your screen for a little while. During the installation, your computer will restart several times.
<br />
<br />After the first restart, Windows 10 setup will resume. You will notice the setup experience has once again been refined from the previous animated circle. This will be your screen for a while. When complete, Windows 10 setup will restart automatically.
<br />
<br />Sign into your account.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 completes application updates and post setup tasks.
<br />
<br />That’s it, the Windows 10 Feature Update is installed.You can check Windows Update for latest updates, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates.
<br />
<br />How to prepare your computer before upgrading?
<br />
<br />Although updating to Windows 10 version 1903 is a relatively simple process, similar to a repair upgrade; users should perform some basic pre-requisites before initiating the upgrade.
<br />
<br />If you are finding it difficult to carry out some of the steps described below, please review detailed instructions how to perform them:

<h2>            Windows Security Center will not start.</h2>
                    <p>Windows Security Center will not start. I am running Windows 7.</p>
<p>But first some background info. Recently my Google searches were being hijacked ie when I selected a search result I was taken to a site other than the one selected. In trying to resolve this I ran HijackThis but did nothing as a result (as I couldn't understand
 the report). Apart from my resident virus/malware software, Norton 360, I also ran scans using Kaspersky, Malwarebytes and ESET. ESET found the ponmocup.aa trojan but said it couldn't remove it. However the hijack problem was fixed.</p>
<p>Since then, my HP Action Center has advised me to start Windows Security Center but when I click on the fix button, I get a message that Windows Security Center cannot be started.</p>
<p>There is no entry for 'Security' in Control Panel. I checked services.msc and found Security Center was listed but was not started so I started it by clicking on 'Start' in Properties. It is listed as 'Automatic' but I can't remember if I had to change it
 from 'Manual' or not.</p>
<p>Windows Defender was also not started and was listed as 'Manual'. I have changed it to 'Automatic' but clicking on the 'Start' option in Properties gives a message saying words to the effect that it started and then stopped and that some services will stop
 if they are not being used by other programs or services.</p>
<p>Is it possible to recover Windows Security Center without hving to reinstall Windows?</p>
<p>I cannot use System Restore to roll back to a Restore Point as I found that System Restore was turned off. I find this surprising as I had not had a reason to check System Restore previously and I had assumed it would be turned on by default.</p>
<p>Thanks in anticipation.</p>

<p>Are you sure all malware was removed?</p>
<p><span><strong>T</strong>ry these “free” on demand scanners which will not interfere with your resident AV program -
</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>you might need to run them in Safe Mode or Safe Mode With Networking:</span></p>
<p><span>Go to </span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>www.malwarebytes.org</span></a><span> and download, install, update and run the free version – just follow the prompts. &nbsp;Select Download Free – at the end of the installation
 is a dialog with 3 check boxes:&nbsp; The first option is to Enable Free Trial of Malwarebytes Pro and you must uncheck the first option to install the free version without real time protection enabled.&nbsp;&nbsp; You may need to rename the installation file to 123.exe
 or something similar to prevent the malware from disabling/blocking the installation.&nbsp; Or you might want to download the installation file to a flash drive or CD and then install Malwarebytes on the infected computer.</span></span></p>
<p><b><span>And/or</span></b></p>
<p>Try Hitman Pro Trial Version: <a href="http://www.surfright.nl/en/hitmanpro" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span><span>http://www.surfright.nl/en/hitmanpro</span></span></a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
This program may be run from a flash drive.</p>
<p><b>And/or</b></p>

<div>&nbsp;One suggestion even resulted in a message that my operating system Windows 7 Ultimate 32 bit was not supported.</div>
<div>&nbsp;I live in Spain-my Windows is in English so local engineers are not able to assist completely.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;Can anyone help. I have a task bar little RED X saying -'Turn on' but it has never worked.</div>
<div>&nbsp;I have lost my disc.</div>
<div>&nbsp;The problem started after a lock-screen {Trojan &nbsp;[Ransomware] was resolved and my Microsoft Security full scans plus RegCure Pro and MalwareBytes all run with zero errors thus I see no effects-just the irritating Action Center &nbsp;X.</div>

            <p><strong>UPDATE: Persons are reporting issues with the Microsoft Software Recovery website not working, especially when selecting desired languages. Please use the alternative instructions available immediately below for obtaining install media.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>For the past 5 years Microsoft made it quite easy for users of the Windows 7 operating system to obtain reinstall media. If you lost your retail installation disc or recovery media; either it was damaged or faulty; you could download a copy of the edition
 you have a license for from an affiliate website named Digital River. Most recently, Microsoft ended availability of reinstall media which you could download as a .ISO file from Digital River, which is a digital replica of a optical disc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
Details
</p><div>
<p>This was especially handy for persons who could not easily obtain recovery media from the manufacturer, did not want to pay the cost required to obtain it or preferred a clean configuration without the manufacturers bundled software or even a non-functional
 recovery partition. It was easy to use, all you had to do was reinstall and reactivate using the product key located on the certificate of authenticity and download any appropriate drivers from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this option is no longer available, what are your options? In this article, we take a look at what users can do if they end up in a situation needing such media.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><strong>What to do if you cannot get recovery media from your manufacturer, refuse to use or purchase it or the Microsoft Software Recovery Website is not working?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Your next best option is to borrow the corresponding retail edition (upgrade or full version) or OEM System Builder disc from a friend or family member who has a Windows 7 disc. You can also borrow any of the following editions: Home Premium, Professional
 or Ultimate and create your own disc which will give you the option of selecting the desired edition you are licensed for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Identifying the edition - Windows 7 comes in many editions, you need to get the edition that corresponds with your product key. You can easily identify this according to the disc and labelling. Also note, you need to obtain the architecture you desire, so
 if you need 32 or 64 bit Windows 7, you need to specifically borrow that disc. See below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Retail</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/359de88d-6518-437d-8b45-b4f6e551678e" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the disc does not look like any of the above, these instructions will not work. If you are running editions of Windows 7 such as Starter and Home Basic, these instructions should also work. Keep in mind, Starter is only available in a 32 bit architecture,
 so a 32 bit disc will be required if you need to reinstall that particular edition.
</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2"><strong>Create a digital replica of the disc</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have obtained a copy of the disc, the first step is to turn it into a .ISO file. This will require you have access to a computer with a DVD drive. Follow the instructions in the following article to&nbsp;create a .ISO file:</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have a .ISO copy of the software, you can return the disc to your friend or family member and follow the instructions to create your own bootable copy:</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can then&nbsp;use the <a href="http://download.cnet.com/Windows-7-USB-DVD-Download-Tool/3000-18513_4-10972600.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/aba9ec7f-07cb-4b80-8679-879006757ad6" title="KenRaP">
<p>
</p><p><strong>Question 1: </strong><em>I'm confused on what pose to happen when&nbsp;I make a Skype call from laptop to laptop. First, is the number I'm calling suppose to ring on the phone?
</em><em>And if so, do I need to answer it to get Skype to work?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Answer: </strong>If you will call a number using Skype, yes, it will ring on their mobile device or landline depending on what number you are calling. Or if you will call another Skype account, the call will ring depending on the device that the
 recipient of the call is using.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong><em>Calling mobile and landline numbers require a calling subscription or Skype credits to cover the calls.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Question 2: </strong><em>If I'm using two laptops, does everything happen in the Skype window?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong> You can use Skype in multiple devices, if you are referring to Skype calls, you can only see the call window open on the device you have&nbsp;used to initiate or receive the call.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Question 3:</strong> <em>When I run the video test, I see me in&nbsp;window, but when making call&nbsp;the video button in&nbsp;Skype window has a slash through it. How to I get that to turn on?
</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Answer: </strong>Please be guided that you cannot initiate a video call to mobile or landline number. It is only possible if you are initiating Skype to Skype call. If so, you can enable the video by tapping the video icon.</p>
