<h2>            Magic Jigsaw Puzzles will not open.</h2>
                    Tried opening as usual. The game seems to begin&nbsp;opening but then shuts down. Tried to open Puzzle "Help" and it does the same thing. No pop-ups involved. Have been playing this for two years now. Also tried Microsoft Support but the site is ridiculously
 unhelpful.&nbsp;

<p>Hey Millie!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for bringing this issue to us and we are happy to help. The best course of action for the issue at hand would actually be to go to the
<a href="https://community.microsoftcasualgames.com/category/jigsaw/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Casual Games forums</a> since they would be better equipped to resolve said issue. Give it a shot and let us know how it goes!!<br />

            I wrote to Microsoft for the purpose of getting an actual answer from you, not to be passed off to yet another forum. I've checked so many questions and answers on this same subject. All questions are the same or very similar, and the ideas purported in
 the answers are basically the same also and do not work. There definitely is a problem with this game. You say the aforementioned forum would "be better equipped to resolve said issue."&nbsp; Even the answers from in one of the forums from two separate Microsoft
 people, an "MS Director" and a "Team Member" had opposing viewpoints. I would think that you as a Microsoft Agent would report this huge problem to the right people, making sure it's fixed. It's not something that we as users can deal with.

    <title>Missing messages, but not on all devices - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ash4man  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing messages, but not on all devices</h2>
                    <p>So lately I've started having this problem where my groupchat looks like they're talking about random crap without context. At first I just thought my friends were as weird as always, but then I noticed that there was clearly parts missing.</p>
<p>After looking into it a bit more, I found that the desktop app seemingly does not recieve all messages, whilst the phone app (android) gets most of em, and the outlook integrated skype gets seemingly all (as far as I know). Essentially there can be full
 days of conversations missing from both the android app and the desktop app, with some random thing said totally out of context - which is the only hint I get at looking up the conversation in the outlook-skype.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Google-fu showed very little in terms of this problem, as it seems people mostly have issues with sending and recieving messages (fulltime) and not this randomly missing segements of chat. And there's noone that is completely missing from the chat, as messages
 randomly not appearing on my end applies to all members in the group.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate any input on this matter!</p>

                    Or is it something else. It definitely was not the wonderwaffle or the vr-11 and from the video it looks like the gun either shrinks zombies down or turns them into monkeys.

<p>
</p><p>To resolve your issue with <strong>unmountable_boot_volume</strong> error, follow the troubleshooting steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, check the disk as errors could be causing the issue and could also compromise any repairs.
<ol>
<li>Open <strong>Command Prompt</strong> as administrator.</li><li>Type <strong>chkdsk /f /r</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>Y</strong> and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Reboot and let the check proceed.</li></ol>
</li><li>If your drive is running error free, let's scan the file system.
<ol>
<li>Open <strong>Command Prompt</strong> as administrator.</li><li>Type <strong>sfc /scnnow</strong>.</li><li>Let the process complete and follow the on-screen instructions should it find any errors.</li></ol>
</li><li>If the error still appears after these two steps, let's fix the master boot record.
<ol>
<li>Boot from your Windows 10 installation media.</li><li>Select <strong>Repair my computer</strong>, then <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Command Prompt</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>bootrec /RebuildBcd</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>bootrec /fixMbr</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>bootrec /fixboot</strong>.</li><li>Type <strong>Exit</strong>.</li></ol>

<p>Hi XGuarden2,<br />
<br />
I understand that you want to hide the Outlook app on your taskbar so that you can avoid issues when sending emails. For now, this is possible with the help of 3rd party apps. What I suggest is that you raise it to our developers by posting it on our
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/27932/windows-10-send-us-feedback" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Feedback Hub</a></strong>. They might consider including this option on the future updates. For your questions regarding Outlook app,
 I suggest that you post your concern on <strong><a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/outlook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Outlook forum</a></strong>. We have Outlook experts there that may help you with the configuration that you need in order to
 achieve your preferred setup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<p>I got no idea how post it on geedback hub. But I did't find any third party app that can solve this.</p>
<p>All of them make app disapear when minimized but not if he started already minimized.</p>
<p>One of them actually give this possibility but require to edit the shortcut to put the app.exe before the wantted app in parameter and it's imposible with remoteapp.</p>

<p>I totally agree that finding a 3rd party app that is able to do the task that you need is really difficult. That is because only few needs that kind of feature on their computer and is rarely required for a special function or task. To post a feedback, you

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Login screen features added to Windows 10 is for the security of the user profile which prevents other user from accessing your personal and sensitive information saved on the PC. Bypassing the security measures is not recommended for your own benefit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's try creating first a local user account with admin rights and attempt to delete the Outlook account from there. To Create a local user or administrator account in Windows 10, click this

<p>
</p><p>After creating a new user account, try ot delete the Outlook account by following the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press Windows key, click on Settings.</li><li><span>Click on <strong>Account</strong>, click on <strong>Family and other users</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Select the user you want to delete under <strong>Other users </strong>and click on

</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Note: </strong>When you want to delete a user account from your computer:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>You must be signed in as an <strong>administrator</strong> to be able to delete a user account.</span></p>
</li><li>

<p>I was able to delete the account.&nbsp; I thought I had made a new account <strong>
called meme</strong> the admin.</p>
<p>BUT after deleting outlook.com account I had no admin rights and no&nbsp; other user and meme was just a user.</p>
<p>I tried getting admin rights in safe mode and from the cmd prompt but was denied.</p>
<p>I had to sign back in with outlook but still could not gain admin access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plus I still had to log into window and I HATE logging in -so now I cannot delete accounts and I still have to Log In.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to do a recovery-- but I needed admin rights and the HOMEGROUP$. workgroup was unfamilar to me and not a part of my home network-- I tried everypasswor I have every used anywhere to no effect.</p>

<p>We appreciate the information you provided. The device you're trying to gain admin rights to, is it part of a domain or a server? Is the any other user on the device with admin rights? If yes, kindly ask for admin rights first before making any changes on
 it.</p>

<h3> edhelharn  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD dxkrnl.sys  atikmpag.sys 0x00000116</h2>
                    Hello all,<br />
<br />
I am getting an annoying BSOD 0x00000116. This started abouth one month ago, and it occurs randomly during games (especially frequently during Alan Wake), but only while loading a next level/chapter, etc. or during in-game videos.<br />
<br />
According to BlueScreenView, three .sys files can be suspected:<br />
<br />
http://kepfeltoltes.hu/121015/bsod_www.kepfeltoltes.hu_.jpg<br />
<br />
Firstly, I unistalled the old ATI driver (using Driver Sweeper) and installed the latest driver, but it did not work. Then I installed an older driver, namely AMD Catalyst 12.6 Beta Driver, and I did not get any BSODs for two weeks!<br />
&nbsp;<br />
However, this weekend I got BSODs again. This time I updated other drivers (e.g., audio drivers, USB drivers, etc.), and BSODs failed to come again. The games in question crashed, however, at the "usual" critical points, but without BSODs and restarting the
 system. (In the case of Alan Wake, I also got this error message: "Could not lock vertex buffer - Hardware device was removed".)<br />
<br />
But on Sunday, yesterday, BSODs came again, and now here I am, totally despairing. I hope someone can help me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here is my config and os:<br />
<br />
Asus P8P67 REV 3.1<br />
Intel Core i5-2500 3.30GHz<br />
Kingston 8192MB DDR3 1600MHz KIT<br />
ASUS ATi Radeon HD6950 2048MB<br />
Samsung 320GB + WD Ext 1.5TB<br />
Chieftec CTG-550-80P<br />
Asus Xonar DX/XD/A<br />
LG 23'' IPS231P-BN<br />
Windows 7 64 bit<br />
<br />
And the minidump file after the latest BSOD: <br />
<br />
www.parf-en-ereglass.hu/mix/101412-18564-01.dmp<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance!<br />
<br />
Edhelharn<br />
<br />
<br />
p.s. Sorry for my English, I hope I was not unintelligible.

            <b>We do need the actual DMP file as it contains the only record of the sequence of events leading up to the crash, what drivers were loaded, and what was responsible.<br />
</b><br />
You may be able to get the DMP files without crashing by booting into safe mode (F8) with networking.<br />
<br />
If you are overclocking stop.&nbsp; (chances are if you dont know if you are, you are not)<br />
<br />
To enable us to assist you with your computer's BSOD symptoms, upload the contents of your "\Windows\Minidump" folder.<br />
<br />
The procedure:<br />
<br />
* Copy the contents of \Windows\Minidump to another (temporary) location somewhere on your machine.<br />
* Zip up the copy.<br />
* Attach the ZIP archive to your post using the "paperclip" (file attachments) button.<br />
&nbsp;*Please upload them to a file sharing service like Skydrive or"Rapidshare" and put a link to them in your reply.<br />
<br />
<br />
To ensure minidumps are enabled:<br />
<br />
* Go to Start, in the Search Box type: sysdm.cpl, press Enter.<br />
* Under the Advanced tab, click on the Startup and Recovery Settings... button.<br />
* Ensure that Automatically restart is unchecked.<br />
* Under the Write Debugging Information header select Small memory dump (256 kB) in the dropdown box (the 256kb varies).<br />
* Ensure that the Small Dump Directory is listed as %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
* OK your way out.<br />
* Reboot if changes have been made.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please also run MSinfo32 and upload the output as well.<br />
<br />
To run MSinfo32 please go to start&gt;run&gt;MSinfo32<br />
Go to "file" "save" and upload the saved file with the DMPS<br />
(Instructions for XP, Vista, Win 7, Win 8)<br />
<br />
<br />
<b><br />
We really need the DMPS to be sure but your BCC116 is this</b><br />
<br />
"It's not a true crash, in the sense that the Blue Screen was initiated only because the combination of video driver and video hardware was being unresponsive, and not because of any synchronous processing exception".<br />
<br />
Since Vista, the "Timeout Detection and Recovery" (TDR) components of the OS video subsystem have been capable of doing some truly impressive things to try to recover from issues which would have caused earlier OS's like XP to crash.<br />
<br />
As a last resort, the TDR subsystem sends the video driver a "please restart yourself now!" command and waits a few seconds.<br />
<br />
If there's no response, the OS concludes that the video driver/hardware combo has truly collapsed in a heap, and it fires off that stop 0x116 BSOD.<br />
<br />
If playing with video driver versions hasn't helped, make sure the box is not overheating.<br />
<br />
Try removing a side panel and aiming a big mains fan straight at the motherboard and GPU.<br />
<br />
Run it like that for a few hours or days - long enough to ascertain whether cooler temperatures make a difference.<br />
<br />
If so, it might be as simple as dust buildup and subsequently inadequate cooling.<br />
<br />
I would download cpu-z and gpu-z (both free) and keep an eye on the video temps<br />

<h2>            Flashplayer, firefox and newest windows 10 update.</h2>
                    <p>I have problems to get flashplayer work with newest update from win10. I use firefox as a browser, but it dont matter at this point. I tried to update flashplayer, i used flashplayers uninstall tool , and downloaded newest version for firefox. Usually it
 has installed to pc as normal program and i can find it with search tool and get in to settings in there. But now&nbsp; i downloaded several times, but still cant find it whole pc... Can you help me on this, or should i just boot my previous win 10 version what
 works fine with flash?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you Marko Kojo</p>

            Can you confirm if you have the 32 or 64 bit version of Firefox installed?

Open Firefox, press Alt key on your keyboard then click Help &gt; About Firefox.

=====================================<br />
WLMP is not a movie file. It's the Project file which <br />
is only useful for re-editing in Live Movie Maker. And<br />
it cannot be played outside of Live Movie Maker.<br />
<br />
The .WLMP file is just a text file that records the <br />
path to all the source files and records the transitions,<br />
effects, etc... It does not include copies of the source <br />
files...(photos, video clips, audio clips).<br />
<br />
For sharing and playing in Windows Media Player <br />
save the file as a movie in the WMV format...the <br />
following link shows how: <br />

<h2>            When I BURN DVD&#47;CD they will play on my computer not on my MP3&#47;CD players.This has started 2 weeks ago. I have windows 10.</h2>
                    I have used Windows Media Player, Any Video Converter, CD Burner XP and WinX Video to burn the DVD/CDs, I use VLC media player. When I BURN DVD/CD they will play on my computer they will not play on my MP3/CD players. This has started 2 weeks ago. I have
 windows 10. I burn more CDs then DVD. When I burn a CD I use wav or wma format. I have replaced the DVD/CD Opticsl Drive with no change. Could it be caused by windows 10 update?

<br />
<br />If it is, right click it then uninstall each. 
<br />
<br />Try burning another disc again.
<br />
<br />If the problem perists, try burning at a lower speed, use a different brand CD.

<h2>            Failure to boot from Win 10 on SSD or from Recovery Thumb Drive &#40;Blue Stop Error &#38; Failed Troubleshooting&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the last day, I've been unable to boot to Windows, gotten a blue screen stop error, and tried to repair with recovery drive but failed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hoping to get help, though I am new to posting so might not know what I'm missing at first.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen this a few places on forums, and the large consensus is to reinstall windows using a recovery drive, but when I plug it in I don't see the same options/they don't work for me or I need guidance to go through, specifics below. I'm in a rabbit hole
 now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>First thing's first <strong>here are my stats</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I built my computer within the last 2 months with the following bits:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gigabyte LGA1151 Intel Z170 ATX DDR4 Motherboard GA-Z170X-Gaming 3</p>
<p>Intel Core i7 - 6700 Skylake Processor 3.4GHz 8.0 GT/s 8MB LGA 1151 CPU</p>
<p>512GB Intel SSD </p>
<p>32GB Ram plus </p>
<p>1TB WD SATA memory drive</p>
<p>EVGA Geforce GTX 1060 6G GDDR5 Graphics</p>
<p>Assorted Fans, Wireless adapter, Optical Drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 was originally installed from a friend's thumb drive on to the SSD, and I entered my product key in later down the line, which changed it from Pro to Home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I've been getting boot errors the last week</strong> saying to "insert the proper boot drive and press any key" after the Motherboard intro screen, and
<strong>have been able to fix by going in to BIOS</strong> and selecting the SSD (where Windows was originally installed) as primary option instead of the original thumb drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Yesterday I got a blue screen of death</strong> after working on the computer all day, and the QR Code led me to this page;</p>
<p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14238/windows-10-troubleshoot-blue-screen-errors</p>
<p>like this</p>
<p>https://www.howtogeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/xwindows-8-blue-screen-error.png.pagespeed.gp+jp+jw+pj+ws+js+rj+rp+rw+ri+cp+md.ic.yOWUS_rYGn.png</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think the code was Initialization or something, but honestly I should have taken a picture and now am kicking myself I didn't get back there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The screen did nothing, 0% info collected for 2 hours, so I manually rebooted, and now can't get to Windows at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I can enter BIOS</strong>, but now:</p>
<p>A) selecting the SSD with Windows doesn't work and goes into the "insert boot media" message</p>
<p>B) there's a UEFI option I hadn't seen before that takes me to another blue screen titled "Recovery" and says "your PC/Device needs to be repaired. The boot configuration data is missing or contains errors.
</p>
<p><strong>File \EFI\Microsoft\Boot\BCD </strong></p>
<p><strong>Error Code 0xc000000f</strong></p>
<p>You'll need to use recovery tools. If you don't have installation media, blah blah blah.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, so at this point I get I need to reinstall windows or at least go from the boot drive. &nbsp;I don't have my recovery drive made up with my own system settings yet and my laptop wouldn't recognize thumb drives with Media Creation Tool, so I made one using
 windows "Create Recovery Drive" on a friend's computer. &nbsp;I have another one in the process of writing with Rufus just in case.</p>
<p><strong>Note here:</strong> I did not check "keep system files" thinking that would be his personal files and now think I may need them.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">BOOT DRIVE MENU OPTIONS</span></strong></p>
<p>However, I try to come home and plug in the thumb drive and boot up, and I get into the UEFI Troubleshoot menu (if that's what it's called) which is also on the blue screen and has the following options:</p>
<p>-<strong>SYSTEM RESTORE</strong> - when I click this, I get the error saying "To use System Restore, you must specify which Windows Installation to restore. Restart, select an operating system, then select System Restore." &nbsp;I don't know where this selection
 would be made? &nbsp;</p>
<p>-<strong>SYSTEM IMAGE RECOVERY -</strong> this allows me to browse, but says Windows can't find a system image on the computer. I can navigate to "Install a driver" or get one from the network, but I'm lost as to where to proceed from this point without
 damaging further.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-<strong>STARTUP REPAIR</strong> - says it looks for errors and attempts repair, but then boots right back in to the blue screen menu.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-<strong>COMMAND PROMPT</strong> - I don't know enough about computers to use this effectively without guidance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>-<strong>GO BACK TO THE PREVIOUS BUILD</strong> - "We ran in to a problem and won't be able to take you back to the previous build. Try resetting yoru current build instead. Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC." &nbsp;I don't have the option on the menu to "Reset" unless
 it's the restore option.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>ANY HELP on how to navigate from here would be appreciated.&nbsp;</strong> I know i maybe shouldn't have turned off the blue error screen, but other internet posts said if this was happening for more than 2 hrs it probably wasn't doing what it should.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if there are things I haven't considered or options to toggle.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, what is the likelihood here that I'll lose data on the SSD (personal, not program data)? Not sure what options would lead me to having to format, and I would like to avoid that at all costs or at least rehabilitate and try to recover afterward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, </p>

<p>On the SSD note - I think it's a PCIe - is there a similar way to make this an external and save those files or am I out of luck?&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If I was in your position then I would set my priorities like so:</p>
<ol>
<li>Save my files to an external device.</li><li>Try to repair the machine.</li></ol>
<p>Since you appear to be able to get into the Console environment, saving your files should be fairly easy. Here you go:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect an external USB backup disk to the problem machine.</li><li>Use your bootable flash disk to get into Repair Mode / Command Prompt.</li><li>Find the drive letter with the&nbsp;<em>\Users</em>&nbsp;folder. I'll assume it is drive S: (as in Source). It cannot be drive X:.</li><li>Find your profile folder in S:\Users. I'll assume it is S:\Users\Jessica.</li><li>Find the external backup drive letter. I'll assume it is drive T: (as in Target).</li><li>Use these commands to back up your files:<br />
<em>robocopy &nbsp;"S:\Users\Jessica\Documents" &nbsp;T:\Robocopy\Documents &nbsp;/s &nbsp;/w:1 &nbsp;/r:1</em><br />
<em>robocopy &nbsp;"S:\Users\Jessica\Desktop" &nbsp;T:\Robocopy\Desktop &nbsp;/s &nbsp;/w:1 &nbsp;/r:1</em></li><li>Disconnect the backup disk.<br />
Connect it to some other machine.<br />
Check if its folder&nbsp;<em>Robocopy</em>&nbsp;contains your files.</li></ol>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am about of ideas then... other than to reinstall windows...</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as recovering data goes... There is a 3rd party bootable program called Parted Magic that has a Linux based "File Explorer" that can copy your files you want to recover.. Provided your old SSD isn't junk, of course...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It works similar to windows, but identifies the drives differently on the left of the screen...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you select a drive, the files and folders appear on the right in a manner you will recognize... You can then copy and paste what you want to save..</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will include a link to a older version... This was a free program, but the newer ones are paid... This is a ISO that when properly burned to a CD, is bootable... It can also be put on a Flash Drive, but requires another 3rd party tool to do so...</p>

    <title>How to Configure 4K displays with Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fototipper  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Configure 4K displays with Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought a 4K display for editing images and 4K video. Everything looks great except for two problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 - Even with the 150% text scaling, a lot of applications look either too small or the correct size but upscaled and fuzzy.</p>
<p>2 - I have my old DVi display set up as my second display but I don't want that to have the 150% text scaling because</p>
<p>now everything on that looks too big.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to apply different text scaling to each display output just like you can set different resolutions? It seems daft</p>
<p>to force both screens to have the same attributes when they have completely different resolutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I get a second graphics card for the old display, would I still see the same problem if I switch on the 150% text magnification</p>
<p>on the 4k displays card? It seems like this setting is global.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows allows you to use scaling to increase the size of text and other items on the screen. When you use scaling in this way, Windows magnifies the size of text and UI(User Interface) elements to the scale you choose. Each account on a computer has a separate
 setting for scaling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to try using steps provided in this article and check if it helps.</p>
<p>Refer:<br />

<h2>            Realtek Microphone not working</h2>
                    Neither of my microphone head sets work on Windows 8.1 when using Skype - originally the Realtek HD Audio worked on Windows 8.0 - I'm told that the driver is up to date. The headphones work but not the microphone. I understand that this is a common problem.
 What is the fix?

            I am having the same problem. My headset worked fine before the update and now it will not recognize that the device is plugged in. Unplugging the microphone cord does not cause a notification nor does plugging it in. This problem persists through all
 apps. In the recording devices before updating to windows 8.1 my headset would appear under "microphone plugged into rear panel"

            I have an MSI GT70 with the same sound card both windows 8 and 8.1 do not work properly with the mic. The issue is even worse on skype. I have tried the app and the desktop version. I have tried using multiple headsets (bluetooth, Razor Tiamat 7.1, normal
 Razor headphones...etc) This is getting very annoying. &nbsp;I updated to the latest drivers. I tried troubleshooting all with the same result "check if your mic is muted". Please fix this

            <p>I had the same problem, no microphone with skype. the permisisions were okay. the microphone didnot work anywhere else either. the sound recorder crashed while I tried to record and save something. right-clicked in empty space in the dialog below and I realized
 "stereo mix" device was disabled. I enabled it but still no microphone with Skype. I had changed the default microphone device in Skype to "microphone-realtek high definition audio" , which was the only option besides the "default microphone device". I changed
 it back to use the "default microphone device" and then finally it worked. the microphone works as it should now. but I don't know what that "stereo mix" device is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks for the help.</p>

<h2>            Where is my voicemail&#63;  Where is real support&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I PAY for a Skype number, I PAY for outgoing calls, I am not receiving voicemail.&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet, there is no real support for PAYING customers.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Microsoft is a BIG company.&nbsp; Why are they nickel and dime support?&nbsp; Why do I have to go to some bulletin board where someone may or may not decide to answer instead of an email address where actual people are assigned to assist PAYING customers.?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Does Microsoft really need to squeeze every penny out so that they don't really provide CUSTOMER SUPPORT?&nbsp;&nbsp; Where is the customer support?</p>
<p>Give me a break !</p>
<p>&nbsp;I pay money, I want service.&nbsp; That isn't really such a radical expectation.&nbsp; I have not had voicemail for about 2 months except for a couple of days 2 weeks ago.&nbsp; WHERE IS MY VOICEMAIL?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to the Skype Community Forum!</p>
<p>
</p><p>We apologize for the inconvenience. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If&nbsp;your voicemail has been enabled but it's not working, <a href="https://secure.skype.com/account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
sign in</a> to your account and, in the Manage features section, select&nbsp;<strong>Call forwarding</strong>. Check that the status is
<strong>Enabled</strong>. If it’s not, select the button to enable it. Next, try signing out of Skype and signing back in again: in the menu bar, click
<strong>Skype</strong> &gt; <strong>Sign Out</strong> (<strong>File</strong> &gt; <strong>
Sign out</strong> on a Mac), and then sign back in. Voice messaging should now be enabled. Make sure that you have the latest version of Skype.
<a href="http://www.skype.com/go/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download the latest version</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In&nbsp;addition,&nbsp;we’ve removed your outgoing voicemail message as custom greetings are no longer supported. Instead, Skype will use the default message for your app language. By the way,

    <title>What is the fix for Windows 10 inability to connect to any open public - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marcusmasters  say:</h3>
<h2>            What is the fix for Windows 10 inability to connect to any open public WiFi that has a click through page, such as those commonly found in libraries, coffee shops, universities etc.</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 will not connect to free open public wifi.&nbsp; I have no trouble getting it to communicate with any password restricted wifi.&nbsp; I have found this to be true in ALL situations of free open public Wifi.&nbsp; These places normally have some sort of click-through
 access page.&nbsp; For example, Westfield Malls, (common the globe over) My favourite coffee shop(s), and any library I've dared to drag it to.&nbsp; Cisco Meraki's "hardware/software" network access services are unfortunately ubiquitous.&nbsp; I read through their material
 extensively and here is what they had to say "Currently only the following authentication mechanisms are supported:<br />
User authentication: Active Directory (AD), RADIUS, or Meraki hosted authentication."&nbsp; They advised creating a VPN and jumping through various hoops which ultimately accomplished nothing, because there is no one on the back end who is going to set up a public
 "shared secret" on their radius server.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Allow me to be the first to say that Microsoft and Cisco Meraki are all just bollixing the world.&nbsp; Seriously, windows 7 has no such issues connecting to free open public wifi's ANYWHERE.&nbsp; But Windows 10 is completely useless.&nbsp; There is security, and then
 there is "stupidity".&nbsp; Yes, it is very secure when you can't connect the system. Trying to get a government ran agency to make their system Windows 10 accessible is about the same as trying to get Microsoft to make a product that actually works the first time.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft, with Windows 10 you not only have ONE MORE LEMON O/S, you are guaranteeing Windows 7 will enjoy the same longevity as Windows XP, because we all figured out that Windows 8 was a disaster, and windows 8.1 was a bandaid on a disaster.&nbsp; Vista....that
 was just a stain on humanity, right on the tail of the millennial edition on the tails of windows 98...yada yada yada.&nbsp; Windows 10 has oh so many more layers of nonsense built into it that the average user isn't aware of let alone capable of working around.&nbsp;
 The entire operating system is nothing more than a collection receptacle for everyone's every keystroke.....(including voice)....all for sale to the NSA no doubt.&nbsp; Microsoft's "brilliant ploy" to try and turn every user into a monthly service cash cow with
 SaaS is going to fail because let's face it....they've destroyed the economy and it's never going to recover until Armageddon is over.&nbsp; Most people are going to flee once they find out that half their software isn't going to work because they aren't going
 to know the work arounds for creating even more admin level accounts to install the stuff because Win 10 is so persnickety it won't even allow administrators to handle installs of ordinary stuff.&nbsp; Windows 10 pukes on every certificate it doesn't like, and
 that's pretty much everything. Everything that worked just fine on windows 7 is like walking through a mine field on Windows 10 just to get you up and working again, and there is no easy way to over-ride Microsoft's built in "WE SAID SO" bollix.&nbsp; It takes
 obscene amounts of time just to cull the system of the useless Microsoft apps and cut the ties with all the personal data windows 10 is set up to automatically forward to Microsoft, along with a love note complete with all your banking info, credit cards,
 personal letters and documents and everything else on your machine.&nbsp; I can't imagine the server farm and data collection warehouse necessary to hold all that rubbish from everyone everywhere.&nbsp; There is such a thing as "data overload" and I don't care what
 kind of equipment you have sorting it all, you're basically just nosy **** if build a system to auto-forward everyone's internet searches docs and everything etc. ad nauseum to Bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now all I care about is getting online, and since for me and my day that means I have to be able to get onto free open wifi's with click through pages.&nbsp; Yes, I have tried ALL the suggested solutions: for example numerous cmd prompts clearing - resetting
 - netsh - dns etc.....&nbsp; I've read endless hours of whitepapers that didn't address this specific issue, all that before I found Cisco Meraki's statement that "Windows 10 simply can't get on without certain back end adjustments to individual radius servers;
 adjustments NOT REQUIRED for Windows 7 access.&nbsp; Other such public open Wifi's have similar infrastructure behind them and even harder to contact IT personnel.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, MICROSOFT, building an OS that requires free open public Wifi essentially to set up passwords for users is just shortsighted and more of the rubbish the world has come to expect from Microsoft OS releases.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PEOPLE, THROW AWAY YOUR WINDOWS 10 AND JUST GO BACK TO WINDOWS 7, because if they haven't been able to fix this KNOWN ISSUE by now, I don't suppose they ever will.</p>

    <title>XP Mode in Windows 7 Pro will not update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            XP Mode in Windows 7 Pro will not update</h2>
                    Windows XP (XP Mode in Windows 7) will not download updates. SP3 is installed by default, but only IE6. Not a single update will download. I have allowed computers to run for 3 days solid and it claims it is downloading updates, but never downloads a thing
 ... stays at 0%. I don't know where to go anymore. This is on brand new Dell Inspiron 660 computers that claim compatibility for running the Virtual Machine and XP Mode, but no one can seem to offer any help.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried also to download the November 2013 Cumulative Security Patch from Microsoft (an .iso file that I burned to a DVD), but that doesn't help ... there are 4 folders on that DVD, each appear to contain files for all versions of windows, and the /ENU
 folder on each one has only 1 to 4 files in each so there are not near enough files (and only 1 small patch even installed ... the rest hang the XP Mode).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does Microsoft have a DVD I can download with everything from SP3 onward that I can just run the DVD and it does the rest? &nbsp;That would be helpful unless someone can tell me how to get these updates working.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you in advance.</div>

            Doesn't seem to be working ... IE8 is trying to download, but has been sitting there trying to do just the download for the past hour. &nbsp;Is there a complete IE8 file I can download on a different computer and transfer via USB drive to this new computer
 to install it?

            That <b>IS </b>the complete IE 8 file.&nbsp; It sounds as if your problems are more severe than not being able to run Windows Update from XP Mode.&nbsp; Can you download anything from anywhere -- either in XP Mode or in Windows 7 (not in XP Mode)?<br />
<br />
I did notice that the first link I gave you gives you an opportunity to add on a download of the December 2011 Cumulative Security Update for Internet Explorer 8 for Windows XP (KB2618444).&nbsp; I don't know if the November 2013 Cumulative Update (KB2888505) requires
 that the earlier update be installed first (I doubt it, but why not do it any way?).<br />

            Actually, I have no trouble downloading anything else both in Windows 7 mode as well as in Windows XP mode. In XP mode, I downloaded and installed Google Chrome and it worked just fine.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>As I said, this is a brand new computer and I've had other brand new ones in the past few weeks act the exact same way ... it just doesn't make any sense and is so frustrating.</div>

            I've run into the same problem as John and based on a Google Search this problem is not isolated but seems to have started a few months back. You should check yourself to be definitive. I have a clean install where everything works great except XP mode
 won't update. I uninstalled XP Mode and reinstalled it and same problem. have tried some of the other proposed remedies I've read and they either did not work or I read they won't be successful. Some say it's been intentionally crippled.&nbsp;

<div>If anyone finds a solution to this mess please post!</div>

All I can tell you is that XP Mode on my Win 7 box updates with no problem.&nbsp; Now, perhaps that's because I originally installed XP Mode about a year and a half ago and have kept it up to date since then ... and perhaps there's something else going on with the
 admittedly significant number of people who are reporting problems with XP Mode and Windows Update (actually, the problems seem to be wider than that:&nbsp; fresh installations of XP, virtual or not, seem to have problems with Windows Update..<br />
<br />
I can also tell you that I recently dusted off an XP machine that had been in storage since the beginning of the year (but kept up to date to that point), and Windows Update had very similar symptoms:&nbsp; endlessly looking for updates.&nbsp; I manually downloaded and
 installed last month's cumulative update for IE 8 and Windows Update began working the way it's supposed to.<br />
<br />
That's why I suggested to the OP that he manually download the installer for IE 8, install it, then manually download the November 2013 cumulative update, and install that.&nbsp; In response, the OP says that his system can't download IE 8 ... but can download anything
 else.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I have no answer for that:&nbsp; I just downloaded the IE 8 installer.&nbsp; I downloaded it in Windows 7, so I had to confirm that I didn't want IE 10 and I wanted IE 8 for XP, but other than that, no problems.<br />
<br />
Plainly, there is something going on with both the OP's system and yours ... but I sincerely doubt that anything has been intentionally crippled.<br />

<p>FWIW, I have just installed XP mode on a brand new Windows 7 system. Windows Updates would just cycle, seemingly interminably,&nbsp;whilst on IE6. Installed IE8 and let&nbsp;the installer&nbsp;get&nbsp;updates too and Windows Updates works just fine.</p>
