<h2>            Xbox One wont play any type of disc</h2>
                    
<p>My Xbox One wont play game discs or dvds. I have to put the disc in and take back out about 10 times before it will read the disc. How do I go about fixing the problem. Any help would be nice</p>

<p>I hate to say it, but it sounds like your optical drive is going bad. You need to call support and request a repair. Maybe an advanced exchange. Word of warning tho, keep records of who you talk to, what they told you, dates and times. Seems as if support
 is overwhelmed, understaffed, and probably not sufficiently trained. Over a month now to get my console replaced, first one they sent me wouldn't &nbsp;even turn on. Still not sure if they found the console they sent me ( that didn't work and I sent back). Also
 make copies of every piece of paper work ( return labels..ect..) that you receive from support. Will make it easier if there is a snag. Good luck.</p>

<p>thank you for your help with my windows 10 Nachappa.</p>
<p>I checked, &nbsp;I&nbsp;am the administrator of my PC, I entered the coding again and checked I had put it in correct and the reply was cannot find &nbsp;rd</p>
<p>I tried Windows Defender but it is not running on my PC, I assume it is because I&nbsp;am running &nbsp;Mc Afee real time, firewall on, updates current and subscription continuous with my BT internet&nbsp;. I checked and did a further complete scan and there was no problems.</p>
<p>I will find out how to take Mc Afee off and run Defender if you think it necessary. I am a silver surfer so have to look things up.</p>
<p>Hope you can help me with this and many thanks for what you have done so far.&nbsp; &nbsp;Jean</p>

            Windows sent updates through which cleared all of my problems, if you are still having problems with your recycle bin look for the updates on your computer. Jean

            <p>Hi again,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the inconvenience. I'd recommend performing a Refresh, which will reinstall Windows while keeping your personal files, settings and any apps that you've installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To do this:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, tap <b>Settings</b>, and then tap
<b>Change PC settings</b>. <br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, click
<b>Settings</b>, and then click <b>Change PC settings</b>.)</li><li>Tap or click <b>General</b>.</li><li>Under Refresh your PC without affecting your files, tap or click <b>Get started</b>.</li><li>Follow the on-screen instructions. </li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let me know if this helps and if you have any further questions. For any additional information on refreshing Surface, you can check out this

            <p>That's already quite clear. The Audio hardware on your computer does not meet the minimum Windows Movie Maker requirements.</p>
<p>Audio hardware here refers to the audio device (common examples are Realtek and Conexant High Definition Audio) in your computer and not the audio file which you want to add to the movie.</p>
<p>The audio drivers might be corrupted or have some problems.</p>
<p>Please tell the following details about your PC-</p>
<p>* Manufacturer/OEM (HP, Dell, Acer, Sony, MSI etc.)</p>
<p>* Product series and Model</p>
<p>The information could be helpful in finding out updated drivers for your audio device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also press Windows key + R, type devmgmt.msc and press Enter. Expand Sound, Video and game controllers and make sure your audio device is there. Also double-click your audio device, click the General. The device status should be 'This device is working properly'.
 If it reports any errors or problems please post the Device Status description here along with the Error code.</p>
<p>Also, you may try downloading and installing <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&amp;id=34" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Movie Maker Version 2.6</a>.</p>

            To know what exactly is causing the crashes, I need to analyze minidumps generated by crashes with WinDBG. WinDBG is the only tool which can do end to end complete analysis of ..dmp files generated by BSOD (Blue screen of death).
<br />
<br />Go to C:\Windows\Minidump 
<br />Zip the contents of the folder corresponding to date and time of your crashes. 
<br />Upload the content to Onedrive or any other file sharing site for me to locate the problem
<br />
<br />If you need help to generate Minidump - <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/blue-screen-of-death-bsod/1939df35-283f-4830-a4dd-e95ee5d8669d">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

            Hi Nathaniel, the event viewer is just reporting a DCOM error, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            Hi Nathaniel,
<br />
<br />The NETwew01.sys referenced in the crash would be a driver for an Intel wireless card so try updating the driver for this card if you have not already:

<p>Hello and thank you for the quick reply. I've done all you've said and the crashes thankfully stopped but I have one more problem. Programs like chrome and firefox seem to be crashing for no reason for me. I also have a weird event happening after every
 reboot:<br />
The driver \Driver\WudfRd failed to load for the device ROOT\WPD\0000.</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>The driver \Driver\WUDFRd failed to load for the device ACPI\PNP0A0A\2&amp;daba3ff&amp;3.</p>
<p>Could those 2 problems be related?</p>

<p>I've tried removing and re-installing the IMEI interface but the problem seems to persist at startup of the computer.</p>
<p>I've also tried using the system file check but I get the error:<br />

I seem to have crashed again but for a different reason.</p>

            <p>Hi everyone,</p>
<p>As it turns out, Microsoft has turned off this feature in IE9. There are two work-arounds I have used:</p>
<p>Use IE 8 functionality</p>
<p>1) From the IE <strong>Tools</strong> menu, click <strong>F12 Developer Tools.</strong></p>
<p>2)&nbsp;Click <strong>Browser Mode: IE9</strong> and now you can choose IE8</p>
<p>3) Now you can right-click like you did before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bing Desktop app</p>
<p>1) Use the Bing Desktop app, with "Make the daily homepage image your desktop background" checked.
</p>
<p>2) Then right-click the desktop, select <strong>Personalize, </strong>and click
<strong>Desktop Background </strong>in the lower left.</p>
<p>3) Control Panel will show you where the image is stored.&nbsp;I copy it to a new folder, rename it, reset my background there.&nbsp;Now I can use that image for as long as I like.</p>
<p>4) Be sure to&nbsp;uncheck the Bing Desktop app option.</p>
<p>Whenever I see a new&nbsp;image I like,&nbsp;I repeat. I have a number of saved images now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can always use Firefox.</p>

    <title>Error Code 800705B4 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kendre&#40;2&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error Code 800705B4</h2>
                    
<p>Okay, so, two questions:</p>
<p><br />
First and foremost, I had this problem like 18 months ago. Why in the name of all that is holy has this ridiculous problem not been patched or something yet?</p>
<p>Secondly, the last time I had this problem, I fixed it via deleting my profile, then clearing my cache twice, then restarting Xbox and redownloading my profile.</p>
<p><br />
So, specifics of the problem - I cannot access any functions of my Xbox whatsoever from my profile. When I attempt to log into said profile, it immediately requests that I sign in with my Username and Password. I do the normal overly-secure security measures,
 as per norm, and when it asks if I want to remember my password (it remembers that I want it remembered, but won't let me bypass this...) it goes into a ridiculously long loading circle, which then slaps me with the error. I cannot even back up my game saves
 or anything, because I can't access my profile to get the permissions to actually move my own saves. I have been effectively locked out of my own profile.</p>
<p>I don't think I'm alone in saying that this is an issue that should be a high priority. I pay for this service, cannot even use it, and if I have to delete 244GB worth of games and data, I will be disposing of this service and system. This is outright ridiculous
 that I'm being impeded by security measures to the point of being effectively banned.</p>

                    I brought a hp envy with intel 7&nbsp;and a hp surface RT (they both with different versions of windows 8)&nbsp;a couple weeks ago and yesterday both of them start to have audio problems where the envy one is not giving me any particular message to explain me why
 the audio is not coming out through the speakers or headsets and the surface is just telling me that the speakers are not plug in, but the speakers are (as you know) part of the surface.

            Obviously there is no way to save settings in one file like many smart programs provide. Although windows is not a new software on the market, it is not smart enough to provide a feature like this!!<br />

<h3> svstorm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Sync Toy on Windows 8 Question</h2>
                    Hi,,,,
<div>I have windows 8 and using File History as main back up. Seems to be working well.</div>
<div>I also would like some advise on the following; ,,,</div>
<div>I keep some my Doc folders copied on a usb so i can work with them at work ,, i then come home and sometimes have prob sorting which files are latest on usb and on home PC.</div>
<div>Is syncToy a viable option for me ,,, ???</div>
<div>ie:</div>
<div>Can i make changes to files and delete etc on usb ,,, and different changes on PC (same folders) ,,, and then use sync toys to sort it all out?</div>
<div>I can imagine that it would work well with 1way sync, but not sure going both ways when i have added/deleted etc on both locations?</div>
<div>i was previously using directory Opus for this, but only with one way sync ,,, one has to be careful changes were are made in one location.</div>
<div>I would prefer to stay Microsoft Based.</div>
<div>I dont have access to SkyDrive at work PC</div>
<div>Thanks for any Help/Advice</div>
                </div>

<p>Or just try it.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would think it sees new files no problem, but deletes on one... will become a new file to the other.&nbsp; It has a lot of options,, try it, its small.

            <p>The Surface 3 is like a regular PC, but the driver disk will be a problem since there is no DVD drive.&nbsp; However, at http://www.hp.com, you can download the full installation file for the printer.</p>

    <title>Had to reset my toshiba satellite and have lost bitlocker. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> douglasbrindle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Had to reset my toshiba satellite and have lost bitlocker.</h2>
                    <p>I had windows 8.0 running fine and dandy, then on an auto-update on Monday morning, things went south.&nbsp; I use bitlocker to encrypt the laptop(as required per my profession), and upon restarting, bitlocker accepted my password, but then required my bitlocker
 key. I entered the key and it was accepted,&nbsp;but the laptop failed to load windows. I then repeated this for 12 hours,&nbsp; trying auto repairs, restores and everything else I could get my hands on. Finally this morning, I had to reset the laptop back to factory
 settings(2 years&nbsp;of work related material lost, my fault for not backing it up), and now,&nbsp;my laptop no longer has bit locker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone could point me in the right direction, it would be greatly appreciated as I need to have this encryption software as a professional requirement.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Jessica,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to hear about this issue being experienced with your Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your email that was hacked was a third party email (Gmail, Yahoo, AOL, Etc.), then you would need to contact the support channels for those email domains.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your Microsoft account was hacked then you would need to contact official <a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Support </a>to get this issue resolved as we do not have the tools on the forums to assist you for this issue unfortunately since it's dealing with sensitive account information. If you cannot request a callback due to not being able to sign in to the

<p>Yes, for almost everyone, it would be best to have Windows and your installed programs on the SSD, and your data on the hard drive. But make sure the SSD is big enough. Personally for almost everyone I wouldn't recommend anything smaller than 100GB or so
 (mine is 120GB).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, it's where computers are going. In a few more years, hard drives will likely be gone, and all drives will be SSDs.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft .NET Framework 4 has not been installed because&#58; Fatal Error during installation</h2>
                    Hello, I've been trying to install Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 for about three hours now. Every time, it's told me that a fatal error has occurred and that it was not installed. First I tried through the downloader + installer. Next I tried to do it through
 a Windows Update. Finally, I tried to install it through the standalone installer. None of these have worked. Here is the link to the log for the standalone installer:<br />
<a href="http://pastebin.com/Zs9BjN9V" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://pastebin.com/Zs9BjN9V</a><br />
I've also tried Method 1 in this article: <br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/976982</a><br />
Which did not help me. Method 2 was not available for me because<strong> </strong>
Microsoft .NET Framework 4 Client Profile was not listed under programs that I could uninstall. If someone could help me out, that would be great. Thanks!<br />

    <title>How to install Epson Printers and Scanners Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to install Epson Printers and Scanners Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi folks:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had some difficulty getting my Epson Stylus Photo RX500 to work after upgrading to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The key issue was that the drivers weren't installing properly (they are supposed to, and do come with Windows 10).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Device Manager, the printer/scanner was showing up under other devices. &nbsp;When I would go into properties, &nbsp;I was seeing the error "<span style="color: rgba(42, 42, 42, 1)">Printer driver was not installed. Unable to find a core driver package
 that is required by the printer driver package</span>" trying to update the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried multiple avenues to reinstall the printers, and eventually settled on doing it manually through the printers dialog by choosing add a local printer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bd1210ab-a0b3-4a64-8024-b0a268ecb3d9" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I was then able to select the USB port...</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/76dc23ea-02e4-40b4-8e42-4970d347f331" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>And then get to the point to pick a driver. &nbsp;At this point, it's VERY important to pick "Windows Update". &nbsp;Apparently windows when upgraded did not have all the drivers for Epson listed. &nbsp;After I did it, the list of Epson printers filled right up. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5bcc576a-680b-4020-b072-345edc5c841d" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I'd seen the Epson Stylus Photo 500 in there, but I was presented with an option for 2 different drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/886f7a63-9a90-44f3-ab46-dd578687ef76" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I choose the higher version number and it worked!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now able to see/use the printer and scanner, and the Scanner shows up in "Fax and Scan" and I can use it in the Windows Scan app (download for free on the Windows store). &nbsp;The Epson Print and Scan app (from the Windows store) does NOT appear to work
 at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy Scanning and Printing!</p>
<p>

<h3> spaceman sublime  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#91;Windows 10&#93; IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL, SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION, &#40;PLUS MANY OTHERS, will update with others as they come, just cannot remember their exact wording&#41;</h2>
                    <p>So I have been getting these among other BSODs a lot and ive tried pretty much everything i can think of. The bsods can be as frequent as 2 minutes after login to 20 minutes to 2 hours to 20 hours. No specific action appears to trigger them, and more often
 than not the stopcodes do not call out any drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just cant find anything. In accordance to solutions that worked in the past, something that would work would be to install the base 1709 build. I don't know how to go about that. 1803 broke my system, rolling back fixed it. It forced itself again after
 about a month even though the trigger for the updater in services is set to manual, and guess what, it broke it. Rollback option was gone and recovery options kept failing, Microsoft support was able to roll me back to 1709 and everything started working right
 again. Then the 1709 cumulative update on 7/10/18 installed. The problem was reintroduced. Uninstalling this deemed impossible, even through an elevated command prompt. So now I'm stuck with a constantly bsoding system and I know that going back to a fresh
 install of 1709 would fix this. But how to do that? The media creation kit only allows 1803, and no staff will give me 1709.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the initial 1803 update a lot of the time it wouldn't even let me get to login and I'd be stuck in a "boot, bsod, boot" loop. Then it just kept doing the "boot, power off, boot" loop. I once even got a beepcode from my mobo it was so bad. At one point
 I also tried an in place upgrade to 1803 hoping that it was just bad files, but that didn't fix anything either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a mini dump file. I'm hoping someone can help me. I'm at the end of my rope here and have lost pretty much all hope.</p>

<p>
</p><p>BIOS are up to date</p>
<p>
</p><p>Drivers are up to date by the following means.<br />
1. Windows update</p>
<p>2. Device Manager</p>
<p>3. First party device updaters (geforce, etc) (clean reinstalls)</p>
<p>4. Drivers on mobo page (whether they are newer or older or the same) (clean reinstalls)</p>

<p>
</p><p>I decided to use the versions listed on the mobos support page rather than direct from maufacturer (intel chipset drivers, etc) because I kept bsoding with those, but nothing has changed with the mobo versions. I'm prob gonna just reupdate them to the newest
 since it doesn't seem to make a difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really hope somebody, official Microsoft or not, can help me out here. I have $3k of nearly useless equipment, and have been unable to eat or sleep. I've literally made myself sick with worry.</p>

            The crash was caused by memory corruption, probably caused by a driver.
<br />As no drivers were named, 
<br />Let us try finding any misbehaving driver
<br />Enable Driver Verifier: 
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/driver-verifier-tracking-down-a-mis-behaving/f5cb4faf-556b-4b6d-95b3-c48669e4c983">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />(Must create a Restore point before)
<br />Upload the newer dumps when you get Driver_Verifier_detected_voilation. 
<br />
<br />Please note that the system might crash before you reach the desktop-if it does please let us know so that we can guide you to disable Verifier.

<p>Update: So it has gotten even worse. An in place upgrade to 1803 didn't help and now its crashing 8/10 times before i can reach the desktop, and once im in the desktop, i get between 30 seconds to a minute before it bsods. I can't roll back and i bluescreen
 when i try to "reset this pc" or use the media i used to in place upgrade to repair this pc. i even bluescreen in safe mode!</p>
<p>
</p><p>im going to try and use my precious seconds to back up files in small chunks, and then use the windows 10 disc i have to clean reinstall. HOWEVER last time this happened and i tried this approach, it wouldnt let me delete the partitions on my ssd in the
 installer. I wont be able to try anything untill i get home late night tonight.<br />
