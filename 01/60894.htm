<h2>            Problems with Windows 8 after computer refresh and 117 updates</h2>
                    <p>Having problems with fan failing to run except when computer first turned on, causing my laptop to overheat, risking hard drive damage. Installing SpeedFan worked at first but then didn't. Since it was a relatively recent problem, and I was beginning to
 get other problems (app windows opening at the bottom of the taskbar instead of with the quick launch icon), I decided to try Windows Refresh for the first time ever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That was the first thing that didn't work right: Windows Refresh was advertised as merely resetting my computer to default settings, in the process of which some apps might be removed, but&nbsp;I would be provided a list of the removed apps on my desktop at the
 end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After Windows Refresh, I found all apps had been removed that weren't Windows apps. I did not expect for Office to be removed, but it was, along with my antimalware software and a whole bunch of other stuff.&nbsp;The promised list of removed apps did not materialize,
 except for a single app belonging to my laptop manufacturer. However, I was happy to note the fan now was working properly and kicking in fairly frequently, ensuring me my&nbsp;laptop innards were not frying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I found I had to reinstall 117 security updates. Again, not&nbsp;what I expected for a refresh rather than a reinstall. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I re-installed 117 security updates. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, all of a sudden the fan was no longer working. </p>
<p>
</p><p>And unexpectedly IE11 no longer was opening with last session. I did not change the setting but when I checked the setting had been changed. Evidently one of the 117 updates reset my IE11 settings to default without my knowing it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I now had notification errors I did not have prior to installing the 117 security updates: after installing the updates &amp; restarting, at log on&nbsp;I had a message&nbsp;that important updates were waiting to be&nbsp;installed. However, after completing log on and
 launching Windows Updates, the message was there were&nbsp;no updates waiting to be installed. I had Update check anyway, and lo and behold, I had 107 more security updates to install. So I selected to install, and after&nbsp;more than 15&nbsp;minutes, the status notification
 was telling me 0 bytes and 0 percent had been downloaded. Update appeared to be hung; however, I'd had this problem before with windows, and knew from that experience that the updates were probably actually downloading and may even be installing so I decided
 to wait it out when all of sudden the whole thing blue screened and crashed. Concerned about overheating, I decided to solve the fan problem before taxing my laptop any more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows updates have created problems I did not have before they were installed, the most troubling of which is the fan problem because my laptop is getting fried.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need the fan problem caused by the updates to be fixed before my electronics are damaged.

            <p><span><span>Hello NotRiley,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>As per the issue description, I understand that you were experiencing overheating issue on your computer and performed Reset. After reset the overheating issue disappeared until you installed 117 updates. Along with overheating other issues like
 Internet Explorer 11 not opening and notification errors returned.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I can understand the inconvenience that you have to face due to this issue. However, since now you are here, let’s work together to get this issue resolved with our combined efforts.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would appreciate if you can provide us the following information to help us understand the issue better.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Have you checked the update history? Do all 117 updates shows as successfully installed?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Do you have any security software currently installed on the computer?
</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>These problems may appear when Windows Updates are not properly installed or if installed not properly configured with the computer.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Sometimes due to third party security software posed conflict or dropping internet connection while Windows updates or other related circumstances Windows Update installation and configuration process gets interrupted, update history
 shows those updates to be installed but they are not installed properly and cause similar issues on the computer as explained above. Helping the computer in properly getting all the updates installed may help us in getting this issue resolved.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Let’s try these methods below and check if that helps. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>First, I would suggest you to follow these steps and run the Windows
<strong>System maintenance</strong> troubleshooter to get the problem automatically detected and fixed.</span></span></p>

</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>In the list of options, click on <strong>System maintenance</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click <strong>Next</strong> and follow the on-screen instructions.</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>Check with the issue and proceed with the next method if the issue persists.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To identify whether the overheating issues are caused by some drivers or any third party programs conflict, let’s start the computer in safe mode. If the issue does not appear in safe mode place the computer in clean boot state and check.</span></span></p>

            <p>Thanks very much for your thoughtful and thorough reply. Sorry not to have read this until now but in the meantime, the computer crashed, I was unable to get back in,&nbsp;and, after&nbsp;several days of frustration,&nbsp;ended up doing a complete PC reset, and now have
 the Windows Update problem. I just finished posting a question about that and then remembered I had another open question .
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't have time to read this very thoroughly right now (on my way out) but will do when I get back later today to try your suggestions. However, I did find the link you provide about Windows 8 safe mode is broken
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode.</a> I have never seen a Safe Mode boot option, and would like to know how to get there. For some reason the article on using scannow does not load properly - perhaps
 because I haven't been able to do the updating and it's a compatibility issue w/ IE. Also, when I search Windows 8 for scannow, it cannot not find it under apps, settings or files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will have to pursue this more later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE 01 25 2015:&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Yes, Update history showed all 117 + 107&nbsp;updates as having been successfully installed. However, I have now once again done a PC reset and then&nbsp;performed disc cliean up and defragging before downloading each set of updates in case something went awry
 in the update process due to memory being overtaxed,&nbsp;as the updates did&nbsp;take a very long time and I still had the fan problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I did have security software installed: Windows Defender and Malwarebytes. I uninstalled Malwarebytes and did find afterward that updates worked. Therefore, when I did the 2nd PC reset, I did not reinstall&nbsp;Malwarebytes. However, I have reinstalled McAfee
 AntirVirus, which is my usual security program, after the bulk of the updates had been installed since it had not proved to be an obstacle to updating before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. I have performed the System Maintenance routine and the result is that no updates or changes are required.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. The link to the clean reboot instructions is now functioning and I will try that after I have attempted to update in safe mode later today.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. It would still be helpful to me if you could give me instruction as to how to reset the fan in BIOS so it will come on more frequently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. I believe I already performed scannow but it could have been prior to the latest PC reset so I am performing that task now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will update this reply again after I have completed these last 3 tasks. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>UPDATE 01 26 2015</p>
<p>
</p><p>SAFE MODE ACTIONS</p>
<p>1. Windows update not permitted in Safe Mode. It never was in Windows 7 but I thought perhaps, given your recommendation, that had changed with Windows 8, but that is not the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Scannow found no integrity problems, but it did take a very long time - about 8 hours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Disk Cleaner found 61.9G of system queued error reports, which I'd never seen in any of the many disk cleaner scans I'd performed before.. I was very tempted to delete those but was not sure if that is a good idea, and hoped they would get sent while
 I was in safe mode. </p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Windows defragger would not function at all in safe mode, and it had been getting hung up in regular log on, so I ran a proprietary program's defrag, which I had been running regularly because of the problem with Windows' defragger.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. My proprietary program's disk cleaner also found over 31G of unnecessary files. I've been running their disk cleaner regularly in regular log on also, and it never found anything like that many unnecessary files before. I of course deleted all those files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. I also noticed that not once in the entire time I was in safe mode did the disk error notification pop up. But as soon as I logged back on in regular mode, that was the first thing I saw.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All this makes me wonder about malware or some unauthorized program causing my computer fan, update &amp; other problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Windows update still cannot update the same Windows .NET Framework 4.5 update that still gets hung up at the same 17% download point as before, even though I've run troubleshooter which claims to have once again fixed the Windows Update database problem
 with that specific update (80073712) and the Windows Update components which must be repaired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. My fan is still not running nearly frequently enough.</p>

</p><p>Possibly you're not able to open the Microsoft Knowledge Base articles link because currently the website is down due to maintenance, please try after some time you should be able to view the article contents fine.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Now since you have already reset Windows and have posted a new query for Windows Update issue, I am sure you will be able to get this issue resolved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>SCANNOW&nbsp;is not an app, hence it cannot be&nbsp;found under app search, it's a command that can be run&nbsp;in command prompt. You may refer the article above to run SFC Scan now command through command prompt.

            <p>Thanks for the new link. The new link works, and I think I'll have no trouble getting into safe mode later today. Thanks!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got so many issues now it's ridiculous, all of which appear to be generated by the installation of updates. Now Windows Update is not keeping track of my updates (shows no downloaded updates though I've downloaded at least 87), unable to install latest
 security update for .NET Framework 4.5 tho troubleshooter keeps finding and fixing what is apparently the same issue with Update (issue went away when I started to run a McAfee scan for 1 update but not for&nbsp;the remaining&nbsp;.NET Framework 4.5 update - error code
 80073712) and now IE 10 (why do I have IE10 when I previously had IE11??) is taking an exceedingly long time to add bookmarks to Favorites and/or Favorites Bar).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update was getting hung up downloading all 116 updates Update first presented to me following PC reset, so I decided to try breaking it up and&nbsp;downloaded the bottom 67 for starters. That was successful but I was shocked to see that instead of presenting
 me with the remaining 50, it only presented me with 20. I downloaded those, and then found 2 remaining - one a security update for Windows 8 64-bit systems, which eventually was successful, and one a security update for .NET Framework 4.5, which is the one
 above reported as failing. Previously when I did a Windows 8 refresh, I was presented with 117 updates, followed by an additional 107. I'm wondering what's happened to all those updates &amp; why Windows Update is not presenting them to me or showing them in update
 history.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been getting messages that Windows has detected an error on my hard drive (I'm all backed up) but also wondering if&nbsp;my security may be compromised. A former employer's IT team installed a program so I could access my office computer from my laptop.
 I uninstalled it but am not sure what else may have been hidden or remains on my PC. &nbsp;I did the PC reset to hopefully eliminate that possibility &amp; also&nbsp;see if the Windows hard drive message was correct. Unfortunately, Windows 8 seems to have taken control
 of my computer and I am unable to bring my PC back to factory state, so I can't be confident that I've undone any unauthorized or unintended changes to my computer that may be causing issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now just trying to keep things running until I can work through these issues and am prepared for likelihood I'll have to get a new hard drive. I still get the hard drive error message but much less frequently since PC reset (was getting it every 5 minutes),&nbsp;although
 the more updates and apps I add back, the more frequent the messages.&nbsp;My fan does seem to be running more or less normally today (just heard it cut on - something that only happened at start up before), which is a big relief. I just hope it holds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to find out how to change the BIOS setting for the fan, which I've seen some posts for on the internet but none of which explain how to get into the BIOS fan setting in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, this is just an update so you know I'm keeping on top of it. Will do the safe mode thing next and will get back to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for&nbsp; your help!</p>

            Can't you all just tell this guy is so wound up that he's in his own way. &nbsp;This stopped being about the solution a long time ago. &nbsp;The solution keeps trying to manifest itself, but he's not ready for it yet. &nbsp;He just wants to keep explaining how messed
 up everything is and by doing so he just keeps perpetuating that reality for himself. &nbsp;My favorite line was, "sorry i'm so late responding, and i don't have time to read all this stuff yet (on my way out) but when i get back i'll....." &nbsp;LOL gimmee a break...
 sorry to take up so much of your time dude, you're the one with the drama. &nbsp;So, hopefully you were able to calm down long and were able to stop complaining long enough for you to become aware that there is a very simple answer to all of this. &nbsp;In computer
 land, when things have gotten way out of wack to the point where the computer and you are not able to go on, you don't start hatching at the problems one by one. &nbsp;You will never ever fix a computer tha

            I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/</a>...
<br />
<br />You can also type Services in Start Search, open Services app, find Windows Update Service and turn it off to see if it relieves the problem.
<br />
<br />You can manually install WIndows Updates from here:  <a href="http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=windows%207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/sit...</a>
<br />
<br />What I would do if you haven't yet is manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by installing Media Creation Tool and choosing to Upgrade Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  
<br />
<br />This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have.    
<br />
<br />You can use the same tool to download the ISO or create bootable media so you only need to do it once, and have the bootable media for repairs or possible Clean Install.   
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during the Upgrade see these steps to optimize the install as this is evidence it's corrupted: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />You can also go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that a factory or Upgrade install are inferior installs that most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  Most prefer to do the gold standard Clean install from this link which has had no reported issues:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

<h2>            Screen resolution and colors messed up after returning from sleep, Latest AMD video drivers</h2>
                    Hello!<br />
<br />
recently, every-time i reboot by computer from sleep mode, the screen is completely messed up.<br />
<br />
the resolution is set to the lowest possible level for my monitor<br />
the colors and overall screen quality are perfectly messed up, similar to this picture<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
of course, its not exactly like that, I can still recognize with some effort where all the buttons are.<br />
restarting the computer fixes the issues, but i am wondering what is causing this?<br />
<br />
perhaps is my new power source? or the newly updated drivers? or the newly installed windows updates?<br />
<br />
i tried entering the catalyst control center while my screen is messed up, and it works, but i don't know how much indicative of a driver failure this is.<br />
there are also no events in the maintenance log.<br />
<br />
Any ideas what this could be and how to fix it?<br />
<br />
<br />

            hello,<br />
<br />
thank you for your response.<br />
<br />
The first method couldn't find anything wrong.<br />
<br />
the screen looks something like this:<br />
http://oi43.tinypic.com/16itj40.jpg<br />
<br />
<br />
as i mentioned, this problem only occurs when coming back from sleep.<br />
<br />
after further testing, it seems that forcing a "user account control" pop-up window also fixes the problem, without the need for a computer restart. So i am guessing this is a video driver problem or something.<br />
<br />
My drivers are already up to date. I will try roll backing them to see if this fixes the problem.<br />
<br />
rollbacking drivers fixed it:)<br />

    <title>DEFINITIVE Individual Hardware Change List for Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> willchan22  say:</h3>
<h2>            DEFINITIVE Individual Hardware Change List for Windows 10 Reactivation&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Alright, so here's what I'm dealing with: as a custom PC owner (one I built myself), I have hardware changes I'm planning to make. I haven't made the changes yet because I want to know DEFINITIVELY that I won't have to deal with the mountainous headache
 I know it can very easily be. I know that there's something about hardware activation (a stupid design btw). So here's my situation below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I DO NOT WANT TO WIPE MY DRIVE, "you must reinstall the old OS to install the new OS" is just plain dumb.</li><li>I upgraded from Windows 7 Ultimate to Windows 10 Pro at launch and no longer have my old product key (which is only even relevant for version 10586). Stupid of me to lose it, I'm aware of that. I do have a different Win7 Ultimate key available, which I'm
 told won't work for reactivation anyway since it's different from the key I originally used to install Win7 Ultimate before upgrading to Win10 Pro</li><li>I know for certain that changing out the motherboard or updating the BIOS will break activation status.</li><li>I have a new CPU and GPU ready for installation and extra storage (not OS drive) with NO OTHER HARDWARE CHANGES. This means I'm planning to change to a new GPU and a new CPU on the same socket, motherboard, and SSD OS drive as before.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>What I need to know with ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY is what <strong>EXACT </strong>components break Win10 activation status? And please, no one reply with "refer to this article....." because if it's an MS support article, it's going to say "motherboard" or "major
 hardware change" and nothing more specific, which makes it useless information. I'm also fully aware that this question has been posed before but haven't seen any concrete answers. Case in point, the 3 conflicting answers in the articles below, 1 MS Staff
 Forum Mod, 1 MS Staff Support Engineer, and 1 MS Insider.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-start/windows-10-no-genuine-after-hardware-change/d6dd12a1-3215-48a4-a0a7-b3ca8f4b2696">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-start/windows-10-no-genuine-after-hardware-change/d6dd12a1-3215-48a4-a0a7-b3ca8f4b2696</a>.
 This MS Insider says that storage, GPU, and RAM changes won't affect status, but anything else will. Granted, it's also not too clear of an answer simply because the OP included changing a motherboard which we know for a fact to break activation.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/do-hardware-changes-affect-my-windows-10/cdd58a7e-6dea-42ff-9869-07c7c4b11357">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/do-hardware-changes-affect-my-windows-10/cdd58a7e-6dea-42ff-9869-07c7c4b11357</a>.
 This MS Forum Mod is in basic consensus with the MS Insider above: storage, GPU, and RAM changes won't affect activation status. However, they also further list that motherboard (which we know about), TPM, and CPU changes will indeed
<strong>break </strong>activation status.</li></ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/if-computer-hardware-changes-will-the-windows-10/789cd5fe-d6ae-47c1-aa8f-1abac01f1a77">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-other_settings/if-computer-hardware-changes-will-the-windows-10/789cd5fe-d6ae-47c1-aa8f-1abac01f1a77</a>.
 This MS Support Engineer (Karthicka_R near the bottom of all replies not marked as "answer") says that changing ONLY the CPU won't break activation because the motherboard is not being changed.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I want to know what <strong>INDIVIDUAL PARTS </strong>break activation. So here's the summary I'm looking for in regards to breaking or not breaking Windows 10 activation status:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Motherboard: <strong>BREAKS </strong>activation, we know this, it's well-documented</li><li>SSD/HDD OS/storage drives: <strong>DOESN</strong><strong>'T</strong> break activation</li><li>RAM: <strong>DOESN'T</strong> break activation</li><li>GPU: <strong>????</strong> (above 3 articles indicate a GPU change doesn't break activation)</li><li>CPU: <strong>????</strong> (no consensus at all from above 3 articles, someone says it breaks activation, someone else says it won't, both are MS Staff)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In my particular situation, as is possible for others, my motherboard will be a constant. It is
<strong>NOT </strong>being changed nor is the BIOS being updated. The parts I intend to change are the CPU and the GPU only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for your help. I know that I come across as annoyed and the truth is that I AM quite annoyed. I never had to worry about activation status when changing out
<em>any</em> hardware component with past versions of Windows, I just had to make sure there were drivers available for that OS version. This new problem isn't only with the fact that
<strong><em>hardware </em></strong>changes can break your <em><strong>software</strong></em> activation, but also that it's not documented! The least one could do is say exactly what components cause the issue. So please, MS Community clear up the above list
 with absolute certainty; leave no ambiguities and no doubt as to what works and what doesn't. I would love for multiple MS Staff and Insiders to chime in. Answers from individuals help but I want to be certain that all the MS Staff and Insiders agree on what
 specific components break or don't break Win10 activation status. Again, thanks for your hard work! This has so far been the only major problem I've had with Win10, it is otherwise fantastic to use.</p>

            Wanting isn't getting.&nbsp; I don't think anyone except a handful of Microsoft employees know the answer and they're not going to turn up here and spill the beans.&nbsp; The fundamental reason you have to worry is that you lost your Windows 7 product key and you
 cannot blame Microsoft for that.&nbsp;

            <p>Well that was unfortunately unhelpful. I won't deny I'm an absolute idiot for losing that key (cuz I totally am, no question) and I don't blame MS for that in any way, but like I said, this is EXACTLY the sort of thing that should have documentation! "Here's
 your new Cuisinart. There are many pieces that you can customize and change out to fit your needs, just remember that changing out some of those parts may result in breaking your machine and we cannot help you with servicing. Have a nice day!" What parts can
 I change without breaking something???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plus, as indicated by the articles, obviously there seem to be people that have an idea of what can and cannot be changed without issues. The trick is to get them to agree and give an unquestionable answer. Honestly, with a company as large as Microsoft,
 I'd imagine more than a few people know how the authentication solution for the OS works. And as I demonstrated above, it's literally 5 lines to document what major components affect activation. I like MS and their products, wouldn't be using them if I didn't,
 but I hate to see them do a shoddy job, which is exactly what has happened in regards to this documentation. If activation hinges on hardware, then it's illogical to not document what exact hardware changes affect activation.</p>

            I'm sorry my reply was unhelpful but I doubt that you will get a helpful reply and you may need to reconcile yourself to that.&nbsp;&nbsp;I think the consensus view is that you can change anything and everything apart from the motherboard.&nbsp; But if the worst comes
 to the worst and you&nbsp;find otherwise&nbsp;you will&nbsp;have to buy a new copy of Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp; Console yourself with the knowledge that it will probably cost less than you paid for Windows 7 Ultimate.&nbsp;

            <p>First...make sure the format of the photos is <br />
compatible with the frame...JPG would be the best <br />
choice.<br />
<br />
I'm guessing the frame has an SD&nbsp;memory card?<br />
<br />
Do you have an internal or external&nbsp;media reader?<br />
<br />
If_Yes_try the following steps......<br />
<br />
Insert the SD Card in your media reader and go to...<br />
Start / Computer.<br />
<br />
The media reader should be recognized as one or <br />
more Removable Disks and each will have a drive <br />
letter.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
Removable Disk (F:)<br />
Removable Disk (G:)<br />
Removable Disk (H:)<br />
<br />
Left click each Removable Disk until you reveal the <br />
Root Directory of the SD Card.<br />
<br />
(If not....the frame (connected by USB) may be listed <br />
as a Removable Disk)<br />
<br />
OK...now that you know the drive letter...if you right <br />
click a selected group of photos or a complete folder <br />
you should be able to choose...Send to / Removable <br />
Disk (?:)...this should copy the photos to the SD Card.<br />
<br />
Be sure the photos are in&nbsp;one or more folders because <br />
the number of photos you can copy to the root directory <br />
will be very limited. And you will receive the following error:<br />
<br />
"Cannot copy XXXX: The directory or file cannot be created"</p>

                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I currently am running Windows 8.1 pro 32 bit on a self build but the new processor is x64 based. I know that I cant upgrade without doing a clean install which is no problem but I was wondering if anyone knows if I have to repay for a new OS? Or can I get
 a free 64 bit version seeing as I have already paid for Windows? Thanks in advance :)</p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have purchased Windows 8.1 kit from the Microsoft Store then that kit has both 32 bit and 64 bit disc. You can use the same product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a Windows 7 32 bit computer or Windows 8 32 computer bit you can download Windows 8.1 32 bit. If you need to download Windows 8.1 64 bit then you need to use a Windows 7 64 bit or Windows 8 64 bit computer.</p>

<h2>            My xbox live account</h2>
                    
<p>Hi I hope someone can help</p>
<p>I can't access my gold account.&nbsp;I think my gold account expired so I tried to put in my card details to update my account but it wouldn't accept it. It told me to go to xbox.com. I have logged onto my pc and gone into my xbox sign in. I signed in but it
 won't let me go to my account it says there is a glitch and won't let me do anything. I tried clicking on the support chat but it says it doesn't recognise the address (I clicked on it from the tab)</p>
<p>At the top of my screen it has my username and the link for my account is green along with the sign out link but the gold member link is grey. I need to get my gold account&nbsp;activated with the new payment but it won't let me.</p>
<p>please help</p>

<p>Sounds like you need to do one of two things. &nbsp;You can try fixing your billing suspension at billing.microsoft.com. &nbsp;If it's not letting you add a new payment option, it might be something wrong with the payment option. &nbsp;Does it have money on it? &nbsp;Is it
 activated? &nbsp;Are you sure you're using the right billing address? &nbsp;Basic stuff. &nbsp;If that's not working out, the other thing to try is calling Xbox Customer Support. &nbsp;Their billing team can add the payment option on there for you and charge your declined balance
 to it which should bring your Gold service back online.</p>

<p>I managed to change the payment option on my xbox I added a new card to it. But I am still faced with the same problem my billing address and everything else are all correct.
</p>
<p>I still don't understand why it won't let me access my account on my pc either.</p>
<p>Thank you for the quick reply</p>

<p>The account accepted your payment option, but it doesn't know that you want to use it for your suspended Gold subscription. &nbsp;Trying accessing Account Management on your console. &nbsp;Under "Your Memberships", select "Xbox LIVE Gold". &nbsp;Then choose "Change Payment
 Option". &nbsp;Select your good credit card, and that should fix it. &nbsp;Expect it to process the declined payment right away, and that should lift the suspension.</p>

<p>Thank you so much Klokkwork</p>
<p>I tried that and it worked great. I also read some of the other forums and found that they suspend your online live (pc)account too. Bit mad really could have had this sorted a couple of days ago otherwise!</p>

<p>Hi JaimeMcCormack,<br />
<br />
Based on the information you have provided, considering that the issue happened after installing an update, I suggest that you uninstall the problematic update. To do this, go to
<strong>Control Panel &gt; Programs &gt; Programs and Features</strong>. On the left pane, select
<strong>View installed updates</strong>. Right-click the problematic update and then select
<strong>Uninstall</strong>.<br />
<br />
If the issue persists, you can perform a System Restore to revert your system files to an earlier date. To do this, follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key</strong> + <strong>R</strong> on your keyboard.<br />
</li><li>On the run command box, type "<strong>RSTRUI.EXE</strong>" and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.<br />
</li><li>Follow the on-screen instructions to restore your system files to a date prior to the update.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Please be advised that programs and application installed after the system restore point will be removed.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions or things you'd like to clarify, feel free to ask.<br />

            <p>Hello Sir , </p>
<p>&nbsp;I we got the same error&nbsp; ,,&nbsp;and this is the step that I've tried on my own, First I Downloaded the Iso file of the windows 8 and used&nbsp; the&nbsp;
<strong>WINDOWS 7 USB/DVD DOWNLOAD TOOL&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/html/pbPage.Help_Win7_usbdvd_dwnTool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoftstore.com/store/msstore/html/pbPage.Help_Win7_usbdvd_dwnTool</a>&nbsp;,&nbsp; to burn&nbsp;into the a dvd which&nbsp;
 the dvd should have aleast 4gb of space ( you should use an empty dvd&nbsp;),&nbsp;&nbsp;after I've burned the ISO file , I went to services and restart the Background Inteligent transfer Services ( BITS ) , to go to the serivces
</p>
<p>1. click start type " services.msc " without quote</p>
<p>2. then look for&nbsp; the Background Inteligent transfer Services ( BITS ) then click on it
</p>
<p>3. On the left pane you will see&nbsp; stop and restart&nbsp; click on the restart and it will restart the serives
</p>
<p>4. restart your comptuer / and try running the setup from the disc</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks ,</p>
<p>see if it works on you</p>

            Hi
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp; I also have the same problem and tried using a boot USB flash drive without&nbsp;success, also tried disabling the antivirus program, however there is no way to install Windows 8 by upgrading the existing Windows 7 installation.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Keep getting the dead end road of "&nbsp;setup is unable to&nbsp;initialize&nbsp;the start-up folder " error message.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I am quite surprised&nbsp;Microsoft overlooked such a simple upgrade issue, which almost 90% of the users will be carrying out.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any suggestions how to get over this impasse ?&nbsp;</div>

            I actually managed to solve the problem for myself. What&nbsp;I&nbsp;did was I disabled the resident shield on my antivirus program and then&nbsp;I&nbsp;booted from&nbsp;DVD&nbsp;and it worked. At first I tried simply disabling the antivirus but that&nbsp;didn't&nbsp;work so&nbsp;I&nbsp;only disabled
 the resident shield of it and it worked.
<div><br />
<div>Try that and see if it works.</div>
<div><br />

            Had loads of problems with it and none of the solutions above worked, appreciate all your suggestions though.<br />
Spent 3 days with a&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;Answer Tech and finally got it installed, in my opinion it was well worth the wait and can't fault the help and time given by the answer techs.
<div>My opinion to all above who cant find a solution that works for them? Keep trying the answer techs, when you do eventually get through they get the job done. Even if it does take a bit of time.</div>

            I encountered this problem on two out of three computers I upgraded.&nbsp; I believe Avast antivirus was the problem.&nbsp; I upgraded Avast and rebooted the computer.&nbsp; This solved the problem.

    <title>Media Creation Tool_ Unable to select bootable USB option - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Media Creation Tool_ Unable to select bootable USB option</h2>
                    Hi,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I'm trying to move my windows 10 OS from one hard drive onto a new one that has more space. So I'm trying to create a bootable USB drive so I can reinstall windows on the new hard drive, however the media creation tool doesn't give me any options to create
 a bootable drive. After selecting the edition of windows I want, I click next, the media tool then preps the files it needs and then gives me an error message saying I don't have enough space on the (c:), which is where my OS is currently installed on.&nbsp;<br />
I'm not sure what's going on. Please help<br />
<br />
Thanks,&nbsp;<br />
Mike

            <p>This drive is generated by Windows 10 Update, think of it as a virtual drive used during the update as a swap location to store user files, update files . . . etc. it is nothing to worry about and should disappear all by itself in the near future.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should not try to do anything with it, it is managed by the Windows 10 system</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Hope this Answers your Question!</p>

<h2>            Printing Color Photos from Windows Photo Viewer come out in B&#38;W instead</h2>
                    I am having problems printing from Photo Viewer.&nbsp; The photos are in color, and appear in color when I select the paper, size etc....but they come out in black and white.&nbsp; I have an HP photosmart C4500 and checked a few weeks ago for new drivers but did
 not see anything.&nbsp; I have printed the same picture in color successfully from Word.&nbsp; The ink cartridges are new. I check and make sure the printer preferences &amp; settings are in color, not greyscale, and they are indeed in color.&nbsp; I have not printed in color
 successfully since having 7, though I don't know the cause. Both computer &amp; printer have definitely been restarted many times. &nbsp; I honestly don't know where to go next. Thanks in advance!

<h2>            Please stop saying Xbox 360.5 and PS3.5</h2>
                    
<p>I put this in another thread, but here is a brief guide to consoles. for those of you to young to remember most or any of them. There is by no means the whole set of consoles for each generation, but i have named the main ones for those eras.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Why does everyone keep saying that the ps3 is a ps3.5 and the X1 is a Xbox 360.5</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Quick history lesson for all you young gamers, who are not old enough to have been through many console gens.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>1st gen - Pong, pinball, binatone, Telstar</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>2nd Gen - Atari 2600, Intellivision, super vision</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>3rd Gen - Amstrad, Atari, C64 (not consoles, but they are there), NES, Master System</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>4th Gen - Neo Geo, Genesis (Megadrive), SNES,</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>5th Gen - Jaguar, CD32, N64, playstation, Saturn</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>6th Gen - Dreamcast, Gamecube, PS2, XBOX</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>7th Gen - Xbox 360, PS3, Wii</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>8th Gen - Xbox One, PS4, Wii U</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Can you see a common thing here, Oh yeah, nothing changes with games consoles, gamers want games, not gimmicks, The only thing that changes everytime, and i mean everytime, is the power of the machine and the media used. Get over it, True Gamers have got
 what they want, A new Next Gen, More powerful machine that plays games better, faster, crisper and with more depth. True Gamers buy consoles to play games on, not watch TV, or skype, or any other gimmicks that have nothing to do with gaming.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>When a new console generation arrives, the only thing i want to see, is better graphics, better music, better gameplay, better immersion, and better all round escapism from daily life, when i plunge into a game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>like some of you. I too am an "old ***" (within the world of gaming that is). I hate the way people are saying the Xbox One is just an upgraded 360, it's not f***ing Call Of Duty. As some educated people have highlighted, consoles grow over time. The Xbox
 360 of today is almost unrecognisable in all areas compared to the Xbox 360 of 2005.</p>

<h2>            Question on DVB-T2 &#40;digital TV in HD&#41; in Germany when using the digital TV receiver accessory</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>

<p>The digital TV receiver accessory sold by MS is supposed to support DVB-T2 (digital TV in HD) according to the packaging. But it's not so in Germany. I assume the Xbox just doesn't support the required H.265 codec which is different from the codec used in
 any other country for DVB-T2 (H.264).</p>

<p>I hoped that the anniversary update might bring the codec or whatever else is needed to receive the free to air HD channels but that was a wrong assumption as I know now after updating my console.</p>

<p>Please MS, post the status about this topic. We can live with any kind of answer but we want to hear it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

<h2>            Monitor, Mouse, Keyboard shut off during boot up, then about 10 minutes later Windows 10 loads</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 Pro from Windows 7 Ultimate. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anytime I restart the computer, right after the blue windows icon displays on a black screen, the monitor shuts off, the lights on the mouse and keyboard shut off. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then about 10 minutes later, the Windows chime can be heard and the login in screen appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought this was an issue coming from the upgrade from Windows 7 to 10, however I just a clean install and wiped out the entire hard drive and this issue is still happening.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I a high end set up with a i7 processor, SSD drive and GTX graphics card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No idea what the problem could be. &nbsp;Please let me know if you have any idea what could cause this problem.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We understand how you feel about the situation. We're sorry for the trouble.
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Please follow these steps and check if that works.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Run system in safe mode.</span></strong><span><br />
To run system in safer mode follow the steps below.<br />
a) Click on Windows key, and in the Power Options click on Restart while pressing the shift key.<br />
b) A blue screen will appear with a few options.<br />
c) Click on Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Settings &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart.<br />
d) Our system will automatically restart, press 4 or F4 key to go to the Safe Mode.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: If you are able run system in safe mode, try Clean Boot.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows
 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.<br />
Why software conflicts occur?<br />
When you start Windows by using a normal startup operation, several applications and services start automatically, and then run in the background. These programs include basic system processes, antivirus software, system utility applications, and other software
 that has been previously installed. These applications and services can cause software conflicts.<br />

    <title>Using the Esc key to return to the Start screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sad_panda  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using the Esc key to return to the Start screen</h2>
                    Is it possible to configure the Esc key to return to the Start/Home screen from a full-screen app in Windows 8? &nbsp;This seems to be the more natural choice to me - whenever I am in a full-screen app and want to return to the Home screen, I naturally go for
 the Esc key rather than the Windows key.

<p>Ctrl-Esc.&nbsp; Exactly the same as it has been since the&nbsp;Start Menu&nbsp;and Taskbar were invented.&nbsp; Think of the Start Screen as the Start Menu.&nbsp;&nbsp; But that would not close the MUF app.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you wanted to do that instead, same as ever, you could press Alt-F4 and
 then, depending on what else you had running and other options, you would leave that and switch to something else.</p>

<p>Is not just Esc. &nbsp;Windows -&gt; Ctrl-Esc is about the most awkward hand movement I can make. &nbsp;I'd really prefer just Esc.</p>
