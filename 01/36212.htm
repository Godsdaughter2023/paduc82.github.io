<h2>            security question won&#39;t accept answers</h2>
                    Hello- I'm trying to sign up for some affiliate programs, and of course they ask me the robot-proof security question: type the letters you see in the box. This I do, but they will not accept my answers- they just keep showing me different combinations
 of letters OVER AND OVER AND OVER. Very frustrating. As I say, this happens on more than one site. What do I need to do? Thank you in advance.

The letters in a box = <a href="http://www.captcha.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Captcha</a>. Anyway, what website?<br />
Is this related to hotmail or Windows Live™? <strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong><span>&nbsp;</span><br />

<p><span>No I don’t think that, I suggest you check the Caps Lock (CapsLk) on your<br />
keyboard, and check the keyboard language map settings. <br />
If they are correct, then I suggest you contact Google™ for your<br />
Google™ Account then. <br />
<br />
BTW, have you stored something in the Windows Vault?<br />

<h2>            April 19 Surface Book Update failure - Error 0x800f0203</h2>
                    <p>While applying today's updates, I received a Blue screen. After it restarted, it applied updates before continuing into Windows startup.</p>
<p>Went into Windows Update and clicked on Install for the remaining ones that were yet to be applied. Then I get this error:</p>
<p>* Intel Corporation driver update for Intel(R) Control Logic - Error - 0x800f0203</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked Retry, it says no updates available.</p>
<p>Click check for updates and again:</p>
<p>* Intel Corporation driver update for Intel(R) Control Logic - Error - 0x800f0203</p>
<p>Rebooted, still offering this driver and failing with same error.</p>

<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Open the setupapi.dev.log log file from c:\windows\inf.</li><li>Find the error "Failed to install device instance".</li><li>Above this error it will say which inf file caused the issue.

    <title>Howto export Windows Media Player 12 &#40;Win 7&#41; library to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> qlaras  say:</h3>
<h2>            Howto export Windows Media Player 12 &#40;Win 7&#41; library to text&#47;spreadsheet format&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Would like to find a way to export the full library listing of Windows Media Player 12, on a Windows 7 machine.&nbsp; (That way we can see what songs we do have, when we're at say a second-hand store - do I need that album, or do I have all those songs?)</p>
<p>Everything I've found on the web so far references back to either an old Windows XP Powertoy that was for a really old version of WMP - or for Vista with a link to the Msft support site that redirects to the front WMP support page.</p>
<p>If the library database itself isn't encrypted, if I can find that I could perhaps just pull the data from there and remove the unnecessary categories.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

            Are you referring to the Media Info Exporter powertoy in the&nbsp; <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/downloads/powertoys/wm_winterfun.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Winter Fun Pack 2003</a> ? That should still work with WMP 12. If you get an error messages about insufficient privileges while installing, then (temporarily) deleting the&nbsp;<strong>C:\Program Files\Windows Media Player\Icons</strong> folder should fix this,
 see&nbsp;<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistamedia/thread/adc55535-e1a5-42e7-9ea1-f93c6334b523" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">this thread</a> for more info.<br />

            Tried that. Seemed helpful at first, but indicated that this was primarily for Office support. Chat agent provided a phone number and link to another support department. Tried the link, but it didn't work. Haven't tried the phone number yet. Shouldn't
 need this amount of effort.

<p>Wenn du keine Garantie mehr hast, kannst du auch mal beim Gamestop schauen. Bei unserem bieten sie ne gebrauchte Slim 4g für 39€ an. Wenn du ne Slim 250GB hast, könntest du dann einfach deine Festplatte raus- und in die neue einbauen. Reparatur kostet glaub
 ich min. 90€ (wenn das noch aktuell ist).</p>

<h2>            Gamer Tags</h2>
                    
<p>Okay, I want to know how it is fair of Microsoft to charge us to change our Gamer Tag. Why should I pay 10 bucks to be called something different after having the same gamer tag for a year. How is that even fair? And I just renewed my 1 year subscription,
 so I should be able to change my freakin gamer tag for free. It is not okay to charge for something that small! It's just our account name!</p>

<p>It takes server space and processing power to change your gamer tag in all available online services. That costs money on Microsoft's part and with there being a price tag, the usage of this function is cut to 1/4th of what it would be used for which means
 FAR LESS chances for Live to crash because of all the name changes happening. I know a guy who runs a webcomic directory and the biggest gripe that he's had for the past 2 years was how resource intensive it is for him to add a delete function to forum posts.
 He said it had something to do with his database being crawled by several users at once and during the testing phase it crashed the entire site. In essence, a forum post being deleted would have the same effect on a database that a name change would. Relabeling
 and possibly breaking a script file that causes a butterfly effect.</p>
<p>I mean I could just be on a tangent here but there seems to be a lot of roadblocks keeping us from free gamer tag changes.</p>

<p>It was enjoyable, some different enemies, but the X-8 quests were repetitive, having to do the same thing 8 times, but all in all it was good, &nbsp;yes, used the new traits, swapped small frame and kamikaze for good natured and skilled, on one character, benefited
 some of my skills, bit hacked off about skill book recipes, spend points when leveling up on skills you don't need to!!! &nbsp;some skills you &nbsp;can increase 14 points just by taking the new traitsand the skill recipes,, &nbsp;got all skills at 100 apart from Explosives,
 thats 96, pity they didn't let you re-allocate all your skill points would have been good if they did, but I enjoyed it, did 1 run through with a guns character,low level unarmed /survival, then did hardcore with my unarmed/melee, energy character, that was
 hard work, but easier, as I knew what to look for and where to go, and what to expect, ie, X-13 stealth nightstalkers, lol, &nbsp;also you knew about the changes you could make, so you could plan ahead, the proton axe and the other one are great for a melee character,

<p>I enjoyed it to, although the main story was abit to short, content wise I think it was the biggest yet of all of the dlcs. I also don't like the skill book recipes....and how easy it is to have a maxed out character in this game now, if they increae the
 level cap again by 5 for the next DLC there will be no point of adding skill points unless they increase the skills from 100 to say 130.</p>
<p>I also didn't think the main quest line in it made any sense....Mobius is portrayed as the antagonist to start with, then it switches to Klein.</p>
<p>Overall though i enjoyed the challenge of the enemeis, and the exploration and back story within Big MT. 4/5</p>

<p>I'm going to have to do HH's one more time first. Pretty lame so far, I hope you folks are serious that OWB is better. I just can't seem to figure why they would release these so dang late. The ending is going to be the same no matter what. I've conquered
 the Dam 6 times now.</p>
<p>I failed nearly all the quests in Honest Hearts after 1 minute through the pass. The whole Caravan was wiped out in like 40 seconds or so. Does OWB play out that way?</p>

<p>The whole caravan will have to be wiped out then you can fire at the enemies... That's just the setting. I don't think you can save anyone from the caravan.</p>
<p>OWB is definitely better than HH, and much longer. I spent ~15 hrs with OWB, same with DM, but ~6 hrs with HH. DM is the best, for me.

<p>I thought it was pretty good, and I thought it had the most interesting dialogue by far. Seeing all of the appliance personalities come to life was humorous.</p>
<p>I thought the enemies were a little frustrating at times, because I choose to play Fallout for fun and relaxation rather than to take up a challenge.</p>

<p>The whole caravan will have to be wiped out then you can fire at the enemies... That's just the setting. I don't think you can save anyone from the caravan.</p>
<p>OWB is definitely better than HH, and much longer. I spent ~15 hrs with OWB, same with DM, but ~6 hrs with HH. DM is the best, for me.

<h2>            Indian guy calling saying he is calling from Microsoft Windows Service Center California</h2>
                    I am getting a call from indian speaking guy who says he works for microsoft Windows service centre at california mountainview. He is hinting that I have issues / virus on my computer and wants the technician to fix it by taking remote control. I refused
 and he is saying that he will be blocking my windows ID. Is this a scam or a real procedure of microsoft? I recently migrated to Windows 8.

            <p>Hi Ernst,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It is a SCAM!!! Microsoft does not do that nor do they have partners who do that nor do they hire sub-contractors or people or even get volunteers to do that. There are probably thousands of such companies out there doing this every day - we get two
 or three messages like this (or more) every day asking about it. You are the lucky ones who recognized the scam enough not to be sucked into it and end up with identify theft, infections, hacking of your computer, convincing you to buy software or services
 you either don't need or that don't really exist at all, and all sorts of nefarious tricks. You'd be surprised by how many contact us AFTER they realized they'd been suckered asking what to do. Do not waste time talking to these people, do not give them any
 personal information whatsoever, do not be tricked by what they may get you to see on the computer - in fact, don't do anything they suggest on your computer or even visit websites they recommend, and for heaven's sake don't give them access to your computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Microsoft knows this goes on but with these companies springing up like dandelions, or closing and changing names when discovered, and mostly operating in foreign countries, it would take an army of lawyers to pursue every one of them. They do the
 best they can, but there simply are too many and more get added every day. People have to be careful of these things. They not only occur by phone, but also by e-mail, instant messaging, regular mail and every way imaginable. Just remember that Microsoft does
 not do this and hang up or delete emails or messages or mail from anyone claiming they are doing this because they know information about your computer or want information from you to confirm your account so it won't be closed and ask you for your username
 and password and all sorts of other personal information. Microsoft DOES NOT DO THIS!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>See the following for additional information about this and what to do and how Microsoft operates:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I hope you didn't get caught by these scammers and saved yourself a big headache. Continue to use the same caution and you should do fine.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you got caught by these scammers (did any of the things they suggested and especially if you gave them access), I would also proceed as follows:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It was not a good idea to give them access to your computer or any personal information, but if they had access to your computer or you visited a website they suggested or downloaded anything intentionally or unintentionally from a website or email,
 they could have infected you or made changes (or installed a way to gain access at their convenience in a background download occurring while they were showing you things and installing who knows what). Plus if they installed fee-based products (as is often
 the case since they negotiate deals with such vendors to split the profits on such “sales” – in effect, a kickback), they may have removed other products and when the service is cancelled what they installed may also be cancelled. In some cases, this may be
 good. In others, it may leave you without security protection depending on what they did. So you need to make sure that you eventually have proper firewall and real-time AV protection installed (and remove any they installed unless you did a clean install
 or System Restore as will be suggested shortly – then just confirm things are back to normal and the security is enabled or re-installed).
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>See this article: </span><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/securitytipstalk/archive/2010/03/09/don-t-fall-for-phony-phone-tech-support.aspx?PageIndex=10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://blogs.msdn.com/b/securitytipstalk/archive/2010/03/09/don-t-fall-for-phony-phone-tech-support.aspx?PageIndex=10</span></a><span>.
 The article also includes links for things to do if you think you've been a victim of this type of scam and information about what Microsoft does and doesn't do so you won't be tricked again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Still, it doesn't hurt to be cautious. <b>I believe the safest thing to do at this point is to backup your data and do a clean install or a restore to factory conditions (however you are setup to start from scratch after doing a full format of the
 hard drive).</b> If you aren’t prepared for such a radical solution (even if it is the safest), please at least proceed as follows:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Do a System Restore to before the call and giving them access. That will hopefully remove anything they may have installed and undo any changes they might have made. Also change your password and security questions with your email provider, network,
 ISP and perhaps others listed below (which a System Restore won’t do – they’ll still be the same until you revise them). There’s no telling what they could have done while they had access to your computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Then to make sure you weren't infected,&nbsp;run a full scan with Windows Defender.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If&nbsp;you'd like some free options to be more sure&nbsp;(though they can take days or a week or so before getting a response and then more days going back and forth in a forum environment - and though the quality of help you get is generally good, the level
 of expertise of the person assigned to your case is pretty much the luck of the draw - but that's the "price" of free options), here are some free malware-removal forums:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>P.S. In the meantime, I'd contact the bank or credit card company and dispute the charge to try and get my money back (if you actually paid anything - otherwise skip ahead to the P.P.S). Canceling the card is not enough to remove prior transactions
 that were charged to it without disputing them – and there may be more than just this one company if they installed products that cost money that will separately charge you (or already have). That may be simpler than asking the company or companies for a refund
 - but if the banks can't help you at this point, then of course try to get the refund from the company or companies (and keep asking to talk to the person's manager until you get as high as you can) and tell them if they refuse you'll notify the authorities
 and the company that hosts their website and take legal action (even if we know you won't because it's too much of a hassle, they won't be certain).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>How far you want to go in terms of changing all your other passwords, pins, logon information, account information (including all your financial data if on the computer) and such is a decision you need to make for yourself. They are not all related
 to resolving the computer issues and your best bet outside of anything computer-related is to contact those companies or the local authorities and see what they advise (or seek out an attorney for advice).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</span><a href="http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx</span></a><span> This one is the "big gun" and while the best (like getting the BAU to take your case at the FBI), they really only focus on the major cases.
 I imagine enough complaints from enough people (or the right person or perhaps someone actually victimized or the company being misrepresented) about a particular company would make it a major case, but frankly don't know how they work or prioritize what they
 do. Still, since if they do get involved they can probably do the most to resolve the matter, I'd include them if I were harmed.</span></p>

            Hello Mary,
<br />
<br />If you purchased your computer or keyboard individually before Windows 8 (2012), your Windows key should look like this: <a href="https://tr2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/10/03/db1e0f76-eff2-4eff-b3bf-0d206e846bc0/thumbnail/770x578/a91aeac9b9eedcd512d06d4a56b93ea5/WindowsKey-.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tr2.cbsistatic.com/hub/i/r/2013/10/03/d...</a>
<br />
<br />If not, and your computer or keyboard was made at or after 2012, it should look like this: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/geek/gars/images/2/types/thumb_WindowsKey.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/geek/gars/images/2/ty...</a>
<br />
<br />If you do not see any of those emblems on the bottom right or bottom left of your keyboard, you don't have the Windows key and you should endeavor on getting a new keyboard.
<br />
<br />Hope this helps.       
        </p>

    <title>Activation by phone not working in Saudi Arabia - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dockkka  say:</h3>
<h2>            Activation by phone not working in Saudi Arabia</h2>
                    I bought a new laptop and I wish to install win7 on my new laptop from my old one.<br />
<br />
automatic activation does not work. so tried calling the activation by phone in order to speak to a customer support agent.<br />
<br />
Activation by phone is not working in Saudi Arabia properly. Each time I tried in the past 4 days, I can hear the customer support agent. but they cannot hear me. I tried from 3 different telephones.<br />
<br />
I do not speak the local language which is Arabic. So I always press for English and the call get routed to one of their overseas call centers. and none of those agents can hear my voice on their end.<br />
<br />

<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes the Developer did correct the connection issue between BLR and Steam. I had to add -log to the launch preferences for BLR in Steam.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd say the over all fix for this issue for me was:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Reinstall Win10</p>
<p>2) Reinstall 2010 Redistributables</p>
<p>3) Fully install all current updates</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fixed!</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Home OEM to Windows 10 Pro upgrade Volume licence</h2>
                    <p>I have a school that has purchased a laptop with Windows 10 Home Edition activated by a Digital Licence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>They wish to upgrade the laptop to Windows 10 Pro and have a valid Volume Licence MAK Key but the laptop will not accept it as valid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have re-installed the OS from the Windows 10 Pro ISO from the MSVLSC site, but it still shows as Windows 10 home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My understanding was that education establishments are allowed to do this.&nbsp; Please can you advise?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
All of the attached DMP files are of the <b>VIDEO_TDR_FAILURE (116)</b> bug check.<br />
<br />
<u><b>The basic definition of a 0x116 bugcheck is:</b></u><br />
<br />
<blockquote><br />
<i>There may be a bug in the video driver or video hardware.</i></blockquote>
So, let me now explain what VIDEO_TDR_ERROR means. First off, TDR is an acronym for
<i><b>'Timeout Detection and Recovery'</b></i>. Timeout Detection and Recovery was introduced in Vista and carried over to Windows 7. Rather than putting exactly what Timeout Detection and Recovery does exactly, I'll just directly quote the MSDN article!<br />
<br />
<blockquote><b>Timeout detection:</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>The GPU scheduler, which is part of the DirectX graphics kernel subsystem (<i>Dxgkrnl.sys</i>), detects that the GPU is taking more than the permitted amount of time to execute a particular task. The GPU scheduler then tries to
 preempt this particular task. The preempt operation has a "wait" timeout, which is the actual TDR timeout. This step is thus the timeout detection phase of the process. The default timeout period in Windows Vista and later operating systems is 2 seconds. If
 the GPU cannot complete or preempt the current task within the TDR timeout period, the operating system diagnoses that the GPU is frozen.
</i><br />
</blockquote>
<blockquote><i>To prevent timeout detection from occurring, hardware vendors should ensure that graphics operations (that is, DMA buffer completion) take no more than 2 seconds in end-user scenarios such as productivity and game play.
</i></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Preparation for recovery:</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>The operating system's GPU scheduler calls the display miniport driver's
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff559815%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<b>DxgkDdiResetFromTimeout</b></a> function to inform the driver that the operating system detected a timeout. The driver must then reinitialize itself and reset the GPU. In addition, the driver must stop accessing memory and should not access hardware. The
 operating system and the driver collect hardware and other state information that could be useful for post-mortem diagnosis.&nbsp;
</i></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Desktop recovery:</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>The operating system resets the appropriate state of the graphics stack. The video memory manager, which is also part of
<i>Dxgkrnl.sys</i>, purges all allocations from video memory. The display miniport driver resets the GPU hardware state. The graphics stack takes the final actions and restores the desktop to the responsive state. As previously mentioned, some legacy DirectX
 applications might render just black at the end of this recovery, which requires the end user to restart these applications. Well-written DirectX 9Ex and DirectX 10 and later applications that handle Device Remove technology continue to work correctly. An
 application must release and then recreate its Direct3D device and all of the device's objects. For more information about how DirectX applications recover, see the Windows SDK.
</i></blockquote>
<blockquote>&nbsp;<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff570087%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Article here.
</a></blockquote>
<br />
With this being said, if Timeout Detection and Recovery fails to recover the display driver, it will then shoot the 0x116 bugcheck. There are many different things that can cause a 0x116, which I will explain below:<br />
<br />
<b><i>(Ensure you have the latest video card drivers. If you are already on the latest video card drivers, uninstall and install a version or a few versions behind the latest to ensure it's not a latest driver only issue. If you have already experimented with
 the latest video card driver and many previous versions, please give the beta driver for your card a try.)</i></b><br />
<br />
<u><b>The following hardware issues can cause a TDR event:</b></u><br />
<br />
<b>1.</b> Unstable overclock (CPU, GPU, etc). Revert all and any overclocks to stock settings.
<br />
<br />
<b>2.</b> Bad sector in memory resulting in corrupt data being communicated between the GPU and the system (video memory otherwise known as VRAM or physical memory otherwise known as RAM).<br />
<br />
<b>GPU testing:</b> Furmark, run for ~15 minutes and watch temperatures to ensure there's no overheating and watch for artifacts.<br />
<br />
<b>RAM testing:</b> Memtest - Refer to the below:<br />
<br />
<span><u><b>Memtest:</b></u></span><br />
<br />
Memtest86+:<br />
<br />
<b>Download Memtest86+ here:</b><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.memtest.org/</a><br />
<br />
<b>Which should I download?</b><br />
<br />
You can either download the pre-compiled ISO that you would burn to a CD and then boot from the CD, or you can download the auto-installer for the USB key. What this will do is format your USB drive, make it a bootable device, and then install the necessary
 files. Both do the same job, it's just up to you which you choose, or which you have available (whether it's CD or USB).<br />
<br />
<b>How Memtest works:</b><br />
<br />
Memtest86 writes a series of test patterns to most memory addresses, reads back the data written, and compares it for errors.<br />
<br />
The default pass does 9 different tests, varying in access patterns and test data. A tenth test, bit fade, is selectable from the menu. It writes all memory with zeroes, then sleeps for 90 minutes before checking to see if bits have changed (perhaps because
 of refresh problems). This is repeated with all ones for a total time of 3 hours per pass.<br />
<br />
Many chipsets can report RAM speeds and timings via SPD (Serial Presence Detect) or EPP (Enhanced Performance Profiles), and some even support changing the expected memory speed. If the expected memory speed is overclocked, Memtest86 can test that memory performance
 is error-free with these faster settings.<br />
<br />
Some hardware is able to report the "PAT status" (PAT: enabled or PAT: disabled). This is a reference to Intel Performance acceleration technology; there may be BIOS settings which affect this aspect of memory timing.<br />
<br />
This information, if available to the program, can be displayed via a menu option.<br />
<br />
Any other questions, they can most likely be answered by reading this great guide here:<br />

<br />
<b>3.</b> Corrupt hard drive or Windows install / OS install resulting in corruption to the registry or page file.<br />
<br />

<br />
You can run it via Windows or DOS. Do note that the only difference is simply the environment you're running it in. In Windows, if you are having what you believe to be device driver related issues that may cause conflicts or false positive, it may be a wise
 decision to choose the most minimal testing environment (DOS).<br />
<br />
Run all tests EXCEPT: Fix All, Long Generic, and anything Advanced.<br />
<br />
<b>To reset your page file, follow the instructions below:</b><br />
<br />
<b>a )</b> Go to Start...Run...and type in "sysdm.cpl" (without the quotes) and press Enter.<br />
<br />
- Then click on the Advanced tab,<br />
- Then on the Performance Settings Button,<br />
- Then on the next Advanced tab,<br />
- Then on the Virtual Memory Change button.<br />
<br />
<b>b )</b> In this window, note down the current settings for your pagefile (so you can restore them later on).<br />
<br />
-Then click on the "No paging file" radio button, and<br />
<br />
- then on the "Set" button. Be sure, if you have multiple hard drives, that you ensure that the paging file is set to 0 on all of them.<br />
<br />
-Click OK to exit the dialogs.<br />
<br />
<b>c )</b> Reboot (this will remove the pagefile from your system)<br />
<br />
<b>d ) </b>Then go back in following the directions in step a ) and re-enter the settings that you wrote down in step<br />
<br />
<b>b ).</b> Follow the steps all the way through (and including) the reboot.<br />
<br />
<b>e )</b> Once you've rebooted this second time, go back in and check to make sure that the settings are as they're supposed to be.<br />
<br />
<b>Run System File Checker:</b><br />
<br />
SFC.EXE /SCANNOW<br />
<br />
Go to Start and type in "cmd.exe" (without the quotes)<br />
<br />
At the top of the search box, right click on the cmd.exe and select "Run as adminstrator"<br />
<br />
In the black window that opens, type "SFC.EXE /SCANNOW" (without the quotes) and press Enter.<br />
<br />
Let the program run and post back what it says when it's done.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
- Overheating of the CPU or GPU and or other components can cause 0x116 bugchecks. Monitor your temperatures and ensure the system is cooled adequately.<br />
<br />
- GPU failure. Whether it's heat, power issue (PSU issue), failing VRAM, etc.<br />
<br />
<u><b>The following software issues can cause a TDR event:</b></u><br />
<br />
- Incompatible drivers of any sort <br />
<br />
- Messy / corrupt registry<br />
<br />
- Corrupt Direct X - <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/179113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/179113</a><br />
<br />
- Corrupt system files (run System File Checker as advised above)<br />
<br />
- Buggy and or corrupt 3rd party drivers. If you suspect a 3rd party driver being the issue, enable Driver Verifier:<br />
<br />
<i><b>( -- Remove Asus' AI Suite from the system. It's buggy bloatware and is infamous for causing crashes and issues.)</b></i><br />
<br />
<br />
<b>What is Driver Verifier?</b><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows kernel-mode
 components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.<br />
<br />
<b>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</b><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />
Windows 8 - <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
<br />
<b>How to enable Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
1. Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
2. Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
3. Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />
- Deadlock Detection<br />
- Security Checks (Windows 7 &amp; 8)<br />
- DDI compliance checking (Windows 8)<br />
- Miscellaneous Checks<br />
4. Select&nbsp; - "Select driver names from a list"<br />
5. Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.<br />
6. Check EVERY box that is [B]NOT[/B] provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.<br />
7. Click on Finish.<br />
8. Restart.<br />
<br />
<b>Important information regarding Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will flag it, and as stated above, that will cause /
 force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
If this happens, do <b>not</b> panic, do the following:<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier.<br />
If you did not set up a restore point, do not worry, you can still disable Driver Verifier to get back into normal Windows:<br />
<br />
- Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
・&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
<b>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</b><br />
<br />
It varies, many experts and analysts have different recommendations. Personally, I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier.<br />
<br />
<b>My system BSOD'd, where can I find the crash dumps?</b><br />
<br />
They will be located in %systemroot%\Minidump<br />
<br />

            Not sure I understand your post, are you implying since installing Furmark you BSOD upon boot? If that's the case, boot into safe mode and remove it. Furmark should not be appearing on boot as it's a stress program, so this is not likely related whatsoever.<br />

<p>Hey girl or guy try to download off line install. Use \layout&nbsp; over 7 gig of stuff. I have installed on 8.1 have not tried 7 yet.&nbsp; I would guess your downloaded iso is corrupt. You can always run the check sum and find out.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Parental Controls and Java</h2>
                    
<p>I just started parental controls on an account for our young children. I have allowed all programs and blocked all but listed websites (on Mozilla Firefox). One of the sites that is listed as allowed will not load a java applet to play a game. The site is
 chess.com, and all parts of it work (with ads blocked) but the applet window. When I run Firefox as an administrator on the kids' account the game works fine.</p>
<p>How do I let my son play chess?</p>

<p><span>Hi Bitz_a,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may temperorarily disable the UAC (User Account Control) settings on your childrens account and
 check if they can play the games on the websites and if it loads properly. Later re-enable the UAC settings after checking.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Disable UAC (User Account Control) and check the result. Access the link below and follow the steps to disable UAC.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Turn-User-Account-Control-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Turn-User-Account-Control-on-or-off</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: You must restart your computer when you enable or disable UAC. Changing levels of notification does not require that you restart
 your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue can happen if the Internet Explorer settings are corrupt on your computer<span>. You may optimize Internet Explorer
 settings to default on your computer and check if it works fine. </span>Access the link below and follow the steps to optimize Internet Explorer.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also reset Internet Explorer settings and check if it helps. Follow method 4 in the above article to reset Internet
 Explorer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps and let us know the result.</span></p>

    <title>Microsoft Solitaire Collection - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> geoff  &#40;gst&#41; turpin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Solitaire Collection</h2>
                    <p>So, I bought a 1 year subscription to this program so as not to have to watch the stupid and annoying commercials. I do love the game and especially some of the events. I am having a huge problem believing some of the scores that get posted.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an example, I posted a score to do the 20 games of Klondike of 58:51 minutes. an average of about 3 minutes per game. The present leader has posted a score of 12:42 minutes, which is about 38 seconds per game. I can do some of the easy games in less than
 the 38 seconds but I am really having a problem believing the 38 second average.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fully realize that the world is full of millions of people who are a whole lot smarter and faster than me. I want Microsoft to make a video of one of these players (they're pretty much the same ones over and over) doing 20 games in under 13 minutes. If
 it's possible I would love to see it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd love to know if anyone else has some doubts about this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My other question is why don't we ever see 4 suit games of Spider in the Events</p>

<p>Hi Geoff;</p>
<p>I posted a discussion topic/question on this today; no replies as yet. It seems users are now able to download a
<p>
</p><p>I can't play sport anymore due to illness, so Solitaire has been a fave interface to get those juices flowing. My first tournament I managed to place 11th in the Klondike. It's been going downhill ever since. Today I placed 69th and it doesn't finish for
 another 2 and 1/2 hrs!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think an update employing a program to identify cheaters, then ban or oust them would be ideal. Pie-in-the-sky thinking probably. Something needs to be done, especially since it's an international hit where we compete trusting we're not being duped. It's
 bad enough tolerating a barrage of ad's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I sent a private message to the number 1 ranked player personally challenging them with scores incurred through actual play next challenge. Might be seen as nuisance contact, but I had to do something to ease my frustration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers...</p>
<p>Liz</p>

<p>Hi Liz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it could be proven that people are actually cheating then I won't bother renewing my subscription when it becomes due. I think Microsoft should weigh in on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to sound like sour grapes because like I said before, I know that there are a lot of really smart people out there. It just seems like a stretch to believe some of the scores.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would really appreciate a You Tube video of someone actually doing it.</p>

<p>Hey again Grant;</p>
<p>Here's the YouTube video showing how to use a specific 'Table', which probably explains why such low time counts are being achieved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OH7HwKrU8ww</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's really bad audio quality, but you get the gist of what's being used. It means people have to adjust each challenge manually, but this only takes a few seconds. And yes, Microsoft need to address this.</p>
<p>I've had a response to my question on here but haven't read it yet. I'm hoping for an answer by Microsoft staff. I'll copy/paste on here for you.</p>
<p>Cheers;</p>

<p>So today I look at the results from Spider Adventure. The top winner was a few seconds over 20 minutes to complete 20 games. An average of 1 minute per game. This is absolute crap. I defy anyone in the world to take 104 cards FACE UP and place them numerically
 by suit in 1 minute.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I won't waste anymore time competing against outright cheaters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To Microsoft:&nbsp; If you can't fix this bull***t then stop offering it to the public. I want a full refund on my Premium membership.</p>

<p>Hey Grant;</p>
<p>Merry Xmas by the way!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do understand your feelings; absolutely. I needed an outlet so I sent personal messages to two of the number 1 spots but haven't had replies. No surprises there...</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the upside, it helped to quench my anger. I'm competitive by nature so the whole idea of rising through the ranks appealed to me. I don't worry about that anymore; I'm just there to compete with myself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My group weren't too bad this time, though the number 1 spot as usual was taken by a fraud.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Giving up isn't what I want due to enjoying the games immensely. It's helped me out of a slump I sorely needed to rid myself of.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get what you're saying though about Microsoft. If they want the numbers competing, they need to step it up and improve the program to identify cheats.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wishing you a safe and prosperous 2019 Grant.</p>

                    <p>Hello&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having an issue with the Windows 8.1 update. Previously Plantronics BackBeat Go2 headset was working fine with tablet on Windows 8. Now after the update on searching it finds the headset but cannot connect. Sent off emails to Dell and Plantronics but no
 response so far - hope there might be a quick solution here.</p>
<p>

            <p>Problem solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Had this issue for a while. Went through a number of online solutions suggesting services.msc, etc and none worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solution that did work was going to the Dell website (in my case for a Dell Latitude 10) and going through all the drivers for my model, found a driver labelled Broadband WLAN/Bluetooth and installed that and it worked. Constant connection now with all bluetooth
 devices.</p>
