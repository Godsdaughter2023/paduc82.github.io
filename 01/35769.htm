<h2>            Skype Number not connecting to Incomming calls</h2>
                    <p>Hi team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could I please have some assistance regarding my Skype Number? I am able to successfully make outgoing calls with Skype Credit, and my Windows 10 laptop will&nbsp;<em>ring</em> when an incoming call to my Skype Number is made, however when I answer the call on
 my computer the call doesn't connect. If I immediately call the number back it will connect, so the issue is only limited to connecting incoming calls. Interestingly the computer will ring, but its the connection which fails. The caller hears nothing, and
 eventually hangs up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have turned off Focus Assist and reinstalled the latest version of Skype (as troubleshooting steps), but these haven't helped. I only begun having these issues recently, and none of my network settings changed in the meantime. Any thoughts would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Matthew</p>

<p>There are no Windows 7 Dell drivers for your printer. Usual advice for Dell printers is to use the corresponding Vista Drivers - see here for yours:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.dell.com/support/downloads/driverslist.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=gen&amp;ServiceTag=&amp;SystemID=PRN_ALL_A962&amp;os=WW1&amp;osl=en&amp;catid=&amp;impid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.dell.com/support/downloads/driverslist.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=gen&amp;ServiceTag=&amp;SystemID=PRN_ALL_A962&amp;os=WW1&amp;osl=en&amp;catid=&amp;impid</a>=</p>
<p>If this doesn't work try instaling them in compatibility mode for Vista. See here:</p>

<p>for method.</p>
<p>Remember to install the drivers BEFORE connecting your printer to your PC.</p>

<h3> austacker  say:</h3>
<h2>            27&#38;quot&#59; Gaming Monitor for Xbox One and 360</h2>
                    Currently running with a 24" AOC for my 360, but I want to upgrade now to a top quality rig in prep for the Xbox one release later this year. I've been looking at a few options from Asus and Samsung, but they're all 120 - 144hz models, which I think is
 not only overkill, but may even be detrimental. So I'm in the hunt for something that will give me the best 27" monitor option possible. Money isn't any object - quality is. Not interested in a TV either, this is a desk mounted gaming station and i want to
 keep it that way. So from what I've seen, the Xbox one will be capped to 60hz, so a 120hz is really pointless. I'm mostly looking for something sporting IPS &amp; with a sub 2ms seek. Dual HDMI input ports would be nice so I can run both the 360 and One through
 it, although we might be able to through put via the One anyway, so that's not as important. A monitor with inbuilt speakers would be nice, but since I'm likely to jump in with the new Turtlebeach day 1, it's not a deal breaker.

<p>Newegg is your friend if you want a monitor. Also, IPS panels never have 1ms response times, let alone sub 5ms usually. But this search link provides 4 monitors that are 27", 2 HDMI, IPS, 1920x1080.
<a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/ProductList.aspx?Submit=Property&amp;Subcategory=20&amp;Description=&amp;Type=&amp;N=100007617&amp;IsNodeId=1&amp;IsPowerSearch=1&amp;srchInDesc=&amp;MinPrice=&amp;MaxPrice=&amp;PropertyCodeValue=3098%3A21329&amp;PropertyCodeValue=1099%3A17843&amp;PropertyCodeValue=1055%3A100622&amp;PropertyCodeValue=2889%3A24672" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.newegg.com/.../ProductList.aspx</a> Personally, I say forget about IPS and just get something else. I use the monitor in my sig and it is perfect when I game on my laptop or 360 (and my laptop does run games at high/ultra settings getting 60fps at full
 HD, looks great). If you want quality. Don't get Turtle Beaches. Go with a actually audio company for a headset or something, not cheaply made overpriced garbage. You pay for features on stuff like Astro, Turtle Beach, Tritton headphones, not driver quality.
 Go to real audio company, like Audio Technica or Sennheiser or something. Also, if your AOC is 1920x1080, has the right inputs, and has no input lag issues, and has no color issues, then there is no reason to change. Especially for spending all that money
 on an extra 3".</p>

<p>Thanks for that Hellhog.</p>
<p>I've been using the AOC for some time now, but I'm looking for something a little larger and perhaps future proof a little more for the coming Xbox one. &nbsp;I would ideally like to run both the 360 and Xbox One on the same desk, so the 2nd HDMI isn't a must
 if the throughput on the X1 will allow me to just run the 360 through it.</p>
<p>That said, it depends if the X1 needs to be switched on to do that. &nbsp;More info needed.</p>
<p>I forgot about the IPS not having the lowest seek time, but to be fair, I will have the Monitor for pretty much just myself, so the view from the side isn's THAT important.</p>
<p>What I'm looking for here is the 'best' option here for the game experience. &nbsp;Will an IPS panel with the extra clarity and view angle be worth the trade off for a lower seek on the TN model?</p>
<p>Question is, how much of an impact does the lower seek matter?</p>
<p>I know the 360 and X1 will have a max frame rate of 60 fps, so I don't think that higher refresh rate monitors out there (like 120hz - 144hz) are going to be any better than say a 60hz effort. &nbsp;If anyone more knowledgable disagrees, please let me know!</p>
<p>So what it comes back to for me in considering my options is the MS seek time, clarity &amp; compatibility.</p>
<p>If you look around online, it IS actually difficult to find informative and frank discussions on what monitor is 'best' for CONSOLE gaming... rather than just PC.</p>
<p>But as someone who's 100% console only and doesn't want a TV, I am at something of a loss as to what the best options are and what I should be looking at.</p>
<p>Will anything under 5ms be enough?</p>
<p>Will anything over 60Hz be enough?</p>
<p>IPS or TN, does it really matter?</p>
<p>Things like that, from a console (and specifically, Xbox one) player's perspective I'd love to get more definitive info on!</p>
<p>Thans for your help so far and by all means, if anyone else out there with experience has something to add, I'd really appreciate to hear from you!</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>As a PC and Console gamer, I can flat out tell you, any monitor for PC gaming is fine for console gaming. As far as I am concerned, console gaming is PC gaming but locked down. I use my monitor connect via DVI for my laptop and VGA for my 360 (since it is
 an older one without HDMI out). I've also connect via HDMI for it from another laptop. Between two laptops and one console, picture is always great. When it comes down to picture quality, the higher gamut displays are technically better. When I bought my laptop,
 I had the option of either a 72% or 95% Gamut display, many people went with 95% (which was an expensive upgrade option) but I chose the lesser. Personally, I think it is one of the best displays I've ever used and that's on a laptop. If you want to know good
 quality, just look for monitors on Newegg and read the reviews on what experienced users have to say. Now, 1ms vs 5ms is non-existent. You will not and never notice a difference at all. I don't even know of any 1ms. Just 2ms at lowest. As for refresh. That's
 when your monitor refreshes the screen. No, all you need is 60Hz. Whether on a PC or gaming console, you only need more than 60Hz if you are going 3D, that's when 120Hz come into play. Technically a game can run at higher than 60fps on monitor, but if a monitor
 is 60fps, then you will only see 60 fps, this is where v-sync comes into play on computer games to prevent possible screen tearing. Such as when I run SW The Old Republic, I can get as high as 100fps but I get screen tearing and technically only 60 frames
 flash by my eye anyway, turn on V-sync and the game becomes capped at 60fps. 60Hz is the bare minimum on LCD monitors. And its all anyone ever needs if you don't need 3D. TVs are sold at 120Hz only because movies are 24p as in 24fps. 60 is not divisible by
 24 but 120 is. This helps with frames being cut or jumped in movies. For gaming, 60Hz is all you need. On the X1, games are going to be frame capped at either 60fps or 30fps. So no need to waste money on monitors that are 120 Hz. And you definitely don't want
 something in between 60 and 120 because if a game is frame capped at 60, you could have screen tearing unless the games frame capping (v-sync) is triple buffered which would allow 90 Hz I believe. Not sure. Either way, 60Hz is fine. Like I said, there is no
 monitor that is best for console gaming rather than just PC. They are one in the same. So search for any monitor that is 1920x1080 at the size you want, 60Hz, 2 HDMI in, and at least 5ms response time. From there, it comes down to specifics that you want and
 the reviews. Do you want a Matte or Glossy screen? Do you want one that has a brighter backlight? Personally, just look for something from Dell, Samsung, or Asus as they are best for monitors. Based on your requests in the OP and your second post, here is
 what I recommend, read the reviews for me user experience. But it has everything you want except IPS.

[/quote]I don't recommend that at all. Unless you want 3D, and even then, you'll want 120Hz not 144Hz. Any monitor that is good for PC gaming and Xbox 360 gaming is good for Xbox One gaming. Read my post above for me details. I linked a decent monitor as well
 that you may like.

<p>Now, if you don't mind only having one HDMI, then I'd recommend this. <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16824236103" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.newegg.com/.../Product.aspx</a> Also, you could always use an adapter to connect both HDMI at the same time, such as an HDMI to DVI adapter.</p>

<p>That's some great advice there Hellhog and I really appreciate you taking the time out to discuss it for me.</p>
<p>I really like the look of the Asus VE278Q as you just recommended and it looks like it'll save me a good $150 Australian over the model I was looking at, so that's great news.</p>
<p>Now the single HDMI is not a problem, especially if the X1 will allow the X360 to throughput, but even then, if I can only run one system at a time the X1 will win for me anyway.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your time and info, I really appreciate it!</p>

<p>Happy to help, always been a fan of using my 360 at a <a href="http://sdrv.ms/1cy7alf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
desk experience</a> compared to the whole living room entertainment center idea. Allows me to better swap items between my laptop and console and allows me to use the same monitor when I want to extend the desktop of my laptop. Plus, being able to keep connections
 wired (including my controller) means I never use batteries and have the lowest latencies possible when gaming.</p>

<p>[quote user="Hellhog"]As a PC and Console gamer, I can flat out tell you, any monitor for PC gaming is fine for console gaming.[/quote]If you don't mind frames of latency, sure.[quote]As far as I am concerned, console gaming is PC gaming but locked down.[/quote]3D
 and multimonitor gaming called. They both say you're wrong.[quote]When it comes down to picture quality, the higher gamut displays are technically better.[/quote]Wide gamut displays don't help if the device doesn't support wide gamut. There have been&nbsp;many
 problems with&nbsp;how the 360 handles color. I wouldn't count on the Xbox One being&nbsp;standardized until A/V sites test it.[quote]Whether on a PC or gaming console, you only need more than 60Hz if you are going 3D,[/quote]On a PC, that is untrue.&nbsp;Higher refresh
 rate is usable&nbsp;both at the desktop and in games without 3D.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Xbox One probably can't output anything higher than a 60hz signal. However, since we don't know for sure it may be worth waiting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When choosing a monitor, look at the input lag. Input lag is lowest when the resolution of the input matches the native resolution of the display. A 27" 2560x1440 monitor that has to upscale a 1080p signal&nbsp;is going to have higher input lag than a 27" 1920x1080
 monitor, just by virtue of the scaling process. However, that may not be an issue if you're ok with a couple frames of latency. As an example, my previous gaming monitor was an HP LP2475w. It had around 25ms of input lag. I never had any issues with it. My
 new Dell U3014 has around 4-12ms of lag+response time latency at its native 2560x1600 resolution. I don't have any issues with it, either.</p>

                    In upgrading my laptop to Windows 10 my wife's account came across as a child account.&nbsp; I can't change her to an Adult account.&nbsp; I removed her as a child and then tried to add her as an adult but it complains that she is already part of the family.&nbsp;&nbsp; Clearly
 it is not presenting the data in the browser.&nbsp; How can I add my wife's account?

            <p>This instructions aren't helpful per the content of my question.&nbsp;&nbsp; I already removed the account as a child.&nbsp; The problem was in adding her back.&nbsp;&nbsp; The website would continue to throw an error message suggesting she was part of my family.&nbsp; I&nbsp;could NOT&nbsp;perform
 the activities suggested in the link from your reply.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I fixed the problem by logging into a separate Windows 10 device, added my wife's MS account and changed her type to&nbsp;a PARENT at which point it sent her an invite and allowed her to join the family as an ADULT.&nbsp;&nbsp; Once she logged into the device she was then
 added to the family as&nbsp;an adult.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>This really should be more streamlined.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is absolutely no reason why I was required to visit the website and the PC device.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I don't have any other Windows 10 devices so I have no way of deleting and re-adding or changing the account type.&nbsp; This new OS is very advanced... you can only create new accounts. No editing or removing.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t limit Minecraft use in App Restrictions on Family Safety - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jasw1957  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t limit Minecraft use in App Restrictions on Family Safety</h2>
                    <p>As most parents know, Minecraft is an app that is wildly popular with kids. Unfortunately, Family Safety does not appear to offer any way to limit its use under App restrictions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Minecraft app is an executable file that one downloads from Mojang, the developer's site. It runs on Java. So in Family Safety, its usage shows up under Activity reporting &gt; PC activity &gt; Apps and games as "<span>Java(TM)
 Platform SE binary." &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>However, when you look under App restrictions in Family Safety, there is no "</span><span>Java(TM) Platform SE binary."</span>&nbsp; And, of course, there is nothing for the minecraft.exe
 file either. There is a Java folder, but it only contains "Configure Java." &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is no apparent way to add apps to the App restrictions list. The apps are either there already, listed as "apps already installed on these devices that [the child] can use," or they are not. &nbsp;If one goes to the individual child's Account setting on
 a particular device, the only option presented is to edit Family Safety settings online.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>(There is a related post <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-security/restricting-a-downloaded-app/7e449569-58c7-48fe-818c-4c21996547fb">
here</a>&nbsp;but it deals with Windows 7/"parental controls" and ultimately offers no help, apparently even for Windows 7.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>This appears to be a major and negligent oversight by the developers of Family Safety. I am stunned that they are either ignorant of the pervasive use by children of Minecraft, or that they are simply not competent enough to create a means to limit usage
 of the app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone is aware of a means to use Family Safety to limit Minecraft, please let me know. Otherwise, I will just assume that the developers of Family Safety are unresponsive boneheads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

</p><p>When running some games like motogp,sonic heroes,I do not get full resolution. My pc resolution is 1366x768 onl. But when playing I get only get 1024x768 resolution . Is it because my graphics card driver is not up to date? I have tried updating it through

<p>i will be shocked</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so you have a great looking standard campaign with different difficulty levels, an arcade-mode campaign, a "horde 2.0", which looks insane!!!!!!, beast mode, multiplayer mode with 6 modes! and thats only so far...and everything seems flawless...idk bout
 you guys, but my social life is goin bye bye after september 20th, i never wanted a summer to go by so quick...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gears of War 1 is in my top 3 favorite games, and yet after playing the 3 beta i feel like its so lacking!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HURRY UP!</p>

<p>I think LA Noire will win just because what all the mags and sites said. Personal Noire was a great story but a boring game. my list is Gears3, MW3, Assassins creed, Battlefield3, Noire, Batman, and maybe Duke but their can still be a surprise entry since
 many more games are coming out.</p>

<p>gears 3, assassins creed and bf3 tbh</p>
<p>mw3 wont win, the only reason its on your list is cuz its a call of duty game, besides cod elite, which they make you pay for, whats new? in other words, what is new that actually comes with the 60 dollar game? nothing lol, reviews are gunna realize this
 is more of the same year after year, black ops received quite a few mediocre reviews actually</p>
<p>noire has generally good reviews, but its been said that is has its problems repeatedly, goty has to at least have a 90 or above rating...and its below that on gamerankings (which compiles all reviews and combines them into one score)</p>
<p>batman? lol, i realize the last batman was good, but what superhero game has ever been good twice in a row? let alone once lol, i say the last one was a fluke...but who knows</p>
<p>duke? no shot, i dont even have to give the reasons for that, jus look at the graphics lol, gameplay will still be from the early 2000s as well, no game that has ever been delayed repeatedly has been worth it tbh</p>
<p>gears 3 has all the content goin for it, and the gameplay based on the beta, plus its the last in a straight trilogy (yes mw3 has that goin for it too but it has all the stupid games in the middle of it like black ops that makes it lose its story)</p>
<p>bf3 clearly wins in the graphics dept so far, ill be able to tell from the beta if it deserves goty gameplay wise</p>
<p>and well, assassins creed is assassins creed, good series, itll deff be up there, it usually is

<p>The actual game you need to be concerned about is Elder Scrolls V:Skyrim. &nbsp;That game will most likely win. &nbsp;But that doesn't mean I don't want Gears 3 to win. &nbsp;Bethesda just has a track record for blowing the competition away when they release Elder Scrolls
 games.</p>

<p>Skyrim will win PC for sure but console Elder Scrolls games have never been that great in comparison. &nbsp;Gears has real good shot at winning 360 game of the year from at least a few sites.</p>

<p>I think you guys are really overlooking Portal 2. Fabulous game. Very polished. A separate co-op story. The writing for the game was brilliant. Other than Gears of War, I can't think of a game I've had more fun playing than Portal 2. That game was amazing,
 and funny, and exciting, and just a great experience. &nbsp;But to the OP, it is hard for a console exclusive to win GOTY, so do you just mean XBox GOTY? And if so, are we talking about the Spike TV Awards? What GOTY interests you the most. My problem with GOTY
 is that games are so subjective as to what people like. I love sandbox style games, but I know people who HATE them. I don't care much for FPSs, but obviously CoD and Halo speak volumes on the genre. As far as LA Noire goes, it was innovative, but I kind of
 hated the story and the main character, and by the end, the game was a tad boring, just walking around waiting for the controller to buzz to tell me there is another clue on the ground. And the whole "doubt" thing was irritating at times. What people said
 was true, but I was suppose to press for more information. I would hardly call that "doubt", but whatever.</p>

<p>Have to agree with ya on all Fronts but Batman.....</p>
<p>Loved the first one great game and really enjoyed - best damn Super Hero game ever IMO. I'm hoping for the same in the next one, GOTY don't know but I hope it will be good enough to be a contender anyway.</p>
<p>MW3? I'll be waiting for the bargin bins to try that out - burned far to many times in the wallet for those POS easy games.</p>

<p>Were you talking to me?</p>
<p>I don't care about game ratings I play them cause I like them.</p>
<p>All I was saying is I'm hoping Batman2 is as good as the 1st one &amp; I find recently CoD has failed in delivering with me it costs $150 for&nbsp; the standard game here and I finish it in a number of hrs over a few days on Veteran 'it blows hard' i don't play that
 game online I play for the campaign, I like war shooters - but not falling for it again I'm gonna wait before getting it.</p>

    <title>Windows 2008 R2 Task Schedule failing to execute process &#40;process - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 2008 R2 Task Schedule failing to execute process &#40;process started but failes with exitcode 0xC0000142&#41;</h2>
                    Hi There,
<p>for one of our Projects we depend on the usage of Task schedule. We have Tasks to process data, started on regular Basis, several times / day. Since some time now, after some number of days while the Server is working without problems, the taskschedule will
 fail to execute our Jobs saying that Task is started but Exitcode is 0xC0000142. Till now, we have no solution on how to get out from this Trouble, the only way to make our Server work again is to restart Server, solution which make us Look quite stupid in
 front of our customers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have tried TaskSchedule with pure console programs (cmd.exe or sqlplus.exe) but no success till now. There is no Special Situation when this Problem occur. If we are lucky, the Server works for several weeks without a Problems, if not the Problem may
 occur several times in a week. The only Thing I can say for sure that the Problem happend mostly on Servers where we use Remote Desktop Services (RemoteApps).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope somebody can help to explain the problem. Or probably somebody can give me a "tip" on how to debug the TaskScheduler.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>OS: Windows Server 2008 R2</p>
<p>Service: Windows Task Schedule</p>

 "click <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">on"</span> .. <strong>Where </strong>
is "<strong>on</strong>"? [e.g.One of a list in left-hand column--high-lighted].&nbsp; This is "obvious", when you have confidence, and after doing it a few times!</p>
<p>&nbsp; I still have to explore the distinction&nbsp; between "folder" and "album"--the second seems more appropriate for photos, and is prominent in M/S "Photos"--as against "Pictures".</p>
<p>

<div>hello,</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>when i set a new user up with skype for business on our domain, it automatically adds some contacts to the contact list (looks to be pulled from the 'team' ad attributes). all of these users have the flag set for status change alerts. in the case of some
 of our more senior managers, they can have 30-50 contacts automatically added that need to have this flag individually turned off.</p>
<p>if i manually add a contact, it does not have this flag set. so it appears to be tied to the automatically added contacts somehow.</p>
<p>looking through the settings in skype for business, and having looked at the gpo templates i cannot find a setting that defines this behaviour. does anyone have an idea as to where this comes from, and how i can set it to not automatically set this flag?</p>
<p>thanks,</p>
<p>nick</p>

<h2>            I&#39;ve been losing emails from my inbox that are more than 1 month old.</h2>
                    <p>I use outlook and windows live mail to download emails on a few different computers.&nbsp; For some reason, as of late, any email older than 1&nbsp;month has been removed from my inbox.&nbsp; They are not on the web-based hotmail either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have already tried to restore deleted emails (which works fine, for emails I've DELETED), but I cannot get emails back that have been just sitting in my inbox.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please let me know what can be done to restore them, or prevent this from happening.&nbsp; My account has never been inactive, as I have been using this hotmail account daily for over 10 years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's possible that this issue occurs in your Windows Live Mail because you may have not set or enabled
<span>the option “<b><i>Always leave a copy of the message on the server”</i></b> when you configured the account.
</span></p>
<p><span>We recommend that you enable this setting by following the instructions below:</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>Open Windows Live Mail.</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>Right click the email account's name in the folder pane then select
<b>Properties</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>Click on <b>Advanced</b> tab.</span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>Tick on <b>Leave a copy of messages on the server</b> under Delivery.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> By default, Windows Live Mail leaves messages on the POP3 server when setting up a new account.&nbsp; This setting does not apply to HTTP or IMAP accounts which always leave messages on the server until you remove them in the WLM
 account folders.<br />
<br />
In addition, we would like you to set your POP3 client settings in your Hotmail account for us&nbsp;to make sure that your messages won't be deleted when transferring it&nbsp;to a mail client. Please follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>Sign in to your Hotmail account.</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>Go to <b>Options</b> - <b>More options</b>.</span></p>
<p><b><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><span>Under <b>Managing Your Account</b> select <b>
Pop and deleting downloaded messages.</b></span></p>
<p><span>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>Tick on<b> “Don't let another program delete messages from Hotmail”</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>Click <b>Save</b>.</span></p>
<p>As for the Outlook email client, please refer to their respective support group for assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            How to schedule Windows Update Downloads.</h2>
                    <p>Rushing to get important work done yesterday - just at the wrong time computer slows then freezes - after some waiting and some fretting I had to hit power button to reboot and hey presto "installing updates" - I was very late for my meeting and lost some
 work.... &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I want to know when updates are being downloaded so I know why computer slows</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I want to choose when updates are downloaded! Its MY computer!!! </p>
<p>
</p><p>Happy to leave computer to do its thing when im not using it, but updates should never have priority over what I bought the computer for!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me how to achieve the above please? &nbsp;I genuinely love windows 10 so if I cant do the above please tell me who needs to know this so that THEY CAN CHANGE IT! &nbsp;Thanks :-)<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Community, we apologize for the inconvenience caused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per your query, I understand that you&nbsp;wish to set your Windows Update settings to such that you can&nbsp;download the updates as per your convenience. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In such a case, I would like to inform you that, it is not possible for you to schedule the download of updates. However, you can schedule the updates to install at a time which is of your convenience. To do so follow the steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>&nbsp;menu and type&nbsp;<strong>Windows&nbsp;update</strong>&nbsp;in the search bar.
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on&nbsp;<strong>Windows update</strong>. </p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on <strong>Advanced options</strong> under Windows updates.
</p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select the&nbsp;<strong>Notifies to scheduled restart</strong>&nbsp;form drop down menu under the&nbsp;<strong>Choose how update</strong> are installed.<span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span><strong>Note:</strong> You will be prompted to scheduled restart when to install the updates after the updates are downloaded.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information helps.&nbsp;</span></p>

            Thank you both for your reply.
<div><br />
<div>I have just checked and I must have done this already in the past as it is set to "notify is to schedule restart".</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm using a computer which is only about three months old and it was upgraded from a retail version of Windows 8.1 which I purchase separately. I do use a lot of resources on the computer, for example I often have several word documents open, several webpages,
 Skype, Evernote and Nuance Dragon pro but the computer is maxed with 16gb of ram so I can't see that could be the cause. The symptom is as follows,</div>
<div><br />
<div>The computer slows down and I temporarily get "is not responding", the hard drive is usually going and then eventually everything freezes-I tap ctrl-alt-del leave it for five minutes and if nothing has happened I end up holding the power button down. Often
 when the machine reboots it says things like "configuring updates" which is what made me think that the computer updating is using the resources?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any ideas on how I can make my computer more stable would be appreciated.</div>
<div>Many thanks,</div>
<div>Martin</div>

            <p>I have had this problem since upgrading to Win 10 but in my case, these automatic update downloads are costing me money ! &nbsp;I have a 5GB 'cap' on data with a further 5GB if used between 01.00 and 05.00 daily. &nbsp;This is when I want the downloads to take place
 ! &nbsp; All data exceeding the daytime 5GB limit is charged at an horrific rate by my ISP.</p>
<p>I'd prefer NO DOWNLOADS to the existing situation.</p>

<h2>            Problems with connecting to an Xbox</h2>
                    My son and I have been communicating for years using my computer and his Xbox.&nbsp; All of a sudden, we cannot connect. There is no connection. It shows that he called but nothing happens. We can't hear or see anything.

                    <p>Just as the title implies, after some sort of major Windows 10 update about a week ago all of the Multi-Key functions that come as default with my laptop are no longer working. By pressing and holding the "Fn" (function key) + F-keys (F1 through F12) certain
 things would happen, such as turning on/off the Wi-Fi, Controlling the volume and brightness, enabling and disabling the touch pad, etc...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of these functions have been working at all since the latest Update, which might I add, I had no option in whether I wished to download it or not, it just suddenly happened as I was casually using my laptop.&nbsp;</p>

                    <b>Question Summary</b><br />
Other Windows Live Movie Maker issues

<div><b>Which version of Windows Live Movie Maker are you using ? </b></div>
<div>Version 2011 (15.4.3538.513)</div>
<div><b>Choose your Operating System version : </b></div>
<div>Windows 7</div>
<p><b>Additional Details</b><br />
I used to have a wide variety of animations available to me in Movie Maker.&nbsp; They suddenly disappeared.&nbsp; Either five will show or sometimes the entire box containing the options has shrunk in size with nothing in it at all.&nbsp; I've completely uninstalled and
 reinstalled Live Essentials a dozen times now.&nbsp; Sometimes the animations come back for a split second and then they're gone again.&nbsp; An error message is NOT displayed.&nbsp; I've tried looking for the .inf file as well (because some fixes require right-clicking
 and installing from this file), but I don't have it.&nbsp; This software was installed from the website and not the CD.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

            The ribbon style menu of WLMM changes in a highly interactive way. In the case of animations, the number of them shown is minimal if you're on the first visual clip in a project, and full when you select a different clip... the 2nd or beyond.<br />
<br />
Hopefully it's a simple matter of learning more about how it varies with what you have currently selected in the project.

            Hi <span>nchantedmoon,<br />
<br />
PapaJohn is correct. By design, Windows Live Movie Makers animation options&nbsp;is minimal if you're on the first visual clip in a project, and the full options are available on the next cllip or so.
<br />
<br />
@PapaJohn thanks for helping out.<br />
