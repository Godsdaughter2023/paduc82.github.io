<h2>            Minecraft Xbox One problemas de rede e conex&#227;o no meu mundo</h2>
                    Meu Minecraft do xbox one, não é a versão xbox edition, é a mais nova, toda vez que eu crio um mundo, nenhum dos meus amigos conseguem se conectar, mas eu consigo se conectar nos mundos deles. Quando minha NAT está ''MODERADA'' ninguém consegue se conectar
 ao meu mundo, mas quando começo a mexer nas configurações de rede, deixo a NAT ''ABERTA'' eles conseguem se conectar mas depois de uns 2 ou 5 minutos eles caem do meu mundo e eu caiu do grupo e fico desconectando toda hora, já tentei de tudo, trocar a porta,
 mexer na NAT e sempre dá a mesma coisa, estou indignado que para jogar um jogo tão divertido com meus amigos eu tenha que passar por isso, nenhum outro jogo faz isso, só o Minecraft :/

 the design on the tables and this is still in Yes/No mode. All other client machines on the network can see Yes or no Not -1 or 0. I have looked all over and the only solution I can find is manually changing the value to a textual one using a IIF statement.
 This would be a lot of work, and considering it is only one client I might just have to down grade the client machine. Is there a rendering component/object related to forms or boolean? Any help in this matter would be greatly appreciated. Regards, Mark Tinsley</span>

<p>HI there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What the others are eluding to, the account that the Minecraft code was redeemed on, does it have the console set as it's
<strong><a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/game-setup/my-home-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">home console
</a></strong>so the other profile can access it? </p>
<p>If not, or the purchasing account is not logged into the console, you will get a 'do you own this game message' when trying to play on any other account. Once the account that the code was redeemed on is logged into the console, other accounts should be
 able to launch and play the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you getting any specific error message when trying to launch the game under a different account, or does the game not show in the My Games and Apps section when you try to launch the game under any other account?</p>

<h2>            how to remove boot info from C&#58; drive</h2>
                    I had windows xp pro installed on my c: drive like normal. Had a problem, tried to repair the installation with rebulding windows. Ran into problem. Now I did not want to lose my documents and other info so, I installed fresh copy of windows on D: dirve.
 Everything is fine except when windows during startup asks me where I want to boot from. The default is C: and if I don't choose in time, it will go to C:, which will fail and the pc will be in a loop for booting up. I want to get rid of having the option
 to the system to even try to boot from C: drive....I have been reading and trying different things but here I am asking for your help...Please help..

            <p>Hello Bonnell,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know some information about the issue so that we could help you better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the model number of your Gateway laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for providing details about the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also realize the inconvenience you are experiencing due to Windows login issue. I will certainly help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may occur due to corrupt Windows login files and settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to <strong>enable built-in administrator account from command prompt in Windows recovery environment</strong> and check if it helps. Please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a. Do one of the following, depending on whether you have installation media (such as a DVD or USB flash drive):</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you have installation media for Windows, start your computer from the installation media. Insert the DVD or USB flash drive and restart your computer. If you see a message asking you to "<strong>Press any key to boot from DVD</strong>", do so. If you
 don’t see the message, you might need to change the boot order in your computer's BIOS settings so that it first starts from the DVD or USB. When you see the "<strong>Install Windows</strong>" page, click "<strong>Repair your computer</strong>" to start the
<strong>Windows recovery environment</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- If you don’t have installation media, use the power button to restart your computer three times. This will start the
<strong>Windows recovery environment</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>b. In the <strong>Windows recovery environment</strong>, on the "<strong>Choose an option</strong>" screen, click "<strong>Troubleshoot</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>c. Click "<strong>Advanced options</strong>" and then click "<strong>Command Prompt</strong>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>d. In the command prompt, type the following command and press Enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>net user administrator /active: yes</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>This will enable built-in administrator account. Now, you may <strong>logon to the built-in administrator account and create a local administrator account.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please refer this article:<br />
<strong>Create a user account</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-user-account#create-user-account=windows-8</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After creating a new user account, you may <strong>logon to that account and disable built-in administrator account.</strong>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may type the following command in the command prompt and press Enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>net user administrator /active: no</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS
 settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk. </p>

<h2>            Surface book charger not working &#40;despite good condition&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My charger is not working for the Surface Book. It looks in good condition - no frays or bulges on the wire - and I have taken good care of it. But the connection light is not coming on and the battery isn't charging. A couple of times I disconnected the
 short lead going into the adaptor - then when I reconnected then the connector light went on and the battery was successfully charging. Now that no longer works and the thing just seems dead. Any thoughts on this? Sounds like I just need a new charging plug,
 but if anyone knows better then it would be great to hear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for any assistance....</p>

            Can you try a different charger to see if it works normally? If you are in the US, you can go to the closest physical retail Microsoft Store and they will test your charger with their demos and vice versa. If not in the US, can you try a charger belong to a friend with a SP3/SP4/newest SP/Surface book to see if it lights up? These aren't the 102W Surface Book specific adapters but they should light up if in fact it is your charger that has died. 
<br />

<p>Hello John, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sure, there are several ways on how to reinstall your applications. You may manually install the applications using Microsoft Store, downloading over the web, checking if you back up the application from your OneDrive or external storage. To assist you better,
 we'd like to know the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What's the make and model of your device?</li><li>Did you back up your applications using OneDrive or external storage?</li><li>What are the applications that you are trying to reinstall?</li><li>What troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We are looking forward to your reply.</p>
        </p>

<p>thanks for the help. yes I did back up my system to an external hard drive. I tried to restore my files from that. I got a message the files were being restored. this took many hours. I thought it was going to work however the files would not open???</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also had a back up set on another drive in my computer and I tried to restore from that drive. it also looked like it was working because it took several hours also. however the files will not open</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a dell inspiron 630. there are numerous files I have lost including Microsoft word and excel. they are all listed&nbsp; but I cant seem to find a way to restore them'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Come to find out I didn't accidently delete them. I lost windows 10 and in the process of restoring&nbsp;</p>
<p>windows 10 that is when I lost the apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not too good at these things</p>
<p>

            <p><span>Hi Jranz,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Inconvenience regretted. I suspect the issue might due to the corruption in the user profiles. Lets follow the below mentioned steps and see if it works:</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to add&nbsp;another Microsoft account by following the steps mentioned below and see if the problem persists:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Click <strong>Start.</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Navigate to <strong>
Settings/&gt;Accounts/&gt;Your Account/&gt; Add a Microsoft account. </strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>If you have another Microsoft account try to use that or else follow the steps to sign-up for new and switch with new Microsoft account.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Sign-out from the old and Login with new Microsoft account.</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Once you're sign-in with new Microsoft account, then try to perform the actions and check if the problem still occurs. You can remove the existing Microsoft account from
 there if needed. Check and see if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>Please ensure to backup you data if you wish to remove your old Microsoft account.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information is helpful.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mentioned that the build of your Windows 10 is 16299.15. The latest build of Windows 10 is 16299.125. It is possible that the issue with Windows Subsystem for Linux is occurring because you're still using the earlier build of Windows 10 version 1709.
 We recommend updating the build of your Windows 10 to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you can enable Windows Subsystem for Linux after updating the build of your Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>There is a possibility that there is an issue with the Windows Subsystem for Linux in the current build of your copy of Windows 10. This is the reason why we recommend that you update your Windows 10. Since you've mentioned that you cannot install the latest
 update of Windows 10, can you please provide us the error that you're getting when you attempt to update?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us resolve first the Windows Update issue so that you will be able to update your copy of Windows 10. Once you can update your Windows 10, we will be able to verify if you will still encounter the issue with Windows Subsystem for Linux while using the
 latest OS Build. Kindly access this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></strong>. The article will provide the steps that can usually resolve common Windows Update
 issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please update us if you're able to update after following the steps.</p>

<p>there is no error. the widows update console simple goes into a loop where it informs me my machine needs to reboot, and upon rebooting the message persists. (e.g. the windows update console continues to try and install the latest update,&nbsp;kb4054517, but
 appears to fail)</p>
<p>
</p><p>i've tried uninstalling the update and installing it manually. i even found and followed the first "workaround" on this URL:&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4054517/windows-10-update-kb4054517</p>
<p>
</p><p>im UNABLE to get&nbsp;kb4054517 to install at all.... which i understand is the reason why i can NOT install the linux subsystem. quite frustrating considering i purchased windows less then a week ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>is there going to be a fix released from MS? Is there an ISO i can download to re-install windows which has patch&nbsp;kb4054517 applied? (it's upsetting i even have to consider totally re-installing windows, but im in dire need here to get this working)</p>
<p>

</p><p>right click on the Windows folder, click properties, uncheck the hidden box then on the next box I checked "unhide this folder and all of the subfolders and files."</p>

<p>Otherwise you need to work on getting Windows Update to work. 16299.15 should automatically update to 16299.192 (as of 1/15/2018).</p>

<h2>            Installed New Netgear WiFi Range extender but new network has no internet access.</h2>
                    i just installed a net gear universal WiFi range extender and the signal on the Extended network is very strong, but when i connect to it it says it has no internet access. What do i need to change?As i post this i am on the Ext network.but when i try
 to access other sites it won't let me.<br />

            I have had the same problem as you and searched everywhere for a positive answer and haven't got one. I was about to return the netgear extender when I, fortunately, found the way around this strange problem.
<br />
In fact it's really simple, and I really would encourage everyone that eventually get this problem to complain to netgear about not having their setup process detailed in the guide they ship with the product.<br />
<br />
In my case I have a WEP encrypted network.<br />
<br />
If you cannot access the extender's web interface than you need to reset the device by inserting a paper clip on the small hole next to the WPS button(if you don't know that already).<br />
<br />
When you are prompted for the encryption key and passphrase for the existing network(original one), you MUST WRITE THE PASSPHRASE ON THE KEY INPUT FIELD you select and not on the field for the passphrase. You may select any of the 4 key input fields but you
 MUST write the passphrase on one of them and leave the passphrase field blank(I believe this is just for WEP encryption which is my case).<br />
<br />
I also changed the encryption type for the new "_EXT" network from WEP to WPA/TKIP but kept the same password.<br />
<br />
After the connection completed the extender successfully checked for updates and all IP addresses were assigned automatically via DHCP.<br />
<br />
I hope I answered in time before you return the extender because I don't have any kind of complains after doing this.<br />
<br />
Best of luck,<br />
Marlon.<br />

<h2>            unknown usb device &#40;device descriptor request failed&#41;</h2>
                    <div>
Hi as above currently there is no usb device connected and I'm getting that error message even though when tested both usb ports work. The only thing that doesn't work is the 2 in 1 keyboard buts thats not usb. I have tried uninstalling, reinstalling, updating,
 rolling back drivers to have no effect. All drivers and bios and windows are up to date. run sfc, dism no effect. This occurred when creators update installed unfortunately this update destroyed my previous version of windows (I'm left with a paperweight)
 so rolling back is not an option. I have run trouble shooters to no effect. I am looking for a solution so please don't tell me to go to the feedback hub as that is not a solution, I have asked this question previously please do not merge threads as I'm looking
 for someone who will work with me to find a solution not just disappear on me putting it in the to hard basket. Please note this question has been duplicated due ms support disappearing and not answering the question. This is something that occurs to frequently
 on these threads which is disgraceful customer service by ms support, people are looking for answers it is unacceptable for you to runaway from questions that are to hard. Please note this question will continue to be asked until one of you does your job and
 provides a solution to this question. I am willing to work the problem are you? </div>

<div>It looks like you would like to use canopus advc110 with </div>

            you can't edit videos or email them&nbsp;with media player. You will need to use movie maker(search 'movie maker' in the start menu) to edit, and email as you would normally send an attatchment.

<h2>            &#34;White&#34; Windows 10 taskbar icons appearing incorrectly on my PC</h2>
                    <p>I've just finished upgrading to Windows 10 on...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Laptop </p>
<p>Sony VAIO VGN-AW11Z'B'</p>
<p>Intel Core 2 Duo T9400 2.53GHz</p>
<p>4GB RAM<br />
32bit<br />
NVIDIA 9600 GT</p>
<p>+</p>
<p>My Desktop Computer</p>
<p>Alienware Aurora R4</p>
<p>Intel i7-3960X 3.30GHz</p>
<p>16GB RAM</p>
<p>64bit</p>
<p>Dual NVIDIA GeForce GTX 690</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both systems are running Windows 10 Pro. I'm not sure whether the above spec's are even relevant - but this is the first time I've ever asked a question to a forum so I'm just copying what I've seen in the past when I've read through other threads regarding
 help / support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The title for this is possibly a little misleading. First off my icons are "appearing" (in terms of are they displaying with a relevant icon) perfectly on both systems. What my question relates to is the consistency of their appearance on both systems and
 how I can 'fix' it so that icons appear the same on both of my computers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is how 'Windows 10 icons' (by this I mean applications supplied by Microsoft) appear, so... Music, Xbox, Store, Mail, Calculator etc.</p>
<p>

</p><p><strong>Laptop Screen Grab&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b0c130a9-23c3-4f0b-94d2-e7b8cfd0ffbe" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see the laptop icons are displaying as distinctly different from the desktop computer set above... with the laptop icons being, I'm assuming, the official Windows 10 icons for those particular applications. My desktop computer however has 8.1
 style tiles for it's Windows 10 application icons.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my question is: How do I make my desktop computer icons appear the same as my laptop icons?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To give a quick run-down of things I've tried prior to writing this post, they are as follows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Ran Windows updates from settings (everything is now as up to date as it can be)</p>
<p>2. Opened 'Store' and ran updates to apps from there (again everything is as up to date as it can be)</p>
<p>3. Updated my display drivers</p>
<p>4. Opened apps: Music, Mail, Calculator, XBox; on both machines to set them up (I hoped this would switch the icons on the desktop, maybe as part of a 'final step' of installation - no luck there)</p>
<p>-- Restarted after every update</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course - this isn't a major problem... but it is one that will persistently bug me because I'm a little OCD when it comes to consistency across interfaces.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">:: Notes ::</span></em></strong></p>
<p>1. I wondered if possibly there's something going on in the background of the system that's restricting the white icons on my Desktop PC from displaying. I can switch to tablet mode on my Laptop, this switch is not possible on my Desktop PC... so thinking
 perhaps these are the default "desktop mode only" icons? If they are that's a shame - I like the white, bigger, non-colour background icons. Would really like them to appear on my main computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. A subtle difference that I noted... If you hover the mouse pointer over the music app on the Laptop the tool tip that appears says 'Music'. If the same is repeated on the Desktop computer the tool tip says 'Groove Music'. This made me think that perhaps
 the two apps are launching from different places within their respective systems. However, I unpinned both 'music' icons from the latop and desktop and then re-pinned them going to: Start &gt; Music &gt; [right-click] Pin to taskbar to see what would happen but
 both tool tips remained the same (laptop:Music and desktop:Groove Music)</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>TLDR : - My Windows 10 app icons are appearing differently across two computers. See screen grabs above. How do I fix this?&nbsp;</strong></p>

            <p>Hey Shawn</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks so much for your response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked out the about sections of all the apps from the screen grabs and here are my versions as requested...</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Desktop Apps</strong><br />
<br />
3.6.1182.0</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Xbox</span><br />

<strong>Laptop Apps</strong><br />

2015.7.22.2<br />
<br />
17.6020.42011.0<br />
<br />
10.1507.15010.0</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, as you can see (unfortunately for this thread) they're all the same version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>However...&nbsp;</strong>as I was writing this reply, I had the Store app open on both the desktop and laptop and I noticed that I didn't have the toggle for ' Update apps automatically' switched to 'On' on my desktop. It was switched to 'On', on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I switched it to 'On', on the Desktop, I went back and pressed the 'Check for updates' button in the Downloads and installs section and lo and behold tonnes of app updates appeared (94 to be precise).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was strange as, as I'd said; I checked multiple times for updates before making my original post to be 100% sure that I wasn't going to fall foul of forgetting to do something painfully obvious and therefore leaving myself open to a sort of 'have you
 tried plugging it in?' type response. I also pressed the 'Check for updates' button before I started writing this reply (before I noticed the inconsistency in my laptop and desktop settings) and again no updates appeared.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway - after all the background updates - all the Microsoft apps are now displaying the big white icons that were missing this afternoon from the desktop Windows 10, minus 1 app - the Xbox app... but I am now just assuming that this will right itself shortly?
 I'm just leaving my computer on for the time being with the store app left open to let it hopefully happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly, none of the version numbers have changed on the desktop apps versus the laptop. They're all still the same; so I'm assuming that the slew of updates was retrospective??? and installed behind the up-to-date versions that I have which simultaneously
 fixed the icon inconsistency issue that I noticed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another thing that I did - a couple of hours ago was marry up the sync settings between the laptop and desktop. Maybe this also had an effect? Not sure about that though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not an insider - I registered for it - but never got around to actually following through with it. Namely because at that point in time I couldn't bothered messing around with my old, old laptop... Just waited for the public ready launch build to come out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, again, even though you didn't fix the problem directly - in reality your question actually ended up prompting the fix, because if I didn't have both apps open to compare the version numbers, due to you pointing me in that direction, never in a million
 years would I have been put in the position of noticing the tiny difference in the settings section of the store which ended up resolving the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, on that note, THANK YOU!!! :-D</p>

            <p>Hello Nicolas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My card is the 9600 GT as opposed to the&nbsp;9600M GT which you're asking about. However they are essentially one and the same with 9600M having a few on board modifications to help it better with cooling I believe and I think it's also physically smaller. Even
 though my computer is a laptop too, for some reason Sony stuck the desktop&nbsp;version into the laptop... When they released my laptop it was sold as a 'hybrid PC' (a cross between a desktop and a laptop) even though, I guess that's what it is; it's also huge
 and clunky - not very portable but less space is taken up than a desktop would (which I think was what they were trying to achieve).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure what computer you have (I'm assuming you're on Window 10 though) so I'll answer your question in 2 parts. If you've got a Sony VAIO like me with the 9600 GT (or 9600M GT) installed inside it, I recommend ignoring 'Answer 1' below and just scrolling
 down to 'Answer 2'. Answer 1 is referring to if you can install drivers on your graphics card&nbsp;without having to rely on the computer manufacturer to provide their own specific model updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Answer 1</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you go to Nvidia's website and navigate to their drivers section : <a href="http://www.geforce.com/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Nvidia Drivers">
http://www.geforce.com/drivers</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once on the Nvidia driver page, in the <strong>'Manual Driver Search' </strong>
box fill it out as shown in the screen grab below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e58a6b33-6007-4507-83e9-f7fe44567299" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>::NOTE for screen grab above::</strong> Obviously, in you're in a different country to the UK simply&nbsp;select the relevant country for you from the drop down list (second from bottom, above the 'Start Search' button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you've pressed search the page will load a list of all drivers available for that 9 series model (in your case the 9600M GT) There's no Windows 10 driver available for it - but an 8.1 driver will work just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The most recent one is the: GeForce 341.44 Driver WHQL&nbsp;(24th February 2015).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, try to install this - if it works - then that's it. Latest driver, for that&nbsp;card is now&nbsp;installed :-D</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Answer 2 - The following ONLY applies to a VAIO VGN-AW11Z'B'</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a VAIO VGN-AW11Z'B' like myself... the first thing that you should notice after upgrading to Windows 10&nbsp;is that Windows has gone ahead and installed a generic display driver in place of your Nvidia cards&nbsp;driver - This makes everything appear
 large and blurry on your screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I noticed this had occurred, I simply installed the relevant graphics driver (nVidia) - 8.15.11.8640_0910130 from Sony's support page...
<a href="http://www.sony.co.uk/support/en/content/cnt-dwnl/VGN-AW11Z/list" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="VGN11ZB Graphics Driver">
http://www.sony.co.uk/support/en/content/cnt-dwnl/VGN-AW11Z/list</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The latest driver is a windows 7 driver (don't look at this as a problem though, the most important thing is getting the system to recognise that there's an Nvidia card inside your laptop).</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is also an 'Nvidia Guard' application for Windows 8 on the same support page&nbsp;(download, install this as well).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once those are installed onto your VAIO VGN-AW11Z'B' the Nvidia graphics card will now work perfectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>:: IMPORTANT ::</strong></p>
<p>If you have a different&nbsp;Sony VAIO model, or even another manufacturers model like an ASUS or a Lenovo or Dell or whatever,&nbsp;please go to your laptop manufacturers relevant&nbsp;support page for your specific laptop model. There will be an Nvidia graphics card
 driver there for you if&nbsp;the 9600M GT&nbsp;is the card that shipped originally with your laptop&nbsp;(it may well not be a Windows 10 driver((it could be but the chances of that are very, very slim as it's an old card))&nbsp;but even if it's for Windows 8/8.1 or even Windows&nbsp;7)
 installing the latest driver version that is available to you will fix the problem that I'm guessing you're having which is that Windows 10 has installed a generic display driver in place of your Nvidia driver after you upgraded to Windows 10 which is making
 your graphics and screen look not so great at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps you out.</p>

<p>I Have an aw11z too and I m going to install windows 10 very soon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have 2 questions:</p>
<p>- Did you backup your data and format everything or did you keep your data and install from windows 7?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- The aw11 is one of the best laptop I know, i love the screen, but it is an "not so old" machine. Do you feel it has enough power for programming apps, use visual studio and others tools from microsoft?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi Louis! ... what Vinod said... but in fairness to answer your question you directly asked me please read on...</p>
<p>
</p><p>For my VAIO&nbsp;I upgraded from 8.1 to 10. You're right it is indeed an awesome machine - it's&nbsp;like a tank. The screen is beautiful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you do the upgrade to Win10 you will need to reinstall the Nvidia driver discussed above, as for whatever reason a generic display driver is installed on upgrade and it is just plain nasty (in terms of how it looks visually on screen - really big, zoomed,
 blurry display).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before I go on below - if you perform only an upgrade you will NOT lose your data. If I remember right you should be&nbsp;given&nbsp;a choice to either upgrade (which is what I did for my VAIO)&nbsp;or to do a clean install from ISO (which I did not but this&nbsp;will wipe
 EVERYTHING) ...&nbsp;and ISO install will&nbsp;install a fresh Win10... discussed in more detail&nbsp;below....&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So for&nbsp;upgrade... It simply upgrades your OS... nothing else is touched. I recommend though going through your software and uninstalling quite a lot of applications - you'll have to do some research for that. As in my experience of upgrade Windows 10 plays
 far better with new installations on the OS than installations carried across from the upgrade. Even if the upgrade compatibility tool (if you ran that?) says everything is good to go I still had A LOT of problems with various applications - namely: Adobe
 (all apps), Bitdefender, Apple (iTunes, Quicktime, iCloud). Browsers (Chrome and Opera). Microsoft (Skype). Secondly I completely recommend that you DO back your stuff up... just incase something goes wrong - you can never be too careful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I won't go into the ins and outs of how I upgraded my VAIO&nbsp;to Windows 8... as we both know that Sony did not support this particular model in the upgrade cycle when Win8 came out. However, I persevered&nbsp;because I wanted it and I didn't agree with Sony telling
 me I couldn't have something after I'd paid a boat load of money only 18 months prior to Win8 coming out and then all of a sudden they just dropped their support for what was apparently at the time one of their flagship laptops... I mean&nbsp;really Sony?&nbsp;So I
 basically&nbsp;forced the machine to accept it. But the downside of this is,&nbsp;is that it took 4-6 weeks of what can only be described as a nightmare upgrade&nbsp;experience to achieve the upgrade without compromising any of the (for example)&nbsp;Sony keyboard 'Fn' controls
 etc. At one point I honestly thought I'd ruined it... but perseverance was key here.&nbsp;The upside was, was that once&nbsp;all&nbsp;done it was a very stable and possibly&nbsp;faster machine than when it was on Windows 7.&nbsp;So yeah basically it was totally capable of handling
 Win8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, yeah...&nbsp;I have the AW11z'B' same as you - Upgrading to Windows 10 was actually a very seamless experience for me on that laptop (I'm not entirely sure if this was because I&nbsp;was&nbsp;only jumping up from Win8.1 - but all the same from start to finish it took
 around an hour or&nbsp;2&nbsp;to do it).&nbsp;Far better experience than on my&nbsp;much newer and vastly more powerful&nbsp;Win8.1 Dell&nbsp;workstation desktop that I use for my&nbsp;work.&nbsp;Which appeared easy enough at first and then I ran into multiple problems down the line which were only
 fixed by doing a 'reset' (last week)&nbsp;though the Windows 10 settings with help of Microsoft Support team over the phone&nbsp;- fun times... not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you've upgraded to Windows 10 and if and&nbsp;when you reset&nbsp;(only&nbsp;do it if you feel you have to do it);&nbsp;it completely wipes the hard-drive (so it's important to back up any of your important files and to make sure that you have any disk based software installers
 or digital downloadable installers&nbsp;at your finger tips) and of course your personal files. After it performs the reset - it's important to note that this does not reset the computer back to its original factory settings (in your case Win7? or Vista? like my
 factory reset would achieve)&nbsp;but basically installs a fresh copy of Windows 10 on to your system. So, it stays 10.&nbsp;From my own personal experience with Windows 10 I&nbsp;absolutely (based only on my experience&nbsp;- so take it as you wish)&nbsp;recommend a fresh install
 on to your device as it is so, so, so much more stable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding a Windows 10&nbsp;'reset' after I upgraded&nbsp;and my experience of it&nbsp;all, all&nbsp;I will say is "wow" it totally, totally sorted my&nbsp;machine out. Well it did in&nbsp;the case of my&nbsp;Dell workstation&nbsp;anyway.&nbsp;It essentially strips&nbsp;the computer&nbsp;of it's identity so
 all the previous&nbsp;bloat-ware goes.&nbsp; All the Dell start up screen is gone and now a windows logo appears in its place. Pre.reset the dell logo appeared on the Win10 machine. This is only to try and describe to you the changes that come about from performing
 something such as a reset.&nbsp;The BIOS is still the latest version I&nbsp;should add -&nbsp;so no effects to the BIOS on reset apparently. Tonnes of hard-disk space is recovered too&nbsp;(in my case 300+GB) before reset HD with applications uninstalled all work backed up on
 to external drive and then deleted from HD was at 432GB. After reset once all owned applications, fonts, music,&nbsp;work etc etc etc&nbsp;put back on to HD, HD stood at 101GB. My work computer is now rapid as a result. I have Bitdefender for my Antivirus and it has
 a system boot up analyser - pre.reset it clocked it at&nbsp;5 minutes and 48 seconds to start up to a ready state from power on - post.reset from power on&nbsp;it now goes straight to desktop and is fully ready to go, with all services and start&nbsp;up apps loaded, in&nbsp;43
 seconds - amazing... really (for a 3 year old machine).</p>
<p>
</p><p>This weekend I'll be doing the same to my VAIO (performing a Windows 10 reset) and taking it from there as I'm hoping this will breath fresh life in to the trusty old&nbsp;machine that it is.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>p.s. for reset from upgrade you do not need the ISO. Windows'll do all that for you in the background - fresh install takes a looooooooong time. For me it was 14 hours when I did it to my workstation - but as I said there was a lot of problems on the Dell
 machine so the Sony when I do it to that I assume will be much quicker, even though it's less powerful ... (in my opinion, now it's done on&nbsp;the Dell&nbsp;- totally worth all the worry and hassle to be honest).<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally - if it's the AW11zB that you have&nbsp;(like mine) then yes it has enough power to do what you want it to do. Mine runs simultaneously&nbsp;Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe InDesign, Adobe Dreamweaver and&nbsp;Adobe Acrobat, plus Office Apps Word, Excel
 and&nbsp;Outlook and&nbsp;Skype and browser with multiple tabs&nbsp;be that Edge or Chrome perfectly well with no real dips in performance. So, you should be ok.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this helps you out.</p>

            <p>Salut Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank for the generous reply, I have finally upgraded to windows 10 without any major problem, just Windows Update tested my patience because my windows 7 was missing around 200 updates. I followed your instructions for the nvidia drivers and everything
 worked flawless. I installed visual studio too and every thing look fine. Now I had no time to check everything... but I can t make the fn keys for the brightness (for exemple) work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p>Louis.<br />

<p><span><span>Hi sheema88,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Are you trying to delete the songs copied to media player library?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2. What exactly happens when you try to delete the music?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Do you receive any error messages or codes?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You won't be able to delete songs on your memory card using windows media player. You can only delete the songs in Windows
 media player library.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Refer the link:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Remove items from the Windows Media Player Library</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Remove-items-from-the-Windows-Media-Player-Library" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Remove-items-from-the-Windows-Media-Player-Library</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You have to go the original location and choose music from there to delete it.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Insert your memory card into a supported card reader connected to the PC.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Select "Open folder to view files" in the dialog window that opens on the desktop.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. Or go to the "Start" menu and select the "Computer" folder. Double-click on the removable disk.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d. Locate the music file to be deleted. Right-click on the file and select Delete.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Hope this information is helpful.</span></span></p>
