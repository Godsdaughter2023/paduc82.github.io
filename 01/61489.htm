<h2>            Failed Network Diagnostic</h2>
                    Help!!! I recently setup a wireless network, and at first my laptop could not connect to my network...it would just say "Acquiring IP Address" and then do nothing.&nbsp; I manually entered the IP address, and now my laptop connects to the network.&nbsp; Problem
 is, when you try to open a web browser...nothing.&nbsp; It won't display a web page.&nbsp; Of course, I can connect through the ethernet without issues, and my brother's laptop connected from the start without issues.&nbsp; Any ideas?&nbsp; I ran the network diagnostic and the
 Internet Explorer Web Proxy 127.0.0.1 failed...but when you open up the tab, it says "PASSED."&nbsp; Any help on this would be much appreciated!!!

<p>The 127.0.0.1 IP address belongs to your localhost; i.e., the local machine. There is no reason it would be used as a proxy since that would prevent the computer from ever reaching the Internet. I don't know how you have set up your wireless network but
 obviously it is wrong. You left out how you connect to the Internet (DSL/cable/satellite) and what type of router you're using so all I can do is give you these general instructions for setting up a wireless network. If you need further help after that, please
 post back and clarify your situation. Also make sure you have set your wireless network adapter to get its IP and DNS addresses automatically. Unless you have a special situation that you didn't mention, you would not want to be using a proxy server.</p>
<p><span>Setting up a router is quite simple. Normally you run the CD that came with the router and follow the instructions. But you can set up the router without a CD. Note that if you have cable Internet, for the connection you just
 set the router to do DHCP (or there may even be a choice of cable for you to select). If you have DSL Internet, you usually select PPoe and enter the username and password which you chose when originally setting up the DSL connection. So:<br />
<br />
1. Turn off the power to your cable modem.<br />
2. Attach a cat5e ethernet cable (usually provided with the router) going from the router's Internet/WAN port to the cable modem's ethernet port.<br />
3. Attach a cat5e ethernet cable going from your computer's network adapter to one of the ports on the router. If you don't have an ethernet cable (because you were using USB), you will need to go to the store and buy one.<br />
4. Turn on the cable modem. After all the lights are on, turn on the router.<br />
<br />
To configure the router:<br />
<br />
Have a computer connected to the router with an ethernet cable. Examples given are for a Linksys router. Refer to your router manual or the router mftr.'s website for default settings if you don't have a Linksys. Open a browser such as Internet Explorer or
 Firefox and in the addressbar type:<br />
<br />
http://192.168.1.1 [enter] (this is the router's default IP address, which varies from router to router so check your manual)<br />
<br />
This will bring you to&nbsp;router's login screen. The default username is left blank and the Linksys default password is "admin" without the quotes. Enter that information. You are now in the router's configuration utility. Your configuration utility may differ
 slightly from mine. The first thing to do is change the default password because *everyone* knows the default passwords for various routers.<br />
<br />
Click on the Administration link at the top of the page. Enter your new password.
 username blank and put in your new password to get back into the configuration utility.<br />
<br />
Now click on the Wireless link at the top of the page. Change the Wireless Network Name (SSID) from the default to something you will recognize. I suggest that my clients not use their family name as the SSID. For example, you might wish to name your wireless
 network "CastleAnthrax" or the like. ;-)<br />
<br />
Click the Save Settings and when you get the prompt that your changes were successful, click on the Wireless Security link which is right next to the Basic Wireless Settings link (where you changed your SSID). Most computers purchased within the last 4 years
 have wireless hardware that will support WPA2-Personal (also called WPA2-PSK). This is the encryption level you want. If your wireless hardware is older, use WPA. Do not use WEP as that is easily cracked within minutes. So go ahead and set the Security Mode
 to WPA2-Personal. Do that and enter a passphrase. For example, you might use the passphrase, "Here be dragons, beware you scurvy dogs!". The passphrase is what you will enter on any computers that are allowed to connect to the wireless network.
<br />
At this point, your router is configured and if the computer you were using to configure the router is normally going to connect wirelessly, disconnect the ethernet cable and the computer's wireless feature should see your new network. Enter the passphrase
 you created (exactly as you wrote it with all capitalization and punctuation) to join the network and start surfing.<br />

<p>Thanks for the reply!&nbsp; I'm definitely not an expert in networking, but I have setup a quite a few.&nbsp; I've never been stumped like this before.&nbsp; Here's a little bit more info.&nbsp; I have:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Cable internet/Motorola modem</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Linksys Dual-band N router</p>
<p>I set the network up like you would any wireless network...exactly how you stated above.&nbsp; I have disconnected/reconnected, and powered up/down several times to reset/setup the new router.&nbsp; No good.&nbsp; When I type the default IP address in the URL this is what
 I get:&nbsp;</p>
<p>"The connection has timed out. &nbsp; The server at 192.168.1.1 is taking too long to respond."&nbsp;</p>
<p>The network is setup to automatically to obtain both IP and DNS addresses, and DHCP is enabled.&nbsp; I used the IP/DNS address from a computer that will connect to the network, and when I manually entered the info. I can connect...no more getting stuck on "Acquiring
 network address."&nbsp; However, I cannot get a webpage to load (Explorer or Firefox) with the manual config.&nbsp; There is no reason why I shouldn't be able to connect...it finds and connects to other networks no problem!</p>

<p>If you are able to connect to the LAN when assigning an IP address but not the Internet, then you aren't getting DNS. Make sure you can connect to the Internet (get an IP and DNS) when directly connected to the cable modem. If you can't, then the fault is
 with the cable modem and/or on the ISP's side. If you can, try a different router; however, if other computers on the LAN successfully connect to the Internet wirelessly using that router you need to check whether a proxy server is set up on the troubled computer.</p>
<p>Look in Control Panel&gt;Internet Options&gt;Connections tab&gt;LAN button. Nothing should be in the proxy server section. Review what antivirus/security program(s) are in use on that machine. If you are using a third-party firewall, uninstall it. Don't just disable
 it, actually uninstall it. If your antivirus has a firewall component, disable it and also check to see if that program uses a proxy server for malware filtering. Make sure the target computer is virus/malware-free because quite a few varieties of malware
 set up a proxy server on the infected machine.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware</a></p>
<p>Another point which you haven't mentioned is whether this is a home or small company network using a Workgroup or whether this is a domain. That makes a difference since in a domain the server only looks to itself for DNS with forward lookup zones for Internet
 connectivity and the domain member workstations should only look to the server for DNS.</p>
<p>Also look at the Linksys' settings. A dual-band N router is a newish one (although hardware can certainly fail out of the box). I've noticed that many of the newer routers have a wireless PIN number feature and you should disable that and use your own passphrase.
 If you are using a passphrase and haven't disabled the PIN number (or whatever Linksys calls their version of this feature), that could also cause the issue.</p>

            OK...good advice!&nbsp; My problem lies with the driver.&nbsp; My older Broadcom driver does not support newer N network...b/g only!&nbsp; I have an buddy in IT whom stated that older network cards are inconsistent with hooking up to N networks.&nbsp; I still want the fastest
 router for my network (home), so I kept the N router and now run a ethernet connection through my powerline.&nbsp; Faster than wireless...it works throughout house.&nbsp; Still need wireless for PS3 and family/friends with better laptops than my own!&nbsp; When leave home,
 I still can connect to outside networks.&nbsp; Thanks for all you help...spot on info.!&nbsp;

HI..thanks for the suggestions, the webcam used to work fine with WinXP SP2 and I have the drivers for it. I tried running it in the&nbsp;compatibility&nbsp;mode that you suggested but to no avail. Is there anything else that can be done..? Thanks.

<h2>            The screen is black and in power safe mode</h2>
                    <p>Playing game online and sometimes just by clicking anywhere and the system went blank and in safe mode. Moving mouse didn't wake it up and now happens many times.&nbsp; This has happened a few weeks ago and when I return from vacation.&nbsp; What can I do?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I click those buttons on the monitor and it says:</p>
<p>"There is no signal coming from your computer.&nbsp; Press any key on the keyboard or move the mouse to wake it up.&nbsp; If there is no display, press the monitor button now to select the correct input source in the on-screen-display menu.&nbsp; The Input source shows:&nbsp;
 Auto select (checked), VGA and DVI-D "(should I leave it at Auto select?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Few days ago, I reset my computer it came back but it went back to safe mode again.&nbsp; Sometimes I wait awhile and the computer is back and then black out again when I click anywhere.&nbsp; Why is it happening now and not before?</p>
<p>

<p>Have you checked your cable connections at both ends (at computer motherboard/graphics card slot and at the monitor)?&nbsp; &nbsp;It could just be a bad connection or worse still a damaged cable plug or port.&nbsp; You will need to check this first before trying to work
 out what else could be causing your problem.&nbsp; &nbsp;Remember, don't just pull out these cables - they may have locking finger screws to secure them to the ports.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Input source:&nbsp; if your cable is a smaller ~15 pin type, then it will be a VGA cable.&nbsp; &nbsp;If it is slightly bigger (up to 29 pins) then this would be a DVI cable.&nbsp; You can select the appropriate cable.&nbsp; &nbsp;Sometimes, an HDMI cable is used for a monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other than the above solution, you may need to replace cables, monitor (this may be failing), damaged ports (on computer).&nbsp; &nbsp; Also, you may need to check your Power Supply Unit, motherboard, graphics card, etc.&nbsp; &nbsp;These tasks will need to be done by someone
 who knows what to check and how to rectify them.</p>

<p>I don't think that has anything to do with it.&nbsp; It now affects when shut off/log off....it goes blank and in power save mode.&nbsp; I did a trouble shoot for that&nbsp; and it "fixed" the problem but it still affects playing games each time I click somewhere and it
 goes to sleeping mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may have to contact Dell Computer but they mostly may charge me.&nbsp; I think it's the issue with Dell computer but I don't know how to change the setting for power saver mode.</p>
<p>

<p>Of course cable condition and location would be your primary checks.&nbsp; &nbsp;But if you believe that the problem lies elsewhere, then you will need to do other checks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are wanting to try disengaging your Power Plan settings to see if this fixes it, then you will need to go to your Power Options:&nbsp; &nbsp;Control Panel\System and Security\Power Options.&nbsp; &nbsp;Check the High Performance box as this will not allow the computer
 or HDD to sleep.&nbsp; &nbsp;As a further adjustment (if necessary) on this High Performance Plan, you can click on Change Plan Settings and then on Advanced Settings, and check if everything is as you want it here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As well, if your computer goes into Power Save mode when you switch Off, then you may want to check here:</p>
<p>Control Panel\System and Security\Power Options\Choose what the Power buttons do.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Windows cannot locate a suitable printer driver&#34;  PLEASE HELP&#33;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I have a HP Color Laserjet 3800N that is physically installed on a computer in our home office (running Windows 7).&nbsp; The computers are set up on a workgroup with printers and files shared.&nbsp; And, the printer works fine on that computer.&nbsp; I am trying to network
 the printer to a second printer in our workgroup, which runs Windows XP.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I go through the add printer wizard and when I get to add the printer, I receive a message "Windows cannot locate a suitable printer driver..."<br />
<br />
I have installed from the HP website the driver for XP and am not able to get the printer to add to the second computer.<br />
<br />
What is the solution?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Maria<br />

<p>First you need to check the ip address are in the same network, then switch off the firewall in both the systems, check the share permissions&nbsp;given to&nbsp;the printer........&nbsp;

<p>Every morning, after I leave my computer sleeping during the night, I find it in a state where Skype shows feedback the user I am chatting with is typing but I don't see his/her message. When I type and send the message, I don't see it neither.</p>
<p>Sometimes, pretty often I see this Error: </p>

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/fd31d56b-cc0a-4c7d-9231-0a85b7c9059c" title="KokoJambo1">
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to Skype Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are several reasons why you may receive a database error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the time this is due to a corrupted file. Can also be because of read/write permission on Mac.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried reinstalling Skype?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, I would recommend you to do that. If you continue to get this problem them it would be best to install the Classic Skype to test if the issue is with the version or with your Mac OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can download the classic from our download page via this
<strong><a href="https://www.skype.com/en/get-skype/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">LINK</a></strong></p>

<h2>            How to disable xbox360 controller in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    I connected my Xbox 260 controller to my laptop so i can use it in a game. I wanted to map the buttons using software called reWASD. I found that the software worked perfectly. I also found that there were buttons mapped of which i couldn't find the settings
 to. I tried everything including purchasing the full version of the software and removing it from my computer completely only to find the buttons were still mapped. I could use the Xbox controller in web browsers and other things within Windows, and the downside
 is that i can not turn it off. I've tried deleting several Xbox services and registry items, even deleting the joy.cpl file among others. i can not break this function so that i can use the controller the way i need. Does anyone have any advice on how to remove
 it or which update it came with so i can revert my pc. Thanks

<p>Hi Joey!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for using the xbox forums, I will be happy to help you out!</p>
<p>
</p><div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1); margin-left: 0">Set up a wired controller on Windows 10
<p>
</p><p>
</p><div>
<p>Follow these steps to install your Xbox 360 wired controller on Windows 10:</p>
<ol>
<li>Plug the Xbox 360 controller into any USB 2.0 or 3.0 port on the computer.</li><li>Windows 10 will automatically install drivers for your controller, so you won't have to download or install software other than Windows 10 updates. Once you see the pop-up notification that the drivers have been installed, you can use your controller.</li><li>Open a game or the Xbox app and test your controller by pressing a button, pulling a trigger, or moving a stick on the controller.</li></ol>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If your Xbox 360 wired controller is not detected by your PC, try plugging it into a different USB port, and then test it again.</li><li>If your controller still does not work, check that Windows 10 is fully updated. Install any updates and then try again.</li><li>Refer to your game documentation for information about how to configure the Xbox 360 controller for a specific game.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I also found How To Calibrate your 360 controller on a PC:</p>
<p>
</p><div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
Calibrate the controller
<div style="margin-left: 0; color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">
<p>When you perform a calibration, you set the range of motion for the axes of the controller. You don't have to calibrate the controller unless you want to customize the range of motion of the axes.</p>
<p>To calibrate the Xbox 360 Controller for Windows, plug your controller into one of your computer’s USB ports and follow these steps.</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the Game Controllers window:
<ol>
<li>In Windows 10, type&nbsp;<strong>joy.cpl&nbsp;</strong>in the Search box,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>and then select the joy.cpl result to bring up the<strong>Game Controllers&nbsp;</strong>window.</li><li>In Windows 8.1, swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then select&nbsp;<strong>Search</strong>. Type&nbsp;<strong>joy.cpl</strong>, and then select&nbsp;<strong>Game Controllers&nbsp;</strong>in the search results.</li><li>In Windows 7, select&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong>. In the&nbsp;<strong>Search programs and files</strong>&nbsp;box, type&nbsp;<strong>joy.cpl</strong>, and then select the&nbsp;<strong>Game Controllers&nbsp;</strong>icon when it appears.</li></ol>
</li><li>In the Game Controllers window, select&nbsp;<strong>XNA Gamepad</strong>, and then select&nbsp;<strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Select the&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>&nbsp;tab, and then select&nbsp;<strong>Calibrate</strong>.</li><li>Follow the steps in the Device Calibration Wizard.
<p><strong>Important&nbsp;</strong>When you're prompted to use the directional pad (D-pad), use the left stick instead. If you use the D-pad, the left stick configuration may be incorrect.</p>
</li><li>To save the new calibration settings, select&nbsp;<strong>Finish</strong>, and then select&nbsp;<strong>Apply</strong>.</li><li>Test the operation of the controller. If you're satisfied with the new settings, select&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>, and then select&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>&nbsp;again.
<p>If you're not satisfied, select&nbsp;<strong>Settings</strong>, and then select&nbsp;<strong>Reset to defaults</strong>. When you select&nbsp;<strong>Reset to defaults</strong>, the device controls are
 reset to the default settings that are obtained from the device</p>
</li></ol>
<p>Let us know if this is working for you and update us with the results!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>Completely removing the software does not necessarily remove all of its effects. Ambassadors usually work on the Sherlock Holmes principle of eliminating the probable until whatever remains, however unlikely, must be the truth, or in our case the next best
 solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have entirely ruled out the possibility that the software community linked above could help in terms of pointing to what has been changed then going to the next best solutions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. System restore to before when you used the software.</p>
<p>2. Back up your PC files and reinstall windows</p>

            I respect your response, please understand that i am a certified computer technician and an avid computer programmer. I do know how to uninstall a program. I build high performance computers and am very familiar with the software and hardware i use. I
 did a little homework on the issue myself which is why i started deleting registry files and disabling Windows services relating to xbox. As stated above i deleted the joy.cpl file but of course did not work.&nbsp;

<ol>
<li>Plug the Xbox 360 wired controller into any USB 2.0 or 3.0 port on the computer.</li><li>Windows 10 will automatically install drivers for your controller. Once you see the pop-up notification that the drivers have been installed, you can use your controller.</li></ol>

<p>Its a plug and play feature that can be used to navigate not only in games but in browsers and other parts of your desktop. The feature maps the controller automatically with no way to remap or disable it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If I understand you correctly, the "reWASD" software remapped some buttons to actual keyboard keys and mouse movement, so the controller is now interfering with your normal Windows usage, like web browsing?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, then I'd suggest you contact the <a href="https://forum.rewasd.com/forum/rewasd/technical-questions-aa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
reWASD community</a>, and to NOT remove or delete Windows internal files like joy.cpl (which is only the control panel for the joystick).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems that reWASD hooked itself into the system, and permanently changed something, which wasn't reverted when you uninstalled the software.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the only people to help you is the reWASD community. It would also help, if you knew which button mappings are causing you that trouble, so the main cause can be found, so they can help you on how to (un-)set these again.&nbsp;</p>

I have seen others with this problem from Brazil. It seems the game Dragon Age 2 is not available in that region. You will not be able to download it and they may switch the game to something else that is available, if possible. Digital games are region locked
 for various reasons, and unfortunately this game may be region locked.

<h3> the turtle guy  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;UNMOUNTABLE_BOOT_VOLUME&#34; - Windows 7 laptop will not boot, goes to Blue screen after &#34;Starting Windows&#34; screen</h2>
                    My computer crashed this afternoon (I was not manually downloading any Windows updates). It cut to a Blue Screen. It read "UNMOUNTABLE_BOOT_VOLUME". I turned the laptop off and restarted it, and after the "Starting Windows" screen, the laptop shows the
 BSoD for a split second and abruptly shuts off, restarting (using a Safe Mode option, I see it is the same BSoD as before). All Safe Modes lead to the same thing as starting Windows Normally, and running Startup Repair leads to a blank black screen with an
 big white cursor. all input has no effect at that point.

                    <p>
</p><p>Windows 7 Ultimate SP1 - Windows Update screen is stuck at 'Checking for updates'. Absolutely no activity. Just seems to sit at the progress bar going back and forth for ever. How do I troubleshoot further?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far tried with no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Reseeding the SoftwareDistribution, catroot folder as described here &gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.canadiantech.info/for-techies/windows-update-not-working/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p>2. Tried over WiFi and Ethernet Cable (with WiFi switched OFF).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Tried from different Internet Connection in a separate location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Rebooting several times and also keeping it in this state overnight (without letting it sleep).</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Restored via 'Windows System Restore' to a point we knew everything was working fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Updating the Windows Update Agent. <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/949104" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            I am having the same exact problem. It works just fine before I install SP 1. With non-SP1, Updates works just fine. I install SP1, BOOM! It stops working.

    <title>Win10 Log in Won&#39;t Recognize User Account Profiles - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> philip &#40;live.com&#35;philip&#41;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win10 Log in Won&#39;t Recognize User Account Profiles</h2>
                    <p>On one Win10 machine in our office--my assistant's compuer--there are 4 created account profiles:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>My account as administrator (I did not enable the built-in Administrator account).</li><li>My assistant's standard user account. She also has Office365 so she logs on with her email address.</li><li>A standard user account called "scanner" to which our networked printer can send scanned pdf documents.</li><li>A standard user account called "Check Deposit" which we set up for one purpose: to deposit checks. We have a check scanner from the bank which is connect to . My assistant typically handles the check deposits. By setting up a distinct user, we can deposit
 checks on her machine without having to log into her account.</li></ol>
<p>Two days ago, my assistant logged out of her account to log into the Check Deposit account but got the message, "The user name or password is incorrect. Try again."</p>
<p>
</p><p>She then called me. After confirming what she experienced, I logged into my administrator account. I confirmed the Check Deposit account profile existed along with the associated User folder. I then logged out but, when we tried to log into her account,
 we got the same message,&nbsp;"The user name or password is incorrect. Try again." Then same thing with the scanner account. The only account I could log into was my administrator account. (Later on, I enabled the built-in Administrator account and I can log in
 from that account as well.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>We tried creating new accounts, both administrator and standard user accounts, both with and without passwords, both with non-MS accounts and with Office365 accounts. From the login screen, we continue to get that same message. Yet, in both Settings|Accounts|Other
 People and lusrmgr.msc, all accounts are there. I also used lusrmgr.msc to reset the passwords on each type of account without any success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We also tried restoring point but we got an error message that the system could not restore and would have to return to the present state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I search here and the Web to see if others have had this problem and could not find any.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also was on the phone with Office365 Support and Micro Center Support (who sold me the PC a few months ago). I gave remote access to both and none could find a solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am left with doing a factory reset of Win10 but thought to post this in case someone else has the same problem.</p>

<h2>            Lifecam VX 2000 shows the light as though it&#39;s on whilst gaming</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have an unusual thing that appears to happen with my webcam. Whilst I'm playing a game, e.g. Call of Duty: Black Ops, the green light comes on on my webcam, as though it has been activated. The game contains no method of recording video and I don't see
 the need for it. It's not just CoD:BO, it also happens in several games. I can produce a list, if required. I was wondering if anyone knew as to why?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A guess might be, it's activating the microphone, but not 100% sure on it!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks for any advice given!</div>
<div><br />
</div>

    <title>Corrupted Profile Data and Freezing Xbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thecharmingone  say:</h3>
<h2>            Corrupted Profile Data and Freezing Xbox</h2>
                    
<p>I'm new to this forum, so I hope I've put this topic in the right place. &nbsp;Currently, I'm having a problem with my Xbox Live profile. &nbsp;Two days ago, I was playing a game of Black Ops Zombies with randoms over Xbox Live. &nbsp;For the first three hours, everything
 was fine - connections were good, minimal lag, etc. &nbsp;But all of sudden, out of nowhere, everything just seemed to lag. &nbsp;Loading screens were taking way too long to load, lag &nbsp;was occurring on the main title screen for Black Ops (which is weird since it has
 NEVER done that before), etc. &nbsp;I got fed up with it after awhile, and went back to the Xbox Live home screen and found a big "Connect to Xbox Live!" box in the center of my screen. &nbsp;I went over to the profile tab and found a greyed out avatar with zero gamer
 points, no avatar pictures, etc.</p>
<p>When I tried to regularly connect to Xbox Live, it wouldn't allow me. &nbsp;It said that I should test my connection, so I did. &nbsp;It turns out that my Xbox can hit my network, my network can hit the internet, and the internet can hit Xbox Live, so my next question
 was, "Why is it saying that I can't connect when the test shows that I have a connection?" &nbsp;After searching for roughly thirty or forty minutes, I came across my answer, a corrupted profile. &nbsp;I followed the steps (System &gt; Hard drive &gt; Profiles &gt; Select Profile
 &gt; Delete Profile &gt; Re-download), and it worked. &nbsp;My solution was fixed, or so I thought. &nbsp;Ever since I redownloaded my profile, my Xbox has been freezing. &nbsp;There was a time when I couldn't play forty-five minutes of a game without it freezing to the point
 that even pressing the power button to turn it off wouldn't register. &nbsp;I had to unplug the power chord from the wall to get the Xbox to shut off. &nbsp;(As a note, I got my Xbox way back in 2010, so it's two years old. &nbsp;It also has an 80GB hard drive with roughly
 37GB of space left.)</p>
<p>However, today, it didn't freeze. &nbsp;I was able to play Black Ops Zombies again without any hang up, but I found that a little strange. &nbsp;Why would the console constantly freeze two days before, but not today without me doing anything to try and fix it? &nbsp;I
 still haven't figured that out, but I digress. &nbsp;The real problem is what happened today. &nbsp;I was playing Black Ops Zombies again when the same problem that I had with the corrupted profile data happened again - long loading screens, horrendous amounts of lag,
 etc. &nbsp;I went back to the Xbox Live home screen once again and found that familiar greyed out avatar looking at me again, and I knew exactly what was wrong. &nbsp;My profile data was corrupt AGAIN. &nbsp;I followed the steps again, and I have fixed the problem, but I
 don't want to constantly have to delete my profile every two or three days just to play Xbox Live. &nbsp;Here are my questions:</p>
<p>What is causing my profile data to be corrupt?</p>
<p>Why has my profile data become corrupt twice?</p>
<p>How can I fix this problem so that I won't have to constantly delete my profile data?</p>
<p>Why is my Xbox constantly freezing?</p>
<p>Is there any way to stop my Xbox from freezing?</p>

            <p>If you have a HDD attached and, here are some <strong>possible</strong> answers for your questions</p>
<p>Here are my questions:</p>
<p>What is causing my profile data to be corrupt?</p>
<p>Your HDD might be failing, which can result in corrupt data</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Why has my profile data become corrupt twice?</p>
<p>same answer as the first question</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>How can I fix this problem so that I won't have to constantly delete my profile data?</p>
<p>you can try using a usb flash drive, to see if the hdd is the problem</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Why is my Xbox constantly freezing?</p>
<p>Might be caused by the failing hdd</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Is there any way to stop my Xbox from freezing?</p>
<p>You can try starting up without HDD connected, if it doesn't have any freezing issues anymore, your hdd is causing the problems.</p>
<p>So basically the best thing to do is connect a usb flash drive, copy/move your gamertag and save games just to be sure you won't loose them. and try starting the console without the hdd attached.</p>

<p>Check your Call of Duty games for corrupted data. If you play MW3, those files corrupt. A lot. And will spill over to other games.</p>
<p>Also, after deleting profile, clear your system cache ( <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../clear-system-cache</a> ), then redownload your profile. Clearing the cache is important to get rid of any corupt temporary files. Also helps when your console is lagging or freezing.</p>

<p>I've tried everything everyone has suggested, but nothing has worked. &nbsp;I thank all of you for your excellent and detailed advice, but it just hasn't worked. &nbsp;I went to Best Buy and they said that I'll have to ship it into Microsoft to get it repaired since
 it's the Xbox that has the problem, but it would cost roughly $100 to fix it. &nbsp;I don't feel like spending that kind of money on an Xbox that is already three years old and is almost toast anyways. &nbsp;I'll be taking the Xbox along with all of the games and selling
 them for a PS3. &nbsp;I'm sorry that it's come to this, but I feel that there is no other solution.</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I actually had the samething happen, with one exception, i have 2 hdd's. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;See ive had my xbox since 2008, its five years old, and has made the trip to microsoft and back already once for a red ring, so im somewhat surprised its lasted this long.
 &nbsp; &nbsp;About a month ago, the same symptoms as the o.p. began with me. Was playing forza 4, and it started to get really sluggish, but without being on live, this was just playing offline. Around the same time my gf's saves began corrupting, she got pissed off
 with it and stopped playing sims, my dumbass didn't pay any mind to it, until, forza told me that my profile was corrupt, delete it and start a new one....yes forza told me that exactly. &nbsp; My guitar hero warriors of rock also completely corrupted the next
 day the entire save just gone. &nbsp; thinking oh crap ima have to buy a new xbox, i stopped playing for a while and started playing my ps2 again, got half way through GT4 and remembered i had my old 20gb hdd sitting around that i had upgraded from to the 120 that
 was now trash it seemed.</p>
<p>I loaded my profile back on the old hdd, everthing fixed, no lag, nothing, just a lack of space. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;so today i had the idea to put the other hdd back on, it still runs and everything, but i thought what would happen if i redownloaded my profile, if i
 could somehow get my saves back?</p>

<p>Hi Michael! &nbsp;Man, sorry to hear about your files! &nbsp;It does sound like that hard drive may not be in good shape. &nbsp;You can try transferring the files to a different storage device, but honestly, once it's displaying as corrupt, it likely will not be possible
 to recover the data I'm afraid.</p>

<h3> finessity  say:</h3>
<h2>            Expand Gamertags</h2>
                    
<p>Please, allow there to be dashes(-) or underscores(_) in the gamertag, limit it to one dash(-) or (_) per gamertag or whatever you think is right but please, if is so hard to find a normal, cool, original gamertag without having to use a number or a bunch
 of extra letters. I think the expansion would allow players to have more fun with their names and you know, more name changes means more $$$$$. I just really want an expansion because of how difficult I find it to be to find a good gamertag and because I'm
 sure that about 90% of the original or cool gamertag that are all taken are all on inactive accounts. Any way to clear this up, open up more gamertag, create opportunities for new and better gamertag, ANYTHING IS FINE WITH ME!</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>As GG said, you're not being creative enough, you can make a gamertag that's relatable to you without the use of dashes or underscores.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm sure if they did add the dash or underscores it would be considered the same as a space, so Digital_Assassin would equal DigitalAssassin and it wouldn't make it any easier to create a tag.</p>
<p>I do think that maybe they should recycle some of the ones that have been reserved and never used, but how do you make that process fair to the community? It's a tricky one.</p>

<p>They could randomly free up some up every now and again but not say anything it to the public. Keep it hush hush. But I guess it would only take a lucky individual to tell people and then the gamertag scalping would begin all over again due to word of mouth.

<div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
<div>a. Which trial program did you use to customize the fonts?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1. </strong>You can restore the default font and remove any changes that you've made to your display settings from Appearance and Personalization.<br />
Here’s how:<br />
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Fonts by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking Appearance and Personalization, and then clicking Fonts.
<br />
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the left pane, click Font settings.<br />
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Restore default font settings.</div>
<div>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go through each item and reset fonts (where appropriate) to Segoe UI 9pt, not bold, not italic. (All the settings in a default Win7 or Vista machine will be Segoe UI 9pt.)<br />
<strong>Note:</strong><br />
This also removes all manual changes that you've made to your display settings.</div>
<div><strong>Method 2. </strong>If this doesn't work or I should say, if all your settings here are already Segoe UI 9pt then you have probably inadvertently changed your ClearType settings. ClearType is how Windows draws fonts on-screen, and depending on the
 screen, different settings will be needed for optimal font display.</div>
<p>To fix this in Win7:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the desktop. Choose "Personalize." </li><li>Click "Display" </li><li>Click "Adjust ClearType Text" </li><li>A window will pop up. Make sure its checkbox ("Turn on ClearType") is checked. Click "Next."
</li><li>Follow the prompts through the wizard, adjusting until the fonts look "right" again.
</li></ol>
<p>I've listed couple of links that could be of assistance to you.<br />

<h2>            Audio Problem</h2>
                    <p>Hi, if someone knows how to help me, please help!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, my laptop (Lenovo yoga 910) started to experience a problem where after it comes back from sleep or after it comes back from shutting down, there is no sound, even though none of my sound is muted. I've tried everything, as in I troubleshooted
 my audio, uninstalled and reinstalled the audio drive, I've tried updating my drive only to see that its already the latest driver, I've also tried to turn off sleep mode, but there is no option for that, and i even reset my whole entire computer. The only
 way to get back my sound is to restart, but its getting frustratingly annoying to always restart just to get the sound back. So, please, if anyone knows how to get back the sound, please tell me! Thank you!</p>

<p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>For accuracy, please help us by identifying the complete name of your audio driver. Can you also identify its service(s) under Services.msc? The reason we ask for this is its possibility of the driver being on manual startup status.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, please check if the following services (in addition to your audio driver's respective services) are enabled, and set to run automatically:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><strong>Windows Audio</strong></li><li><strong>Windows Audio Endpoint Builder</strong></li></ul>
