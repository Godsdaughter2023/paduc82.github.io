            <p>Removing it without using Safely Remove Hardware ought not to cause corruption, unless something was writing to the drive at the exact time of extraction.&nbsp; The same applies to physical damage to the drive too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Excitedly, and roughly, disconnecting the drive might damage both male and female USB connectors.</p>

From my non-lawyer perspective, I see it as Linux is running on the same device (computer hardware), and dual-booting doesn't seem to fall under any of the "Multi use scenarios", so the license I have to the font files is just as valid when using it under Linux
 as when running under Windows. Is that right? Or is there something in the licensing which means that "device" is defined in a way such that my computer becomes different devices depending upon which OS it's currently running?</p>

<h2>            Possible to reinstall a rollbacked back update&#63;</h2>
                    I was installing some joystick drives to my computer the other day and the install froze up and the uninstaller wouldn't run. At the same time during restarts to setup the drives, a Windows update installed. I tried to rollback just to get rid of the new
 drivers I installed, which also got rid of the Windows update. Ended up not getting rid of the drivers and had to remove them another way. Is there a way to get the Windows update to install again?

            Hi Shaun,<br />
<br />
Windows 10 periodically check for updates. It will automatically download and install the updates when available. However, since it has been installed before, let's go ahead and manually check for the updates. Follow the steps below:<br />
<br />
1. Click the <strong>Windows</strong> logo, then select <strong>Settings</strong>.<br />
2. Go to <strong>Update &amp; Security</strong>, select <strong>Windows Update</strong>.<br />
3. Click <strong>Check for updates</strong>. <br />
<br />
If Windows Update says your PC is up to date, you have all the updates that are currently available.<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes.<br />
<br />
Regards.

<h2>            Cannot connect my Epson sx235w to my laptop wirelessly...</h2>
                    Hi, <br />
<br />
I just bought a wireless printer (Epson sx235w) and I can't seem to connect it to my laptop and set up the wireless use. I connected the printer with the laptop via a USB cable and the network signal is very strong,<br />
It appear to have something to do with IP addresses, which I found by running a test-print. Still not working (I also turned off my anti-virus while trying).
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;I am getting a bit desperate and have absolutely no clue on how to go about this !
<br />
<br />
Any help much appreciated, cheers !

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Thanks for your reply.<br />
<br />
How do I do that exactly, with the browser ? Just type in the IP address and press enter ? I tried and got a message of error as a result... No page downloaded.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the IP address I got from the print-test (192.168.192.168) does not seem to be right : it failed to be recognised by the dos prompt command. How do I find the right IP address ?<br />
<br />
Anything else I can try ?<br />
<br />
Thanks very much !<br />
<br />

<p>I had tried to run one but it never got going - and I belatedly realized I didn't have to run it.&nbsp; It won't run yet I can't cancel it so I can defrag.&nbsp;&nbsp;I would really rather just cancel it than run it,&nbsp; HELP!!!!!</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            When trying to defragment a volume and Disk Defragmenter reports:<br />
<br />
Disk Defragmenter has detected that Chkdsk is scheduled to run on this volume: (C:)
<br />
Please run Chkdsk /f. <br />
<br />
That message doesn't mean you have a chkdsk scheduled - that means the "dirty" bit on the volume you are trying to defragment has been set and XP
<i>needs </i>to run a chkdsk on the volume before you can defragment it.<br />
<br />
You can still defragment a volume when there is a chkdsk scheduled to run.&nbsp; Non believers, try it.<br />
<br />
The dirty bit can be set on a volume from a power interruption, aborted restart, ungraceful shutdown, etc.&nbsp; Have any of those event occurred?<br />
<br />
You can query the dirty bit on a volume from the Command Prompt window.<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
cmd<br />
<br />
Click OK to open the Command Prompt window.<br />
<br />
To query the dirty bit on drive C, type:<br />
<br />
fsutil&nbsp; dirty&nbsp; query&nbsp; C:<br />
<br />
Sample output: <br />
Volume C: is dirty<br />
Volume C: is not dirty<br />
<br />
Is your volume dirty or is it not dirty?<br />
<br />
Type 'exit' to close the Command Prompt window.<br />
<br />
No amount of entering commands or registry edits will clear the dirty bit on a volume (sorry Microsoft engaged Support Engineer "experts").<br />
<br />
The only thing that can clear the dirty bit on a volume is a chkdsk with error correction and that can only run when the volume is not in use - either from the XP Recovery Console or you can schedule it to run the next time XP starts, and you may need to run
 it more than once.<br />
<br />
To schedule chkdsk with error correction to run on the C drive on the next reboot, click Start Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
chkdsk&nbsp; c:&nbsp; /r<br />
<br />
Click OK and respond in the affirmative to the question to schedule the chkdsk to run the next time the system restarts, then restart.<br />
<br />
Depending on the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume and what chkdsk finds to do, it may take a long time for chkdsk to complete (several hours) or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'.
<br />
<br />
Be patient and do not try to interrupt or stop it. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing or you can hear the HDD "working", chkdsk is doing something. &nbsp;Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear to go backwards
 sometimes.<br />
<br />
Now that you know how to check the dirty but, you can check the dirty bit again when the chkdsk with error correction is finished to see if you need to run it again.<br />
<br />
When chkdsk runs automatically on a reboot either because XP thinks it needs to (perhaps your NTFS volume has been marked as dirty) or you choose to schedule the chkdsk with error correction on the next reboot, the results are shown in the Event Viewer Application
 log.&nbsp; You need to look there for the chkdsk log to see what happened and any problems after chkdsk has run.<br />
<br />
To see the results of a chkdsk that runs on reboot, you must look in the Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
To see the Event Viewer logs, click Start, Settings, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
A shortcut to Event Viewer is to click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
eventvwr.msc<br />
<br />
Click OK to launch the Event Viewer.<br />
<br />
Look in the Application log for a recent event sourced by Winlogon, something like:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Information<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Winlogon<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />

            dirty means you will not be running a defrag from Windows until things are not dirty.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
You can choose some third party defagmenters that will do, but why is the volume dirty, how did it get that way, can you fix it and how to prevent it from happening again?&nbsp; Something has gone wrong somewhere.<br />
<br />
It is good that you now know how to check it.<br />
<br />
That is not necessarily a bad thing - you just need to see if you can fix it and sometimes you can't from XP.<br />
<br />
The only thing that will clear the dirty bit is a clean run of chkdsk with error correction.<br />
<br />
If I were you, I would make yourself a Hiren's Boot CD and run the chkdsk with error correction from there.&nbsp; I don't know how to query the dirty bit from Hiren's so when it is done you will have to reboot XP and query the dirty bit again.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
You may have to run the chkdsk multiple times and check the dirty bit after every run.&nbsp; It may take some time to run the chkdsks...<br />
<br />
It is possible that your HDD has some problem where the dirty bit will never clear.&nbsp; The manufacturer of your HDD may have some tools to use to try to fix it, or you can tell XP not to pay attention to the dirty bit, but that may not be a good idea if the HDD
 has really failed or is about to fail.<br />
<br />
I would start here:<br />
<br />
Make yourself a Hiren's Boot CD which you can download from here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/</a><br />
<br />
The ZIP file is large, so the download will probably take a little while to complete bit it is worth it.&nbsp; Then unzip the download to extract the Hirens.BootCD.ISO file that will be used to create your new bootable CD.<br />
<br />
Creating a bootable CD from a .ISO file is not the same as just copying the .ISO file to a blank CD.&nbsp; You have to use software that understands how to burn a .ISO file to a CD to create a bootable CD.<br />
<br />
In the Hiren's ZIP file are the BurnToCD.cmd file that you can double click to launch it, but I have never used it and prefer to use ImgBurn.<br />
<br />
If you need a free and easy CD burning software package, here is a popular free program:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.imgburn.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.imgburn.com/</a><br />
<br />
Like many third party programs you might install, the ImgBurn installation defaults to installing things you probably don't want installed on your system in the form of extra Internet browser toolbars or may make other adjustments to your browser.&nbsp; You don't
 want to install any of that so you have to pay attention during the installation.<br />
<br />
When clicking through the installation screens be sure to pay attention to the screens and always choose a Custom install and UNcheck the following (or any other things like it):<br />
<br />
UNcheck:<br />
<br />
Install the AVG toolbar and set AVG Secure Search as my default search provider<br />
Set AVG Secure Search as my homepage and newly opened tabs<br />
<br />
Choose custom installation again and UNcheck the following:<br />
<br />
Uncheck:<br />
Install QuickShare<br />
<br />
There could be other things too.<br />
<br />
Here are some instructions for ImgBurn:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://forum.imgburn.com/index.php?showtopic=61</a><br />
<br />
It would be a good idea to test your new bootable CD on a computer that is working.<br />
<br />
You may need to adjust the computer BIOS settings to use the CD ROM drive as the first boot device instead of the hard disk.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
These adjustments are&nbsp; made before Windows tries to load.&nbsp; If you miss it, you will have to reboot the system again.<br />
<br />
When booting on the Hiren's CD you will see a menu of options.&nbsp; Choose the Mini XP option.&nbsp; Then it will appear that Windows is being loaded and you will be presented with a desktop that has the look and feel of the Windows Explorer interface you are already
 used to using.<br />
<br />
Remember:&nbsp; You did not boot on your hard disk - you booted into the Hiren's desktop.<br />
<br />
One way to check the disk for errors is to open My Computer and right click your afflicted drive and choose Properties, Tools, Error-checking, Check Now... put a check mark in both the boxes and then Start.<br />
<br />
Sometimes that doesn't work, so you can also click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
<b>cmd</b><br />
<br />
Click OK to open a Command Prompt window and enter the following command (assuming XP is installed on your C drive)<br />
<br />
<b>chkdsk&nbsp; c:&nbsp; /r</b><br />
<br />
This disk checking can take a long time (perhaps several to many hours) depending on the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume and what the disk checking finds to do.
<br />
<br />
<p>Let chkdsk finish and correct any problems it might find.&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Depending on the the speed of your system, the size of the volume, the amount of data on the volume and what chkdsk finds to do, it may take a long time for chkdsk with error correction to complete (several to many hours) or it may appear to&nbsp;be 'stuck'.&nbsp;
 Be patient. &nbsp;If the HDD light is still flashing, chkdsk is doing something so don't interrupt it.&nbsp; It will finish eventually one way or the other.&nbsp; Keep an eye on the percentage amount&nbsp;to be sure it is still making progress. &nbsp;It may even appear to go backwards
 sometimes.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>You may have to run the chkdsk&nbsp; /r&nbsp; it more than once.</p>

<h2>            Skype messaging privacy</h2>
                    Hi! We love Skype but have a few questions:<br />
is everything we type being recorded/stored?&nbsp; and is it searchable/accessible by everyone within the company? or just the administrator?&nbsp;<br />
lets say i am just a basic user. can i search what some other user said to another user? or can only admin do that? or no one?&nbsp;<br />
just fyi, we are using skype as a part of our office 365. thanks.

                    <p>Original title: Problem with Windows 8 and Turbotax</p>
<p>Previously using Windows XP and Turbotax, and no problems of the current nature!&nbsp; Switched to a new PC running Windows 8, then tried to install Turbotax for years 2009 thru 2012, but each time get an error code 1935.&nbsp; Seems there is a problem with the .NET
 family?&nbsp; I have viewed some of the posts, even back to year 2010 with a similar problem, but no one seems to post a resolution?&nbsp; Is there any way to get Microsoft support to chip in; having tried, but no takers.&nbsp; I have spent hours with Turbotax tech support,
 but no resolutions, just turning me over to Microsoft (800-642-7676).&nbsp; I have tried to tag several posts in the MCF, but no resolution, YET!<br />

                    We are having two continuing issues with Skype: 1. Frequent disconnects. 2. Frequent instances where I hear them but they don't hear me. &nbsp;Is this more likely to be a WiFi problem, a Skype problem or a computer problem? Secondly, What is the best order
 of steps for diagnosis?<br />

<p>Hi Michael,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype normally disconnects when there is not enough Internet speed to cover your calls. As a suggestion, please reset your router and try to make a call again to test if you will still experience the same problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you will still experience the same problem, please respond to this thread with the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>The exact version of Skype that you're using.</li><li>Try to connect with a different Internet connection source and let us know how it'll turn out for you.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I look forward to your response.</p>

    <title>Vista boot repair - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tom_g35  say:</h3>
<h2>            Vista boot repair</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Packard bell machine has Vista 32 bit home premium&nbsp;installed. My malware scanner reported an item of malware in the boot menu, and removed it. Now Vista won't boot, just loops to the Packard bell splash screen, pressing F8 just give me the option to launch
 windows normally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've got the installation disks which I created when I first got the machine, but reinstalling windows to fix a boot issue seems a bit extreme. I don't have access to a full Vista disk to run a repair.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have found a couple of sites offering repair disks but one wants $20 and the other one is free but has a bundled anti virus suite included (so I won't be touching that).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know of a site that will just offer me a boot repair disk? Could I use a windows 7 disk to do a repair instead or do I have to spend $20, or spend the next two days totally re-installing windows?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. You normally&nbsp;tap F8 to go into Safe Mode, etc instead of pressing/holding it down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp;I don't know any&nbsp;sites offering that repair disk for free that are legit or approved by Microsoft; so you would be taking your chances.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Windows 7 disk is not for repairing Vista</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Neosmart offers the Repair disk but it is not for free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the guide to using the Repair Options while using a Microsoft Vista DVD&nbsp; or Repair DVD.</p>
<p>If a friend or work acquantance of yours&nbsp;has one, you may borrow and use it for Repairs.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/repair-windows-with-windows-startup-repair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/repair-windows-with-windows-startup-repair/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not have or can not borrow a Microsoft DVD there is&nbsp;a download of a Vista&nbsp;Startup Repair ISO file available&nbsp;which you can make into a Bootable disk to do the above&nbsp;Startup Repair and&nbsp;that&nbsp;method&nbsp;is recommended by a lot of posters in these Forums.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you have to buy it.</p>
<p>Here is a link to it:</p>

<h2>            Alexa for Windows 10</h2>
                    I was able to install the app and everything is working fine except playing music sounds absolutely terrible. I have attempted to play other music directly from the computer and everything is working fine. What can I do to make the music that Alexa is

    <title>How do I unzip files without an &#34;extract all&#34; option&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ma21cuteboy  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I unzip files without an &#34;extract all&#34; option&#63; PLEASE HELP&#33;</h2>
                    I downloaded some digital scrapbooking papers, to a file and went to open it, but it doesn't have a zipper in front of it, it has the "e" for Internet Explorer in front of it, and when I open it it continuously opens{flashes} a lot of them without the
 files inside. So I in turn&nbsp;have to shut down my computer using&nbsp;ctl-alt-delt.&nbsp;I also noticed that I don't have an "extract all" option to extract my files. What am I doing wrong, and how do I fix it?

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p><span>If the problem is occuring with ALL programs, then go&nbsp;to<span><a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2008/06/22/reset-and-fix-broken-windows-vista-file-ext-and-type-associations-include-exe-com-sys-zip-lnk-folder-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.mydigitallife.info/2008/06/22/reset-and-fix-broken-windows-vista-file-ext-and-type-associations-include-exe-com-sys-zip-lnk-folder-drive/</span></span></a><span>.
 and run the problem for EXE files and that shouold restore the EXE file association and resolve that problem (but not the ZIP problem - that folllows).</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If
 the problem is that all your icons show the Internet Explorer icon, then rebuild the icon cashe as follows:<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/117229-icon-cache-rebuild.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/117229-icon-cache-rebuild.html</a>&nbsp;and that
 should fix that problem.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I
 only mention these because I'm not quite sure what your problem is and include these only if they apply.&nbsp; If they don't apply, ignore them.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>=======================================================================================================================&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>If it is only a ZIP problem (or it was more and the above procedures fixed the other issues), you can take it to a computer repair
 shop and spend your money, or you can do this yourself.&nbsp; If you review the folllowing articles and do the procedures to reset the ZIP file association (and/or install 7-Zip as an alternative) then I believe you can do this yourself and save yourself some money.&nbsp;
 The decision is yours.&nbsp; I would at least look it over to see if you feel comfortable with the procedures and guidelines.</span></p>
<p><span>Zip file associations have been messed up somehow and need to be repaired (I'm not sure what caused it - perhaps some inadvertent
 setting or hidden keyboard command).<br />
<br />
Here's a link to how to restore the zip file association in Vista: </span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/65254-zip-file-support-restore.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/65254-zip-file-support-restore.html</span></span></a><span>
 .</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Here's another link on how to turn compressed folders on and off in Vista: </span>
<a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/93827-zip-file-compressed-folders.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/93827-zip-file-compressed-folders.html</span></span></a><span>.<br />
<br />
</span><span>Between these links, you should be able to restore zip files to the compressed folder association and not with open files - in effect, returning things
 to their default settings.</span></p>
<p><span>If you don’t like Vista’s program, try 7-Zip at:<a href="http://www.7-zip.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.7-zip.org/</a> and don’t forget to change the file association of
 Zip files to this new program if you decide to use it:<a href="http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/5100-10878_11-6172036.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://articles.techrepublic.com.com/5100-10878_11-6172036.html</a> .<br />
<br />
Here are a few additional links that may be of help if the above three do not resolve the problem:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/91920-unassociate-file-extention-type.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/91920-unassociate-file-extention-type.html</span></span></a></span><span>,</span><span><a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/2008/06/22/restore-and-reset-file-association-in-windows-vista-back-to-original-default/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.mydigitallife.info/2008/06/22/restore-and-reset-file-association-in-windows-vista-back-to-original-default/</span></span></a></span><span>,
 and </span><span><a href="http://www.winhelponline.com/articles/105/1/File-association-fixes-for-Windows-Vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.winhelponline.com/articles/105/1/File-association-fixes-for-Windows-Vista.html</span></span></a></span><span>.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps and I hope you give it a try.&nbsp; I'd hate to see you spend your money on something you can fix perfectly well on your own if you take your time and follow the instructions carefully.&nbsp;I wish we had the ability to remote into another computer
 to work on it directly, but they don't give us that capability and it costs much too much to buy it unless you need to use it frequently (and are getting paid which is not the case here).</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

<p>This is usually a feature of your keyboard drivers or utility software so check with the manufacturer to see how to enable and disable this feature. Windows does not include it natively - it is not part of Windows 7.</p>

<h2>            Cannot download profile - games for windows live &#40;PC&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm unable to boot/download my Windows live profile to my computer in order to play Dark Souls on my PC.</p>

<p>My current internet connection is based around a 3G Broadband from 3, (Huawei model).</p>
<p><br />
I've been checking UPnP settings and firewalls, and nothing that's supposed to be a problem is activated/unactivated. The game/Log in menu in the game announces that the connection to Windows Live isn't working, but i'm still able to log in in my browsers and
 play other games.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Simply put: Why wont the game connect to Windows live and fetch my profile.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>The problem is the server side (GFWL).</p>
<p>An announcement was made recently regarding to GFWL sign in issues.</p>

    <title>My Windows 10 tablet is stuck at 64&#37; installation level - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            My Windows 10 tablet is stuck at 64&#37; installation level</h2>
                    <p>Got a new Pendo Pad 10.1 with Windows 10 pre installed.&nbsp; However, while trying to factory reset it, came with the error that said the computer restarted unexpectedly or encountered an error and installation could not be completed and that the computer needs
 to be restarted for installation to complete.&nbsp; I followed a youtube video which helped solved the problem by editing the registry keys.&nbsp; However, now it is stuck on 64% and reboots over and over.&nbsp; I tried to get to the boot menu and tried secure boot and all
 with no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I came across this page, <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/windows-install-stuck-at-64-and-is-constantly/e00398e2-d4ce-4918-8e3f-4b4ba508e5e1">
http://answers.microsoft.com/</a>but my concern is that I am trying to upgrade from Windows10 to Windows 10 - so if someone could confirm that this would work, that would be great.&nbsp; I do not want to purchase another license (when my tablet came with a preinstalled version) and try the
 clean install.&nbsp; Any help would be highly appreciated.</p>

            <p>The device already has a digital entitlement, so it would automatically reactivate when you reinstall Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Power down the computer. Unplug it, then wait 20 mins to 1 hour.</li><li>Disconnect it from the Internet (unplug Ethernet or turn off Wi-Fi).</li><li>Plug it again, ensure it remains disconnected from the Internet then start computer.</li><li>See if it completes setup.</li><li>If setup completes and you see the desktop with the ability to click Start and launch programs, proceed to reconnect to the Internet.
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If that does not work, you will likely have to investin a micro-USB connector that can connect and boot from a USB thumbdrive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Download then create a bootable copy of Windows 10 then perform a custom install:</p>
