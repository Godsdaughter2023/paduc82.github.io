            Thank you but unfortunately none of this is working for me at all. I was able to log into my microsoft account and under basics I was able to insert my name but this did not do anything when I shut my laptop off and turned it back on it still displays
 my email address. Also I only want my first name displayed when I go to log into my laptop but my live account asks for both first and last name before it can save changes. As for this email address to name option that you mentioned I did not see a single
 option under basics&gt; edit name that has this. I also don't see account option so I can't find the "your tab" that you mentioned here so I am stuck not knowing how to change the profile picture.

    <title>How do I install AutoCAD 2007 on Windows 7&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> phnx428  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I install AutoCAD 2007 on Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    I have recently purchased a new system, upgrading to a 64 bit system with Windows 7 (home edition).&nbsp; I would like to install an&nbsp;AutoCAD program on the new computer... Preferably&nbsp;AutoCAD 2007&nbsp; (( I have versions R14 and 2007 ))&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I do not own or operate a&nbsp;business, and my use of AutoCAD does not generate an income, so it is not cost effective to run out and buy a new copy of AutoCAD every time it is updated (gets expensive).&nbsp; So running out and buying Autodesk - AutoCAD 2010 is not
 an option. <br />
<br />
So what can I do to run and operate one of&nbsp;these two&nbsp;versions of AutoCAD on this new system?&nbsp; (( I really need to get it up and running. )) &lt;&lt; pulls hair &gt;&gt;&nbsp; I thought converting over to Windows 7 from XP would be GREAT... but NOW I am starting to regret it!!

<p>Hello phnx428,<br />
<br />
Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
From the AutoCad website:<br />
Both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of AutoCAD® 2010 and AutoCAD® LT® 2010 are compatible with and supported on Microsoft Windows® 7.</p>
<p>Autodesk does not officially support 2009 and older versions of AutoCAD and AutoCAD LT on Windows 7. If you choose to run older versions of AutoCAD on the Windows 7 operating system, you may opt to use Windows compatibility mode.<br />
<br />
I would try to install in Compatibility Mode for XP or Vista. If you have an older application for Windows XP or Vista that doesn't run in Windows 7, you may be able to get it working properly by running the program in compatibility mode.</p>
<p>1. To begin, find the application or shortcut that is causing the problem, then right click on it and select Properties.<br />
2. Then, select Compatibility from the tabbed menu at the top of the properties page:<br />
3. Now, check the "Run this program in compatibility mode for..." box and select the OS you wish to emulate. For most applications, it will be Windows XP SP2. Once you are done, click OK.<br />
4. When you next launch the application it should run under compatibility mode using the OS you selected. If it still fails to run correctly, try another OS selection in step 3 and try again.<br />
<br />
I hope this will help to resolve your issue. If not, you will need to contact AutoCad to see if there are any workarounds.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,</p>

                    <p>Hi There,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it ever advisable not to run Chkdsk (Via Windows 7)? Can it do more harm than good, if you don't know what you doing:-)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep on receiving error 41 and was told this is due to the hard drive, yet ChkDsk did not show any problems.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>No, not particularly. It depends entirely on the parameters/flags you use as well, but in general, if chkdsk cannot fix problems, it implies your drive is too far gone. For example, if you run /r to locate bad sectors and recover readable information (implies
 /f with the addition of physical error analysis), and it notes it cannot fix, etc, you should at that point back up any data and replace the drive ASAP.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would not be so quick to judge a drive, some people blame drives simply because they are not aware what else it can be.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)"><strong>In order to assist you, we will need the .DMP files to analyze what exactly occurred at the time of the crash, etc.
</strong></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1. </strong>Navigate to the %systemroot%\Minidump folder.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Copy any and all DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop and then zip up these files.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. </strong>Upload the zip containing the .DMP files to Onedrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply. Preferred sites: Onedrive, Mediafire, Dropbox, etc. Nothing with wait-timers, download managers, etc.<br />
<br />
<strong>4 (optional):</strong> The type of .DMP files located in the Minidump folder are known as Small Memory Dumps. In %systemroot% there will be what is known as a Kernel-Dump (if your system is set to generate). It is labeled MEMORY.DMP. The difference
 between Small Memory Dumps and Kernel-Dumps in the simplest definition is a Kernel-Dump contains
<em><strong>much </strong></em>more information at the time of the crash, therefore allowing further debugging of your issue. If your upload speed permits it, and you aren't going against any strict bandwidth and/or usage caps, etc, the Kernel-Dump is the best
 choice. Do note that Kernel-Dumps are <em><strong>much larger </strong></em>in size due to containing much more info, which is why I mentioned upload speed, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/skydrive/add-photos-files-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Upload photos and files to Onedrive.</a><br />
<br />
After doing that, to learn how to share the link to the file if you are unaware, please visit the following link -
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Share files and folders and change permissions</a> and view <strong>'Get a link'</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Please note that any "cleaner" programs such as TuneUpUtilities, CCleaner, etc, by default will delete .DMP files upon use. With this said, if you've run such software, you will need to allow the system to crash once again to generate a crash dump.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log'.
<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.

    <title>Gamerscore decrease - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jdawg7480  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gamerscore decrease</h2>
                    <p>Last Friday 29/9 I was gaming during the day and my gamerscore was ~167k. I went back on at&nbsp; night and noted it had dropped to ~155k.</p><p><br /></p>

<p>I reached out to MS support and we went through the routine (hard reset, delete and re-add profile) and it wasn't resolved. I was then directed to the enforcement policy yet the link showed my status as perfect and no one had lodged anything.</p><p><br /></p>

<p>On the Xbox One console, if I drill into individual games I have zero gamerscore against Overwatch, COD BO3, Dark Souls 3, Micro Machines and BF4 to name a few, but numerous achievements are unlocked and correctly dated. The gamerscore has just stopped calculating correctly. </p><p><br /></p>

<p>If I look at my 'milestones' on TrueAchievements it says I hit 165,000 gamerscore on 20 August 2017. I don't understand how or why this has happened. I asked MS support if I could send screenshots through and they indicated that I couldn't. I've searched forums and found that some people just have it magically resolve, and others are still without their score. Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h2>            2 Wired Controllers not connecting properly</h2>
                    
<p>2 Wired controllers both connect as player 1 or copy eachother. Have tried in other usb ports but still persists. Tried on another console and they worked fine. Any suggestions about this problem? Is there a way you can reset the usb ports ? When i first
 got my new xbox, i kept changing the controller around like putting it in different ports all the time, would that be a cause ?</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated thanks.</p>

<p>I have the same problem with both controllers only seen as Player 1. &nbsp;They are both the black MS Xbox 360 wired controller. &nbsp;I tried all the ports, one at a time, together, on, off etc. &nbsp;Nothing works. &nbsp;I can only use one wireless and one wired if I want
 2 players but not 2 wired together. &nbsp;Help! &nbsp;Is there a fix? &nbsp;Otherwise I will return the wired controllers and buy just wireless.</p>

<p>Hey there Beatle! I just want to confirm that you have tried plugging them both in after the console starts up, correct? Also (to anyone having this issue) can you take these wired controllers to another console to try them out, or use different wired controllers
 on your console? Let me know the result of this, thanks! </p>

<p>I have the same problem. &nbsp;Two identical MS wired controllers, competing for the same player space on a 2011 XBox 360 slim. &nbsp;They compete for player 1 if the wireless controller is off or compete for player 2 if wireless controller is already on. &nbsp;Tried plugging
 them in after console has been turned on, and also tried plugging them in when console is off. &nbsp;I've tried the suggestion in the support link above.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I came accross a vid, split into two parts on youtube of the problem -</p>
<p>Part 1. [View:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMaeeHhiBm0]</p>
<p>Part 2. [View:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSR_RRhV3W8]</p>
<p>The bloke in the vid has bought 6 controllers to try and solve the problem.</p>
<p>I haven't tried on a different console.</p>

<p>Took them to Gamestation and they did the same on their console so it looks like either one or both controllers are faulty. &nbsp;Have sent back to retailer.</p>

<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I`m also having the same problem and its getting to be quite frustrating. Im really grateful to have found some other people in the world that have had the same problem but unfortunately it looks like there isnt a simple answer.</p>
<p>I have two wireless controllers and two wired controllers. It doesnt matter what order I turn any of these on or when I plug them in, the two wired controllers always fight each other in the same way as the video above showed where one doesnt work and the
 other does.</p>
<p>Has anyone managed to work a solution? I bought two wired controllers as it would reduce my reliance on having to charge batteries, and for a cost saving reason! So Id be keen on sorting this out without having to buy more wireless controllers. Microsoft,
 its a shambles how this problem can come up especially if you are trying to attract more mainstream customers. But the support facilities have impressed me so far, lets hope its not all for show!!</p>
<p>Thank you! Hope to hear from someone soon!</p>

<h2>            Spybot - Search and Destroy gives a warning &#8220;Mcrosoft.WindowsSecurityCenter.FirewallOverride&#8221; on every scan</h2>
                    
<p>Original title:&nbsp; <span>(SBI $OC94D702) settings__HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\microsoft\sec</span></p>
<p>I have spybot search and destroy and i get this everytime i run it for spyware the full warning is</p>
<p>Mcrosoft.WindowsSecurityCenter.FirewallOverride</p>
<p>i assume the hotkey above is the one causing the problems because when it is restricted and removed by spybot and i try to then connect to internet i have difficulties and i have windows security center telling me that i don't have an active firewall. so
 i open it up ask for recomendations and it tell me it cannot open windows firewall.</p>
<p>My worry is this a virus that is there just taking infomation from me or is it legitimate hotkey that should be there</p>
<p>i have done all available updates i'm running windows xp</p>
<p>i run windows onecare safety scanner every month and still get it appearing in my spybot search</p>
<p>any help or advise would be greatly appriciated thank you</p>

<p><span>Hi pfcDix,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 is the version of Spybot you are using?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 is the complete registry key error that is detected?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 type of difficuties do you’ve with your Internet once you’re done with the scan?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>What
 is the exact message that is given by Windows Security Center?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the steps mentioned below.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1: Use “exclude this detection from future scans” in your Spybot</span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The reason why you receive this error “<strong>Mcrosoft.WindowsSecurityCenter.FirewallOverride</strong>” everytime you scan is due to the fact
 that the option to “exclude this detection from future scans” in your spybot is not enabled.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>You’ve
 to right click on each detection entry and then click “exclude this detection from future scans”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If
 it is greyed out, highlight the item you want to exclude by left clicking on the item first, then right click on the item and choose to “exclude this detection from future scans”.
</span></p>
<p><span>Now perform the scan to see if the message withers away.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>On the other hand, when you try to remove some registry entry, you should be very careful. You need to<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>backup
 the registry</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span>before you remove it. The registry key that you’ve provided is a valid windows registry key and upon removing, it has an adverse effect on Windows Security Center and other programs on your computer. Most of the
 anti-virus software will disable the Windows Security Center in order to take care of things themselves. Windows Security Center fails to monitor the status of any firewall installed on your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Check the registry settings</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Make sure the following registry keys (Anti-virus Override and Firewall Override) have the value data set to 0.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Registry Disclaimer</span></strong><span>: The steps mentioned below include
 system registry modification. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the
 registry if a problem occurs. </span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to back up and restore the registry in Windows</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/322756/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>322756</span></a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Profile/en-US/?user=Linda+Yan&amp;referrer=http%3a%2f%2fsocial.technet.microsoft.com%2fForums%2fen%2fw7itprogeneral%2fthread%2f97de8a2a-12f2-4381-a409-a78f4ae551cf&amp;rh=5mM7yHrdtVf1bDfGRy3UPXDpkXRSr5HdMQUuFVZg8FA%3d&amp;sp=forums" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
</a></span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Start and then click on Run.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Type
 regedit and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Go
 to the following location</span></p>
<p><span><strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Security Center</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Check
 the data value set for Anti-virus Override and Firewall Override.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>They
 both should have value data set to 0x00000000 (0)</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If
 not, set it to the above value and save the changes.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Exit the registry editor and then perform the scan.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would also suggest you to check with Spybot forums to see if they have any suggestions on this issue.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused. I will assist you with this.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would suggest you to follow the steps below and see if it helps to resolve the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>First, confirm the correct password is getting entered with some simple checks before resorting to more extreme measures:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Click on the “eye” icon in the password field and view the password before hitting Enter.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Verify the keyboard layout wasn’t changed during the upgrade, causing you to enter unexpected characters when typing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Press the
<strong>Windows Key and the Spacebar </strong>at the same time to check the keyboard language and layout.&nbsp;&nbsp;While holding the Windows Key, press the spacebar repeatedly to change the keyboard layout.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">From another device, verify that you can successfully sign into&nbsp;</span><a href="http://account.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://account.live.com</span></span></a><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;with
 the same Microsoft account email and password.</span></li></ol>
</ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this helps.</span><span>Please get back to us with the updated status and we will be glad to help you further.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)"><br />

<p>
</p><p><span>Sorry for the delay in response.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>As the issue happened after the recent update I would suggest you to perform a system restore and see if it helps to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>System restore</span></span></p>
<p><span>System Restore is a way to undo system changes by using restore points to return your system files and settings to an earlier point in time without affecting personal files of users. System Restore uses a feature called
<strong>system protection </strong>that regularly creates and saves information about your PC's drivers, programs, registry, system files, and settings as restore points.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If you are having recent problems with Windows 10, then you could do a System Restore to restore Windows back to an earlier point in time, called a restore point.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Please refer the link below to restore Windows back to an earlier point in time.</span></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>System Restore disclaimer: </strong>When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.</span></span></p>

</p><p><span><span>Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we would be happy to help.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Parental Controls Windows 10 - blocking websites</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm setting up the partental controls on Windows 10.&nbsp; On Windows 7, I created a list of websites that my child was allowed to visit.&nbsp; In the instructions below in #4 it indicates "If you want your child to only see websites you've explicitly allowed,
 check the box next to <span>Only see websites on the allowed list</span>."&nbsp; However, I can't see anywhere on the website where it indicates "only see websites on the allowed list".&nbsp; Where did it go?&nbsp; I only want my child to have access to the
 websites that I have on my "allowed list".</p>

    <title>Bypass Lock Screen in 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cheriejb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bypass Lock Screen in 8.1</h2>
                    I am the only user on my home computer.&nbsp; I do not want the aggravation of using any form of password (including picture, pin, or other "options") when I turn on the computer.&nbsp; I am an intelligent and savvy USER, not programmer or tech professional.&nbsp; I
 want a SIMPLE way to bypass the lock screen and eliminate the need to enter a password.&nbsp; My suspicion is that Microsoft is making this very difficult in order&nbsp;to discourage users from bypassing the password requirement thereby making it easier -- and possible
 -- for Microsoft to track personal data and activities for their&nbsp;marketing efforts.&nbsp;

 thing else blank, and click on go.</p>
<p>No more passwords.&nbsp; Works every time for me.</p>

            <p>It seems that it is ok now. Earlier when I open the surface pro3 Bluetooth tab appeared but no WIFI tab.</p>
<p>When I restarted again the WIFI tab suddenly appeared.</p>
<p>How come when I did the same process last night it did not solve the issue.</p>
<p>Is this common problem with surface pro 3?</p>
<p>Shall expect more of this problem later?</p>
<p>I haven't experienced this with any of my lap top before at home or even in the office.</p>
<p>Thanks anyway.</p>

            <p>Guys finally fricking fixed it the Wifi issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>It happened right after microsoft or some newbie engineer decided to release a Windows 10 update, and it wiped our Wifi capability off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply open windows restore, and go back to an update a few months ago prior to this incident.</p>
<p>Boom. Fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also STOP the windows 10 from automatically updating by changing your wifi connection to metered. It is so unstable, seriously microsoft, get better engineers and check things before updating....</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t install patches</h2>
                    <p>Hello.</p>
<p>I've a box where patches KB4019264, KB2952664, KB3172605 and KB 3184143 fails to install since some months ago. The errors reported by Windows installer are: 80073701, 800F0900 and 8007371B.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today I've tried to manually install wannacry patches KB4012215 and KB4012212 but also both fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know if both issues are related? How can I install failed patches? How can I know if my computer is protected against wannacry attack?</p>
<p>

 breaks password changes on our domain. We have 100+ machines on our domain (mixture of Win7x64 and Win10) and it appears to be only affecting this one machine (win7x64) and not sure what else to try at this point.&nbsp;

<p>Hello Canadian Tech.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried with first and second solution with same result. KB3172605 fails on first attempt and KB3020369 appears to be installed, so reinstall is not allowed.</p>
<p>Also, as the update history becomes empty with second way, I can see the failure on Windows Updare History telling that KB3172605 with error code 8007371B.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I have the computer with auto-update disabled. I'll wait for any other update on this thread.</p>

<h2>            How to set security permission &#34;FULL Control&#34; over the Windows forlder in Windows 7</h2>
                    I have a laptop with Windows 7 Ultimate installed<br />
when i want to install some programs for example "Adobe Elements 4.0" or some other special programs for my friends i get this error:<br />
&nbsp;error 1926 could not set file security for file (here it varies for adobe it is C:\Windows\Fonts.) 0 verify that you have sufficient priveledges to modify the security permissions for this file<br />
<br />
So after some googling I manage to set ownership for User group<br />
and set for every group Full Control over Windows folder except Owner Group (for some reason it didn't get the changes applied)<br />
(some folders didn't change but none that i am interested in)<br />
yet STILL getting this error<br />
<br />
I even enabled the built-in administrator profile still no use <br />
<br />
So any more ideas??<br />

            Well, you're never going to be able to install any security updates ever again first thing. &nbsp;This is unfortunately the worst possible course of action you could have taken. &nbsp;The following might help, but there will likely be remaining issues until you
 erase and re-install your operating system.

<ol>
<li>Start an elevated command prompt by typing <b>CMD</b>&nbsp;into your Start menu search box, then press Ctrl-Shift-Enter to run it.<br />
<br />

<strong>secedit

    <title>Windows 10 Random Hangs - solution&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidhyland  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Random Hangs - solution&#63;</h2>
                    <p>In the last day or so, I've been experiencing random hangs on Windows 10 (free "upgrade", not factory install).</p>
<p>These are completely random - hangs occur in any program or app, or even straight from login. Sometimes the hang resolves itself after waiting for a while (anywhere from a few seconds to several minutes), more often I have to reboot using the Power button.</p>
<p>Once rebooted, I Restart from the Start menu (if it works!).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Searching various online forums and the Microsoft help community has not helped at all.... but it has revealed that Windows 10 is inherently unstable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is twofold:</p>
<p>Is there an actual solution to cure these hangs?</p>
<p>Or should I revert to Windows 8.1 and wait until Microsoft fix this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Windows 10 can't be inherently unstable if it has almost 100 million users worldwide, but undoubtedly there are users with problems, some of which are software related and many of which are hardware related. &nbsp;You're on a Forum which is about the Community

<p>
</p><p>Your first action should be to check with your PC Manufacturer's Support Site to check for any indications of compatibility issues with Windows 10 and whether the manufacturer has released any firmware/software updates to improve compatibility. &nbsp;In particular,

<p>Thank you for the info &amp; instructions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not able to dedicate the time at the moment to try the above, but to answer your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. I made no changes to my laptop prior to installation of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I have installed a 3rd party program sunce installing Windows 10, but my system was running fine since then - this hanging issue started 2 days ago. I will try to uninstall this application to see if this makes a difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. There is an update pending, but my laptop hangs during download...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will update this post accordingly.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Thank you for your slightly trollish reply....</p>
<p>Up until 2 days ago my system was running without issue. A web search returned many many results related to my problem, including some professional sites: most seem to suggest an issue with update stability. My comment was based on other user opinions and
 conclusions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, your comment regarding manufacturer updates is valid and useful - I'll check with their website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you - I'll update this thread accordingly.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Updates freezes/hangs on 'Checking For Updates'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In summary, nothing so far suggested has made any difference whatsoever.</p>

</p><p>I have tried to roll-back to Windows 8 without success - as soon as I click on the Restore Windows 8 button, the laptop restarts and eventually reboots to Windows 10.</p>

</p><p>So don't anyone try to tell me that Windows 10 is stable and that 100 million users are happy with it. 2 minutes internet search returns thousands of hits from tens, if not hundreds, of thousands of users suffering exactly the same issues that I am. None

<p>managed to the laptop stable long enough to perform a System Restore to a date prior the suspect update.</p>
<p>I can't connect the laptop to the web as W10 will try to download the dodgy update (seeing as users have no choice in the matter ).&nbsp;</p>
<p>So I'll wait until Microsoft issue an update to fix the broken update....</p>

<h2>            How do I remove Store from the Taskbar</h2>
                    I'd like to only have apps I choose on the Taskbar. I've looked for a simple way to remove Store and Edge from the Taskbar. Is it possible? I'm not a programmer so I can edit or do fancy stuff here. Am I force fed those programs?

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>Are you receiving any error messages and if so, what do they say EXACTLY?&nbsp; When you say "disabled" do you mean it won't open or that once it is open it doesn't function (acts like it is frozen)?</p>
<div>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span>
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above
 information you should be able to restore with no problems.<br />
<br />
If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C:\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.<span>&nbsp; </span>It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning task manager (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools
 / Event Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a></span><span>.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Look in the&nbsp;System section.</span></p>
<p><span>Try doing a clean boot
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>&nbsp;and see if the problem goes away.&nbsp; If so, follow the instructions to identify the problem and then delete, remove, disable, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to return
 the system to normal status according to the instructions.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the problem occurs in a clean boot then just restore it to normal status and reboot - this process is not going to help.</span></p>
<p><span>Boot into safe mode with networking and see if the problem persists.&nbsp; Let us know either way as the answer may help us find the solution.</span></p>
<p><span>You may be infected with malware.
<span>
Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:
</span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and
</span><span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span><span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a></span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials
</span><span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></a></span><span>
<span>(with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time).
<span>&nbsp;</span>You may also want to try the free Avira at: </span></span><span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a></span><span>
 and Avast at: </span><span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a></span><span>.
<span>&nbsp;</span>Reboot after completing all the scans.<span>&nbsp; </span>
You may also want to try the free OneCare at </span><span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</span></span></a></span><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span><br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve or at least identify the cause of your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></p>

<h3> yeetusa  say:</h3>
<h2>            Infinite black loading screen &#40;cursor loading symbol too&#41; and cannot even reach the login part of booting</h2>
                    <p>Note: tried to do what someone recommended in previous posts on command prompt but nothing came of it</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically I started getting this problem two days ago. Every time I started up my pc, it would boot normally until a black screen with an infinite loading cursor symbol came up. It comes up before the login screen and that never comes up now. I did nearly
 everything I could to attempt to fix it. Here's what I tried:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I pressed F8 to get this startup repair thing, which ended up not working;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Tried to do a system restore but got some error saying it didn't work on all other restore points;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Tried all the safe modes, but still had the loading screen;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Tried all sorts of stuff on command prompt that I was told to do and read online, yet no luck;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>And finally, I did a system reset where I retained my personal files. As for this, it told me to choose one of three accounts to reset, likewise the system restore: [account1], [account2] and [administrator]. Picked my account and even did the reset. Same
 problem came up, even when shutting it down to restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, in a previous thread i made, someone suggested using the media creation tool but when i boot up my pc (dell) and press F12 to get some menu and try to boot with the usb device, i get the same problem. I dont know if i made some mistakes or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this blank screen, I can't get any window or anything up.</p>

            Hi,
<br />If Safe Boot is also failing to boot it sounds to me like there is a critical failure in one or more of the main Windows 10 components. Beyond suggesting what has already been tried I have one suggestion before recommending a reinstall of Windows. Try getting to the startup repair screen again, and starting in command line only. Then try running this:
<br />
<br /><code>sfc /scannow</code>
<br />
<br />it will attempt to repair the files its usually the step to take when there is an issue before using recovery media. However I don't know how effective it will be in command line only. I think however, it is worth a try before resorting to anything drastic like a reinstall. Unfortunately there isn't a great deal more I can suggest this is particularly difficult to diagnose without being able to boot. As there are so many reasons why it could be happening. Especially when all of the usual safety features and recovery tools are not working.
<br />I hope that helps.       
        </p>

            Hi  Yeetus, you mention you created Bootable Installation Media and it did not boot!
<br />
<br />Please try this:
<br />
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS (F2 key repeatedly on the Dell screen) and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media       
        </p>

            Well then i'm sorry to say it might be time for a reinstall. There is not really anything you can do if every available recovery or repair function is a point of failure.

            Hi YeetusA,
<br />
<br />Okay, thanks for that, you have legacy BIOS . . 
<br />
<br />Go to the Boor Tab in BIOS
<br />
<br />Then move the Drive with the bootable Installation media to the top of that boot order list
<br />
<br />Then press F10 to save that change and exit BIOS
<br />
<br />When you boot your Dell up again, does it boot from the Installation Media, and if not, what exactly do you see on your screen - do you even get a white cursor in the top left of your screen?       
        </p>

It still goes to the same black screen with the loading cursor and appears to be infinitely loading
