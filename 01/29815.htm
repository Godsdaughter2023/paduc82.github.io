<p>does he have any other racing games that you could try the wheel with or access to another xbox to try the wheel on. The MS FF wheel has a lot of plastic in it so it could be that its just wore out. If the wheel is really loose in the housing that might
 be the cause of your problem, good luck. &nbsp;</p>

<p>the wheel has a good bearing in it the wheel has hardly been used its probably had 3 months use in all weve tried forza 3 /4 &nbsp;horizon &nbsp;pgr4 the wheel started locking slightly left and right a few times kicking the back end out on the car out while racing
 online about 3 weeks ago but turned it of one night last week next day it was fully locked left on the telementry but when we power the wheel up fist time it centers fine. ive seen a youtube video from 2 years ago untold amount of people have had the problem
 by the replies on the video but no one knows why its happened to so many wheels.</p>

<p>You might want to try to find a used MS wheel on ebay or graigs list.</p>
<p>I've had the same problem on a couple of the wheels and had to get another on.</p>
<p>Microsoft quit supporting the MS wheels a while ago.</p>
<p>I am still using the MS wheel and playing Forza 4.</p>
<p>You may need to buy a different wheel by another manufacturer.</p>

            Hi Popking111555
<br />
<br />Click the link below to download the Free version of AOMEI Partition Assistant 
<br />
<br />The free version is fully featured and can do the partitioning jobs Windows will refuse to do
<br />
<br />Use that to shrink C and add the space to D
<br />
<br />If that application still refuses to shrink C, defragment your C drive and then try again . . .

<h2>            Xbox One - Instant-on enabled but console is turning off fully</h2>
                    
<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I have no idea what is going on with my Xbox One at the moment.</p>
<p>The console is set up with Instant-on enabled but for some reason sometimes after switching the console off either via the controller menu or by the Xbox Button on the console itself - when I come to turn it back on it seems to have switched off fully.</p>
<p>When this happens I am unable to use the "Xbox On" voice command and I am also unable to use the controller to turn on the console. So I am left to turn the console on via the button on the console.</p>
<p>During start-up the Xbox One animation is shown and then the Xbox turns on fine, but this means that the games I have left have lost their prior state and I have to load up the game as if I have turned the console off fully or as if I have the 'Energy Saving'
 feature turned on.</p>
<p>I have no idea why this is happening - it seems to be intermittent.</p>
<p>I have also made sure that the Instant On feature is enabled and that it works when I have conducted some tests while I am in the room with the console (e.g. turning the console off via the controller and also the console button, and then turning the console
 back on again). When I have tested the console it seems to be turning back on fine and acting like it should do with Instant On enabled - and I am also able to jump straight back into my game. Therefore I am sure that the problem is only intermittent.</p>
<p>Could the Xbox power-brick or console itself overheating cause this issue?</p>
<p>It isn't a major issue to have to turn the console on at the Xbox Button but, it is frustrating that I am not able to just jump straight back into a game - and this also worries me as the console isn't working as it should.</p>

<p>Hope you can help me with this.</p>

<p>If you need any more information just let me know.</p>

<p>I also have just started having this problem, exactly the same way as you described,&nbsp;OP, right down to not being able to turn on the console with the controller and having to use the power button when it happens.</p>
<p>My power brick is sitting out in the open with plenty of air flow and anytime I've ever checked, it is barely even warm. I doubt it's a heat issue TBH.</p>
<p>Also, since you didn't mention this, my power brick light goes from white to orange,&nbsp;which is a clear indicator that&nbsp;the console has gone into energy saver mode. If you check, I'm sure you will notice that every time this problem happens, your power brick
 light will be orange... even though it is set to 'instant on' mode, in which it should stay lit white.</p>
<p>The only difference is that my console does this every time. Just sometimes it will take much longer for it to happen than others. If you look into it, I'm betting that you will notice that every time your console has this problem, the power brick light
 will be orange. It will probably operate normally if the light stays white. But as I've said, sometimes it takes longer for this to happen than others. Mine actually stayed white overnight last night, but turned to orange this afternoon.</p>
<p>Can someone please look into this? It seems like there are enough people having this issue to merit at least checking into possible causes and finding a solution.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>I actually put mine into energy save mode to see if it helped. Since it was automatically going there anyway, I figured what's the use of even bothering with instant on when the console won't stay in that mode?</p>
<p>Well, that worked for&nbsp;a few days and then last night... guess what... it wouldn't turn on with the controller. Had to use the power button just like OP described.</p>
<p>C'mon guys, anything? At least acknowledgement that it's a known issue or not? That it's being looked into? Or not? It isn't like we can just wait to see if the December update will fix it and I'm getting a bit tired of having it in energy save mode all
 the time, whether I set it to be or not...</p>

<p>Having the exact same problem, but mine is random. I know it happens because my Astro mixamp turns on by itself which only happens if the console shuts down. Plus, like many of you stated, power brick turns white to orange. Talked to support and they said
 it's a hardware issue, but I don't believe it. I don't want to send it in to repair without knowing 100% it's actually a hardware issue.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Because Windows 10 uses a digital license.</p>
<p>With Windows 10 you get a digital license where your activation information is stored on MS servers.&nbsp;As soon as you do a clean install, Windows would automatically activate when it connects to the Internet, for the first time-provided you install
 the same version as was installed before. If you are asked for a key, skip it.</p>

<h2>            Windows Icon&#47;File ReadProcessMemory&#47;WriteProcessMemory Error</h2>
                    <div>
<p>In the last 2 weeks a few users, including myself, have received an error when clicking on the Outlook icon in Task Bar OR accessing redirected documents. We will get this error on the initial click, close the error, click again
 and it opens. Some users cannot save Excel or Word documents into either a shared network drive or to their redirected personal documents folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At first I thought this was the new version of Sophos we're deploying, but not everyone has it at the moment. We are running an Office 365 hybrid environment, for a year, but this issue just started. Wasn't sure if it was an
 O365 issue considering the document issue, but the error points to a workstation memory error. Event Viewer is no help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone experienced this? This particular error happens on our Windows 10 workstations, but same issues occur on Windows 7.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We appreciate you posting to Microsoft Community. We wanted to know, is this issue only happens with Microsoft Office Outlook and Excel?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error is somehow related to the Read and Write Memory of of the system. This error is very common with programs or applications being launched that require heavy resources. The best thing to do is to check your system background applications, and try
 disabling those that are needed. Especially cloud syncing programs; eg: OneDrive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Another solution that you can try are the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>A. Perform Disk Cleanup:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>
<p>To delete temporary files:</p>
</span>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Search for&nbsp;<span>Disk cleanup</span>&nbsp;from the taskbar and select it from the list of results.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Under&nbsp;<span>Files to delete</span>, select the file types to get rid of. To get a description of the file type, select it.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select&nbsp;<span>OK</span>.</p>
</li></ul>
</li><li><span>
<p>If you need to free up more space, you can also delete system files:</p>
</span>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In Disk cleanup, select&nbsp;<span>Clean up system files</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select the file types to get rid of. To get a description of the file type, select it.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Select&nbsp;<span>OK</span>.</p>
</li></ul>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>B. Take full control of the folder/ program folder</strong>:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><em><strong>Right-click on the folder &gt; Properties &gt; Security tab &gt; Advanced button</strong></em>.
</li><li>Select <em><strong>Permissions</strong></em> tab and ensure that the permissions for folders and sub-folders are as follows:<br />
<br />
System: Full control<br />
Administrators: Full control<br />
Users: Read &amp; execute<br />
Everyone: Read &amp; execute</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>That's it for now.&nbsp;<em>Please respond to this thread to let me know how the issue progresses. Similarly, if you have more questions, please inform me by replying to this post</em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Best regards.</p>

<p>I just did a fresh install of Windows 10 1803 and ran disk cleanup many many many times. I am thinking these issues reside with a Microsoft update to Office 365 since both issues are Office related - Outlook and Excel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you can see from my first screenshot, the Outlook icon in the taskbar gives that error the first time it is clicked.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second screenshot shows a network drive, which I have full access to, but gives an error when first clicked but only with EXCEL items, not WORD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I logged on my workstation with my domain admin account and clicked on the same EXCEL file within the network drive, and it opened right up, no error. This leads me to believe this is NOT an actual read/write memory error based on hardware.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also added myself as an admin to the C: of my workstation and you'd think that might resolve the Outlook issue considering it's locally installed... nope.</p>

<p>Thanks for keeping the thread updated. I'm sorry that I was not able to get back timely.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still not certain about the rootcause of the issue. I tried searching a bot more and found this:&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance-winpc/only-part-of-a-readprocessmemory-or/0cb21c53-47fe-45ae-a3c7-f3c8be29ff7a"><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-performance-winpc/only-part-of-a-readprocessmemory-or/0cb21c53-47fe-45ae-a3c7-f3c8be29ff7a</span></em></a>.
 The thread describes very similar issue and the user found that a thirdparty trusted protection software was causing the error with Excel and Outlook.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Please check if the issue will persist while in <strong><em>clean boot state</em></strong>:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">How

<em>clean boot</em>, please check your background applications one by one in order to know which of them has been causing the error.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of my friends sent me a message, so I decided to open it, it had something of a script inside of it,&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was like this;</p>
<p>EzGT2.2/consolevirus/consoleid2481458/inject&nbsp;</p>
<p>or something like that, then he said since I opened it I have sent a conformation that I opened it so now he can inject a virus to slowly shut down each one of my chips&nbsp;</p>
<p>like the motherboard and ect to shut down...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I am asking is if it is true?</p>
<p>I believe he was **** me because I think that if you opened it it is MS Server's not my indivitual console/ip.</p>

<p>There is no virus on your console. The person is only trying to get you scared and will then try to extort funds (likely Microsoft Points) from you to "stop the virus" when there is in fact no virus on your console. Harassing other members on Xbox LIVE is

<h2>            Hear a Man Talking through my laptop</h2>
                    <p>Hello! I have been having quite an odd problem as of lately that has probably been caused by a virus. Around 9 at night to midnight, I hear a man speaking, having a conversation on my laptop. But i can only hear him. At first i thought that my brain was
 making sense out of a weird noise coming from my earbuds, but he actually is laughing, making random conversation, asking questions and responding after a while as if someone replied. Sometimes it seems like he's saying codes like the first time I've hear
 him(which was a couple of weeks ago), he kept repeating numbers such as "638 638, yup, that's the one!" I can only hear him with my earbuds on and when my laptop is on. It sounds as if he's speaking on a plane or through a walkie-talkie. I've tried responding
 by typing or actually saying things out loud, but he can not hear me. I can only hear his side of the conversation, and not the other persons. I was wondering what caused this and how i could get rid of it. Thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Btw, I'm not sure if i has a windows 10 or windows 8 haha)</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
- What steps have you tried in order to resolve the issue?<br />
<br />
Follow these steps and check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Uninstall</a> the Adobe Flash Player Active-X and Plug-in components and then reinstall Shockwave Flash Player as there could be traces of previous versions
 in the computer which are interfering and making it difficult for the browsers to properly display videos on your computer.<br />
<br />
<br />
Use the latest Flash Player if your Flash Player 10 (or the current version) is not working fine. You can simply download it from the
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Adobe official website</a>.<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem behind the Shockwave Flash crash could be your sound drivers. Follow these steps:
<p>a) Open <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Open-Device-Manager" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Device Manager.</a><br />
b) Look for the sound-card device.<br />
c) Note down the name for that device.<br />
d) <span style="font-weight: bold">Right click</span> and <span style="font-weight: bold">
Uninstall</span> it.<br />
e) After uninstalling, restart your machine. <br />
f) Your Vista would automatically download and reinstall the sound driver. You can also do it manually through approaching the sound card company's web site.</p>

<h2>            Unsolicited phonecalls about my computer being hacked</h2>
                    I received a call from what they claimed was a Microsoft Windows tech service who saw lots of warnings and error messages on my computer due to a corrupted certificate. After a couple of calls and discussion, I was convinced to let them sign me up for
 having a clean certificate created for $184. They had access to my desktop and "cleaned up" for about half an hour. The whole time I was uncomfortable, but they were very convincing and I watched what they did, not that I understood most of it. I just got
 another call. I don't know what to do or if my computer is now at risk. Seems to work fine, but I am concerned. I just got another call about it, but I hung up due to bad connection and being uncomfortable. The phone number is 1-855-677-5556 and I spoke to
 Jack Williams (heavy Indian accent) who is employee 1003. Company called Emcon Commercial, they say part of Microsoft.

Sorry to tell you this but you've<br />been scammed. This is a common and well-known scam. The $184 you spent<br />was a complete waste of money. And possibly worse, yes, your computer<br />is at risk; since you let them into your computer, who knows what they<br

</p><p>Open <em>Device Manager</em> (run <strong>devmgmt.msc</strong> command for this) and verify that you've latest version of keyboard drivers installed. Also run the

    <title>Windows Update failed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wikipedia editor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Update failed</h2>
                    <p>I know, I know that there are a lot of people posting about the same issue. I've tried every single solution provided and none work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my computer runs on Windows 8.1, it keeps putting apps on pending without actually downloading them, I have been reserving my Windows 10 Update and it hasn't been downloaded yet (though it keeps on saying that 'it's reserved') and the troubleshooters
 can't fix the problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am beginning to think that this could be caused by SW Update, since I am using a Samsung computer, and from the media, it has been confirmed that Samsung has been tweaking Windows Update to disable it. Since I don't know how to find out if that is actually
 causing the problem, I'm stuck and I can't install anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the time being, I would appreciate someone suggesting some other way to install apps without using the app store.</p>

    <title>Change the fonts used to render foreign languages - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> techmaster21  say:</h3>
<h2>            Change the fonts used to render foreign languages</h2>
                    Okay so, It's hard for me to explain this, but here it is
<div>This is how my computer will render&nbsp;Japanese text:</div>
<div><a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/8440870/Support/Rendering%20of%20Japanese%20fonts%20Chrome.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">&nbsp;https://dl.dropbox.com/u/8440870/Support/Rendering%20of%20Japanese%20fonts%20Chrome.png</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And no it does not matter which browser is used:</div>
<div><a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/8440870/Support/Rendering%20of%20Japanese%20fonts%20Firefox.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://dl.dropbox.com/u/8440870/Support/Rendering%20of%20Japanese%20fonts%20Firefox.png</a></div>
<div><a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/8440870/Support/Rendering%20of%20Japanese%20fonts%20IE9.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://dl.dropbox.com/u/8440870/Support/Rendering%20of%20Japanese%20fonts%20IE9.png</a></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It also uses the same font for programs(Such as Ccleaner for example) This leads me to believe it is asking the OS what font to use for Japanese, And the OS answers with this one.</div>
<div>The font it looks to be using is MS Gothic. But whether or not it is in fact MS Gothic, It is certainly a bitmapped and non-cleartype font. Cleartype fonts such as Meiryo exist for Japanese. How can I make it so that Japanese is instead rendered with a
 more updated, and less painful on the eyes, font?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Note: Japanese is just the example I am using, It should be able to apply to any language(It also uses old font rendering with many other languages)</div>
                </div>

            Unfortunately there are 2 problems with that answer:&nbsp;
<div>1. The steps seem based on Windows XP(As neither Vista nor 7 has a "Properties" right click context menu item when right clicking on the desktop), And replicating this in Windows 7 is a pain(You would have to change the font for every single item on the
<a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/8440870/Support/Advanced%20Font%20customization.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
list</a>), and</div>
<div>2. And it sounds very much like its not what I want anyways. My system's default font is currently Segoe UI Semibold. However, It would be logical to assume, that Since Segoe UI does not support Chinese, Japanese, or Korean(and languages of that style;
 however it does support&nbsp;Cyrillic, which explains why Russian looks fine), The system is using another font to render those types of characters. My question, is how can I change what font it is using to render [insert language here].</div>
<div><br />
<div>Maybe this isn't a big deal to most people thus why it seems google doesn't turn up a whole lot, and it really isn't, but if I already have East Asian Cleartype fonts installed on my system(As W7 does by default), Why not use them to render the languages,
 instead of outdated bitmap ones, so that my eyes don't metaphorically bleed when I do have to look at said languages?</div>

            Hi,
<div>Thanks for asking! As I understood, you need drivers for the card that will enable the survailance software to recognize the card. Please correct me if I misunderstood. I would suggest you to follow the troubleshooting steps to check if it helps.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
You may use Windows Update to find the drivers.<br />
a. Click the Start button, click Control Panel, click System and Maintenance, and then click Device Manager. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
<br />
b. Right click on the card and click Properties.<br />
<br />
c. On the device Properties dialog box, click the Driver tab, and then click Update Driver Software.<br />
<br />
d. Click Search automatically for updated driver software<br />
<br />
e. Wait to see if a more current driver is found.<br />
<br />
f. Follow the onscreen instructions.<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong><br />
If that does not help, visit the manufacturer’s website and install the latest driver.<br />

    <title>Network Profiles Manager Missing in Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> blogman  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network Profiles Manager Missing in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    Why is the Network Profiles Manger that provided the capability to view, modify and delete wireless network connections missing in Windows 8.1? This omission further serves to demonstrate how clueless the rocket scientists in redmond really are. Now the
 average user has to shell down to the command prompt and enter arcane, unintuitive netsh commands to clean up the wireless network connection table or to review the properties of a particular connection. Furthermore now the only way to edit a wireless network
 connection is to delete the connection, using the aforementioned arcane netsh command and then recreate it. This is just plain stupid when the functionality was already there. Removal of this functionality was pure idiocy and serves only as further proof that
 this company is clueless and that its days are numbered. A windows update that re-implements this functionality is badly needed!!!

            Yes the http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/manage-wireless-network-profiles link that you referred to is where you can find the arcane netsh commands that I referred to. Average non-technical users do not want to and should not have to deal with
 **** like that. More technical users who are aware of netsh but do not have a savant like recall of all arcane command line arguments will be find it a pain the 2$$ because they will have to look up the minutia each time they need to use it. Also, It is important
 to keep the profile list cleaned up. You may have to use a profile with a generic SSID like linksys or dlink to connect to a specific router that one of your non-technical friends refuses to let you re-name to something more unique for them. These should be
 deleted after use so you don't inadvertently connect other to non-safe routers with the same SSID that some hacker phishes with in a hotel lobby, airport or coffee shop. (Obviously you should turn connect automatically off if you h

            <p>I can't believe there hasn't been more outrage over this - I'm sure there will be once more people go over to 8.1! It seems so bizarre that they would do this, I really don't get it! I understand that they want to try to simplify things, but in doing so
 they are actually complicating things! I'm hoping there's&nbsp; something in the pipeline to rectify this.

            <p>First of all - there is no such thing as "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">network and Internet</span>" in the control panel. There is "Internet Options" or "Network and Sharing Center" so I don't what version of Windows 95 you are still
 on. Second there is no VPN involved in this. I am not going to get into it with you beyond that but the options I am talking about used to available via &nbsp;Network and Sharing in Windows 7 and are only now available via an arcane collection of netsh commands
 that are only accessible at the command prompt. If you are interested these are documented at&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/manage-wireless-network-profiles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Arcane Netsh Commands">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/manage-wireless-network-profiles</a>.
 Specifically the "<span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1); font-weight: bold">netsh wlan show profile"</span>&nbsp;command lists the profiles and the "<span style="color: rgba(69, 69, 69, 1); font-weight: bold">netsh
 wlan delete profile name="ProfileName"</span>" command allows one to delete them. The point being that this is a little too arcane and geeky for the average user who doesn't even know what the command prompt is. It is important to clean these up occasionally,
 especially unsecured ones that have generic router names like "dlink" or "linksys" lest Mr. Average User automatically connect to one the next time he is at the airport and get hacked by some vulture just sitting there waiting for a Mark with a generic open
 SSID. In this era of open mobile connectivity there should be an easily accessible, user friendly interface to handle this maintenance task. It is not rocket science so even the rocket scientists in Redmond should be able to implement it.&nbsp;</p>

            It is a bit frustrating that a lot of people don't seem to grasp the issue in the first place (have noticed this a lot in forums) and that Microsoft don't seem particularly bothered about this.
<br />
<br />
Was hoping something might have been added in the recent 8.1 update yesterday, but alas there is nothing :(
<br />
<br />
Still perplexed as to why they would get rid of it!&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>Not sure if this was there before the recent update last Tuesday,&nbsp;but have noticed that under the network settings in the Metro (sorry, Modern UI!) area there's a 'manage known networks' option. Unfortunately you still cant change the settings of these networks
 but you can remove them without being in range. Obviously still no way near as helpful as the old connection manager!

<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you say Restore do you refer to System Restore or restoring the computer to the previous Operating system?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may perform a system restore and check if you are able to boot the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What exactly happens when you try to boot to Safe mode?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may use the disk and perform an Automatic repair.</p>

<h2>            How can I reclaim rights over my desktop and the tasks and programs to be executed, and use my resources&#63;</h2>
                    <div>
<div>Original Title: &nbsp;ipodinst.exe, GatherNetworkInfo, &nbsp;tustedinstaller, RemoteAssistanceTask, UPnPHostConfig, SystemTask, MessageViewer.exe, ProgramDataUpdater</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>ipodinst.exe, GatherNetworkInfo,&nbsp; tustedinstaller, RemoteAssistanceTask, UPnPHostConfig, SystemTask, MessageViewer.exe, ProgramDataUpdater, AitAgent, PolicyConverter, UninstallDeviceTask, Active Directory Rights Management Services Client, GoogleUpdateTaskMachineUA.</div>
<div>
<div>Just some examples of the tasks, that are created without my knowledge or approval.</div>
&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>tasks&nbsp;created in the task manager, without my knowledge&nbsp; approval. Have&nbsp;just accidentally discovered,&nbsp;that the one of the reason that I sometimes, have lost the rights and control over components and&nbsp;applications, on my desktop. One Trustedinstaller was
 created as user, who&nbsp;use resources on&nbsp;the workstation and space on disk,
<div>creates and starts applicationer etc, still&nbsp;without my knowledge or approval.</div>
I thoutght I decided&nbsp;and have the rights over the equipment&nbsp;and&nbsp;internet connection,&nbsp;I have&nbsp;paid for and therefore,&nbsp;had gain the rights and decission over.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div>But I can see&nbsp;many hidden taskes under strange encoded names, some created against the settings I had done in eksplorer, to prevent unwanted use, to prevent virus and lost space on disk.</div>
<div>But&nbsp;it have any affect, becource&nbsp;through hidden tasks&nbsp;created, despite of&nbsp;the security&nbsp;rulles i had made in explorer. This was don whit out &nbsp;any notice or approve from user, so&nbsp;there was any chance to prevent or reject this different taskes. Created countless&nbsp;that&nbsp;it's
 mine workstation, where I have paid for hardware, power and data connection, but do not determine who and what it will be used for. Some tasks are protected&nbsp;and very&nbsp;difficult to disable or delete.</div>
<div>There also created task with update&nbsp;google software, in despite of the settings that&nbsp;should prevent access of these hidden programs and servers. It fill up my desk and uses unnecessary power, data and resources: Since I rarely use google, for the same
 reason, to prevent all this hidden application and data flow, but all efforts to establish blockages and tracking protection,&nbsp;don't help to avoid this througt&nbsp;hidden task in&nbsp;task manager.<br />
(But now I understand better, the reason&nbsp;why,&nbsp;the workstations often works so heavy, when&nbsp;it on unused for a moment.) SQL server had also taking strange name during installations, "AdvertisingDesktop" can see same task are present in task manager and can also
 be the reason for naming my SQL server, and leave mu whit task to makeing change and new installations for renaming server.</div>
<div>The Issues after this&nbsp;
<div>After a very detailed description of my problems, I come to the question:<br />
How can I reclaim rights over my desktop and the tasks and programs to be executed, and use my resources.
</div>
So I can avoid all the mistakes, where I suddenly can't use resources, because I have lost rights, despite&nbsp;mine admin.&nbsp;rights.<br />
Hope someone can help with an answer, to solve this&nbsp;autonomous behaviour from my workstation.&nbsp;Workstation can keep to be busy, without my intervention and use.</div>
<div>Look forward to reclame the rights to how and who use it. [Soft and hardware data: Windows Premium 64 bit, 4Gb. ram,&nbsp;Intel processor 2,9 Ghz.]</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you made any recent software or hardware changes on your computer?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What is the Anti-virus software installed on your system?</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>I would suggest you to do a complete scan of your computer and check.</p>
<p><b>Microsoft Security Essentials</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/security-essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/security-essentials</a></b></p>
<p><b>Note:
</b>If any infections are detected during the scan, there might be a chance of data loss as the infected files will be deleted.</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b></p>
<p>If the above steps do not help then I suggest you to check if the issue occurs in safe mode.</p>
<p><b>Start your computer in safe mode</b></p>
<p><b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a></b></p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b></p>
<p>Check if the issue persists, if it does then follow the steps to start your computer in a
<b>clean boot</b> state and check.</p>
<p><b>Clean boot</b> helps eliminate any third party software conflict.</p>

<h2>            Unable to enter text into Search Box&#59; Missing &#39;Tile&#39; part of start menu</h2>
                    <p><span>I have a problem with my Win10 machine (Dell Inspiron Tower). I have office 2000 loaded for ‘Word’ and ‘Excel’. The problem appears to have started on Feb22 when I copy a word document onto a memory stick. That was not readable on another PC without
 additional office resources </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>On Sunday PM I put the memory stick back into the Dell tower, did the required Office 2000 updates; .<span>&nbsp;
</span>once those were loaded the word file opened but it did not contain the detail in the word doc I’d copied but some HTML and a small quantity of text relating to a Kindle booked I’d browsed on the Amazon web site in January.
</span></p>
<p><span>The original information is undamaged in the file that is still on the Dell tower.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once the file on the memory stick had been opened the the machine slowed down and then one or more standard ‘Apps’ (Calculator) and after being restarted has lost the ‘Tiles’ part of the start menu, also I can no longer type any entries into the Windows
 Search box. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I’ve followed various solutions on the help forums to solve this but without success including trying to do a system restore. I have tried that 4 times from the most recent before the 22 Feb to one in November '16.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I get a failure report as below :- </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>System Restore report</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>(Red Flag) </span></p>
<p><span>“System Restore did not complete successfully. Computer’s system files and setting were not changed.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Details:</span></p>
<p><span>System Restore failed whilst restoring the directory from the restore point.
</span></p>
<p><span>Source: AppxStaging</span></p>
<p><span>Destination: %ProgramFiles%\WindowsApps</span></p>
<p><span>An unspecified error occurred during System Restore. (0x80070091)”</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What is the next steps I can take to resolve this problem please…</span></p>

            <p>Eventually resolved the problem by searching on Google for help...</p>
<p>I tried a system restore several times and that was responded to by the error 0x80070091...</p>
<p>I searched for that error on Google for that code and found "Born's Tech &amp; Windoze World".&nbsp;</p>
<p>By going through all the steps he recommended including removing the "WindowsApps" directory at 'Command Line' level I managed to restore the PC to the Jan'17 restore point - Although I did get another error code on completion of the system restore - 0x8000ffff.
 After reboot the PC does seem to be back to working OK but does seem to be a little slower.
