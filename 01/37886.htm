<h2>            Manual installation of windows update - DISM fails</h2>
                    <p>Hi all!</p>
<p>
</p><p>We've recently just installed a Windows 10 OS to our laboratory computer and I need to install some updates. Unfortunately, windows update is always stuck at 0% so I decided to search and download the updates manually. For most of the updates, they are .cab
 files instead of .exe. I've searched online and I found out that you can install them using:</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 30px">dism /online /add-package /packagepath:"file.cab"</p>
<p class="contentStandard" style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Unfortunately, I keep getting a 0x80070002 error. I tried moving the .cab installers to other directories (shorter directories with no spaces) but still get the same error. I also tried to rename the .cab files that contain "."
 in the filename, but still get the same error.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Is there are a way to resolve 0x80070002? Or is there another way to manually install these updates.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Thank you!</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply!&nbsp;I tried using the commands you suggested. This is the command I tried to use:</p>
<p>
</p><p>dism /online /add-package /packagepath:"E:\driver_updates\" /limitaccess</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get a "The limitaccess option is not recognized in this context". I also tried using source:WIM:path instead of packagepath. But I get the same error with the source option.</p>

<h2>            Subscriptio to phone Finland 100 mins - DOES NOT WORK.</h2>
                    <p>Hard to get information when you have no-one to contact and have to come to this community to air your complaints. I just subscribed to phone Finland from UK. I tried to phone 2 office numbers and it said I am not subscribed for phoning Finland. Restarted
 my phone and tried again (even checking is these were premium numbers and they are not), Tried several times and still same notice - not subscribed. Haven't used Skype in a while but won't be using them again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The numbers used started with 29 and 20 (after the 358 country code.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone else having the same problems and I want my subscription reimbursed please??????</p>

            For the digital games, have you tried unistalling them and reinstalling them? Also, does this behavior happen on other accounts on the console, and is this your home console?

<h2>            Need product key in order to reinstall Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to reinstall Windows 8 on a laptop for my uncle. He bought it from a computer store in New York (we are in Florida now) and they are not able to provide the product key that came with his Windows 8 installation. I have tried to refresh and other
 methods so don't tell me to do that. I need to reinstall it. I need to figure out the product key in order to do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, it is a genuine Windows install, fairly certain about that...</p>

<p>
</p><p>You do not mention the Manufacturer's Name of the Laptop or if Windows 8 was preinstalled on it&nbsp;or installed as an Upgrade by the Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This Program will find Product Keys if it is still up and running:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Also read this information if Windows 8 came preinstalled:</p>
<p>
</p><p>With Windows 8/8.1 The Product Key on preinstalled Operating Systems (HP, Acer, etc) is embedded in the BIOS in the Motherboard, so that the lost and/or worn C.O.A. Sticker problem is no more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you reinstall it will pick up the Product Key and activate the system&nbsp;automatically.</p>

            Hi nishantsharma1, 
<br />
<br />Like I said in my previous reply to you, Microsoft does not publish an app that does this. That's why I tried to find you a 3rd party app that does what you want it to. 
<br />
<br />Did you try the solution I sent?

<p>
</p><p>This isn't working. I'm not using Chrome. I'm using Firefox. The cursor is constantly flickering and won't stop. Now, while I'm typing, everything is working fine. But otherwise, the cursor keeps flickering with the little busy wheel with it.

<br />
Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
Try to remove Java using Windows Cleanup utility. Click <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290301" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here </a>for a link to the Windows Installer Cleanup Tool. <br />
You can use the utility to remove installation information for programs that were installed by using Windows Installer. Be aware that Windows Installer CleanUp Utility will not remove the actual program from your computer. However, it will remove the installation
 files so that you can start the installation, upgrade, or uninstall over. <br />
<br />
After it is removed, restart your computer and then try to install the latest version Java.&nbsp;If this fails, contact Java for&nbsp;further support. www.java.com<br />
You might also look at <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/help/uninstall_java.xml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this article</a> from Java. <br />

<p>Hello Gill54,</p>
<p>The VCM is probably VAIO Content Manager. From the post above, I have condensed this answer from David_John. This may be your issue.</p>
<p>Go to VAIO Content Analyser Settings in control panel.<br />
In the "Pictures and videos" and "Music" Tabs, deselect all "analyse" check boxes. This will stop the content analyser from creating those annoying folders.<br />
Then select "Monitoring Folders" icon. Deselect all the check boxes. A message will come up during the deselect to inform you that that folder will be removed from the content list, which is what you want.<br />
The Computer then did its processing stuff, and a few minutes later the individual picture folders were gone, and I was left with the original picture file.</p>
<p>Please reply back and let us know if this helped.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Xbox One S repair under warranty dissatisfaction - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Xbox One S repair under warranty dissatisfaction</h2>
                    <p>My xbox one s console quit working back in June. I reported it and requested shipping for repair seeing as it was still under warranty. I did not receive my shipping label in time for me to get it shipped out due to my military change of station orders(which
 I clearly made them aware of). I called them back and got ahold of a Paul on the support team, he was friendly and helpful. He set me up with a new shipping label and I sent my xbox in for repair. It seemed like it took forever to get my xbox back so I requested
 a tracking number. The FedEx tracking number I received said delivery date Aug 31st. Well two days later(after notifying my support rep that the shipping status hadn't changed) the tracking site change the delivery date to a week later, keep in mind this was
 FedEx 2 day Express shipping. &nbsp;Finally, when I did get my xbox back, it was laid on the front porch in a plastic bubble bag in the rain. I did not receive my power cord or the original store box I shipped it in. Disgusted by the way my equipment was treated
 and my missing property, I called the support line where I spoke with the Supervisor (stephanie) where she proceeded to tell me it was my fault that I sent the device in with the power cord and box. Then she said she could get me a new cord but no box. I think
 that is unsatisfactory customer service. I deserve to have my property returned to me. I was apparently supposed to have received an email on how to ship my Xbox ( I never got one, I have all my correspondence saved). Some how this is my fault.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would have expected more from a multi billion dollar organization, more respect for there customers and more willingness to satisfy. I was disgusted with the way my equipment was treated and the lack of communication and customer service. And to top it
 all off after Stephanie told me I would Not be getting my original store box back she said that for my inconvenience that award me a one month xbox live subscription. Wow a lousy $15 value for all my troubles. Their insolence is astounding. I expected more.&nbsp;</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>So to explain myself since I was not clear enough for you the first time. YES, it was battered with rain, to put it in perspective, I opened the door because I received an email notification that my xbox had been delivered. Not sure how long it had been
 out there but sure enough there it was on the edge of my porch in the pouring down rain. To better explain its packaging, it was in a clear plastic bag with holes in the top for handles. The xbox was gently covered with a clear foam wrap no thicker that a
 1/32". It was dripping as I picked it up. I immediately removed it from the packaging and dried it with a towel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, I quickly realized that my power cord and original xbox packaging did not accompany the returned product. Then as I said before, instead of your customer service defusing my momentary rage, I was met with an incompetent agent that I could
 hardly understand which literally just told me it was my fault and I shouldn't have sent it in packed that way. And when addressing the rain issue he said that have&nbsp;no control over&nbsp;FedEx. Then the Supervisor Stephanie sounded like a 20&nbsp;female kid and she quite
 literally just repeated what the other guy said. I was appalled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So to&nbsp;be absolutely clear:</p>
<p>-Yes, I am dissatisfied with the &nbsp;way my xbox was treated and handled. </p>
<p>-Yes, I am dissatisfied with it sitting out in the rain.</p>
<p>-Yes, I am dissatisfied with my power cable not being returned.</p>
<p>-Yes, I am dissatisfied with my original store box not being returned to me.</p>
<p>-No, I am not completely dissatisfied with the repair. I brought my xbox over to a friends house and used his power plug and it did turn on! Unfortunately, it was really slow, kept freezing during the setup and kept giving me errors during the process of
 trying to set up my account. Once it was all finally set up I brought it back to my house. So yes it turn on, but it functions as though its degraded. This is unacceptable seeing as all I've been through already with this whole process.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To close, I am highly disappointed with the process that has unfolded hence forth. I've always had a high respect for Microsoft and never had any other product issues. This has been a rollercoaster ride, all for a simple warranty repair. I don't
 think its acceptable to allow your customers to be treated this way. Especially ones that give there time and leave their families for months at a time to defend YOUR Freedom!</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could still use the original packing if you want to, but it's not guaranteed to come back which is why they warn against it. A lot of times they send back a refurbished console since it would be faster than fixing the original console. So most likely
 it's just a way for them to turn it around faster if they already have those consoles packaged up and can send the new one to you as soon as they receive your package.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Also, shipping in a brown box can also just reduce the chance of it being stolen. If someone were to see an actual Xbox box, they'd be more likely to snag it.<br />

<h2>            Very slow file copy speeds</h2>
                    <p>Hi there, </p>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I recently built myself a new PC and am currently running Windows 8 Pro on it. I have been having an issue with copying files between storage spaces/drives on the PC. Whenever I begin a file copy/move operation, the speed usually starts out at a respectable
 speed(ie. 40-50MB/s) and then rapidly drops down and fluctuates somewhere between 50KB/s - 800KB/s, occasionally going down to 0KB/s for a few minutes. Trying to copy a large file(ie. 10GB) takes hours/days where on all my other machines it would normally
 take a few minutes. I tried using Teracopy to see if it would circumvent the problem but it seems to have the same issue. If I transfer a file from my Laptop to the PC over the network(letting the laptop control the transfer) it will sit at a steady 5-8MB/s
 though. Still less than ideal but much faster than what it will do internally. I also updated to bios on my M/B to the latest version just to rule it out as an issue to no avail.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I was wondering if someone could point me in the right direction on troubleshooting this issue and helping me find out what is causing the bottleneck. If it helps the machine is a i5 3570k,, Asrock Extreme 4 M/B, 16GB DDR3 ram and a Gigabyte 7950 GPU.
 I also have several HDD's plus a Samsung 830 SSD for the system drive.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If anyone can help me with this issue I would greatly appreciate it!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p>Thanks!</p>
</div>
<div><br />

            Sorry&nbsp;guys for not getting back to this sooner. I have managed to sort out my problem.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I figured I'd test out all the HDD's in the storage space and ran a benchmark on them to find out if they are all playing ball. Turns out one of them wasn't. Its read/write speeds were about 1% of what all the other drives were getting.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So I think problem solved.... WRONG! My Storage pool was split up into&nbsp;numerous&nbsp;spaces most of which contains media files on simple spaces plus personal files and photos etc on two way&nbsp;mirrored&nbsp;spaces. It turns out you can't just remove a drive from the
 pool like you can in WHSv1 if there are simple spaces in the pool. I ended up having to back up all my data to another PC(luckily I do anyway!), delete all the spaces from the pool and only then would it let me remove the drive from the pool. After this I
 could finally rebuild all the spaces and then copy all the data back over.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If MS wants this technology to be taken seriously, they NEED to implement a way to replace failing or upgrade to larger drives without having to remove all the data or it is next to useless.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I hope this was able to help someone...</div>

<p>Hello Coach,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let's determine the cause of the issue. To get started, we'd like clarify if you have tried using another keyboard and mouse. If so, please check if the same issue happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If isolated that the problem was with the keyboard and the mouse, you can consider updating their driver on the Device Manager. You may check this article:

            Yes I have tried different keyboard and mouse. I can restart the computer and windows 10 comes up and that's as far as it will let me go. I can't login&nbsp;to get to the device manager because the keyboard doesn't work for me to type my password in.

            Hi FlyLow, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />Are you trying to perform a clean installation of Windows 10 1809? Or an update from an existing installation?
<br />
<br />I'd recommend performing a full clean installation of Windows 10 1809 for the highest chance of success. Here's a tutorial on how to clean install:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-clean-install-of-windows-10/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If you're performing an upgrade from an existing Windows 10 installation, you could try disabling the WiFi card in your PC through Device Manager, then try the installation. Here are the steps:
<br />
<br />- Press Windows Key+X and choose Device Manager.
<br />- Find your WiFi device in the list.
<br />- Right-click it and choose Uninstall.
<br />
<br />Hopefully that helps! Please let me know if you need anything else! Thanks!       
        </p>

            HI FlyLow.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />That's the buggy and annoying Upgrade Advisor.  I'd cut it out and upgrade by the most stable method, by installing the Media Creation Tool from this link  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a> choosing Download Tool Now, install the tool, open it and choose Upgrade this PC Now.   This will save your files and apps while bringing you up to the latest version by the most stable method.  It will also bring all of your Updates current and solve most problems since it reinstalls Windows.  
<br />
<br />If any problems report back the verbatim error and number, then continue with these steps for overcoming Version Upgrade problems:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also do the vastly superior Clean Install following the illustrated steps in this link which include everything that works best in Windows 10:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Forza horizon 3-4 Driving manual with clutch</h2>
                    I'm just learning the driving/racing skills. I've been trying to transition from automatic to manual with clutch. I'm having a hard time figuring out when to shift. I configured the controller to have A as clutch, B as shift up and X as shift down. Now,
 how do I know when to shift up and when to shift down. Talk to me like a beginner please. I don't know how to drive a stick in real life, so this is a learning curve thing for me. Explain how I learn to shift properly. Thank you

</p><p>This is how I learned when I am accelerating and trying to speed up if I feel I DO NOT have enough power I simply will DOWN shift one time to give me more power at a lower speed. If you are accelerating and "redlining" or bouncing the RPM's at the top range
 simply give the car a UP shift.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully, this has helped you some. Feel free to ask any questions you may have.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The clutch must be pressed down while you shift gears. You let go of the clutch after you’ve changed gears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could try manual without clutch so you could practice finding the right time to shift gears. Gears should be shifted up when the tachometer starts to get high (in RPM’s) which you could also hear in the car’s engine (it sounds higher pitched). Keep an
 eye on the tachometer and an ear on the engine noise as you race.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Acceleration is the rate of change of speed with respect to time. Every gear lets you accelerate through certain ranges of speeds (e.g. Gear 1 does 0-15mph, Gear 2 does 16-30mph, and so on -- but this is only an example as cars are different), and will eventually
 stop accelerating as the RPMs get too high, which is when you want to shift up to get more speed. I like to shift up just as the needle hits the red.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should shift down a gear (or two) on turns, as you are usually wanting to slow down at that point. How many gears you shift down depends on how much speed you’re losing from braking.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. For the record, I am not a Forza/car expert. I kinda learned this when I began playing Forza Motorsport 5 and I’ve been winning races fine ever since. Like real life driving, practice makes perfect.</p>

</p><p>Everything he stated above is correct, just remember you do not have to deal with the clutch unless you turn that on in your settings. Seeing you're still learning the basic idea of upshifting and downshifting I would wait before you turn on the clutch in
 your settings, just stick to dealing with up shift and down shift for now!&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span>Practical actions:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1. release gas</span><br />
<span>2. shift up (clutch + shift-up button. What I do is a swipe action since the clutch for me is A and the shift-up is B)</span><br />
<span>3. press on gas</span></span></p>
<p>Considerations:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Don't let off the gas. Not necessary in this game and it's actually faster to not lift of gas when shifting.</span><br />
<br />
<span>2. Everyone fast uses MC because the car accelerates better due to reduced shift times. Clutch kicking is a benefit but is not the reason why manual with clutch is used.
</span><br />
<br />
<span>3. The benefits of using the clutch vary depending on transmission type. This is more of a car by car issue and only applies to a handful of modern cars and race cars.
</span><br />
<br />
<span>4. Your power curve will determine when and where to shift. Generally you can get away with running well into the max rpm but if it's a torque monster, early shifting may be faster. This is highly car dependent.
</span><br />
<br />
<span>5. The ping you hear when up shifting is normal. Not much you can do with that. Now if you are hearing a loud and long ping you shifted to late and did lose time on your up shift.</span><br />
<br />
<span>With the crazy builds you need in order to be fast in FH3, the amount of power in a car can compensate for lackluster clutch usage.
</span><br />
<br />
<span>It's also harder to see the benefits. In the Motorsport titles its much easier to see...especially when folks are in bone stock cars.

            It's surprisingly close to an actual standard transmission car. Getting close to turns another thing you can do is clutch popping. I use this for 90 degree turns. When you get close to the turn, let off the gas and hold the clutch button until the arch
 of the turn, then shift down a gear and let go of the clutch button and slam the accelerator. It'll&nbsp; give&nbsp; you a small boost of speed as well. The only issue is sometimes you'll pull to the inside of the turn, depending on your build

<p>There are some really great posts on here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I race a lot online (PC and console) and for me when using a controller, I turn the manual clutch off</p>
<p>I applaud you for using the manual clutch, I race with people who do that and they are very fast.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I always use manual shifting.</span></p>
<p>I used the Manual Clutch for a long time and for me, there is just too much going on with the controller already.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example: keeping a consistent racing line while trail braking and then throwing another button press on top of that.&nbsp; That is too much for me.&nbsp; I try and brake late and keep momentum through the corners.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Manual Clutch helps with acceleration and braking (quicker shift times) which definitely helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When racing with a wheel and pedals, I use the clutch.</p>
<p>Racing with a wheel and pedals is like being a drummer.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">It will take some practice.</p>
<p><span>Don't forget to blip the throttle on downshift.</span></p>

    <title>One computer here has become very slow opening web pages. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            One computer here has become very slow opening web pages.</h2>
                    
<p>Cable modem, SMC router, several XP computers.&nbsp; Internet security software installed, running,&nbsp;and up to date.&nbsp; All Microsoft patches in place.&nbsp; Computers have been reliable until this.&nbsp; A couple of months ago one computer became much slower dealing with
 web pages, sometimes more than a minute to open a page.&nbsp;&nbsp;It looks like this might&nbsp;possibly be&nbsp;DNS resolution, but I cannot be certain.&nbsp; Other computers here do not show this.&nbsp; DNS addresses, etc. are the same on each computer. Computers and router and modem
 rebooted.&nbsp; No change.&nbsp; Help desk for the internet security software&nbsp;did a complete uninstall and reinstall and finally a new version.&nbsp; No change.&nbsp; Multiple scans done looking for any infections.&nbsp; Nothing found.&nbsp; Tried other reputable spyware scanners.&nbsp; Nothing
 found.&nbsp; Tried running the little executable from Microsoft to repair the net stack, I think.&nbsp; No change.&nbsp; Tried other browsers.&nbsp; IE8, Opera 10, Comodo Dragon all show the same very slow behavior on opening each page and item on the page.&nbsp; Tried speed test
 web pages and once the transfer starts the speed is not slow.</p>
<p>So from all this I think I've eliminated possible causes outside this one computer.</p>
<p>Is there a way I can track down and fix this with the minimum amount of ripping things up and making changes?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Have you tried clearing the DNS cache on the machine?</p>
<p>Go to a command prompt and type "IPCONFIG /FLUSHDNS" see if that helps.</p>
<p>If you disable, temporarily as a test, the Internet security software does that affect the speed? &nbsp;Which Internet security software are you running?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>As you instructed I&nbsp;flushed the DNS cache.&nbsp; No change.</p>
<p>Flushed browser cache and watched specific page load.&nbsp;I temporarily disabled the security package. Exited browser, brought it back up, flushed cache and watched&nbsp;same page load. There might be a very slight increase in speed with&nbsp;this disabled, but the long
 latency for each page and item on a page is still clearly there.&nbsp; Was NIS 2009.&nbsp; Had been using NIS for at least 3&nbsp;years. Went through help with them.&nbsp; Now NIS 2010.&nbsp; Turned security back on.</p>
<p>I just ran a little factorization benchmark I've had for may years which&nbsp;is only cpu intensive.&nbsp; Speed is as good as it was years ago.</p>
<p>All other apps run just fine.&nbsp; 1 gig memory.&nbsp; 4 gig free space out of 19 gig in the partition that I use.&nbsp; Been about that for a very long time.</p>
<p>The change in browser speed was sudden and dramatic.&nbsp; No wave of new installs, very rarely anything new installed.&nbsp; No changes to the network configuration.&nbsp; So I don't tend to think that the web page suggesting there isn't enough memory or there are a decade
 of accumulated fragments likely explains this.&nbsp; As I said when I first posted, all the Microsoft bug patches are in place.&nbsp; But I don't believe this happened immediately after a bugpatch Tuesday. I would have watched for and recognized that. I ran ccleaner
 and&nbsp;superantispyware and&nbsp;other legitimate scanners, nothing found and no change.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll dig through Kelly's stuff and see if I find anything, but starting down his list gives the impression most items don't seem relate to this.</p>
<p>It is just my guess but I'm thinking something to do with networking broke suddenly.&nbsp; The behavior is very consistent since then.</p>
<p>Thanks for any suggestions</p>

<p>O.K. &nbsp;Couple things to try:</p>
<p>1. Try changing the static IP address on the affected machine.</p>
<p>2. Try taking the affected machine to a different desk and plugging in at a different cable. &nbsp;You might also try taking a machine that's fine and plugging it into the affected desk.</p>
<p>See if either of those things make a difference.</p>

<p>Excellent ideas.&nbsp; Why didn't I already try that?!?!</p>
<p>As instructed, changed address from 192.168.2.2 to 192.168.2.7.&nbsp; No change.</p>
<p>As instructed, gently disconnected the network cables from the computer ends of two machines and swapped those.&nbsp; No change.</p>
<p>Then gently disconnected the network cables from the router ends and swapped those.&nbsp; No change.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<p>Hmm...well that takes care of most of the obvious things. &nbsp;How are internal network operations? &nbsp;Have you tried transferring a large file from this machine to a server or other workstation inside the office? &nbsp;Compare the same file transfer to one of the
 other machines?</p>
<p>If you ping your router from the affected machine how's the latency?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does this machine have a HOSTS file in use?</p>

<p>Internally I can ftp large files at between 3 and 6 Mbytes/second, it varies some but doesn't appear obviously different for this one compared to the others.</p>
<p>Ping time from any machine to the router is consistently 0ms with no latency at startup.</p>
<p>Ping time from any machine to an outside service we use is consistently 51-55ms.&nbsp; But on the slow machine there is very commonly 8 seconds or more latency before ping shows any progress.&nbsp; The other machines do not show that.&nbsp; With the slow machine pinging
 ip address instead of domain name the 8 second or more latency appears gone.&nbsp; So this again seems to point at DNS as the culprit.</p>
<p>Yes there is a HOSTS file. About 3 dozen 127.0.0.1 entries, looks like they are all notorious ad banner pushers.</p>

<p>Same HOSTS file on all machines?</p>
<p>If you PING your DNS service by IP address from the affected machine is it still noticeably slower than one of the working machines?</p>
<p>Do you have an internal server for DNS or just public servers?</p>
<p>What kind of firewall are you behind? &nbsp;SonicWall? &nbsp;SnapGear? &nbsp;Something like that?</p>

<p>Ping by by ip address gives the same round trip time for all machines.&nbsp; Ping by any domain name gives 8 to as much as 30 seconds latency before printing the first line of output on the affected machine and 0 seconds on the working machines, but the latency
 does not change the round trip time and it is the same as ping by IP address.</p>
<p>Have been given several different directions for DNS, "Use your ISP DNS" versus "Use your router gateway address" versus "Use 4.2.2.1"&nbsp; The affected machine had been perfectly happy for lots of years using the second of those.&nbsp; When this&nbsp;problem started&nbsp;I
 thought something in that might have broken so I switched that to 4.2.2.1 like the unaffected.&nbsp; No change.</p>
<p>Firewall turned on in the SMC Barricade 7004VBR and NIS firewall running on each machine, all identical installs a week or so ago.</p>
<p>HOSTS files on most of the unaffected machines is ~250kbytes dated 9/2008 which probably means that was put in place by NIS then, filled with scum domains.&nbsp; HOSTS file on the affected machine is 3 dozen lines and has a newer date, unknown source or history.&nbsp;
 So I copied a HOSTS from unaffected to affected, rebooted.&nbsp; No change.</p>

<h2>            How much space does a clean install of windows 7 pro 64 bit use</h2>
                    <p>I've just installed Windows 7 on a sandisk 120gb SSD drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;In "my computer" the drive is showing 67.2GB free of 111GB. </p>
<p>This make the install around 43GB!!!&nbsp;which seems to much.</p>
<p>Any ideas?</p>

            <p>Windows 7 64 bit uses 8 to 10 GBs of disk space on a clean install. </p>
<p>Please note, you might seeing less disk space because of the following reasons:</p>
<p>System Retore might be using some of the disk space, see instructions below to reduce that.</p>
<p>Also:</p>
<p>Depending on the amount of RAM you have installed, it will require more disk space for paging, hibernation and dump files. So, 8 GBs of RAM will use 8 GBs of disk space for the page file.

<p><em>Configuring System Protection settings</em></p>
<p>To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the
<strong>Configure </strong>button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the
 amount allocated. Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System
 Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance,
 if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file.
