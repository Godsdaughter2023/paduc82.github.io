<h2>            Windows RT 8.1 apps not opening</h2>
                    I have a desktop computer with Windows 8 originally installed on it. I had bought many apps and then updated to Windoes RT 8.1. Now, none &nbsp;of my apps are opening. Most of them open and then immediately close, while some open and then load forever without
 ever opening. Even the Windows Store does not open. I am starting to regret having ever updated. Please help!

<p>Every time i switch on my computer it goes into into a continuous back up mode and when i click on the back up in progress it does not give me any option to either stop it or even the option to change where my back up goes too. all i have is a blank page.
 I got this error code 0x80070422 when i did a troubleshoot on this problem and it also said that back up was disabled. Because of this issue i do not have any restore points on my computer so i can reset it to an earlier date. PLEASE HELP</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for reaching out to Microsoft Community where you can find the necessary information about Microsoft products!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You are unable to backup, get error </span><strong>0x80070422 </strong><span>and there is no restore point in the computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I can imagine the frustration when there is no restore points in the computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>The issue may occur if the startup type of certain services are not set appropriately.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Is it the
<strong>complete</strong> error message?</span></p>
<span><strong>Method 1:
</strong></span>
<p><span>Make sure that the startup type of services mentioned below are set accordingly:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Volume Shadow Copy (VSS) - Manual</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Microsoft Software Shadow Copy Provider (SWPRV) - Manual</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Remote Procedure Call (RPCSS) - Automatic</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>COM+ Event System (eventsystem) - Manual" &amp; "Automatic</span></p>
<p><span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>System Event Notification Service (sens) - Automatic</span></p>
<p><span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Windows Backup – Manual.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>To change the startup type, right click on the service, click properties and then select startup type.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 2:</strong></span><span> </span><strong>System File Checker (SFC) Scan</strong></p>
<p><span>SFC scan will find any missing or incorrect system files and repairs them.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Refer the site:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>How to use the System File Checker tool to troubleshoot missing or corrupted system files on Windows Vista or on Windows 7</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</strong></span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Also, follow the steps mentioned below to change backup settings:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click </span><strong>start</strong></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Type </span><strong>Backup and Restore</strong></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Now cick backup and <span>
&nbsp;</span>restore and you would get options to change the settings.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this helps. If the issue persists, let us know and we would be glad to help you.</span></p>

<br />You have one of a few options to consider here:
<br />
<br />Option 1: 
<br />
<br />Backup and perform a clean install - you have exhausted everything thats reasonably possible. Sometimes, your system has some unknown underlying issue that creates a blocker for upgrades. Save yourself: time, frustration and just perform a clean install.
<br />
<br />Yes, its a chore, but this man made stuff and it ain't perfect and it will never be. 
<br />
<br />Its better for you to have your data and go through the annoying convenience of reinstalling apps and drivers. 
<br />
<br />Backup:

<br />
<br />Option 2: Don't bother with the upgrade.
<br />
<br />My recommendation to users going forward is not to pounce on every new Windows 10 Feature Update that is released. If your system has been working just fine with the current version, wait it out a while or skip it all together. If there is some specific feature in the update you want, then thats an exception, but these feature updates are becoming more difficult to install on older devices; and it sometimes makes you wonder if the inconvenience is worth the hassle just to keep doing the same thing. 
<br />
<br />If you look at whats considered the flagship features of Windows 10 1709, they are aimed at newer generation devices like the new Surface Book 2. Otherwise welcome features like Story Remix, which you have to upgrade to 1709 to get, could be supplanted with third party alternatives.

<br />
<br />Option 3: upgrade to another release such as Windows 10 1703 
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:

            OK first, this error is very general, there are 30-40 things that will give this same error message (hence the need to look at the log files). I have tried at least (not exaggerating) 3-4 dozen suggestions to fix this issue. If you have tried every other
 suggestion you have found and still can’t upgrade to Windows 10 try this.<br />
<br />
Move the hard drive connection on the motherboard from where it is at (probably labeled something like “hdd0”) to where your CD/DVD drive is connected (Probably labeled “SATA0”) If you need the DVD drive for the upgrade plug it into “SATA1”. You may need to
 change BIOS to allow booting. Start the system and allow it to boot in to Windows. If you are doing an in-place upgrade (I was) run the installer now. If not, restart and boot from your installation media. After (if) the upgrade is successful you can change
 the drive connections back. I had 3 systems out of 20 that would hang during install and/or return this error after reboot. Doing this worked to upgrade all 3.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps you.<br />
P.S. The DISM commands (&gt;Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth&nbsp; for example) that are recommended, do not work in Windows 7. Instructions/suggestions don’t make this clear.<br />
<br />
Background info: 20 systems, all running Windows 7 with latest updates, 15 Identical Dell Precision T7500s purchased at the same time, 3 Dell PrecisionT7500s identical to the first 15 but purchased later, 2 Dell T5600 Precisions purchased most recently. Of
 these systems, 1 of the original 15, 1 of the 3 added later and 1 of the 2 T5600, had the same error upgrading. The other 17 systems had zero problems upgrading.

<p>I posted a response in another thread, about the issue, because I think that issue is more closely related to my specific case, but since I saw this thread when I was looking for some answers,
 I figured I would post it here as well, in case someone else here finds the information useful or someone lands here from a search.<br />

</p><p>So, after a few hours messing with Windows 10 x64 1804 build 17134, I finally got it installed on a system with an ASUS P6T Deluxe V2 motherboard, running the Intel Core i7 920 with 24 GB of RAM:&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 170, 1)"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/nlisEV4.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://i.imgur.com/nlisEV4.png</a></span></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<li>I&nbsp;turned VT-d off in the BIOS, after reading that there may be some problems with that.&nbsp; I'm going to turn it back on here in a moment (when my RAID gets done rebuilding) to see if that really affected anything.&nbsp; It didn't initially, but it may have contributed
 to the whole.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</li><li>I downloaded the official&nbsp;<a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MediaCreationTool1803.exe from here</a>.<br />
&nbsp;</li><li>Running the tool, I downloaded the ISO image for Windows 10 1804 x64, build 17134.<br />
&nbsp;</li><li>I used Rufus USB Key Maker (<a href="https://rufus.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">available here</a>) to copy the ISO image to a new 8.0 USB thumb drive, but I made one important change in the config and one that doesn't matter much at all.&nbsp; By default,
 the Partition scheme of the ISO / USB stick with RUFUS is GPT.&nbsp; I changed it to MBR.&nbsp; That also automatically changed the File system from<em>&nbsp;FAT32 (default)</em>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>NTFS</em>, AND it changed the Target system from&nbsp;<em>UEFI (non CSM)</em>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>BIOS
 (or UEFI-CSM)</em>.&nbsp; I also changed the volume label (which is unimportant) from&nbsp;<em>ESD-ISO</em>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>WIN10_1804</em>, for my own sanity.&nbsp; Here's a screen shot:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://i.imgur.com/9vug9aK.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://i.imgur.com/9vug9aK.png</a><a href="https://i.imgur.com/HbS4QIW.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><br />
<br />
</a></li><li>I put the USB drive in a USB 2.0 port (front of the Chassis, in my case, so it was using the USB motherboard header), but I'm assuming it would also work for the back / main motherboard USB ports.&nbsp; On POST, I hit F8 to open the boot device selector screen.&nbsp;
 It selected USB, and I got the blinking cursor upper left-hand corner, for what felt like the thousandth time.&nbsp; I sighed, walked away to get a drink, and when I returned to try something else, Windows was in the setup installer.&nbsp; I rebooted to verify the status
 ... it worked again, but it stalled on the blinking cursor in upper left for about 30 seconds, which is not normal ... but then it continued without a hitch.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Note, in my specific case, I formatted the SSD completely and installed a fresh everything.&nbsp; It was late ... I didn't want to mess with / wait for an upgrade to complete.&nbsp; I'm not sure if that would work.&nbsp; Anyway,&nbsp;<strong>I believe the working solution is
 to make sure the USB drive is formatted with a MBR partition scheme rather than GPT / Target system BIOS rather than UEFI</strong>.&nbsp; Possible addition of the VT-d BIOS setting being disabled.&nbsp; And everything works as I'd expect now.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Second note, more for Microsoft:&nbsp; 1709 didn't require jumping through these hoops.&nbsp; I would look at what changed between the *UPGRADE* process in 1709 and the same in 1804.&nbsp; Since I had been upgrading in-state, I'm not sure if the change would have been reflected
 earlier in the actual system install media ISO.&nbsp; It definitely was in 1804, but it may have manifested there earlier.&nbsp; It didn't manifest in the upgrade process until 1804.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            My mouse is not visible during games.</h2>
                    <p>When I try to play Heroes of Newerth on my laptop, the mouse is invisible as soon as I open up to the home screen of the game. I can still click on things by moving around and trying to get the mouse on top of buttons but I cannot see the mouse itself. I
 am running on Windows 8. I do have the bluetooth mouse meant for that new half tablet thing but the guy at the store said this should be fine.

<h2>            Windows 10 Store Issues when downloading apps.</h2>
                    <p>I had the problem that windows store was not showing download progress and was taking much longer than usual to download a small file, often showing 0.1mb downloaded of 0.1mb. Thus, to solve the issue i changed my region to my current one. I had not changed
 it because I had bought the device elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing that and running WSreset I am now getting this error when I try to download an app : Try that again. Error code: 0x80010108</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Google has no results regarding this error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kindly assist me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edit: this is only happening for the windows store update. all other apps do not flag this error.</p>
<p>

            Hi:<br />
<br />
Thank you so much; this is very helpful.&nbsp; But, as of this morning, the computer just goes to a black screen when I turn it on.&nbsp; Even the initial "Acer, press F2 to change setup" screen no longer appears.<br />
<br />
Is there anything I can do at this point?&nbsp; Will the Acer even recognize an external drive running recovery discs?<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 and Windows Live Email - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dennislook  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 and Windows Live Email</h2>
                    <p>Although there are many requests concerning problems with Windows Live Email and Win 10, I have found no specific questions about this particular problem. The program opens, all of my folders and saved mail are intact. When it checks for mail it appears
 to be working through the connection, authorization and checking for mail properly. At this point the error box registers the following message:
</p>
<p><span>Server: 'plus.pop.mail.yahoo.com'</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Windows Live Mail Error ID: 0x800C013E</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Protocol: POP3</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Port: 995</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Secure(SSL): Yes </span>
</p>
<p><span>It will not retrieve mail, I have sent messages to my account and get no error code on sending and they&nbsp;had been received&nbsp;when I checked my server's mail site.</span></p>
<p><span>As stated to this point it appears to work well. I have the email app that came with Win 10 but removing deleted emails is time consuming, there appears to be no way to remove them other than one
 at a time.</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for any assistance you may be able to render.</span></p>

            <p>Thank you for your response, it is indeed a frustrating problem. There must be a conflict somewhere but where is the question.</p>
<p>I have removed and downloaded new from the Essentials site and reinstalled and yet the same results. I find it odd that it will send and not receive. If the email program that came with Win 10 were not such a sucky little creature I would not bother but
 it is not a good program. </p>
<p>There must be an answer but I have found a lot of people experiencing problems since the upgrade and nobody seems to be sure of where to go from here.</p>
<p>The only other choice is to remove it from the registry, make sure all files associated with it are deleted&nbsp;and reload again to see it that will fix it.</p>

            I now have the program working well. I removed all reference to Windows Live from the registry and program files. I had to go that route because it did not appear in "programs and features" section of the control panel to remove and it would not reinstall
 or repair. Thanks all for your input. To do this, caution must be taken not to interfere with registry files that could affect other programs adversely.

            <p>I'm glad you've solved your problem, but it's not clear if by "program working well" you are referring to Windows 10 or to Windows Live Mail.&nbsp; I assume if you have removed all reference to Windows Live that means you no longer use it at all.&nbsp; After doing
 the Windows 10 upgrade, I cannot get Windows Live Mail to open beyond an empty template of its setup, which then will not close without using Task Manager.&nbsp; I have come across folders holding my saved email content, but nothing legible opens, and since I cannot
 open the program anymore, I'm unable to either export the contact list and saved folders of old mail or to back up the information before trying the uninstall/reinstall steps.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the mailbox is worthless to me as is, I'm considering uninstalling Windows Essentials altogether and then reinstalling on the slim chance that a reinstall will work and the program will find the stored mailbox files.&nbsp; I'm not enough of a "tekkie" to
 try messing with registry and program files as no doubt I would delete something critical and end up with more problems.&nbsp; (I don't mind switching to Outlook, but why on earth isn't the contact list feature more accessible?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>One more comment:&nbsp; Somewhere I came across a posting that said Microsoft was going to make a cd available that would fix Windows Live Mail for users who wanted it, once an update to Windows 10 had been released.&nbsp; Has anyone heard if this?&nbsp; It's still pretty
 much impossible to get through to Microsoft support, I've found.</p>

            <p>In reply to your question, both Win 10 and Windows Live Mail are working properly. My situation was a little different because the Win Live Mail would not show on the "Programs and Features" page to remove it. I copied the files saved&nbsp;from an earlier date
 to the folders and then rebooted. I then went back to 'Programs and Features" and removed the Windows Essentials program. Reboot and do a clean install of Windows Essentials. If asked "Save User Profile Data" answer yes. Once installed, reboot and it should
 work. It would be a good move to insure that your data is not lost by copying the data to a thumb drive so you can copy them back is data is lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>BTW, leave the registry alone, that could really give your computer&nbsp;a migraine that you would not soon forget,</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>The path for the data is:</p>
<p>C:./Users/(your account)/App Data/Local/Microsofft/Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>That location contains folders that hold the data for user accounts, contacts, in box and out box as well as any other folders you have created. Carefully select the information you wish to save and copy the folders to a thumb drive.</p>
<p>There should be no lost data but if it does occur you will have it saved on the thumb drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Despite the heartburn on startup, I find Win 10 to be a little faster than 7 and a smoothly operating OS once the conflicts were resolved. You will lose some old programs while others that should not work do. That aside, I am quite pleased with the results,
 at least for now.</p>

            Microsoft no longer supports Windows Live Mail. &nbsp;They now have another app for Mail in the store called Mail. This is a terrible app with very few features. &nbsp;Why Windows Live Mail is no longer supported has not received an answer when I asked &nbsp;Windows
 support. &nbsp;It was so much easier to use than the current Mail app and had much more that you could do with your email. The new Mail app won't even let you set a default font and size. &nbsp;Each time you use it it goes back to their font and size.

            <p>I sympathize with your frustration with the Mail app that comes with Win 10. As mentioned in my earlier post (Aug 3, 2015) above it is a poor excuse. My problem with it was once you delete each piece of mail it goes to the deleted folder then you have to
 delete each one, one at a time from that folder. That is time consuming if you have over 300 per day that needs to be removed.
</p>
<p>I had other specific problems&nbsp; with Win Live Mail that had to be overcome to just get it where I could get it into the "programs and features" so it could be deleted (earlier posts in this thread). I have now&nbsp;used it now for over a year with no problems,
 it took a bit of work but it was worth it.</p>
<p>If you do not have it available on your computer or cannot get it to work properly&nbsp;reply to this post and I will try to help you through getting it operative. I have found that not all computers respond to the same "fixes" the same way, it all depends on
 the configuration you have applied but it will work well with Win 10 in most cases.</p>

                    <div><span>I have to reset my password because I couldn't get in to my computer. but you can't use an old password. so, you make a new one. but can't remember because you had to use
 some different variation of my password. so, I opt in for a pin. but, had problems with windows and tried to reset everything. Now I'm stuck. I tried to open the safe mode and now I'm stuck in the loop I can't get out of. can't get in with the password even
 though I changed it. Turns out I didn't change it in the system only my windows live account. wtf is that! you change your password only on window live and not on the computer you were trying to change it on! don't forget your password because you’re going
 to have to make up a new one you have never used before and easily forget it because you only use it once.&nbsp; STUPID!!! once i get this fixed I will NEVER buy a windows computer ever again in my life! I will not buy my kids, family or friends a windows computer
 either! I will make sure that people that are close to me know how stupid and unreliable windows computers are. i will let them know that if you lose your password you will have to make up a harder to remember password. I will let them know that the the older
 the computer gets the longer the boot time gets. good luck trying to fix it because windows wants you to go out and buy another windows key just so you can repair the stupid thing they broke! i'm so done with this!&nbsp;</span></div>

<br />net start bits
<br />net start msiserver 
<br />
<br />2. Type following in Windows Start Search box (Cortana) and hit Enter %systemroot%\Logs\CBS &gt; Rename CBS.Log to something else.

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Install only the one that matches your bits. In this case, the middle one is for 32-bit (x86).</p>

<p>If you read my post carefully you will see that I identify my system in the very first line.
<strong>"Win7 Home 64 bit".</strong></p>
<p>The second paragraph identifies the choice made for my 64 bit Win 7 system.
<strong>"KB4499406"</strong><strong>. It was 64 bit version for Win7 &amp; </strong><strong>Server 2008 R2.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think it could be much simpler. Or detailed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The numbers at the start of each identifying line is the order they were in when downloaded &amp; the order I followed in executing/running them on my computer. Below, BLOCKED &amp; MISSING PARAMETERS describe what happened. The other 4 are marked "DONE" meaning
 completed successfully.</p>

<p>#3 was suppose to update to 4.8 but failed to run. 4.7.2 did update.</p>
<p>#5 was some kind of msi patch register fix targeted at amd64 (mine Acer Intel Pentium P6100).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Both failed. 4.8 IS NOT installed. But the just released update was satisfied. I ran windows update &amp; there are no new updates pending &amp; all of my hidden updates for NET framework that failed since Sep 2018 are gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All NET framework updates since Sep 2018 through Windows update has FAILED. I hid them after failure.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering in what order I should have installed these 6 separate files. I followed the order in which they were displayed for download.</p>
<p>

<p>The dialogue box states that " The game is running in software rendering mode" &nbsp; It Then says Hardware acceleration is either disabled or not supported by my video card driver, which could slow the game. &nbsp; Make sure that I have the latest video card installed
 and that hardware acceleration is turned on.The game was fine before I re-installed Windows7 and Office 2003.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Let’s try the below methods and check.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest that you enable the display acceleration on the computer and check if the game works.</p>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp; Open Display Settings by clicking the Start button, clicking&nbsp; Control Panel, clicking&nbsp; Appearance and Personalization, clicking Personalization, and then clicking&nbsp; Display Settings.
<br />
b)&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Display Settings, and then click Advanced Settings.<br />
c)&nbsp;&nbsp; Click the Troubleshoot tab, and then click Change Settings. If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
d)&nbsp;&nbsp; Move the Hardware Acceleration slider to Full.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p>If the above step fails then you will need to download and install the updates graphics adapter drivers by visiting the adapter manufacturer website and check if it helps.</p>
<p><strong>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly<br />

    <title>Win 7 crashes after installing more RAM - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mad19  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 7 crashes after installing more RAM</h2>
                    I bought new RAM (4gb) for my system, but as soon as I install it, I get a rash of bluescreen crashes and total shutdowns.<br />
<br />
It is the correct type of memory (DDR2), my motherboard can handle up to 16gb (Asus P5Q SE2), and I'm running 64-bit Win 7, so I should be able to use past 2gb of RAM.<br />
<br />
"My Computer" shows that the system now has 4gb of RAM, as does the BIOS list, so the sticks must not be faulty.<br />
<br />
To make it even&nbsp;more confusing, I can work in Safe Mode (which is how I'm posting this). I am completely stumped.<br />
<br />
HELLLLLLP!<br />

<h2>            Getting windows ready Stuck</h2>
                    I have been using windows 10 for about two weeks all with out a problem until today. I needed to do a restart and I selected start/restart button. The computer went to blue screen and reads " Getting Windows Ready Don't turn off your computer". It has
 been like that for about an hour. Can someone tell me what to do now? I really need to get some work done today and this is not helping me. 3 hours later and its finally back up and running. Am I doing something wrong? Is there settings that I need to change?

            &nbsp;Hi,
<div>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.<br />
I am happy to hear your interest in availing Windows 10 on your computer. </p>
<div>I am sorry to hear the inconvenience you have experienced upon Windows 10 Upgrade.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If you’re running Windows 10 and you don’t have the update yet, you can manually check for and install the update by following these steps:<br />
1. Make sure your PC is plugged in and connected to the Internet using a non-metered connection. Don’t disconnect, unplug, or turn off your PC while the update is being installed.<br />
2. Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, tap Settings, and then tap Change PC settings.
<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer up, click Settings, and then click Change PC settings.)
<br />
3. Tap or click Update and recovery, and then tap or click Windows Update. <br />
4. Tap or click Check now.<br />
5. If updates are found, tap or click View details.<br />
6. In the list of updates, select the update containing KB 2919355, and then tap or click Install.
<br />
If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, enter the password or provide confirmation.<br />
7. After the installation is complete, restart your PC and sign in.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
We suggest you to create Installation Media for safety. <br />

<h2>            Not receiving alert on Skype when someone calls my Skype Number on  windows desktop version</h2>
                    <p>For the past few days, i've noticed that the office skype number has been very quiet. Unusually quiet. I've called out from our skype number to check if the skype was working and it did seem to make the call. But when I specifically called the skype number
 from a phone I wasn't receiving a notification on my desktop Skype App and neither was I taken to an answering machine to leave a message.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know what the issue could be, I've tried updating my skype version but I'm already on the latest version of Skype.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know what the problem could be and how I can get it fixed, as the number is essential for us to provide good customer service.</p>

            Hi Glenda. My problem is that I have already installed Family Safety in his computer, and it actually worked for several weeks (meaning to say that it sent me weekly reports on his activity). Then all of a sudden I got the above-mentioned message and also
 noticed that I haven't been receiving reports anylonger. What &nbsp;gives?

            <p>Hello Jen,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you had successfully used Family Safety for several weeks, it is possible that you need to refresh/reconfigure the account for the reports to show up again on your computer. To do this, please follow the steps below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">1. Make sure you're using the latest build of Family Safety. Check the site below for the latest version of Family Safety</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><b><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/essentials-other-programs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0000ff"><font>Family Safety</font></font></a></span></b></p>
<p><span><br />
<font color="#000000">2. Make sure that you update the Family Safety client Filter. Visit the site below for instructions:</font></span></p>
<p><span><font color="#000000">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><b><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/family-safety-filter-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0000ff"><font>Refresh Family Safety Filters</font></font></a></span></b></p>
<p><span><br />
<font color="#000000">The filter might take a few hours to update in some cases so it is advisable that you give it a day and try again and then let us know.</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In case the issue persist, we would like to verify if you're managing one or more child accounts and if it only happens on a single child or all child accounts. In addition, please provide us your operating system for investigation purposes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We'll await for your response.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Bluescreen - Dumping Physical Memory to Disk, System service exception</h2>
                    Hi, I am working on a computer and can't narrow down the problem. <br />
<br />
The computer is an ASUS Desktop CM6850 Series<br />
<br />
According to the user of the computer, it will frequently blue screen and freeze up, with the keywords in the post title. I haven't seen the blue screen myself, so I don't have any more detail yet. I've run chkdsk and found now problems, or at least I don't
 think there were any problems from the logs. I'm also going to run Memtest86 overnight, and see what that does.<br />
<br />
I've run a full system scan with Avast and Malwarebytes. Avast found nothing, Malwarebytes found one little thing and I got rid of it.<br />
<br />
So, I'm going to upload the minidump file of the latest Blue screen, and hopefully someone here can shed some light. From googling, it seems like it's either a driver conflict or faulty RAM, so hopefully after running Memtest86 I'll narrow it down.
<br />
<br />
Also, I tried doing a system restore, but it wouldn't restore, even when I tried a different restore point. It gave this error: 0x80070571<br />
<br />

Hello to fix your problem, I recommend to follow these steps:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;1. Check none plug and play devices in device manger for danger sign by viewing them using view menu then show hidden devices then uninstall the ones with danger sign then restart your PC.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
2. If you have AMD graphic card make sure that the software and driver are all up to date and restore all settings to default using CCC.
<br />
Consider custom uninstalling CCC through Control Panel and leaving only the driver for the graphic card can help to fix the problem.<br />
For AMD If following happens to you then consider running the Fixit tool:<br />
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2665946/en-us<br />
<br />
If you have different graphic card then restore all settings to defaults.<br />
<br />
3. Disable all your start up programs (except your security software) and none-windows services (the ones which are not necessary) through msconfig
<br />
<br />
4. Uninstall any programs that you do not use and uses memory after start up like Vaio Care and Vaio Smart network in Vaio laptops.<br />
<br />
5. Try a different anti virus program if you are currently using Avast. It is a very good anti virus program but it has compatibility issues with windows specially windows 7 64bits. I am currently using Comodo Firewall and antivirus .
<br />
Please note that there is no need to enable HIPS and Defence + feature if you do not install unknown programs.
<br />
Uninstalling Avast could also help to solve your problem.<br />
<br />
6. Go to control panel then click on Ease of Access then click on change how your mouse works then in Make it easier to manage windows section, check both check boxes for activate a window by hovering over it with the mouse and Prevent windows from being automatically
 arranged when moved to the edge of the screen. Then click on Apply then OK!<br />
<br />
7. Also consider disabling Aero peek to preview the desktop through Taskbar properties (right click on taskbar then go to properties)
<br />
<br />
<br />
All above are based on my experience in fixing computer crashes. 90% of the time above steps will solve the computer crash problem.<br />
Hope above helps.<br />

<p>The 0x3B is related to bad graphic card pooling or may be high graphic memory usage&nbsp; ... I had the same problem and managed to fix it by following above steps mentioned earlier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main steps are costume uninstalling CCC (Do not uninstall your Graphic Card driver) only and disabling unwanted start up programs and none windows services. Also remember to restore all your graphic card setting using CCC to default before uninstalling
 the CCC.</p>
<p>Also if you are currently using Avast anti virus consider switching to another anti virus program. It is not a bad anti virus program but I think, it could possibly be the cause of crash too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>also check none plug and play devices in device manger for danger sign by viewing them using view menu then show hidden devices then uninstall the ones with danger sign then restart your PC.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other above steps could also help to avoid further crashes!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope Above helps.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>So as for Avast, I put it on the machine to scan for viruses. It was having the BSOD prior to having Avast installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine run intel HD graphics, no dedicated card, so I'm not sure about graphical memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, this is the second time I have tried running Memtest86+ overnight, and each time apparantly the computer restarts at some point, because the user claims that by morning it is sitting at the windows login screen, where when i left it that night it was
 running memtest.</p>

</p><p>That approach could be fraught with problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can test RAM by rotating existing memory sticks to isolate a problematic stick or by&nbsp;replacing all with&nbsp;known good compatible memory and see if&nbsp; the computer crashes.

<strong>3. </strong>Upload the zip containing the .DMP files to Onedrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply. Preferred sites: Onedrive, Mediafire, Dropbox, etc. Nothing with wait-timers, download managers, etc.<br />
<br />
<strong>4 (optional):</strong> The type of .DMP files located in the Minidump folder are known as Small Memory Dumps. In %systemroot% there will be what is known as a Kernel-Dump (if your system is set to generate). It is labeled MEMORY.DMP. The difference
 between Small Memory Dumps and Kernel-Dumps in the simplest definition is a Kernel-Dump contains
<em><strong>much </strong></em>more information at the time of the crash, therefore allowing further debugging of your issue. If your upload speed permits it, and you aren't going against any strict bandwidth and/or usage caps, etc, the Kernel-Dump is the best
 choice. Do note that Kernel-Dumps are <em><strong>much larger </strong></em>in size due to containing much more info, which is why I mentioned upload speed, etc.<br />

<br />
After doing that, to learn how to share the link to the file if you are unaware, please visit the following link -
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Share files and folders and change permissions</a> and view <strong>'Get a link'</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Please note that any "cleaner" programs such as TuneUpUtilities, CCleaner, etc, by default will delete .DMP files upon use. With this said, if you've run such software, you will need to allow the system to crash once again to generate a crash dump.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log'.
<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.

<h2>            While at my desktop, I have gotten repeated messages about a Delayed Write failure.  Any Ideas what might be happening&#63;</h2>
                    The exact message, as per the System Event Viewer is:<br />
<br />
Application popup: Windows - Delayed Write Failed : Windows was unable to save all the data for the file \Device\HarddiskVolume3\$Mft. The data has been lost. This error may be caused by a failure of your computer hardware or network connection. Please try
 to save this file elsewhere. <br />
<br />
Update (12/31/09):&nbsp; Well, my computer finally froze, and when I rebooted, I got the wonderfully irritating error that the System file was missing.&nbsp; I went ahead and replaced my C: drive, reinstalled Windows, and since then, no error messages...<br />

            Your hard drive may be failing. Back up your data <strong>now</strong> and test the drive.<br />
<br />
Test the hard drive with a diagnostic utility downloaded from the drive mftr.'s website or use Seagate's SeaTools For DOS. You will create a bootable CD with the file you download. You will need third-party burning software to do this such as Roxio, Nero, or
 the free ImgBurn. Burn as an image, not as data.<br />
<br />

<br />
Boot with the CD you made and do a thorough test of the drive. If it fails any physical tests, replace it.<br />
<br />
If you can't do the testing yourself and/or are uncomfortable opening your computer, take the machine to a professional computer repair shop (not your local equivalent of BigComputerStore/GeekSquad).

            I have had the same problem three times and I hate to say it but the only consistent similarity is when I receive Microsoft updates and&nbsp; do not install them.&nbsp; Once I install them fully the problem goes away.

It could be more than that, but, try this first....<br />
Open Windows Mail &gt; Tools &gt; Options &gt; Send &gt; International Settings &gt; Default encoding- click the pointer and select Western European (Windows) &gt; OK &gt; Apply/OK<br />
<br />
See if that does the trick.<br />
