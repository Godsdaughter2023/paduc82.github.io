            I have version 6.0 (build6001:service pack 1. It's windows vista. I have tried all of this but I can't go back any further than 11-30-2012. I want to go back to 11-16-2012. When I put it in maunally it goes to the date that I put the manual in. Like I
 want 11-16-2012 &amp; if I put that in manually today when you hit restore it goes to todays date not the november date.

            We had this problem with Windows Live Mail this morning at the office. Everything was fine and the employee said she must have accidentally clicked on something and suddenly got the working offline popup when Sending/receiving. &nbsp;Clicking on the Work Online
 icon did not resolve, as it still reverted back to Working Offline as soon as we did Send/Receive.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>Our fix was to go into Internet Explorer&gt;&gt;Command Bar&gt;&gt;uncheck Work Offline which all of a sudden had a check mark beside it. All is fine now. But since she had not been in IE we wouldn't have thought to look here.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope this helps someone.</div>

<h2>            How To Undo &#34;ESD-USB&#34; And Recover Files&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I downloaded Media Creation Tool and then selected my hard drive when it asked me to select a device, not knowing it would delete everything on the hard drive. Then after finishing the process it deleted all my files in the hard drive, it's name became from
 Untitled to ESD-USB and now it's only 31 GB. I tried formatting it, only to delete the files that came after becoming ESD-USB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help! I lost SOOOOOOO many files!</p>

            <p>Hi everyone. Fortunately I went to a repair store called "Lost Data" to solve this problem. I got all the files restored and sorted like they originally were before formatting, the ESD-USB is no longer there. It seems like there is no program on the Internet
 to solve this problem, so in case you had this issue too, you might need to go to a computer expert specialized in recovering lost files (doesn't necessarily have to be Lost Data).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you are able to solve it in case you had the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards, GSUser43.</p>

<h2>            wireless keyboard stopped working when I changed batteries</h2>
                    my microsoft keyboard elite 1002 said it was low on battery power.&nbsp; I changed the batteries.&nbsp; The keyboard was not working so I looked for it on bluetooth, didn't find it, and re-added it.&nbsp; I let it pick the passkey.&nbsp; I typed it into the wireless keyboard
 and hit enter on the wireless keyboard.&nbsp; The device now shows as being there.&nbsp; But it does not work.&nbsp; I tried doing these steps (removing and re-adding the keyboard) 3 times.&nbsp; What could be wrong?&nbsp; The battery power shows as "good" when I checked in the properties
 of the keyboard.

<h2>            Windows 10 - Touchscreen driver disappears on reboot on my ASUS Q301L</h2>
                    <p>Alright, after getting the driver updated(Apparently last update was in 2006? Really, Windows+ASUS? Or perhaps Windows 10 can't find any new updates since I can't find the touchscreen driver download on the ASUS support page? Hmm.), rebooting many times,
 using the many different Windows 'troubleshooters'(More like can find an issue, but can't fix it and won't point you in the direction it's located in so you can't fix it yourself), flat out updating it again(Huh, still didn't work.), unchecking literally every
 box of that says to turn off this device to conserve battery, and many other 'fixes,' the touchscreen on my ASUS Q301L refuses to work until an hour or more after bootup or after sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, here's the story, since you'll need as many details as possible. Four days ago, everything worked fine, no issues or anything. Monday morning? Booted it up, and suddenly it didn't work. I kinda panicked- you know, I need to use this laptop for important
 things and not gaming(I have another one with a few small games and it isn't touchscreen) and yet it's forcing me to use the unreliable touchpad. After three hours, I had finally noticed that the driver just appeared flat out of nowhere and suddenly it worked
 again. I figured everything was perfectly fine. Shut it off, went to go do stuff, got home around seven.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Booted it up to write an essay. Oh, my, look. I can't tap my microsoft word button. Panic, tapping the screen- it's gone, again. Back to trying the same old fixes. I dug into these forums for a long, and I mean a long time. Two hours, give or take. Windows
 staff suggesting using the troubleshooters they link on a Windows 10 issue- oh, wait, the troubleshooters they linked claim it only works for Windows 7. I try it anyways, it detects an issue and gives me no details about it expect that it 'wasn't fixed.' Wow,
 mmkay, what's the issue than, friend? Yeah, so that didn't work. Try again, for another hour, and once again leave to go take a breather. Walk back about ten minutes later with a dog in hand, oh look, the driver mysterious reappeared out of thin air.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Okay, good. I finally go to bed after wasting so much time on this. I once again, foolishly, turn off my computer to conserve battery and to make sure it doesn't overheat. It's tuesday. I boot it up, again. Doesn't work, these drivers had mysteriously done
 their disappearance act once again:<br />
HID-compliant touch screen</p>
<p>HID-compliant vendor-defined device</p>
<p>USD Input Device</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me tell you, their acts were not amusing. Gave up, chose to try again tomorrow. It's Wednesday now. Barely managed to finish the essay in time because of having to use the touchpad. Did a little bit of research. So, found this in the touch screen driver's
 log(had to wait the lovely two hours for the driver to appear again):<br />
</p>
<p>"Device HID\VID_0457&amp;PID_1026&amp;Col01\7&amp;1f07bb34&amp;0&amp;0000 was migrated.<br />

<strong>Present: false</strong>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally, I wouldn't understand this, since I don't speak computer. But, something was off. Hmmmm.
<strong>Present is set to 'false'? When all the working drivers were set to 'true' and still are?</strong> This is a pretty tricky move. I've waited another two hours, and it's Wensday, just got the drivers back from their disappearance act. I'm scared to turn
 the computer off, but I'll have to soon enough. Isn't that kinda sad? Having to be scared to turn a computer off because there is a major lack of productivity without the touchscreen? Anyhow, I'm going to have to go home soon, and I really don't want to wait
 for the drivers than rush my work. It's a bit painful and unnecessary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, yes, I need answers. You just don't make someone struggle for three days for no clear reason. I mean, come on. Computers just don't break overnight... unless Windows forces an update and breaks them. Hmm. Possible culprit. Anyone know if there was a
 Windows 10 update on Sunday, the 12th of December? Would really help. It's not like Windows tells you anything, anyways. If anyone has any more possible fixes or anyplace where I can download the drive that is an actual trusted site of Windows or ASUS(I've
 already got enough on my hands trying to fix this mess, I don't need this computer's first virus.) so I can try the reinstallation fix, I'd love to hear about it.<br />
</p>
<p>So, if anyone else is experiencing this, please add more details so that hopefully someone knows how to fix this(Don't just say 'oh mine's not working to anyone got a fix??' because that does not get anyone anywhere.) and actually tells us people who do
 need the fix because it's kinda important.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading through this so far. Good luck to those techsavvy people..!.. I feel like you're gonna need it. Sorry if I'm being a bit passive aggressive here, but honestly, I'm just wowed here. I mean no disrespect, but this annoys me a ton.</p>

<h2>            windows 10 page size changing</h2>
                    Hi. My pages keep changing sizes. I am frequently changing the page magnification to default size. It varies from -75% to 175%. Have gone into settings to try to correct this but it still keeps on doing it. Slowly driving &nbsp;me mad. Anyone have any clues
 out there? I find it hard to imagine I am the only one with this problem. Thanks for reading this. Tom.

    <title>E-mails disappearing from Windows 10 Mail Inbox&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> grandpa jim  say:</h3>
<h2>            E-mails disappearing from Windows 10 Mail Inbox&#33;</h2>
                    <p>My wife's Windows 10 Mail program is causing her great distress. Mail that she has no intention of deleting is just disappearing from her Inbox. Is there some "setting" that is causing this? How can it be prevented? This is a serious problem. Please help!</p>
<p>Also, we do not understand anything about the "sync" settings! Are they possibly related to this issue?</p>

            <p>I managed to go to the Store and verify that there are no updates. The rest of your advice scares me.</p>
<p>Is it possible that the mail has not been deleted but is simply hidden? If so, how to "unhide" it?</p>

            <p>Hello Jim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for getting back to us with an update.</p>
<p>
</p><blockquote>

<ul>
<li>But converting Microsoft account to Local account won't sort out Syncing issue. However, if you still wish to convert your account to Local, then
<strong>Start /&gt; </strong><strong>Settings/&gt;Accounts/&gt;Your Account </strong>and click
<strong>Sign in with local account Instead</strong>. Enter Microsoft account credentials, when it prompts.&nbsp;Follow the steps to switch your account to local account. Sign-out&nbsp;from the profile and Sing-in back into it</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>What does this mean: "Are you able to see those disappeared emails, when you login to the account using Web browser?"</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Say for example, you have outlook account *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. You have configured the same account with Windows Mail app and noticed the emails getting disappeared. Now my question is, when you login to the same account
 using web browser, will you able to see those emails? If yes, then problem might be with the Syncing. Following
<strong>Method 2</strong> troubleshooting steps from my previous response, might sort out this issue.

            <p>Let's say that the synching issue is not worth the aggravation to me. I would like my e-mail reader to function exactly as it did under Windows 7 with Windows Live Mail. If changing the account to local will not do that, then what about disabling the synch
 function--or configuring the server as POP rather than IMAP?</p>

            <p>Hello Jim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, Mail app requires Microsoft account for accessing it. I mean, most of the app on Windows 10 requires Microsoft account for accessing them, where they same not possible with Local account. POP is the technology that allows email to be downloaded from
 the server to your PC. However, Mail app which comes with <span>
Windows</span>, doesn't support adding email accounts that use POP (Post Office Protocol).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I suggest you to try executing the <strong>method 2 </strong>troubleshooting steps to see if it fix the issue. If you're concerned about those troubleshooting steps, then try uninstalling and reinstalling the

<p>Here is what we found. Mail has been downloaded to a Windows 10 computer, but it remains on the server. It is then accessed from a Windows 7 (POP3) computer. It is downloaded to that computer--but this time it is deleted from the server. Now because of the
 "sync" function, items that are deleted from the server are also deleted from the linked computers. We saw mail literally disappearing from the Windows Mail Inbox.</p>
<p>Are you perhaps still accessing the mail server from another computer that is functioning the old way?</p>
<p>The "local account" is an option with Windows 10 that allows you to log on and work without using a Microsoft account. Some Windows functions, such as access to the Store, will not be available.</p>

            <p>This is the first understandable explanation of what is causing our emails to disappear sometimes before your eyes - because of syncing.
</p>
<p>My own system is Base computer Vista, Laptop Windows 7 &amp; Tablet Windows 10.</p>
<p>Rather than limit some windows 10 functions could the base (pop3) computer be un-synced? The problem I can foresee is how to instruct the W10 mail program to leave the messages on the server. We could do this 'THE OLD WAY'&nbsp; but does that facility exist in
 W10?</p>

The Windows 10 Mail system <em>does </em>leave the messages on the server. It's the Windows 7 POP3 setup on your laptop that is removing them when it accesses the server. You say you could prevent this "the old way." I'm not sure what you mean by that. However,
 if you are using Windows Live Mail on your Windows 7 pc, go back through the account setup process and on one of those tab pages you will see an option to leave a copy of mail on the server--with a box unchecked by default. Checking that box might prevent
 the disappearance of your mails from your other computers.

            <p>Does that mean W10 Mail does NOT store emails? It merely reads them directly from the I.S.P</p>
<p>If that is the case, W10 Mail, needs to be used in a different way. Very interesting. W10 has created&nbsp;a learning curve&nbsp;which seems endless.</p>

    <title>Photo Print Quality Poor between Windows XP versus Windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bob_784  say:</h3>
<h2>            Photo Print Quality Poor between Windows XP versus Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I have an old Compaq desktop computer with Windows XP and an HP 6200 Series All In One printer. I view high quality photos from the Windows Picture and Fax Viewer on that system. I print high quality photo prints on&nbsp;8-1/2 X 11 photo paper from that viewer.
 It allows me to choose type of paper, quality of print, etc.</p>
<p>I just purchased an HP Pavilion lap top with Windows 7. When I print the exact same photos from&nbsp;the image viewer in Windows 7. I have limited choices for picture quality adjustments. All I get is a 600 x 600 dpi choice. The same photos are being printed
 on the exact same 6200 Series HP printer but the quality is bad. It is grainy and you can see horizontal lines&nbsp;throughout the photo.</p>
<p>I take the picture and transfer it to my desk top via a flash drive, unplug the printer from my lap top and then plug it in to&nbsp;my old Compaq desk&nbsp;top computer with Windows XP and the print quality is excellent</p>
<p>Why is there a difference in the PHOTO print quality between my NEW HP lap top with Windows 7 and my old Compaq desk top with Windows XP?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here's the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Details.aspx?type=Hardware&amp;p=HP%20Officejet%206200%20All-in-One%20Printer&amp;v=HP&amp;uid=Q5804A&amp;l=en-US&amp;pf=2&amp;pi=1&amp;c=Printers%20%26%20Scanners&amp;sc=Multifunction&amp;os=64-bit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows 7 Compatibility Center web page for the HP Officejet 6200 All-in-One Printer</a>&nbsp;which states the manufacturers states it needs a download to make things work properly.&nbsp; Sadly - that just takes you to a place where they point out they (HP) included
 drivers in the Windows 7 default that 'work' - but essentially - that's all they do.&nbsp; They even have a place for you to "Upgrade to a Windows 7-compatible printer".</p>
<p>If it is unclear - I am saying that your printer is considered a legacy product by the manufacturer.&nbsp; While it may 'work' in Windows 7 - the special drivers that probably make the printout look better on the older Windows XP box will NOT be put out for Windows
 7.&nbsp; HP decided that printer was not worth supporting any longer.</p>

            Hi Vitus
<br />
<br />Windows 10 1803 and since been succeeded by Windows 10 1809. I would try manually upgrading to that release instead.
<br />
<br />First, try upgrading using the Windows Update Assistant:
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-downlo...</a>
<br />
<br />If that does not work, upgrade offline using the ISO file, it is more reliable.
<br />
<br />Please be advised some users are reporting issues with the Windows 10 1809 update. Make sure you backup before attempting to upgrade:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-win_upgrade/how-to-create-a-system-image-in-windows-10/84fa6683-e3ac-4e93-9139-368af9267869">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />
<br /> Have you checked the manufacturers website to determine compatibility?
<br />Check this List to Determine if Your Computer is Compatible with the Windows 10 1809
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/check-this-list-to-determine-if-your-computer-is/5152bb37-f95d-48a6-b7b2-ad0d5c738923">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />	perform the following tasks:
<br />	12 Things You Should Do Before Installing Windows 10 
<br />	<a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/prepare-computer-windows-10-creators-update-version-1703/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/prepare-comput...</a>
<br />
<br />Download the Media Creation Tool Now
<br /><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691209</a>
<br />
<br />Right click the MediaCreationTool.exe file then click Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement:
<br />
<br />Select the option Create installation media for another PC if you want to download a ISO image or create a bootable DVD or USB thumb drive,
<br />
<br />Click Next
<br />
<br />If you want to download a particular edition or both architectures, uncheck the Use the recommended option for this PC. 
<br />
<br />Click in the Edition list box, choose your edition then click Next.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 - contains Windows 10 Home and Windows 10 Pro.
<br />Windows 10 Home Single Language - only select this edition if you are running Windows 10 Single Language, Windows 8 Single Language or Windows 8.1 with Bing.
<br />Windows 10 N - only select this edition if you reside in Europe, it does not contain Windows Media Player. It contains Windows 10 Home N, Windows 10 Pro N.
<br />Please read the following: Fix Windows 10 Media Creation Tool from Defaulting to Home Instead of Pro
<br />
<br />Downloading the ISO file
<br />
<br />An ISO file is a digital or virtual replica of a physical disc. In order to use an ISO you must burn it to a optical disc. In the case of Windows 10, a blank Dual Layer DVD or an empty USB thumb drive. If you are using Windows 7, you can create the .ISO then burn it using the built in Disc Image utility. If you are running Windows XP or Windows Vista, you can using a third party burning tool such as ImgBurn or Roxio/Nero. 
<br />
<br />Creating a .ISO file
<br />
<br />For the purposes of this exercise, we are gonna use the .ISO option. 
<br />
<br />Select ISO file, then click Save, Select your location then click Save. 
<br />
<br />Wait while the .ISO image is created. 
<br />
<br />Performing the upgrade:
<br />
<br />Once you have the Windows 10 Spring Creators Update ISO, you can double click it to mount it then start the upgrade. If you are installing from a DVD or USB thumb drive, insert or connect it, then click the on screen notification.  If setup does not start automatically, click Start &gt; File Explorer &gt; This PC &gt; open the drive containing the Windows 10 setup files, then double click Setup.exe.
<br />
<br />Click Run setup.exe
<br />
<br />Wait while setup is initialized.
<br />
<br />You can select download and install any important updates before upgrading. This is recommended since it can help to ensure a smooth upgrade. If you are not connected to the Internet, select the Not right now radio box instead. Click Next.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup checks your system for compatibility issues.
<br />
<br />Accept the End User License Agreement.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 setup does one final check to ensure your system is ready.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will check if you have enough disk space. If you don't, review the following article for instructions how to upgrade to Windows 10 Spring Creators Update on a system with limited space:
<br />
<br />How to Upgrade to Windows 10 Spring Creators Update on a Drive with Limited Space

<br />
<br />Please note, you have the option of choosing what you would like to keep, which includes personal files, apps and settings.
<br />
<br />This will be your screen for a little while. During the installation, your computer will restart several times.
<br />
<br />After the first restart, Windows 10 setup will resume. You will notice the setup experience has once again been refined from the previous animated circle. This will be your screen for a while. When complete, Windows 10 setup will restart automatically.
<br />
<br />
<br />Sign into your account.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 completes application updates and post setup tasks.
<br />
<br />Thats it, the Windows 10 1809 is installed.You can check Windows Update for latest updates, click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates.
<br />
<br />How to prepare your computer before upgrading?
<br />
<br />Although updating to Windows 10 version 1809 is a relatively simple process, similar to a repair upgrade; users should perform some basic pre-requisites before initiating the upgrade.
<br />
<br />If you are finding it difficult to carry out some of the steps described below, please review detailed instructions how to perform them:

            Hi vitus, version 1809 has been released, you should go straight to that version to bring your system up to date and make all previous updates obsolete . . .
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Temporarily disable any 3rd party Anti-virus you may have installed
<br />
<br />Then, double click the ISO and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

<h2>            Issues with Epson L555 scanner after windows 10 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Hi fellow windows 10 upgraders!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder if anyone can help me with this issue:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently received the windows 10 upgrade, which was a bit 'glitchy' after upgrading from windows 7, but I got there! The problem I have is that my Epson L555 scanner which I use a lot (or did!) does not launch now with windows 10. I have contacted Epson
 support and they gave me new software to download, but it still made no difference....can anyone help me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, the printer still works fine, no problems, it is just the scanner that won't launch.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply, and I'm pleased this fix worked for you, however it didn't work for me. The download link you provided didn't update the scanner drivers or software, only the printer, which still works fine anyway, and wasn't affected by the windows
 10 upgrade.</p>

<h2>            Why doesn&#39;t Windows 7 come with a default mail client installed&#63;</h2>
                    <div>original title:&nbsp;No Email In Windows 7?! What a rip.&nbsp;</div>
I just purchased an HP mini PC with Windows 7. Could you believe Windows 7 doesn't come with email?! (ie email client) What is the point of making a operating system that doesn't have email? Windows want you to create a new email address using&nbsp;Microsoft Live
 account and check your email online. What ____. I want to use a Windows based email&nbsp;client; as it is more powerful, more productive, and much easier to use. Windows already has a monopoly on everything, now they&nbsp;want to&nbsp;have a monopoly on my email as well.
 I'm not creating a new or changing my email address.<br />
<br />
I wish I knew this before I spent $350 for it. Now I have to waste my time to return it.<br />
<br />
I will be returning this to Wal-Mart tomorrow. I will also be blogging my problem everywhere to inform/warn any possible Windows 7 prospects that Windows doesn't come with email.
<br />
<br />
I will most definitely be contacted Wal-Mart and HP about my frustration.<br />
<br />
If this is something we have to look forward to with Windows 7, then I plan on seeing a lot more McIntosh.

    <title>Bitlocker Recovery&#58; How do you &#34;Unlock&#34; a W10 Mobile - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jaredwaters  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bitlocker Recovery&#58; How do you &#34;Unlock&#34; a W10 Mobile Phone&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Just yesterday I purchased the new ALCATEL IDOL 4S, (A solid upgrade over my L640). I was a Windows "release" ring insider on my last phone. So I decided to keep it going on this new phone.&nbsp; I also decided to use the "ENCRYPT" option in the settings. Unfortunately,
 this appears to be my undoing.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>My first insider build downloaded this morning, so I restarted the device as instruction, to which it immediately locked up.</p>
<p>As you can see below.&nbsp; I have the recovery key, unfortunately, the phone doesn't give me any options to input it.</p>
<p>It appears to not be designed for Mobile as it refers to ESC and Enter keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there anyway to unlock it through my Microsoft Account?&nbsp; Anyone have any ideas how to enter this key.&nbsp; Otherwise I'll be forced to use the "device Recovery tool."&nbsp; I don't even understand the directions.&nbsp; The recovery key is something you can get online,
 what format is it expecting the key to be in? Why not give me an option to enter the key?&nbsp; The only other thing I can think of is if I had the "display Dock" I could plug it in and probably use a keyboard through Continuum. But maybe not.&nbsp; Thoughts?</p>

            <p>I have the same issue as &nbsp;amproduced essentially the same way with the same phone : turn on device encryption, a couple hours later restart for an update with it coming back with the same bitlocker recovery screen &nbsp;as about. Disabled reset protection but
 there is no way to use the provided recovery code. After that I attempted to use the device recovery tool but it seems that it has not been updated to support this device&nbsp;</p>

            I ended up returning the phone and getting another one. But I don't have either encryption enabled, and for now will not be participating in the insider program. I was on the most stable- "Release ring" anyway and this still happened.

    <title>No internet connection unless I renew the IP address. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alessandrotasselli  say:</h3>
<h2>            No internet connection unless I renew the IP address.</h2>
                    <p>About two weeks ago, my windows 10 computer started experiencing some connectivity issues. Though my wifi was displayed as connected and secured, I lost connection to the (weak) Internet after 3 minutes and to reconnect I had to restart my computer (just
 for another 3 minutes of Internet). I tried an ethernet cable but the results where pretty much the same (very slow speeds and disconnecting after around 10 minutes). Other devices that where connected to the wifi had a stable Internet connection. I changed
 my router to see if that was the cause and it wasn't. I even called my provider three times and they could not see anything wrong. Only recently, I discovered that if I renewed the IP address, I was able to get 3-9 minutes of good Internet connection before
 having to renew it again. </p>
<p>The windows troubleshooter did not detect anything and I have already tried reinstalling the drivers, hardware, changing the IP to automatic in the IPv4 properties. I know this has to do with windows 10 as I have tried Ubuntu Linux and the Internet connection
 is strong and consistent. I have looked everywhere and cannot find anything. It would be very helpful if this issue is solved because I need the Internet for work.</p>

            This may not solve your problem but, by a lot of trial and error, this seems to work for me.&nbsp; First, I have to keep my Acer plugged in whenever I'm using it and try to keep it fully charged.&nbsp; I disconnect the tablet from the dock when I boot up and then
 dock.&nbsp; The connection isn't immediate but give it several seconds.&nbsp; Despite its lack of technical rationale, this usually works for me.&nbsp; Good luck!

            I bought mine new from Best Buy, and after about one year, I started having the same issue. The keyboard works for a few seconds, and then stops. Also, when the keyboard is attached, after a couple of minutes, the device will shut down. Without the keyboard,
 it works just fine. I have tried all of the above mentioned steps. I think it is a hardware issue. Personally, I think Acer should do a recall and replace them. Obviously it is not an isolated problem.

<p>Hey I also had the same problem with my Acer One 10. I've tried many options, one of them was connecting an external usb keyboard using an OTG(on the go) adapter to the micro usb&nbsp;port in left side of the tablet&nbsp;and this worked for me greatly. Not only i
 was able to use the external keyboard(obviously!!) also the entire keyboard dock began to work flawlessly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think what actually happened is the keyboard driver from the external keyboard was installed thereby supporting the internal keyboard also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also even&nbsp;after the external keyboard was removed the internal keyboard worked for many more restarts. But once again after i removed the tablet from the dock it stopped working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In case you were wondering how i get this idea, I frequently had problem of restarting with an error "DRIVER POWER STATE FAILURE".</p>

            Hello Dharmesh,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for replying with the status of the issue.</div>
<div>Sorry to know that you are still facing inconvenience with touchscreen on your computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>There might be chances that the touch screen drivers are not compatible with Windows 8.1. Follow these methods and check if it helps:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1: </strong>Run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter refer to section “Run the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter” from this link:</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/what-device-isnt-installed-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows-8/what-device-isnt-installed-properly</span></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2: </strong>I would suggest you to check for drivers using Windows Update.</div>
<div>You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;<br />
1.Open Device Manager by pressing Windows key + X, clickingControl Panel, clicking System and Maintenance, and then clicking Device Manager.‌ If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.<br />
2.In Device Manager, locate the device you want to update, and then double-click the device name.<br />
3.Click the Driver tab, and then click Update Driver and follow the instructions.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Refer this article: Download and install drivers</strong></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If Windows Update can't find a driver for your device, contact the device manufacturer's website, or insert the disc that came with the device, and then follow the instructions for installing the software.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 3: </strong>Try installing the drivers in compatibility mode and check.</div>

<h2>            Not able to log on to new user account or guest account &#34; log on has failed&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Original Title:&nbsp;Deleting files from User folder which is located in USERS folder on C drive</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have bought a new laptop with windows 7 installed and then restored my data from external disc choosing the option 'restore to original location'. After the restoring process I got a message that the data might not have been stores in original lacation
 but in User folder which I found in the Users folder on drive C. So &nbsp;just moved all the folders and files to the original folders i.e. desktop, pistures, music etc. in my current user account. Then I wanted to 'clean' whatever left from the restoring process
 inside the User folder - it was actually showing empty folders and I later found out that I deleted all files and folders from the User folder (except the AppData folder - but somthing in this folder might have been deleted also).&nbsp;
</p>
<div>My current user account works find but if I create a new accout or turn the guest account on it would not log on to thouse accounts and gives me an error message thet the log on has failed.</div>
<div>Could you please help me to reinstall the missing files in User folder?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you</div>

            Hello,
<div>thanks for your reply. The message I'm getting goes: The user profile Service services failed the logon. User profile cannot be loaded.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The user accounts I have in 'c:user' &nbsp;are: &nbsp;Guest, Public, Tinkovci and User. My account Tinkovci is working fine. I moved my backed-up filed from 'User' to Tinkovci. All the data is stored in Tinkovci so I haven't lost any of them. Besides I still have
 the back up files available.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I guess all that's needed is reinstalling User folder???</div>

            Hi and thank you for your reply.
<div>I've tried the steps described in the link you provided but what is happening is this:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. When I creat a new account I can't actually see the new user profile folder in C:Users.</div>
<div>but I can see the new user name on windows log on page. All I hav in the Users folder is Guest, Public. Tinkovci (my current user account) and User.</div>
<div>This wouldn't change even after rebooting the laptop.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. Then I didn't know whether I could copy files from any of the existing folders (i.e. Guest, Public, Tinkovci - as I couldn't see the new user folder) but when I was looking into these folders I couldn't find one of the files that are mentioned in the
 link you provided. The file's name is Ntuser.ini. After unchecking the box in folder view options named &nbsp;''Hide protected operating system files'' I was able to see the other two files which are mentioned in the link (i.e. Ntuser.dat and Ntuser.dat.log1,2)
 but not in all user folders. Could that be the problem why I can't create a new user account (profile)</div>
<div><br />

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>just come back from holiday so back to this problem as well...</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've followed your steps but I cannot see the newly created account.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I can see it on the start up windows page (along with my current account Tinkovci) but I can't logon into it. I get this message:&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span><span>The user profile Service
 services failed the logon. User profile cannot be loaded.</span></div>
<div><br />
<div>I compared data on my external hard drive ( data I used for restore) and found that there was an account on that hard drive named ''user''. So it seems that during the restoring process the laptop created a new ''account'' - ''user'' and stored all my
 account named ''user'')</div>
<div>I might have moved also some system files from the ''user'' account to the'' Tinkovci'' account as I simply selected all files in several folders for moving (by pressing Ctrl+A).&nbsp;</div>
<div>Could all of this have messed up the accounts and would you suggest deleting the account folder named ''user'' completely? If so is there anything else that would need to be deleted from the system as well along with the ''user'' folder?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Hope all of this makes some sense to you.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you</div>

<h2>            New icon named &#34;desktop&#34; suddenly appeared on my desktop after 13 Aug update</h2>
                    <p>Today (13 Aug 2014) right after today's monthly automatic update, a new icon called simply "desktop" appeared on my desktop. This was not a link to something else but an actual text file, which I'm therefore reluctant to delete out of hand. The content of
 the file was/is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>[.ShellClassInfo]<br />
LocalizedResourceName=@%SystemRoot%\system32\shell32.dll,-21769<br />
IconResource=%SystemRoot%\system32\imageres.dll,-183<br />

<p>
</p><p>What is this, why do I have it cluttering up my desktop? What happens if I just delete the thing?</p>

            <div>Desktop.ini is one of those files that stores information for software. I </div>
<div>believe the contents of this file make it to where, if the desktop folder </div>
<div>were to show up in an Explorer Window, it would have the desktop icon. (I </div>
<div>don't mean a shortcut, I mean the Windows 7 icon that represents the </div>
<div>desktop.)</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This file, marked as both "hidden" and "system", is seen in several folders </div>
<div>and is used to store folder settings, like the one I described above. It was </div>
<div>designed to be used with Windows Explorer, so you probably would not see </div>
<div>them as often as some other technical users.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Your desktop is run by Windows Explorer. It appears that Windows Explorer's </div>
<div>settings and the settings of your aforementioned file management app are </div>
<div>independent, which why you probably were confused about the .ini part.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I guess that an update probably performed some sort of maintenance that </div>
<div>noticed that something was a little bit off (in this case, the "missing" </div>
<div>desktop.ini file) and thought that it was doing the right thing by putting </div>
<div>it there, as I have seen these desktop.ini files seemingly randomly reappear </div>
<div>on occasion (at least at times when I had hidden+system files showing). </div>
<div>However, like I said above, I too wonder how it suddenly got there. </div>

<p>There is no file tab in Folder options.You would find it under view tab as files and folders.</p>
<p><strong>Change file associations</strong></p>
<p>1. In the Search programs and files type folder options and click the "Folder Options" link that appears.<br />
<br />
2. In the "Folder Options" dialog box , select "View" tab.<br />
<br />
3. Uncheck "Hide extensions for known file types".<br />
<br />
4. Click "OK"</p>
<p>Now you would be able to see the file extension along with it's name which can be easily changed</p>
