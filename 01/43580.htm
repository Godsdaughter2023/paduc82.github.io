<h2>            Xbox one controller keeps shutting off after i plug in the mic&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I just recently got the xbox one i havent even had it for a week yet. Yesterday i was playing&nbsp;and everything was fine then my remote just randomly shut off. I changed the&nbsp;batteries made sure they were in the right way then once i took my headset out of my
 controller it worked. Is there anyway to fix this problem? or do i need a new mic or new controller?</p>

<p>More than likely, the batteries are not strong enough.</p>
<p>Try using batteries designed for these types of devices like digital cameras. &nbsp;

<p>Let me ask, have you made sure that the controller is Updated? There was a time a few months ago when this was happening quite frequently, and the worst part was, if the controller shut off, when you turned it back on, the game and system essentially completely
 froze. Controller updates and system updates were released to address the issue.</p>
<p>Full instructions on updating your controller can be found here:</p>

<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<p>I will share with you my two cents after having this same issue on my BRAND NEW XB1 Sunset bundle controller.
</p>
<p>Controller turns off instantly after plugging in either the headset adapter OR chat headset. Controller firmware is up to date, performed hard reset, tested with friends controllers and headsets ect.</p>
<p>Bottom line is, this is either an outstanding firmware issue that they have yet to resolve or their is an issue in their manufacturing processes that causes defective controllers to shut off when any chat adapter is plugged in.</p>

<p>So I've had this problem come up and I haven't really seen any permanent solutions, although i am able to turn my controller on and everything works when kind of force the stereo headset adapter hard into the controller.</p>
<p>I think the problem is an electrical one that's cause from a bad fit between the controller and the headset stereo adapter. Mine has never really fit too snug, and why does the headset stereo adapter have to be so bulky? It doesn't feel like there's much
 in it.</p>

    <title>Touch screen not working since upgrading to Windows 10. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Touch screen not working since upgrading to Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Touch Screen Problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since updating my DELL Inspiron 15R from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 the Touch Screen has stopped working. &nbsp;Selecting 'Device Manager&gt;Human Interface Devices' reveals that the 5 icons (which can only be seen by using 'View&gt;Show hidden devices) for 'HID-compliant
 ....' are greyed out - <em>device, touch screen, defined device </em>(x3) as well as the icon for
<em>USB Input Device.</em>&nbsp;Right clicking on all 6 icons and selecting 'Properties&gt;General' shows
<em>Currently, this hardware is not connected to the computer (Code 45).</em> &nbsp;When I select 'Properties&gt;Events' all 6 reveal the same message -&nbsp;<em>Device not migrated. &nbsp;</em>The timestamp corresponds to when I updated to Windows 10. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please tell me how I fix this problem? &nbsp;'Update Driver Software' reveals that all have the latest up-to-date drivers. &nbsp;I cannot 'Roll Back Driver' as this option is greyed out. &nbsp;'Scan for hardware changes' doesn't do anything. &nbsp;This leaves me
 with 'Uninstall' as the only option. &nbsp;Should I use this or will this create a bigger headache than I already have?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help.</p>
<p>

            <p><span>Hello Steve,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We regret the inconvenience caused and will assist you in resolving the issue.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong>Error code 45</strong> occurs when the hardware device is no longer connected to the computer. To resolve error code 45, reconnect the hardware device to the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Since Touch screen drivers are pre-installed on the computer, you can try uninstalling and re-installing the drivers on the computer and check if the issue is resolved. To do so, follow the steps
 below:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>
Windows logo + X</strong> keys on the keyboard and select <strong>Device manager</strong> from the context menu.</span></li><li><span>Locate and expand
<strong>Human Interface Devices</strong> from the window, right click and select <strong>
Uninstall</strong> from the context menu.</span></li><li><span>Wait for the drivers to get uninstalled,
<strong>reboot</strong> the computer to install the drivers and check if the changes are effective.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persist, I suggest you to contact the hardware manufacturer for further assistance on the query.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Write to us with the status of the issue on the same post for further assistance. Your reply is most important for us to ensure we assist you accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>Likhitha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did what you suggested. &nbsp;After the reboot the situation was worse, the drivers did not magically re-install. &nbsp;In fact, the 6 icons mentioned in my first post disappeared altogether! &nbsp;Not surprising, I did uninstall them after all. They were not even under
 'Show hidden devices'. &nbsp;Now the cynic in me told me that this was what would happen and the drivers would not somehow just migrate after uninstalling them. &nbsp;So I set a system restore point before I followed your advice. &nbsp;I have now restored my laptop but the
 problem remains exactly as it was before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your reply said to contact the hardware manufacturer, in this case DELL, if it persists. &nbsp;I will give this a try. &nbsp;In the meantime if you can think of anything else that might work then please let me know.</p>

            I'm having the same problem on my Dell. &nbsp;There was an update on windows 10 around Christmas that took this driver out. &nbsp;Since then, I've had zero support from Microsoft or Dell. &nbsp;There has to be someone who has this driver software somewhere. &nbsp;I reset
 my computer back to its factory settings, (which means windows 7), but no luck. &nbsp;If anyone has an answer please let me know. &nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>If I get anything back from DELL I will let you know. &nbsp;I can't really understand why MS would put out an update that removes the Touch Screen Driver though. &nbsp;It doesn't follow their design philosophy for Windows 10. &nbsp;MS clearly believes that we should all
 be using tablets, not laptops or desktops. &nbsp;The proof of this is that Windows 10 doesn't support a CD-ROM/DVD drive and I had to get 3rd party software to let me keep using my disk drive after upgrading. If we follow the logic then surely MS wants our touch
 screens to work and should (he said with trepidation) not be throwing spanners into the works. &nbsp;The replies I have from MS clearly state that it is a DELL problem, as DELL supplied the drivers when they configured and shipped me the laptop. &nbsp;I believe the
 whole problem here is the bit about <em>Device not migrated </em>that I put in my first post. &nbsp;The
<em>Error code 45 </em>is a result of that, not the cause of it. &nbsp;This would explain why checking with DELL for the latest drivers tells me I already have them installed but running the DELL diagnostics tells me they are "not installed or not working properly".
 &nbsp;The 2 requests are looking at my laptop from opposite ends of the tunnel. &nbsp;So the results are different. &nbsp;But somewhere in that tunnel is the migration error that is the root cause of the problem. &nbsp;Still, thanks for letting me know I am not alone with this
 problem. &nbsp;At least it reassures me that I am not being silly and have just flicked the wrong switch somewhere.</p>

<li><span>Yes I did try updating the touchscreen drivers (that is when they were still visible through Device Manager) without success.&nbsp; Every time I tried I received the message that the drivers were
 “up to date”.</span></li><li><span>This problem has only occurred since I installed Windows 10.&nbsp; It was not happening when I was using Windows 8.1.</span></li></ol>

    <title>I can not get Windows 7 to open in a Maximised screen&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> varekai  say:</h3>
<h2>            I can not get Windows 7 to open in a Maximised screen&#33; </h2>
                    
<p>Every Time I open a link or window it is in the minimized (small window)&nbsp;position. I have tried everything by dragging the corners and Windows 7 doesn't remember and opens in a minimized window. I can drag to the top and it will maximize and double click
 the top of a web page and it will maximize. My problem is always having to deal with a minimised window when opening from the desktop or links. Is there a setting or a way to correct it?</p>
<p>What worked before was opening&nbsp;the original&nbsp;window and stretching it from the corners and then opening a link inside it and stretching it and all was fine. That doesn't work anymore. Thanks for any info and help!</p>

<p>For IE, three options.</p>
<p>1: Grab the corners of the window and drag it to full screen size. Do not use Maximize. Close all other windows first via the Taskbar and this one last. Windows will remember the size used of the last window closed the next time you open the program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>2: Whichever shortcut you are using to launch the window, right click it and select properties. Under the 'Run' drop-down, choose "Maximized".</p>
<p>3: <strong>IE New Window Maximizer<br />

<p>#2 should work for Desktop shortcuts.</p>
<p>There is a known bug with Win7 remembering a window size, so there are a couple of other programs that should help.</p>

<p>Thank you once again Bruce! You have helped me in the past and you did tonight with one of the links you provided. I had to try it a few times to get it to work but when it did it stayed that way permanently! I even restarted the computer&nbsp;to see if if remembered
 and it did! Thanks again as this has been a very frustrating experience not being able to control the window sizes! Varekai</p>

<em>Phishing </em>tab of <em>Safety Options</em>.&nbsp;Press Alt-F O S to open <em>Safety Options</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion. We have the top box selected so I hope it's checking for phishing emails even if it doesn't tell us it's found one.</p>

<h2>            I recently suffered a hard drive failure on my Sony Vaio. Can I re install Windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    I recently suffered a hard drive failure on my Sony Vaio. I did not have anything backed up, so I lost all my data. I have been restored and computer is now "out of box"condition, along with the default installed windows vista premium home edition. Before
 my computer crashed I had intalled, updated and been using Windows 7 home edition. I still have the product key for windows 7. Is there any way to reinstall windows 7 without paying for update or full version? Will they honor that I have alreay had windows
 7 on this computer to allow me to reinstall it?

How to do a clean install with the upgrade disc:<br />
If your computer came with a previous qualifying license such as Windows Vista or Windows XP and the Certificate of Authencity is still attached to the machine in good condition, then the COA is reason enough for representing compliance to the software license
 agreement. No actual installation of previous software necessary, which means you can do a clean install with Windows 7 Upgrade disk.<br />
<br />
How to do a clean install with the upgrade disk:<br />
<br />
Boot from the Windows 7 DVD<br />
Click Install Now<br />
Accept License Agreement<br />
When the option is displayed to select an installation type, click (Custom Advanced)<br />
Click Drive Options<br />
Select the drive/s click Delete<br />
Click New<br />
Click Apply<br />
Click OK<br />
Click Format and click Next to proceed with the installation<br />
<br />
Skip entering your Windows 7 product key and complete the installation.<br />
<br />
Once you reach the desktop, click Start, right click Computer<br />
<br />
Click Properties<br />
<br />
Scroll down to Windows Activation<br />
<br />
Click the link x days until activation.<br />
<br />
Click the link that says 'Show me other ways to activate'<br />
<br />
Enter product key<br />
<br />
Click Next<br />
<br />
Select Phone Activation<br />
<br />
Click Next when Enter your key page displayed<br />
<br />
Select your country<br />
<br />
Click Next, call the number listed<br />
<br />
Remember to explain to the call agent your situation.<br />
<br />
Provide the generated installation ID when requested by the call agent<br />
<br />
They will give you a confirmation ID in return, enter it<br />
<br />
Click Next to complete the activation. <br />
<br />
The requirements for upgrade media though is that you have a previously qualifying operating system such as Windows XP or Vista installed to use it. From the Windows 7 End User License Agreement.<br />
<br />
15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UPGRADES. To use upgrade software, you must first be licensed for the software that is eligible for the upgrade. Upon upgrade, this agreement takes the place of the agreement for the software you upgraded from. After you upgrade, you may no longer use
 the software you upgraded from.<br />
<br />
So, if you are still denied, you will have to simply reinstall Windows XP or Vista and let it do the eligibility check.<br />

    <title>Wireless Network problem, Windows 8&#47;8.1, Toshiba Sattelite - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ricklamers  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wireless Network problem, Windows 8&#47;8.1, Toshiba Sattelite L50-A-1EH</h2>
                    <p>Hello MS,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm experiencing problems with my wireless network card. At this point, I think it might be faulty hardware. Here's the problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an SSID access point that is connecting but is disconnecting every 10 - 15 minutes. It's disconnected for 1 minute until it automatically reconnects or if it's disconnected and I reconnect manually it reconnects faster.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop is a Toshiba Sattelite L50-A-1EH. Network card: Atheros AR956x.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To solve this problem I have tried the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install numerous drivers, from Atheros themselves as well as from the Toshiba drivers section for this specific laptop model.</li><li>Installed those drivers on Windows 8.1, downgraded to Windows 8 (perhaps better driver support was my guess, still no luck)</li><li>Tried driver versions: 0.0.75/0.0.263/0.0.270/0.0.287 (latest)</li><li>Changed DHCP IPv4 from automatic to static IP address</li><li>Changed Wireless profile to manually created profile for this SSID</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>In the Windows 8 Event Viewer under WLAN-AutoConfig it says: WLAN AutoConfig service failed to connect to a wireless network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Failure Reason: The driver disconnected while associating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The router is not the problem, I have multiple other devices connected to this access point without any problems or whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I'm thinking this is a hardware problem in the Atheros AR956x card because I can't imagine that Toshiba would have a product on the market pre-installed with Windows 8.1 that doesn't have working drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts? Much appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hello Babu V,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to have you know that I did eventually manage to fix the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a lot of things but what ended up working was the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updating the BIOS to the latest version (1.6 -&gt; 1.7), downgrading from Windows 8.1 to Windows 8 and installing a driver that supported Windows 8. For me it was&nbsp;10.0.0.247 that kept working throughout.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the guide though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yours sincerely,</p>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Sorry, I take it back.&nbsp; -- It has been a real pain.</div>
<div>terrible, terrible, and terrible upgrade experience to those with rapid drive technology.</div>
<div>UEFI was causing some trouble... it went ok and as expected at first but after a crash by some unknown reason, the pc went into auto repair mode and revived windows 7 and created a mix-up.&nbsp; I couldn't deal with it anymore with windows 8 upgrade installer&nbsp;which
 had&nbsp;trouble with partitions even after disks were separated. I decided to install as if new drive so I deleted all partitions...&nbsp; so, no more confusion with windows 8.&nbsp; installed fine, only to find out windows 8 was not activated/ could not be activated because
 it is an upgrade and couldn't find trace of upgrade.&nbsp; Plus, Lenovo drivers released for windows 8 on 10/24/12 would not install properly.&nbsp; Intel Rapid Technology was one cause that brought me to "auto startup repair" which messed more up.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I bought this PC thinking to upgrade to windows 8 easily... I should held back and wait til release of preinstalled windows 8. Clear lesson for me to not upgrade when there is looming New OS just around the corner..</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I hope someone finds this information useful and not waste more time.</div>
<div>I'll re-edit this post after the dust settles..</div>

            I bought the Lenovo Y580 in August thinking with the $15 upgrade to Windows 8 it would be no problem purchasing before Windows 8 release. I have not been able to upgrade to Windows 8 because of the Intel Rapid Drive Technology. I finally gave up and got
 a refund from Microsoft.&nbsp; I have searched the Web and found many people with the same problem with various Laptop manufactures. What gives. Come on Microsoft&nbsp; with the thousands of people you have employed all over the world you would think you could come
 up with a step by step work around for this problem.<br />

<p>There are only green ticks by them. Their names are those of their owners, and could only have been present after these people moved into the house, so they haven't been there for long. I thought it might be something to do with the settings on 8.1.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I believe it is due to network sharing feature which is on and it is also appears when you setup Home Group.</p>
<p>This is feature for better sharing and experience so let say if you want share contents with different devices and PCs.</p>
<p>If you open Control Panel and under Network and Sharing Center , you have option call Advance Sharing Settings and under your current profile, you may Turn off network discovery and also file sharing features.</p>

<h2>            Defender disable auto scan</h2>
                    <p>I have Win 10 and believe the Defender is doing an automatic scan when I am not using the computer. Is there any way for me to disable this auto scan and just do a manual scan when I want? I do not like programs that run in the "background" without my permission
 or knowledge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(If I cannot disable this Defender auto scan, does it run a "quick scan," and how would I know if the auto scan found any problem(s) after it had run?)</p>

            That is an unusual problem, and not something I have seen,&nbsp; but if it only happens with CS 1.6&nbsp; I think the Steam forums may be a better place to ask your question,&nbsp; as the game is a Valve/Steam game.<br />

<h3> do you need to know  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 family safety time limits won&#39;t go away</h2>
                    <p>I originally set up time limits for my child.&nbsp; they worked, and I received notifications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I removed the time limits&nbsp;from the admin page, and they never stopped being applied to my child's PC.</p>
<p>they can ask for more time, and I don't get any request for the extended time request.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reinstated the time controls, but still don't get notifications when my child want's to extend time.</p>
<p>so my efforts to extend their time is unfruitful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do, to the child's machine, to remove the time limits once I turn them off in the admin page?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>my trouble shooting of the windows account, says&nbsp; I can't connect to the sync service?</p>
<p>is it just down, or is there something else I can do?</p>

            <p>Let me be clear.&nbsp; I'm only talking about screen time limits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>when you access the child's screen time admin page, there is a toggle, for on and off, right below the
<p>
</p><p><strong>SET Time limits for when my child can use devices</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Originally I had that switch set to ON, and the time limits were enforced. yeah, no problems.</p>
<p>

            <p>I waited a couple of days and eventually they stopped being applied.&nbsp; They didn't stop when I removed them as there was a significant delay we suffered through, waiting for the time limits to disappear.&nbsp;and they were still applied, even after I had promoted
 the child to Admin, and removed them from the family.&nbsp;in hopes to bypass them.&nbsp; But since&nbsp;we're long suffering, we had no option but to wait for MS to get it's stuff together, before we could get on with our lives.&nbsp; Finally, they disappeared.</p>
<p>

            <p>If two different computers cannot read the SD card, then it is likely damaged and no longer usable.&nbsp; They do wear out over time.&nbsp; Hopefully you had the files on it backed up somewhere.&nbsp; If you simply want to recover and re-format it, I would recommend using the diskpart program to wipe the card clean, then try re-formatting it.&nbsp; However given these symptoms I would never trust it for anything important even if you could format it again.</p>

<h2>            Windows Update Error 0x80070422</h2>
                    <p>I have a similar problem. Also W7 64bit. I tried to check for updates today and got an error code 80070422 Not the same as you, Edouardo, but the description of the problem is the same. I also found that it states now that I have
<strong>never</strong> checked for updates and I know that that is NOT true. In fact I noticed before I started that the last check for updates was somewhere in April this year. But that record is wiped out now!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before the support people ask: </p>
<p>1. I have received this Windows when I bought my laptop 3 years ago. I have updated it several times, but now it seems not to work.
</p>
<p>2. I am using Avast antivirus. </p>
<p>3. I have not installed new hardware or software (except for small applications) for several months now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To try to resolve the problem, I have already downloaded 3 "Microsoft tools" that so-called would fix problems with W-update "automatically". But they achieved nothing. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I have some help here? Or must I open a new thread, because of the different errorcode?&nbsp;</p>

<div>The only way to test is to somehow disable these modules or uninstall the ALWIL software. I doubt the warning is of that much concern, but feel free to check the behavior with those modules disabled/uninstalled if you care. &nbsp;It is a warning, and not an

<h2>            Skype calls to my computer are ringing on my phone even though app is off. WHY&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I only rarely use Skype on my iphone. Usually I use the desktop app and it's great.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, when someone rings me on Skype it seems to ring in both places - even when the app on my phone is TURNED OFF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is making me totally insane and is frankly a major privacy concern. I DO NOT want skype touching my phone in any way unless I have clearly turned the Skype app on. Why does this keep happening and how do I turn it off?</p>

            Strange. How about under Setting-&gt;Skype and turn off background app refresh?
<br />
<br />If that doesn’t work try uninstalling, restart your phone and then redone load. And change notifications to off again.

<p><span>Hi PARAM001,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The BCCode&nbsp;50 usually occurs after the installation of faulty hardware or in the event of failure of installed hardware (usually related to defective
 RAM).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Run Memory Diagnostics test to check for any
 memory problems. Refer the below mentioned link for the same.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Diagnosing-memory-problems-on-your-computer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Diagnosing memory
 problems on your computer</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Update the chipset, video card, display and
 network adapter drivers to the latest by visiting the computer manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Update
 a driver for hardware that isn't working properly</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Update-drivers-recommended-links" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Update drivers: recommended
 links</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Check to see if the issue occurs in safe mode.
 To do so, follow these steps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Restart
 your computer and start pressing the F8 key on your keyboard. On a computer that is configured for booting to multiple operating systems, you can press the F8 key when the Boot Menu appears.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Use
 the arrow keys to choose Safe mode in the Windows Advanced Boot Menu Options and then press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Check
 if you can open the desktop icons, if not, then it could be some third party application that is causing the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 4:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Restart the computer in normal mode and follow
 the below mentioned article to find the cause of the problem.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows
 Vista or in Windows 7</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:&nbsp;</span></strong><span>Make sure you put the computer back to Normal Startup
 once you are done.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the below mentioned link for more information.</span></p>

 (blue screen) errors in Windows 7</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope this helps!</span></p>
