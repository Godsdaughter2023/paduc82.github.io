            Currently Skype services are normal, hence doesn't look like server side issue.
<br />
<br />1. Try following troubleshooting steps

<h2>            why since switched to windows 10 got extra user</h2>
                    <p>Since I have changed to Windows 10 I have got two users, one is "administrators" and second is "home users" (viewable when right clicking on any folder &gt;&gt;&gt; properties &gt;&gt;&gt; security)... checked control panel &gt;&gt;&gt; users account &gt;&gt;&gt; users account &gt;&gt;&gt; manage accounts
 and there are two users one is "my name"&nbsp;(admin, Hotmail account) and one is "ASP.NET machine account" (admin local account)....</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question: is home user same as ASP.NET machine account?&nbsp; if yes, why I don't have "permissions" to all files and folders, same as admin?&nbsp; I have changes the permissions several times to "full control" but when restart the system it losses the "full control
 permissions"?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>when I want&nbsp;to add a "local account" user I get prompted for an e-mail address.... How can I add a "local account user"?</p>

            <p>Well it certainly seems like some "interesting" things are going on, and my best guess as to why would be something happened during the upgrade.&nbsp; One of the many reasons I like to do clean installs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways first off the default location for the pictures is on the C drive, in:</p>
<p>C:\Users\USERNAME\Pictures</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it can be moved.</p>
<p>If you right click on Pictures -&gt; Location, it will show where it is.&nbsp; If it is not on the above path that could certainly be the cause of permission problems.&nbsp; For instance my Pictures are stored on a server and as such the server has a lot to do with what
 permissions might be there.&nbsp; But if it was just say on D drive, I wouldn't really expect all this strangeness.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "inherited from" does mean that the folder listed is controlling the permissions.</p>
<p>That was in fact what we were trying to do with the "Replace all child permissions..." setting, for the folders below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For each of the permissions listed on a file/folder it possible that the permission is "local" or inherited from the folder above it.&nbsp; This inheritance can go all the way up to the top of the drive, adding different permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically you mostly want permissions to be inherited.&nbsp; For instance when you created the test folder under Pictures, what should its permissions be?&nbsp; It should get the inheritable permissions.&nbsp; That way you don't have to set permissions every time you create
 a folder, they just naturally take on the permissions of the parent.&nbsp; And only when you have a special case do you override these inherited permissions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the " I see a new user group (I guess this user is inherited from C:) with same name as I login to the computer".&nbsp; This isn't a group, this is your user account.&nbsp; And yes by default your account should be on all the files from C:\Users\USERNAME on down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm glad you found a combination works for you, but I also think that maybe you should check who owns the Pictures folder.&nbsp; If you go into the advanced permissions, it will show who owns it.&nbsp; If your Pictures folder is on a local drive it certainly should
 be your username (the one you log in with).</p>

    <title>Your Phone Companion - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> majikthyse  say:</h3>
<h2>            Your Phone Companion</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 10 on a Samsung Q330 laptop. All I want to do is to transfer audio files to my phone, an HTC One Mini running Android 4.4.2. OK these are old devices but both usually perform well. I have given up with the HTC Sync Manager which has
 always been horribly unreliable. Searching for a solution, I came across Your Phone Manager from Microsoft. This doesn't even get to first base, as the phone is not visible in Explorer. I went online to chat with MS support, which was pretty disastrous - they
 told me to start deleting USB drivers without checking what was using USB. All the USB drivers are up to date according to the troubleshooter. Installing Your Phone Companion entailed also installing Microsoft Launcher and Cortana. The phone is now much slower
 and the power consumption is horrendous - I have to charge the phone twice a day, even when idling. I was advised by the knowledge base that I can upload the audio to OneDrive and stream it using Groove on the phone. Groove does not appear on the phone, after
 all this installation. According to the Google Play store it's part of Your Phone Companion but there is no sign of it. Is this because it needs a later version of Android? There is no warning about that, other than for syncing web pages and photos (which
 I don't want to do). I am about to uninstall all this Microsoft stuff from the phone as it seems to be nothing but trouble. Am I right?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Fails to Properly Work with Dvorak Keyboard - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> granitestatecolin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Fails to Properly Work with Dvorak Keyboard</h2>
                    <p>I have set my Keyboard to English (United States)-Dvorak on my desktop and laptop at installation of Windows 10. I have never installed the standard US (QWERTY) keyboard layout. In prior editions of Windows, leaving out the QWERTY keyboard altogether was
 the only way to be sure the keyboard would not occasionally revert to QWERTY. </p>
<p>
</p><p>At first, this appears to work fine in Windows 10... for a while. But alas, no. Every few minutes while typing, the keyboard will flip to QWERTY. In the lower right Systray, just to the left of the clock, it shows "ENG DV" when the keyboard is properly in
 Dvorak mode. That changes to ENG US when it flips to QWERTY. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a quick keypress of Win+Spacebar to fix it and return to Dvorak, so the workaround is minor, but it's hugely annoying that this happens at all. For the majority of you QWERTY users, imagine that in the middle of typing, all of a sudden everything starts
 coming out as garbage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Effectively, the Windows 10 keyboard system is broken, if you use Dvorak, something Microsoft has supported properly since at least Windows 3.1. To be clear: this is definitely a new problem with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have checked the Keyboards installed under Language &gt; Language options, and the only listed Input method is "United States-Dvorak".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I fix this? &nbsp;How can I stop it from randomly and sporadically shifting keyboards on me in the middle of my typing?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to disable the Win+Spacebar to shift keyboards? While that's currently my only way back to a working keyboard, maybe disabling it would also stop Windows from shifting in the other direction in the first place. If it never leaves Dvorak, I'd
 never need to switch back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If nothing else, how do we report this as a bug? I have submitted it through Windows Feedback. Is that the only option?</p>

            <p>I have experienced the same result on multiple independent Windows 10 installs, including with updates from Windows 7, 8.1, and clean installs. So yes, I've already done all of the things in your list. In my experience, this happens with absolute reproducibility
 100% of the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All updates are installed. In fact, it appears this problem started with the November update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any evidence that anyone is successfully using only a Dvorak keyboard without having this issue? If so, we should try to determine what might be different in our configurations. As I've said, none of the system I've set up are working, spanning
 different updates methods, desktop computers, convertible tablets, etc. All have the same problem. Only thing in common is that all are members of the same domain, and so there are some settings forced down by Group Policy, but I don't think there's anything
 relating to the keyboard.</p>

            <p>Thank you. That page describes the process in Windows 8, which is a little different from Windows 10, but it was close enough I was able to find that page. I had not setting the "Override for default input method" before. I changed that from&nbsp;"Use a language
 list (recommended)" to&nbsp;"English (United States) -&nbsp;United States-Dvorak" (note that this is the only other option listed, which is part why it's so weird it ever flips to QWERTY -- there is no QWERTY keyboard even installed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, after changing it, typing this very message, the keyboard again flipped to QWERTY. Perhaps I need to restart the computer? I'll try&nbsp;that too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, I should add one more bit of data that may help diagnostically:</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I remove the QWERTY keyboard through the Language Preferences, it appears to stay removed (so no flipping away from Dvorak), until I login again from a Remote Desktop session and then disconnect. This may be why this problem is not widely reported. It
 appears to be an interaction between a Dvorak Keyboard and use of Remote Desktop.</p>

            Hi,

</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting us back&nbsp;in Microsoft Community.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>As per&nbsp;the above reply , even&nbsp;after you have uninstalled the qwerty input&nbsp;layout it still comes back while using Dvorak keyboard input&nbsp;layout and it usually happens when you are in remote desktop connection.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I suggest you to boot into safe mode with networking and see if it helps.</div>
<div>Refer the below article to boot into safe mode :<br />

            <p>No, this is a bug in Windows that I can reproduce on 100% of the systems (admittedly only 5 so far) that I've tried. My configuration may be obscure, but here are the steps to reproduce and a work-around I finally found that fixes:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Set up a keyboard on a Windows 10 computer as Dvorak. In all of my cases, this was the only keyboard installed and installed that way during the Windows 10 installation (as opposed to added after the OS was setup). I'm not sure if the time the keyboard
 was set matters. </li><li>Access the Windows 10 computer via Remote Desktop from another computer also running a Dvorak keyboard (can be running Windows 7 or Windows 10, possibly other OS's too, but only tested with those two). I don't know that remote computer also must be using
 a Dvorak keyboard, but all of my computers use only Dvorak keyboards, so all of my test cases were set up this way.</li><li>There will now be an entry from the Language bar in the systray, showing ENG DV. However, once this appears, even though there is no QWERTY keyboard installed, Windows will seemingly randomly shift to QWERTY keyboard while typing. Pressing Win+space will
 flip the keyboard back to Dvorak.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>In #3, I've finally figured out that it's NOT random. It's that it SOMETIMES happens when pressing Ctrl-Shift (it may be consistent, depending on which Ctrl and Shift (left or right) are being used, but I've not tested further), which is a key combination
 for shifting keyboards set up by default. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is clearly a bug, because there is no QWERTY keyboard installed. It should not be able to change to any other keyboard.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It does not work to add and remove a QWERTY keyboard. It also does not help to go into&nbsp;Control Panel\Clock, Language, and Region\Language\Advanced Settings and set the Override for default input method to Dvorak, as has been suggested in another thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, what DOES work is:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to that same Advanced Settings page: Control Panel\Clock, Language, and Region\Language\Advanced settings</li><li>Under Switching input methods, click on "Change language bar hot keys".</li><li>Select "Between input languages" and click on "Change Key Sequence..."</li><li>Select "Not Assigned" for both options.</li><li>Hit OK, OK, Save</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Problem solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But this is a work-around for an MS bug in Windows 10. </p>

<h2>            &#34;WindowsUpdate_80240020&#34; Error Fix Question Regarding Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I've seen the various responses to fix the above error.&nbsp; Part of the fix is to go to the "C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download" and delete everything INSIDE that folder.&nbsp; Well here is were my main question is?&nbsp; Within that folder I have two sub files,
 which I deleted and now there are still a list of other things (see print screen) some things date back to 2012,
<strong>do I delete ALL of that (in the print screen too)</strong> as the fix it response says to delete everything, but because some of the files go back several years kind of made me question whether I should do that or not.&nbsp; HELP&nbsp; ( I currently have windows
 7 pro)</p>

<p>You say to "remove everything" when did that it wiped out my product Id # on my "Systems Detail" page?&nbsp; Are you sure we get rid of EVERYTHING in that folder even the items dated back to 2012 and the sub folders?&nbsp; I not only have links in that folder, but
 a couple of sub folders and info dated back to 2012.&nbsp; What do I do I don't want to wipe out EVERYTHING in that folder and then not have my system work.&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, In my windows update history I do see that Windows 10 pro is trying to download and has been for

<h2>            MATSHITA DVD-RAM UJ8E1 Not Working on Windows 10</h2>
                    Hi, I recently have updated to windows 10 on my ASUS Et2321I and was able to burn 2 audio CD's earlier today, but when I went to upload my WriteWay Professional software, it would not read. It wouldn't even eject at first...and if I did get the disc in,
 I could hear noise but then "PC is not responding" and I got an error...but no error number. The computer says the device is working and I can't bring up any errors with troubleshooting. I have been all over the net trying to figure this out and I'm at a loss.
 I have version 10.0.1.10586.0 and the date of the driver is 6/21/06....Can anyone assist me with fixing this? Thank you!

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To assist you better, I would like to know if the issue is specific to one particular disc and what are the troubleshooting steps that you have already performed?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I suggest you to uninstall and reinstall the driver and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press “Windows key + X” and click on “Device Manager”.</span></li><li><span>In the list of devices, you should see the DVD drivers.</span></li><li><span>Right click on the device and then select "Uninstall".</span></li><li><span>In the uninstall dialog, make sure you select the option to delete the driver package from the system. This causes the driver package installed earlier to be deleted.</span></li><li><span>In the Action menu of Device manager, select “<span>Scan for Hardware changes”
</span>option. This will cause the device driver to be reinstalled. Once the driver is installed, close all windows and restart the computer.</span></li></ol>

<h2>            How do I burn a DVD that will play on a DVD player&#63; Burned to DVD &#40;MP4 format&#41; but my DVD player will not read it</h2>
                    <p>I created a movie (although my preview screen is black - that's another issue) and saved it to DVD - it plays fine on my computer, both audio and video, but the DVD disc will not work on my DVD player. I tried importing the file to Windows DVD maker, but
 it will not allow me, saying MP4 format is not supported. How can I make a true video DVD that I will be able to watch on my TV screen?</p>

            <p>I had this problem too. Windows DVD Maker does not accept MP4 format . When you save your project, make sure you don't use setting for HIGH DEFINITION display. Use Burn a DVD and make sure it's in 720x480 format. My DVD player would not play a movie saved
 in 1280x1080. Like you my project would work on my computer and my BLU RAY player, but not on a "low-end" DVD player.</p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>For Windows DVD MAKER use WMV file format</strong></p>

            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks, Mr. Rob, but I had already solved the problem. When I first saved my project it was saved as an MP4 file, because I might have selected "Recommended Setting" and the disk I
<strong><em>thought</em></strong> I burned won't even read on my computer anymore. This time in Windows Movie Maker I chose the option to Burn DVD, and it
 a lot easier. Thanks again for helping out.<br />

<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />You should use Windows Media Player to do this:<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/75c5185b-1322-4c02-b14e-64f28c039915?upload=true" />

            Hello, to rip a CD to an audio file, you will need to use the Windows Media Player which luckily is included in the Windows operating system. 
<br />First, you will want to open the Windows media player application and insert the CD that you wish to rip. Now, once Windows media player recognizes the CD, the Rip button should show up. Now, you are able to specify the location and Rip the CD audio into your computer.
<br />Hope this helps, and let me know if you have further questions! :-)

            I am having the same issue. The suggestion for problem solving here is a bit confusing considering that Internet connectivity is the original problem yet the recommendation to solve it is to make sure there is an internet connection to update drivers.
 my other devices are staying connected.

            I solved the problem actually by updating my graphic card driver.&nbsp;
<div>but i was confused because i thought it was up to date.&nbsp;</div>
<div>computer&nbsp;properties - device manager - display adapters - NVIDIA GeForce GT 230M&nbsp;</div>
<div>i right clicked on NVIDIA GeForce GT 230M and than clicked update driver software. it told me that the driver was up to date.</div>
<div>but than i checked the nvidias website. there i found a newer version.</div>
<div>that was confusing. why windows cant find this newer version?</div>

<h2>            Headphones keep cutting out</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Hello, a couple of hours ago I restarted my computer and it was updating. I left it for a while and then got on it to listen to music and play some games. I noticed that only very rarely it would actually make sound through my headset. I refuse to believe
 this is a hardware problem because the sound is fine when I plug the headset into my phone. I restarted my computer again after that and the problem did not fix itself. I have the headphones set as my default device. If I go into my devices it shows that there
 is sound playing while I have music playing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My headset is a pair of Razer Kraken Neons and they have one jack and they require a splitter (one was included) to make the mic work for any purpose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The sound when it plays usually plays anywhere from around 2 to 15 seconds and then stops for quite a long while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If anyone can help, it would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<blockquote>My current OS is Window vista home basic 32-bit. Can i upgrade this to Windows 7 Ultimate 64 bit
<br />
</blockquote>
It's impossible to in place upgrade from 32 bit to 64 bit. The <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
only</span> option is to backup your data and do a custom clean install, then reinstall your programs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Custom Clean Install Steps</strong> <br />
<br />
Times to use:<br />
Moving from XP to Windows 7, or other unsupported in place upgrade paths (ex: Vista Home to 7 Pro)<br />
<strong>Moving from a 32 bit Windows system to a 64 bit system,</strong> or changing languages<br />
Don't want to do an in place upgrade, or you want a fresh/clean install<br />
<br />
You can use an Upgrade or Full Windows 7 disk to do a custom clean install. This will remove all your programs, but you can save your files and settings to an external storage before doing so. Also,&nbsp; you'll have to reinstall all your programs. Here are the
 steps:<br />
<br />
1. Run Windows Upgrade Advisor (<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/upgrade-advisor</a> ) to see if there are any known issues that might affect the installation
 and whether you should install the 32 or 64 bit version of Windows 7.<br />
<br />
2. Back up your files and settings. To avoid losing anything you'll need to save copies of all the files, photos, and other information you want to keep on to an external hard drive. Windows Easy Transfer (<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/windows-easy-transfer</a>
 ) is a free tool you can use to copy your information (but not programs) from your PC and then put them back after you install Windows 7. If you don't have an external hard drive you won't be able to use Windows Easy Transfer, instead you can copy files you
 want to keep on a USB flash drive, or on CD/DVD.<br />
<br />
3. Locate the original installation disks and any associated product/license keys for the programs currently on your computer because you'll need to manually reinstall all your programs after you install Windows 7. You might be able to download some programs
 from the Internet.<br />
<br />
4. Inset the Windows 7 DVD into your PC. When asked "Which type of installation do you want? click "Custom (advanced)."
<strong>Note: 32 to 64 bit requires you to restart and boot from the DVD.</strong>
<br />
<br />
5. After Windows 7 is installed you can use Windows Easy Transfer to restore your files &amp; settings, and use your installation disks to install all your programs.<br />
<br />

    <title>Photos on NAS not displaying in photos app. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dmcollins57  say:</h3>
<h2>            Photos on NAS not displaying in photos app.</h2>
                    <p>I don't know if this is a bug or what but when I'm trying to view my photos on my NAS box not all of them appear. I have a few thousand photos I have stored on my NAS and have no problem viewing them through windows explorer so I do know they are there,
 I just want to use the photo app because it is more user friendly to view everything in a single window. This happens across multiple computers, as i first thought it was just the one. When I do add the network folder with its myriad of subfolders the collection
 view does start to populate the thumbnails, but after waiting hours(I even left the computer on for about a day) not all my photos appeared.
</p>
<p>When I go into the folders view I can start go through all the subfolders but there are no images shown. All I get is an message in the folder stating that "No readable photos, videos, or folder found." What is even more strange I can see photos not only
 appearing in the collection view and I start to think its going to work,&nbsp; but then they even start to disappear randomly right before me. Any help or insight into this issue would be great.</p>

            <p>Hi Sam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed, I would like you to provide the information stated below:</p>
<p>1. Where you trying to install any game from Store when you receive the above prompt?</p>
<p>2. If yes, can you state the game that you tried to run?</p>
<p>3. If no, can you state what was the task you tried to perform that prompted the above error?</p>
<p>4. Can you send us the screenshot of the window which contains the above error?</p>
<p>
</p><p>For now, I suggest that you check&nbsp;the DirectX Version installed on your system. Follow the below steps to check the DirectX Version:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>R</strong> from the Desktop.</li><li>Type <strong>dxdiag</strong> and hit <strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Check the <strong>DirectX Version</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I also <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>suggest you to try and run <strong><span>DirectX Diagnostic Tool</span></strong> and also try other steps in the article given below and check if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">DirectX is a suite of technologies used by many multimedia apps in Windows. If you're having problems getting a game or movie to play properly, the DirectX Diagnostic Tool can help you find the problem.</span></span></p>

I ran the <strong>dx diag </strong>and it shows I have Direct X version 10.1<br />
<br />
I have tried to go to the support link and on the website the page seems to be broken and only shows text. Is here a way to update my Direct X version to 10.1 to 11 ?&nbsp;<br />
<br />

            <div>Your graphics card only supports DX 10.1 features. This is a limitation of the hardware/driver. You would need a Graphics card that supports DX11.

<br />
That's because you have Windows 7 starter. Microsoft pulled out that feature and many others to speed the&nbsp;netbook up since most netbooks can't handle all of the visual effects. However this tutorial:<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/47294-desktop-background-change-windows-7-starter.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/47294-desktop-background-change-windows-7-starter.html</a>&nbsp;shows
 how to change the backbround using a third party tool.

<h2>            One Win 8.1 laptop cannot see or ping other devices or PC&#39;s on the LAN</h2>
                    <p>I have one Windows 8.1 laptop that cannot see or ping anything on the wireless LAN including other PC's, printers,or even the gateway. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It CAN ping its own address and the loopback address. &nbsp;</p>
<p>No wired network is in place; just wireless, including the printer.</p>
<p>The unit can access the Internet with no issues and ping and tracert work normally outside the LAN.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other PC's can ping this laptop and all other network resources. &nbsp; These are all on the same subnet and on the same workgroup. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This problem PC can ping and tracert outside sites; just nothing on the LAN. &nbsp;This is true with the firewall on or off. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I made sure Discovery is &nbsp;turned ON; I tried toggling it several times.</p>
<p>I have tried resetting the stack and reloading the NIC driver. &nbsp;I searched for driver update but none is available. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I disabled and reenabled the wireless adapter.</p>
<p>Any ideas where to go from here?</p>

<p>
</p><p>I have a Lenovo y700 and it seems like it doesn't know it has a touchpad. It's not the drivers, I uninstalled and reinstalled them multiple times.&nbsp; There's no touchpad in the device manager (right now I'm using an external USB mouse.) I think it could be
 the unknown device? <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/11ecae67-6d17-4c7b-b1fd-c5cacb27e624" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            Falls under the too complicated to be worth it pile.. requires both a DAW and ASSIO sound device. Both of which I have for work and won't be constantly reconfiguring for home.. not to mention if you go that far you may aswell just use the daw to rout things.
<br />
<br />
I just fail to understand how it still isn't a function of the volume mixer.

<p>Yeah, having to install those extra devices/drivers makes me hesitate too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And yes, agreed - this is one of those cases where Ubuntu is way ahead of Windows. It has an app called "pavucontrol" that gives you full control over all audio devices and all apps playing or recording audio, including routing, changing the volume of every
 channel individually, and much more. Love it, wish Windows had it.</p>

            I'm talking about not being able to change my laptop password, not my Microsoft account. The software of my laptop is Windows 10. It just says i'm not able to change my password because it says I am not connected to the internet when I am. There is no
 browser. &nbsp;I go to settings and then I try to change my password.

            <p>Hi Ellisa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As ZigZag3143 mentioned, you can change the password for local account without the internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do so follow:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows </strong>key form the keyboard, click on <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Accounts</strong>, <strong>Sign-in options</strong>.</li><li>Click on <strong>Change</strong> under <strong>Password </strong>and follow on-screen instructions.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to disable any third-party anti-virus software installed on your computer and check if you are able to change the password.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>NOTE</span></strong><span>:&nbsp;Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If the issue still persists, I suggest you to uninstall the third-party anti-virus software.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are trying to change the password for administrator account you will have to access internet.</p>
<p>I suggest you to log-in to website manually, try to change the password and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope it helps. Kindly update the status of this issue for further assistance.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 - No .wma files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - No .wma files</h2>
                    <p>Super frustrated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just purchased a new Windows 10 computer a couple of weeks ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Download all of our music files for our external hard drive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NONE of the .wma files will play.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've searched and searched the internet for a solution to this
 problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Media Played doesn't play them, Groove Music doesn't play them, Media Monkey doesn't play them, VLC doesn't play them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The files are not corrupt because I plug the external drive into my laptop with Windows 8 and have no issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've checked
 the sound card, speakers, etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I just don't know what else to do.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Certainly, there are others that have experienced this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've tried contacting Microsoft and really didn't get anywhere.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was told to just keep downloading other players until
 something worked !!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; ??????</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main reason we purchased this computer is for speed and to play our over 12000 music files.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We dabble with a side-line DJ gig.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess we will have to just stick with the laptop to play our music.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please give me your thoughts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm not exactly tech savvy, but I really hate to take this computer back to the business where we bought it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But, I'm thinking the OS may need to be reinstalled.</p>
<p>

<p>And I have a&nbsp;good tip&nbsp;for you. WMA files are basically 1980 and 1990 technology. They are not so good for good audio files. Mp3, AAC or AC3 is really what you want. You should download a free audio converter like any audio to mp3 or one you may have and
 convert them to Mp3 format with 2 channels, 320kbps bitrate, 44,100 sample rate</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you can also rip them on CD's and play in your car stereo and other&nbsp;media devices.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also&nbsp;put them on to a USB thumb drive formatted in FAT or FAT32&nbsp;and play in car stereo too like I do.</p>

<p>Well I believe you had originally posted here about no thumbnails too. Hmmmm. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, Shark007 codec pack will play them. I have&nbsp;used it for over 10 years and so does everyone else I know. It is flawless, safe/no malware and no crashing&nbsp;like K-lite codec pack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://shark007.net/advanced.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://shark007.net/advanced.html</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It has wma codecs to play them. They are disabled on mine, (which I can enable) but probably because I use the play all in WMP but I do not use default LAV splitter or other settings for my play back. I use FFDShow because I have 5.1 stereo and can make
 adjustments for my speakers, add the equalizer and set it up, set Dolby audio and make other changes&nbsp;and also because FFDShow allows you to switch a 4:3 format video to 16:9 wide screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just open the 32 bit settings app (ADMIN RIGHTS)&nbsp;and select box to play all in windows media player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then go to action center&gt;&gt; apps&gt;&gt;default apps&gt;&gt;</p>
<p>in music and video player choose windows media player as default app.</p>
<p>You also can for photos if you want to or use the photo viewer or a 3rd party app.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you do not have to download or install a bunch of players. </p>
