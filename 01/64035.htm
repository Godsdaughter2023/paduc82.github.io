            This appears to be a corruption somewhere in the system. 
<br />
<br />I recommend you perform a repair upgrade:

            Try doing a repair install. A repair Install keeps everything and reinstalls Windows.

            I had this exact problem and found that the ready boost I was using had corrupted cache.. So I&nbsp;removed the ready boost drive&nbsp;that I&nbsp;had plugged in to my&nbsp;USB socket and&nbsp;BINGO.. Everything working as normal..&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

    <title>Why All of My 512gb SURFACE BOOKS Are Working NEAR FLAWLESSY Following - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Why All of My 512gb SURFACE BOOKS Are Working NEAR FLAWLESSY Following 02&#47;17 Firmware AND the REPAIR of Windows 10 &#40;1511&#41; Error Code&#58; 0x800f081f</h2>
                    <p><span>LET'S BEGIN WITH THIS:&nbsp; IF YOU ARE CONTINUING TO HAVE SERIOUS AND RECURRING PROBLEMS WITH YOUR SURFACE BOOK AND, LIKE ME, HAVE EXCHANGED MANY OF THEM ONLY TO FIND THEY STILL DO NOT WORK PROPERLY (AND SOMETIMES THE EXCHANGED DEVICES ARE WORSE PERFORMING
 THAN THE ONES WE SENT BACK,) PERHAPS WHAT I SHARE HERE AND THE REPAIR PROCESS OF THE HARD DRIVE/MISSING AND CORRUPT FILES, WILL SOLVE MOST OF YOUR PROBLEMS LIKE THIS DID FOR ME....&nbsp; AND THANK YOU LEE OF MS SURFACE DEVICE&nbsp;TECH SPECIALIST AND ALL THE WINDOWS
 10 TEAM&nbsp;FOR YOUR OUTSTANDING ASSISTANCE!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I share my experiences here to be helpful and not to dispute in any way other owners of Surface Book who also share their frustrations and real problems with SB, Windows 10 and any and all of the official Updates MS has released to date.</span></p>
<p><span>Now let me add that in my posts of yesterday, 02/26/2016 I shared this all important news that the BIGGEST problem I was having with all my Surface Books was that once each new Firmware Update was installed (and fixed many of the issues each Update
 was designed to do) I (LIKE MANY OF YOU) continued to have problems pile up:&nbsp; some new failures and or failures of the software and or hardware occurring during other functions of the SB that had not been there before…like… SB crashing when on Office 2016:&nbsp;
 Word and Excel… Black screens that suddenly restarted SB with a loud grinding sound coming from within the clipboard when not connected to any websites or apps; all the custom MS sounds start playing like a marching band – one after another till SB would suddenly
 restart itself…among other issues…</span></p>
<p><span>So I set out to try to resolve my suspicion that there was an underlying, possibly systemic problem with SB hardware and or Windows 10 (1511), the latest version of Windows.</span></p>
<p><span>MS Tech Support had me run a new Command Prompt (ADMIN) that I had never run before.&nbsp; That is the DISM Command Prompt that determines the failure error code of whatever may be wrong instead of just stating that there are missing and corrupt files (without
 stating what those missing and corrupt files actually are).</span></p>
<p><span>After opening Command Prompt (ADMIN), they had me carefully type in this code starting exactly where the flashing underscore appears after windows32-Dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</span></p>
<p><span>I recommend you only do this with MS Tech help if you are unfamiliar with this process!</span></p>
<p><span>If you do it yourself, remember, only enter this where the flashing underscore appears:</span></p>
<p><span>Dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</span></p>
<p><span>Remember the ‘case’ matters as does the spaces you see in between the words and phrases and the /</span></p>
<p><span>When the scan completes its run, IF YOU SEE THIS ERROR CODE:&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x800f081f&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This means there are ERRORS with Windows Updates and there are missing and corrupt files that MUST be restored to have your SB run properly.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>Now I have found that 12 SB 512s – purchased for my business ALL had this error when unboxing each device and getting past wifi connection and associating each SB with the business MS email account….&nbsp; THIS WAS SHOCKING.&nbsp; MS had me wipe EACH SB…half
 by re imaging them using a recovery image download to my 16gb USB stick and re installing Windows 10 (1511).&nbsp; Then they had me wipe the other 6 SBs by performing RECOVER FROM THE CLOUD Advanced Option in Recover section/Advanced Troubleshoot – which wipes
 SB and re installs Windows 10 (1511) directly from the MS Cloud (and not from the USB image I used for the other 6).</span></p>
<p><span>The second shocking result was that the ERROR:&nbsp; 0x800f081f&nbsp; was present AGAIN – even after re installing Windows 10 (1511) via both methods of wipe/restore/re install.</span></p>
<p><span>So I embarked on a journey with Tech Support to TRY to resolve this for I believed (and believe now for certain) that al long as that error is present indicating that important files are missing and corrupted related to proper and successful Windows
 Updates.</span></p>
<p><span>This past week I spent over 25 hours on the phone with Tech, exchanged 4 no- working SBs and replaced them with (what turned out to be) other non-working SBs that kept crashing and wrecking Word and Excel 2016 and freezing cursor and device black screens
 and random crashes/re starts.</span></p>
<p><span>These are the 4 SBs that are now WORKING NEAR FLAWLESSY.&nbsp; This is when I posted my story on MS Community and received phenomenal responses from several well-informed, tech savvy, MS Community, SB owners.&nbsp; I read their responses and added them to mine
 and re united with the lead Tech exec in the Philippines, who took that information and screen shots from my emails that contained all the latest info and ideas and process steps and combined all that with his knowledge in Surface Support and once again did
 what is never done, called in and got the contemporary cooperation of the Windows 10 execs who never get on the Surface Support calls.&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>Over the next 4 ½ hours we worked to expand upon what we had discovered the previous 4 days and add in the sage recommendations of Paulo Reichert and J-AlexC.</span></p>
<p><span>Lee, the lead Surface Tech examined all the information and added some steps and clarity he though and Windows Team thought was necessary and they went through a series of steps and eventually download the needed files to my C hard drive and then moved
 them to my 16gb USB stick so I could use that stick to repair every other SB I have or will buy (until MS releases a Firmware FIX for this big issue).</span></p>
<p><span>After all those hours on the first SB, it took less than 5 minutes to insert the USB stick with the files, open the C Drive and see the new repaired files installed and then – in a bit of a complex move, they had me remove the old CBS Logs files from
 all the SBs so they would not conflict with the repaired files.</span></p>
<p><span>Today I reset/repaired two other 512gb SBs owned by an associate.&nbsp; We are all ECSTATIC….</span></p>
<p><span>Now this is important, while I am NOT an engineer and NOT any way employed by MS – what I say here is my opinion though Lee and Aldrin asked me to share all this and post the solution on line (stating to me that their Engineers will immediately begin
 working on an official update to repair this and that the solution we found (and is documented in formal written form with screen shots for all the engineers and MS Board) was being rushed present to the MS Board of Directors.</span></p>
<p><span>Since that ERROR was found in all SBs I have (and had) that had the latest Windows 10 (1511) pre-installed and on SBs that upgraded Windows 10 to 1511 since its release last Fall, it seems to me that this error may be systemic through all SBs.&nbsp; If
 you wish, check yours by running the Command Prompt (ADMIN) and Dism code I detailed above.&nbsp; See if your SB hard drive holds has missing and corrupt files under code:&nbsp;&nbsp; Ox800f081f&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; IF YOU FIND YOUR DEVICE WITH THIS ERROR, CALL MS TECH SUPPORT AND GET THEM
 TO ASSIST YOU OR WAIT FOR THE FIRMWARE PATCH….But who knows when that might come.</span></p>
<p><span>Tech Support told me our solution, crafted with the assistance of Paulo Reichert and J-AlexC will work for all Windows 10 (1511) installs, no matter what the hardware.&nbsp; If you wish to see the process, see the screen shots and text below this story,
 where I share the screen shots /text steps of the process as documented by MS Tech, Lee.&nbsp; This process does NOT require wiping your hard drive and getting rid of your files and info on your SB.&nbsp; This process REPAIRS the corrupted and missing files.</span></p>
<p><span>So now I am here to say that my 4 Surface Book i7 512gb are now performing NEAR flawlessly since the following things were completed and confirmed installed correctly/working:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>1)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>&nbsp;02/17 Firmware Update is properly installed.&nbsp; And while the initial result of the 02/17 Update caused one new problem:&nbsp; that the Windows Hello camera/recognition to stopped working, I was
 able to return it to working perfectly (with MS Tech Support guiding me over the phone) as they had me uninstall the two related Drivers in Device Manager and then we re-installed them (by simply restarting SB after uninstalling each).&nbsp; If you wish to perform
 this process, be sure to call MS Tech Support and they will walk you through these steps.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Repair of the hard drive using the download of the special files and process detailed in my posts on 02/26/2016</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3)</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>The only minor issues that remain on these SBs are:&nbsp; Airplane Mode tab enables itself (in BLUE) in the ACTION CENTER (even when you disable it there, it ultimately turns itself back on).&nbsp;
 And it enables itself even when you have disabled Airplane Mode in SETTINGS.&nbsp; The other remaining issues are that there is still some distortion that plays upon detaching and reattaching the clipboard; the cursor and trackpad will freeze occasionally (1 out
 of 10 times) when waking SB up from SLEEP (the cursor and trackpad return by detaching and reattaching the clipboard; 1 0ut of 30 or so times I will get a black screen upon turning on SB from being completely shut off (this is remedied by a two button restart).</span></p>

            <p>Hi Barb, &nbsp; I'd like to add this additional detail:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The SB from Lot 1551 have the original Windows 10 released last July pre installed. &nbsp;These did NOT come with 1511 although they did come with the new longer power cord. &nbsp; These did not have the corrupt and missing filesupon unboxing and connecting to my
 MS account and WiFi. &nbsp; but once I ran all the Updates including upgrading each to 1511, the error was there: &nbsp; 0x800f081f &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other two Lots: 1552 and 1601 did come with Windows 1511 pre installed (and the new, longer power cord) AND when I ran the Command Prompt (ADMIN) after unboxing and setting up my MS account and WiFi, all showed the error present before ever running and
 installing all the Firmware and other updates.</p>
<p>My conclussion and that of the MS Tech execs after all those days and hours on the phone and running Log Me In Rescue sessions I that the error is part of the 1511 Windows 10 OS as it was not present in the SBs that did not have 1511 pre installed &nbsp; However
 once you upgrade to 1511, there it is &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

            <p>J-alexC shared: &nbsp;If you download the windows 10 ver.1511 build 10586 iso, which is available to download from the Microsoft techbench, and put it on a USB drive you can use it as a repair source. In
 the Iso there&nbsp;has a sources folder with an install.wim file that you will copy the full path to. Then run the DISM restorehealth command you did, but at the end you will point it to the install.wim (something like Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
 /Source:wim:<em>Full path to install.wim file</em>:1 /limitaccess</p>
<p>Check out this page for the details:<span style="color: rgba(0, 115, 188, 1); font-weight: bold">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/7808-dism-repair-windows-10-image.html?ltr=D</span>&nbsp;&nbsp; See option 1 #6</p>
<p>That will repair your image and then you can run the system file check sfc /scannow, which will finish the repair.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as your other issues I can't help you, but the corruption you are referring to is a common thing that I believe is caused by a problem with windows update. I don't believe it's has anything to
 do with something flashed to the SSD at the factory. Simply some file association doesn't match and causes it to be flagged in the system file check.</p>

            Other than what I have posted, I do not recall any more. This was a complex process and my Tech guy, Lee, in the philippines ran everything and created the notes and screen shots I have shared.. &nbsp; your ms tech should be able to figure it out &nbsp; &nbsp;good Luck!!!

<h2>            Someone changed my Gamertag</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Recently I was online playing a game when i was signed out for no reason. &nbsp;When I tried to sign back in it said my account was not valid. &nbsp;My kids said that it showed me online so I was on the phone with xbox support within 10 minutes. &nbsp; I told them someone
 had control of my account. &nbsp;While I was on the phone with them the person changed my gamertag and we only new this because they were &nbsp;still showing online on my kids friend list. &nbsp; Anyway they locked my account and I was without live for almost 3 weeks before
 they notified me by email that my passport was reset and I could regain my account. &nbsp; In the email it said that I would be refunded any charges that were done while account was out of my &nbsp;control and I would be able to restore my gamertag or be allowed one
 name change.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; When I tried I was unable to restore my gamertag and when I called xbox support they told me once this happens I cannot have the gamertag back ? &nbsp;Nobody has it and I paid for this gamertag for 8 years is there anyway to get it back ?</p>

<p>So it's been three weeks since the GT was changed, then? I know that in some cases you can re-claim those tags after they've been unused after some time, but if it's been three weeks, I'm afraid you may need to choose a new tag.

<p>Hey mate, it's not that we're not 'giving' the tag back as much as it is that it's locked up in the system. The investigation team provided you points to change your account, but I don't believe they're at liberty to say what GTs are available. It sounds
 like you will need to create a new one, unfortunately. </p>

<br />
&nbsp;Thank you for your reply back!<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Sorry I have been out and unable to reply!&nbsp; Are you able to uninstall/install QuatroPro?&nbsp; I would suggest trying the steps below and when finished try again to see if you can access QuatroPro.

<p>Hi Wendy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The performance of your device after installing the Windows Update can be due to the changes in its configuration and/or broken system files. To better understand your concern, we'd like to know the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>If pressing the Windows key launches the Start menu on your device.</li><li>The version and build of Windows 10 that you're device is using after installing the update. To check this, you can perform the following:
<ol>
<li>Press the Windows key + R.</li><li>In the pop-up window, type winver, and then press Enter.</li></ol>
<p>
</p></li></ul>
<p>In the meantime, we'd recommend <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
starting Windows 10 in safe mode</a> to isolate your concern. This will run the operating system (OS) in a basic state where it'll use a limited set of files and drivers. Based on the details that you've shared, we'd recommend going through the From the sign-in
 screen section of the article.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you're on safe mode, you can perform the following to check the status :</p>
<ol>
<li>Right-click the Start menu, and then select Device Manager.</li><li>Collapse all categories and verify the status of the drivers. They are usually marked with exclamation points. If you see any driver marked with it, proceed to step #3.<br />
</li><li>Right-click on the driver, and then select Properties.</li><li>In the Driver tab, click Update Driver. If no update is available, check the manufacturer's website. Please also note if Roll Back Driver is lit.</li><li>Follow on-screen prompts.</li><li>Restart your device.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

    <title>Taskbar Network Status Icon Shows Incorrect status - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wmconey  say:</h3>
<h2>            Taskbar Network Status Icon Shows Incorrect status</h2>
                    
<p>Just an irritant, I know, but: at some&nbsp; point the taskbar has begun showing the wrong status icon. It shows a row of empty bars with what looks to be a yellow burst in front. I think this is the icon notice for connecting, but I am in fact successfully connected.
 Any way to reset?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>I think The yellow 'Burst' may be a warning icon, informing you of some problem with the connection. Click on it to see if you get a message about not being able to connect to the internet or some other error.</p>

<div><b>Best idea is to re-download and re-install the Steam Client so you know that is good. Then verify the game cache via you're Steam Client for each of the games you have. If Steam finds any files missing it will re-download them. You may as well delete
 the game icons on your Desktop as they are corrupt and they only make you're PC boot slower. You're games are still available from you're Steam library anyway.</b></div>
<div><b>I upgraded to 8.1 with the Steam Client and my games installed and it didn't cause any problems at all.</b></div>

<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>You might have</span><span> to run a forced check disk from the Windows Recovery</span><span>Environment</span><span>
 (WinRE)</span><span>. To run ‘chkdsk’ from Windows Recovery<span>Environment</span></span></span></p>

 the computer restarts, repeat steps 1 through 4 for the other volume, and then rerun the backup operation.&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Step 3:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>After you have run the check disk for your computer, check if you are able to boot to the desktop in normal. Download the Symantec Removal tool and remove the antivirus
 completely and reboot again.</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Now try to reboot to normal mode and check what happens. Also re-install the antivirus software, also check for related updates for the same.</span></span></p>

<p>I would first feel better if I were more confident your system is reasonably malware free, then I would review your XP startup items (instructions follow) and locate and deal with the offensive startup entry.</p>
<p>What you will be looking for in startup items is going to be a double quote", two double quotes "" or an "empty" startup item. &nbsp;XP can't figure out what to do with these things and tries to start something that really doesn't make sense. &nbsp;You can find it
 though. &nbsp;It might be something that needs double quotes around it but doesn't have them. &nbsp;If you can't see it, we'll do it another way.</p>
<p>I usually apply these instructions where there is a specific startup item that doen't make sense and it is accompanied by some curious looking file name, but using some common sense, you can find your bogus startup entry (double quote, single quote, empty,
 etc.) and disable it, test and then delete it when you are sure it is working. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is one MS article to get you started so you will know what you are looking for:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=170086" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=170086</a></p>
<div>If you are not sure about something, please ask. &nbsp;You will find it though.</div>
<p>Download, install, update and do a full scan with these free malware&nbsp;detection programs:</p>
<p>Malwarebytes (MBAM): &nbsp;<a href="http://malwarebytes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://malwarebytes.org/</a></p>
<p>SUPERAntiSpyware: (SAS): &nbsp;<a href="http://www.superantispyware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.superantispyware.com/</a></p>
<p>They can be uninstalled later if desired.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now my general purpose directions for removing bogus startup items left over from a malicious software removal. &nbsp;It applies to your opening the folder on every startup situation too:</p>
<p>Describe your current antivirus and anti malware situation: &nbsp;McAfee, Norton, Spybot, AVG, Avira!, MSE, Defender, ZoneAlarm,&nbsp;PC Tools, Comodo, etc.</p>
<p>A "Cannot find...", "Cannot start..., "Cannot load...". "Could not run..." Cannot run" "Error loading..." or&nbsp;"specific module could not be found" message at startup is usually related to malware that was set to run at startup but&nbsp;the referenced file(s) has
 been deleted after a malware scan leaving behind a registry entry or startup item pointing to a file&nbsp;that does not exist. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It could be from a malicious software removal or an uninstalled application. &nbsp;The entry may have a curious&nbsp;looking name since it was probably generated at random when the malware was installed. If you search your system for the referenced file,&nbsp;you may not
 even find it.</p>
<p>Windows is trying to load this file but cannot locate it since the file was mostly likely removed during a scan&nbsp;for malicious software. However, an associated orphaned startup parameter or registry entry remains and is telling&nbsp;Windows to load the file when
 you boot up or login.</p>
<p>You need to remove the referenced entry so Windows stops trying to run the file. It may or may not be in the&nbsp;registry. &nbsp;Autoruns (see below) will find the item no matter where it is. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you just locate and uncheck the item in msconfig, that disables the item but does not remove the reference to&nbsp;the bogus startup item from your computer. &nbsp; The msconfig program is not a startup manager, it is a troubleshooting&nbsp;tool. &nbsp;Disabling things in
 msconfig to put a stop to the messages and thinking your problem is resolved is short&nbsp;sighted and leaves behind a sloppy XP configuration. &nbsp;I would not count disabling a startup item as a "solution" to the problem.</p>
<p>If you are comfortable editing the registry you can search for and remove the reference from or remove it using a&nbsp;popular third party tool called Autoruns. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Before making any changes to your registry by hand or with third party tools, be sure to make a backup of the registry&nbsp;first. There is no undo or quit without saving option in regedit.</p>
<p>Here is a link to a popular registry backup tool:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.snapfiles.com/get/erunt.html</a></p>
<p>Autoruns does not install anything on your computer. &nbsp;It will display all of the startup locations where the reference&nbsp;might be so you can disable it or delete it completely. &nbsp;Here is the download link for Autoruns:</p>
<p><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</a></p>
<p>Launch Autoruns.exe and wait for it to finish populating the list of entries.</p>
<p>When Autoruns is finished scanning your system, it will say "Ready" at the bottom left corner. &nbsp;Autoruns can be a&nbsp;little intimidating at first if you have never see it before since it displays a lot of information. &nbsp;You are really&nbsp;only interested in a couple
 sections.</p>
<p>The problem item is usually in the usually the system startup or user startup entries so click the Logon tab&nbsp;and locate the entry.</p>
<p>Scroll through the list and look for a startup entry related to the file(s) in the error message.</p>
<p>If you don't find it in the Logon tab, look for it in the Everything tab.</p>
<p>Right-click on the offending entry and choose to delete it. &nbsp;If you are not sure what it is, you can just disable it,&nbsp;reboot and if the issue is resolved, then delete the offending entry. &nbsp;If you don't see it in Autoruns you may&nbsp;have to edit the registry
 and remove the item from the Startup folder there. &nbsp;Autoruns should display the same&nbsp;information though.</p>
<p>Since you had or have an infection, follow up with this:</p>
<p>Perform some scans for malicious software, then fix any remaining issues:</p>
<p>Download, install, update and do a full scan with these free malware detection programs:</p>
<p>Malwarebytes (MBAM): &nbsp;http://malwarebytes.org/</p>
<p>SUPERAntiSpyware: (SAS): &nbsp;http://www.superantispyware.com/</p>
<p>They can be uninstalled later if desired.</p>
<p>Reboot your computer and troubleshoot remaining issues.</p>

<h2>            Slow PC due to 100&#37; Disk Usgae</h2>
                    <p>My PC has been working extremely slowly very recently and to figure out the problem I saw the task manager and the disk is always 100% full. Usually used up by Sevcie Host Local Sysytem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried running the sfc /scannow command on my command prompt and the error received was as attached below.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Also i tried to use the drive optimization to defragment and optimize and still the issue is not resolved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also tried the clean boot option and the problem persisted even then.</p>
<p>I have also not been able to update my windows version for a long time now too. The error there is as follows.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Havent been able to resolve this issue too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also after upgrading to windows 8.1 the pc has been encountering major issues in connecting to wifi networks and needs to be troubleshooted on every start up.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for posting your query on this forum with the relevant information regarding the issue. I appreciate the efforts that you have made on this issue. You have now reached the right place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us work together to find the root cause of this issue and try resolving it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to ask few questions regarding these issues on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) What is the make and model of your computer?</p>
<p>2) When exactly do you face the slow performance issue on the computer? Is it – a) always when using the computer irrelevant of the application that you work with, b) only when you start the computer or c) work on any particular application?</p>
<p>3) Do you have any third party security program installed on the computer?</p>
<p>4) What are the recent changes that you have made to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The screenshot that you have included in the query, shows that there are some corrupted/damaged system files which the SFC Scan could not fix. So, in this case let us first try running the “<strong><em>Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM)</em></strong>”
 Tool to fix the System File Corruption and Windows Update Errors</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>Use Deployment Image Servicing and Management to fix the System File Corruption and Windows Update Errors</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>To run the DISM Tool, you may follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Press “<strong><em>Windows Logo</em></strong>” + “<strong><em>X</em></strong>” keys on the keyboard and select “<strong><em>Command Prompt (Admin)</em></strong>” from that menu.</p>
<p>b) On the <strong><em>Command Prompt</em></strong> window, type the following commands, and then press “<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>” after each command.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 31.5pt">
</p><p style="margin-left: 1in"><strong><em>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</em></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 1in">
</p><p style="margin-left: 1in"><strong><em>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</em></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 31.5pt">
</p><p>c) After completing the process, type “<strong><em>Exit</em></strong>” and press “<strong><em>Enter</em></strong>” on the
<strong><em>Command Prompt</em></strong> window to close it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once after running the DISM Tool successfully, try running the SFC Scan again and let us know the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that resolves the system file corruption, you may then check if the issues still persists on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this resolves the issue. <span>&nbsp;</span>Please get back to us with all the relevant information and troubleshooting result.</span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2>            Windows 7 freezes when restarting</h2>
                    I just got my computer yesterday.&nbsp; Everytime I have clicked to restart the computer it freezes and never shuts down and I have to click the power button to shut it down.&nbsp; I have already installed the Microsoft updates as well.&nbsp; The only way to "restart"
 is to do a complete shut down and power back up manually.

 different drivers (Win 7 and Windows 8, 8.1 from the Realtek site. Nothing. &nbsp;Device manager says everything is functioning but Windows 10 Network doesn't see it. &nbsp;

            <p>HI Prabhavathi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried all of the steps you have listed with no luck. On reboot Windows 10 installed a driver from April, 2015, and upon doing the driver update steps you listed, Windows responds with "the best driver is already installed" (or such).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Realtek site has a Win 10 install package that updates the driver to 10.003 as of 8/24/15, but even installing that driver makes no difference, Windows 10 will not use the adapter to connect to the router even though it worked well under 7 SP1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Got any other ideas?</p>

            <p>HI Linney,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC is an HP A6403W. It has an Nvidia chip on the MOBO that handled graphics and ethernet, and Nvidia has no stated plans to update the driver for that chip for W10. &nbsp;So I installed an Nvidia 8400GS graphics card and a Realtek 8111E ethernet card when
 running W7 SP1, and turned off the onboard LAN in the BIOS, so that the ethernet cable from the router now plugs into the 8111E card instead of the MOBO. The PC runs well on W7 SP1 and has no trouble using the 8111E card to download the media tool and W10
 installer very quickly over my FiOS 75MB connection. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the W10 install was done, the internet connection icon shows a yellow caution and states limited connectivity, with no IPv4 or IPv6 connections. It doesn't matter if I try to use whatever driver W10 installed during the upgrade or the W10 install package
 available from Realtek; they both end with the same result - no internet connectivity.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As it happens, I do have an extra USB ethernet connector in my computer parts box, a Realtek RTL8191SU unit, but unfortunately the latest drivers that Realtek has on their site for that unit is for W7 and Vista. The Vista drivers resulted in "limited connectivity"
 where I could log on to the router but not get IPv4 or IPv6 connectivity. When I tried to run the W7 driver installation from Realtek, the installer says "sorry we do not support this operation system !!"</p>
<p>
</p><p>So unfortunately, no joy there either. Good thought though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Got any more of them?</p>

            <p>I have the same issue with my HP Pavilion dvt-4100 and have fallowed all of the steps including applying the latest HP driver and still unable to have the Windows 10 to use the card to access the internet. I also have the same problem with my Intel Wireless-N
 network adapter.&nbsp; Even though Device Manager states that there is no issue and with either adapter but when trying to enable both adapters under Network Connection, neither adapter is enabled to make a network connection. This only happened this past weekend.
 Also under the Network &amp; Internet settings neither wireless nor Ethernet settings are displayed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to have to go back to Windows 7. </p>

Most new machines come with a recovery partition allowing you to go back to the time of purchase, you will have to check your user guides (or the manufacturer's Web Site) for instructions.&nbsp; Choosing that path requires you to save all valuable data first.

            <p>Hey Linney,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't tried the W7 drivers in a compatibility mode yet, but I'll look into that. As I remember the setup for the drivers doesn't offer any options other than the output folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to the Windows 10 pages on MS and looked for compatible USB wireless LAN adapter, and the Belkin F9L1101 is listed there as one of the 16 such "compatible" adapters. &nbsp;So a quick trip to Fry's and $21 later I have the adapter installed, but windows
 says "Code 37 - Windows cannot initialize the device driver for this hardware" in the properties for the new adapter in device manager. Sine the Belkin driver was from 2014, I went to their site and got the latest driver, which does NOT mention W10, and sure
 enough, it had the same issue. So I tried having W10 update the driver, which it did in a heartbeat with a Realtek driver from 2/17/15, and now the Code 37 is gone but still no connectivity. I can logon to the router, but no IPv4 or IPv6 connections, just
 as with the other USB adapter and the 8111E card. So much for Windows Compatibility accuracy! I'm taking the adapter back to Fry's for a refund.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the hidden firewall, remember that I have the onboard LAN disabled in the BIOS, and the ethernet cable is plugged into the 8111E card, not the Nvidia chip. And the ethernet card worked under W7, so the only variable is W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I just looked into the Properties on both adapters, and under Events both state that "device XYZ requires further installation." Again, looking that up on Microsoft's site, it seems like a lot of people have having such issues with W10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Do you have WiFi available and if so does it work at all even if slow.<br />
<br />
It is possible that the card has developed a hardware issue.<br />
<br />
Have you checked for firmware updates for your router? That can be needed<br />
even if other OS are working fine on it.<br />
<br />
Have you tried another cable? <br />
<br />
If possible try another router.<br />
<br />
You may need to try a different compatible adapter.<br />
<br />
Do you have a 3rd party antivirus/security program installed? If so that can<br />
be the cause. Uninstall it and use Windows Defender which in Windows 10<br />
is a full antivirus. Then run its maker's removal tool to prevent trouble</p>
<p>causing remnants.<br />
<br />
Check with HP Support and their forums as their may be known issues. Be<br />
sure you are installing the correct driver for your version of Windows (such<br />
as 32 or 64 bit). Download the file and Right Click on the installable setup.exe<br />
and select Run as Admin.<br />

    <title>.Exe file association lost&#58; need permanent solution - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jasonneedshelp_995  say:</h3>
<h2>            .Exe file association lost&#58; need permanent solution</h2>
                    <p>Around 5-6 months ago, I had an issue concerning an .exe file association. I could not open any programs (sidebar gadgets, skype, msn, etc.). I have searched through many solutions, some of which work.
<br />
I downloaded Microsoft Fix It (MicrosoftFixit50194 from <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950505" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/950505</a>) which is supposed to fix the exe solution. In addition, prior to doing that, I used an .exe file association fix from a website called:
<a href="http://www.winhelponline.com/articles/105/1/File-association-fixes-for-Windows-Vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.winhelponline.com/articles/105/1/File-association-fixes-for-Windows-Vista.html</a><br />
Using the .exe file association fix changed the registry in HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT, exefile's (Default) value data into "Application". Then, following some of the windows support queries, it stated to change the value into "%1" %* .
</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-windows_programs/unable-to-open-exe-files/039ceca1-c81f-4136-8c04-bf13c0378495">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_vista-windows_programs/unable-to-open-exe-files/039ceca1-c81f-4136-8c04-bf13c0378495</a></p>
<p>Then I would use the MicrosoftFixit, restart my computer and then I would wait for maybe 5 minutes, and my programs start loading up. The fix would last for maybe a few weeks and it would come back, I would do the same thing and I would fix it again. It
 has maybe happend 4-5 times over the past few months.<br />
Now, just recently, whenever I restart my computer, the .exe problem arises. Therefore, I would continue to use the current method I am doing and after long time (maybe 30-45 minutes -it's gotten longer because my computer is for some reason slowing down-),
 it would work again (until I open my computer where it would happen again). I need a PERMANENT solution for this .exe problem where I cannnot open any programs. I have system restored but it is still having the problem after each relog in. Thank you for helping.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To reitarate, I need a permanent solution for the .exe file association problem because the problems&nbsp;keeps coming back even if I fix it, after each relog in...Please help</p>
<p>Regards, Jason</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 wifi problems are back in 2017&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> waverlybrian  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 wifi problems are back in 2017&#33;</h2>
                    <p>For a month or so now, my SP3 has been dropping wifi continually, for example every time I try to print or load a webpage on any browser (I get the 'no internet' webpage). Half the time when I click on the wifi symbol in the tray, there are no available
 networks at all and I have to keep clicking on it to get my home network back. The other half the time, my network is right there, but the SP3 isn't connected and isn't even trying to connect (even though "connect automatically" is checked). Sometimes it even
 claims it's 'connecting' to some random network that is not on it's 'known networks' list. It always connects right up again when I manually select my home network, but it loses connection the next time I load a webpage or print! It seems to happen in bouts
 where it will do this continually for some period of time, but other periods it will be fine. The few times I tried it, the problems went away when I rebooted the device, but being a work computer, I can't always do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the Netflix APP somehow rarely experiences problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have lots of other devices that never experience this problem so I don't think it's my router (Netgear Nighthawk AC1900). If I plug in my ethernet-USB adapter to connect a hard link to my router everything works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect a software issue - possibly after some update.</p>
