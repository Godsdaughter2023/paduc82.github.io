<h2>            Printers always has jobs stuck in queue Win10</h2>
                    <p>I am running Win10 on a brand new Asus and constantly have jobs stuck in my HP queue. I tried deleting or stopping them from my printer window. Reinstalled the driver. Made sure I had all my Updates updated. Unplugged printer. Cussed.
</p>
<p>I have tried going into Control Panel - Admin Tools - Services - Print Spooler - Stop and Start</p>
<p>(Sometimes that works.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most of the time&nbsp;a queue just sit there while I twiddle my thumbs. Sometimes it takes a few minutes other times 10, 15, 20 minutes. Sometimes a (stuck) job will then print three times before a second or subsequent jobs will even print.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an HP with Win7 and a Dell with Win8 and both print <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
without</span> issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is an issue causing problems and delays with my business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any answers Microsoft? Anyone else found a solution? </p>

            <p>I am no printer expert but is there a way to reset the queue on the printer, not just delete or refresh?&nbsp; Can you see what is in the queue on the printer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are the other machines in contact with the printer when this happens?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would look at the properties for the printer, and the Admin ones which give you the authority to make changes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;See what settings are being used for such things as Queue and how the system is communicating with the printer.&nbsp; If you compare it with the
 other systems you may find a difference...</p>

<br />
<br />C. Recommendations
<br />
<br />1. Create a system restore point so that if something wrong happens you can revert. 
<br />Type restore point in Cortana Search &gt; Create a Restore point &gt; Check whether against your drive, Protection is ON or not. If not ON, click Configure button below to Make it ON &gt; Now press Create to create a restore point
<br />
<br />2. Your nVidia driver is very new. The driver date is 29-Nov-18. If BSOD started happening after 29-Nov-18, you have two options
<br />Roll back nVidia driver
<br />Go to computer manufacturer's website and see if any driver is released after 29-Nov-18.

    <title>stupid skype password reset - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aidasc  say:</h3>
<h2>            stupid skype password reset</h2>
                    <p>hi,</p>
<p>I've been trying for ages to recover my password for my skype, I do not use my skype email for anything except for skype chat, and as it is an old account I did not set up a phone number with it! my backup email does not work when I am trying to reset the
 password! Skype just doesnt send any codes! So I tried other means,meaning the stupid questions it asks like enter your last email, top 3 contacts and etc. But My skype account is so private I only have 2 or 3 people in it and the Skype user which is the same
 as my outlook and I've forgotten the password for cannot be reset no matter what! I even tried sending a code to a phone number but it does not work so I am blocked from my account number 1!</p>
<p>So i gave up! I made a new account! New skype ID, I updated my skype and now I had to re-enter my credentials, which ofcourse I have forgotten again! when I try changing the password it says this is an old password to anything I enter but none of them open
 the skype! the same thing happened all over again! Even though this time I had registered with my phone number! After going through all the forgot password. Skype got me through hell to reset my skype password, then again asked me to login to my microsoft
 account on pc and I reset all passwords and everything is good now yeah? NOOOOOOOO! I already have the code on my phone! I have done everything else perfectly and when I enter the password to login to my Microsoft wants me to verify my Microsoft account while
 it sends the code to the same account I just reset the password of! what nonsense!!!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the third time I am encountering this problem! SO now thanks to microsft I have 2 or 3 accounts with my face and contacts in while I cannot login to! and I have access to none! Also on the other hand, I have the same phone number for different account
 names and IDs! it is so stupid that I cannot send a code to my phone which I have registered with my account but they send a code to my friend's phone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hate hate hate hate everything about it! I expect when I have the code on my phone and I reset a password it'll be the end of it! Just like any other normal service! Unfortunately, I have to use SKype for an interview as the only means the interviewer
 has offered and I hate my life now because of your stupid stupid inapplicable rules!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 2 years I've put up with this and Now I want all my accounts back! All my contacts back! give back my account! and the fact that your virtual
 help is so stupid is just another whole story that made me miserable!</p>

    <title>Lenovo Yoga 11 in need of Win8 RT or 8.1 RT install USB - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matthewkrehl  say:</h3>
<h2>            Lenovo Yoga 11 in need of Win8 RT or 8.1 RT install USB</h2>
                    <p>I've been having repeated issues with my Yoga 11 including loss of touch screen/touchpad input response. I've tried recovery/repair options, I've run chkdsk /f/r/x, I've exhausted every option with what passes for support at Lenovo. As of my latest attempt
 the support page doesn't even recognize my serial number anymore. While I recognize I will need drivers I think I can use device ID's to get drivers that will work. What I can't seem to find anywhere is an ISO file I could use to create a bootable install
 media. As I understand it I would have to jailbreak the tablet to even be able to use the USB once I made it, but I'm ok with that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any possible way I could get some help in getting the files I need?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, </p>
<p>Matthew</p>

<p>No manufacturer releases Windows RT drivers on the internet.</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t Activate Windows 10 on Windows 7 Dell Laptop - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> denniswish_65  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Activate Windows 10 on Windows 7 Dell Laptop</h2>
                    <p>I installed Windows 10 while in Beta on an old Windows 7 Dell Inspiron M5040 Laptop. The original Windows 7 serial number is located on the bottom of the laptop but it came pre-installed. I made a backup but&nbsp;the installation files&nbsp;were of the installation
 partition files but misplaced them over the last several years. on a separate partition. My Windows 7 was activated at the time I received the Laptop but I have never received a follow up offering me an upgrade to Windows 10. Instead, I was participating in
 the Windows 10 Beta on this Windows 7 machine and also on a newer Dell Laptop that had Windows 8.1 installed (which was purchased this last December). The Windows 8.1 machine updated to Windows 10 and successfully completed the Activation process.&nbsp;However,
 the older Windows 7 M5040 did not recognize the serial number&nbsp;indicated on the bottom of the case&nbsp;and gave me an error code 0xC004C003. I tried calling Microsoft but was told to call Dell who told me to call Microsoft. The other message I received was that
 the Current Product Key was ***** - 8HVX7 yet this does not match the last five digits of the code on the bottom of my laptop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dells service site no longer warranties the laptop and has no records of the operating system that was installed on it when it was purchased. We kept doing a back and forth from Dell to Microsoft and back to Dell again with no help from either. There used
 to be a verification process that could be done by phone. This is no longer available and the process for obtaining a Product Key is confusing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now I'm stuck. I have done a clean&nbsp;install of&nbsp;Windows 10 basically wiping out my C Drive to install the latest version from a USB drive. I can access Windows 10 but&nbsp;can not activate it. I have purchased Windows 7 Home Premium Upgrades for other machines
 that I no longer use and&nbsp;I tried to use these serial numbers without luck. </p>
<p>
</p><p>What steps do I need to take to authorize the serial number listed on the bottom of my laptop so I can activate Windows 10????</p>

</p><p>The only way to activate the free upgrade is by&nbsp;starting with&nbsp;an activated Windows 7 SP 1 or activated Windows 8.1 that is then&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">upgraded</span> not

    <title>Recurrent problems with freezes and incompatibilities with graphic - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidclarkeuk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Recurrent problems with freezes and incompatibilities with graphic card drivers.</h2>
                    <p>Ever since I first loaded Windows 10 on one of our PCs I've had problems with incompatibilities with Nvidia graphic cards.&nbsp; There's usually some counter-intuitive workaround that gets things working again but each update brings a new set of problems or a
 return to the old ones.&nbsp;&nbsp; To add to the frustration the latest update (OS build 16299.64) wiped the update history and so prevented me reverting to the previous state.&nbsp; After at least a week of messing around the system still freezes on startup and intermittently
 during use.&nbsp; It often verges on being completely unusable. &nbsp;</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p><p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I've installed the latest drivers from Nvidia of course. I can make the PC stable by disabling the nvidia drivers but then graphics speed and quality is poor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seriously wonder how the average user is expected to make use of Windows given this level of problems and the complexity of the required fixes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll gladly provide details of this system if required but this problem must be very widespread. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi David,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried installing the driver in compatibility mode or rolling it back to the last good configuration? If you haven't done so, you may follow these steps:
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Roll back driver to the last good configuration</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click the <strong>Start </strong>button and select <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Right-click your Bluetooth driver, select <strong>Properties</strong>, and browse to the
<strong>Driver </strong>tab. </li><li>Press the <strong>Roll Back Driver</strong> option if available, and Windows 10 will begin the process.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Install driver in compatibility mode</strong> </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Right-click on the driver and select <strong>Properties</strong>. &nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li>Select <strong>Compatibility </strong>tab. &nbsp; &nbsp;</li><li>Place a check mark next to <strong>Run this program in Compatibility mode</strong> and select the operating system accordingly from the drop-down list.</li><li>Let the driver install, and then check the functionality.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If rolling back the driver to the last good configuration resolves the issue, you may prevent a driver update from being installed from Windows Update. You may refer to this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2500967/how-to-stop-windows-7-automatically-installing-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft article</a> for more details. The steps also apply to Windows 10. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it turns out. </p>

</p><p class="contentStandard">Rolling back the driver has done nothing to stop the system freezing. &nbsp; It just froze for around a minute for example.&nbsp; The time to display anything after returning from sleep mode is no better either.&nbsp; The display was black for
 1 minute 23 seconds when I timed it restarting just now.&nbsp; It often shows the startup screen after such a delay but will not show the password box for a further period of 30 seconds or so.&nbsp; Sometimes it will then display the password box but not accept keyboard
 input for a further delay.&nbsp; </p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">After a previous update I followed a counter intuitive online suggestion to disable

 and then downloading the latest versions got it this far.</span></p>

            Correction to my earlier post. &nbsp; Disabling Ultra Low Power supply (ULPS) by setting EnableULPS to 0 using Regedit DOES FIX the 100 second startup delay.&nbsp; It seems that each Windows update is setting this back to 1 which may be the clue as to why these
 problems keep recurring.<br />
<br />
The fact remains that a bug that prevents the screen being used without starting in safe mode and which must affect lots of PCs seems to have been there though a whole series of updates.&nbsp; Please can future updates preserve the state of this setting, if Microsoft
 confirm this to be the cause?

<h2>            How to connect to a network printer on a different network</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I have a "normal" netgear router at home, windwos 7 64 and a desktop PC. <br />
<br />
I want to be able to print from home to a network printer elsewhere, so totally not on my network.
<br />
<br />
How can I do this please? Can I just get the Network Printer's ID and connect to it? What do I configure on my desktop to print on this printer?
<br />
<br />
<br />
thank you so much<br />

    <title>Win 10 ver 1511 breaks voice modems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sf-tom  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win 10 ver 1511 breaks voice modems</h2>
                    <p>Starting with the November update, USB voice modems no longer have a Unimodem Full Duplex sound device installed. This is true for both Hiro H60113 and USR 5637 USB&nbsp; modems. Pre-Win 10, ver 1511 a sound device would install in the Sound, video and game controllers
 category. Without the sound device, no telephony application requiring sound, such as an answering machine, can function. Both Hiro and USR have been notified of the problem but is this a Win 10 1511 bug or intentional change? Is there any work around?</p>
<p>
</p><p>January 11, 2016 update:</p>
<p>I spent a couple hours on a Microsoft Help Desk session regarding this issue. A knowledgeable technician tried all sorts of things on my computer, all to no avail. He admitted defeat and has escalated the issue to the next level of support. What is frustrating
 about the situation is that this was first time he has encountered the issue and he found no mention of it in any of his support material. Just because we in the user community document and discuss&nbsp;it here in this forum, there is no guarantee that Microsoft
 sees it. If they don't know about it, they sure won't fix it. I am not even convinced that my support desk session will result in an official bug report to Microsoft. Does anybody know of a more direct and effective way to report a problem to Microsoft?</p>

            Had already done those things but for good measure I did them again. No luck. Using exactly the same drivers and same devices (Hiro and USR), Win 10 pre-1511 installs the Unimodem sound device and with 1511 it does not.

            As a follow up, Hiro has reproduced the problem and forwarded it onto their chip vendor. The problem has also been reported to USR and they are investigating. The subject of the original post is correct; 1511 breaks&nbsp;voice modems, or at least USB voice
 modems.

<h2>            Windows Remote Assistance - Easy Connect not working</h2>
                    I have a desktop and a laptop connected to the same router at home. My laptop is able to use the Easy Connect feature of Windows Remote Assistance just fine, but my desktop gives the "Easy Connect is not available" option after timing out. I ran the Internet
 Connectivity Evaluation tool on both my desktop and my laptop.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>On my desktop, all tests were supported&nbsp;except the UPnP Support Test, which was Not Run. On my laptop, all tests were supported except the UPnP Support Test, which was Not Supported. Both computers give pretty much the same results and I'm wondering where
 the discrepancy is. Would really like to use the Easy Connect feature as it allows the computers to be saved for easy connections later on rather than having to generate a new invitation code each time. How can I solve this issue?</div>

<h2>            Screen Shots to One Drive</h2>
                    Kudos to Windows for creating screen shot images automatically on One Drive. I use screen shots a lot, and since the beginning of time have pasted them into an app like PowerPoint and than saved the image. Often times, I have no use beyond capturing an
 order confirmation in case there is a problem with a vendor. This makes it really, really easy.

<h3> machiavellus  say:</h3>
<h2>            Experiencing DDoS. Not sure who to report to on XBL.</h2>
                    
<p>Sat in a party with a kid while he was talking about how he knows how to DDoS people. Using a program that I won't post the name of, nor will I post where he received his fancy little walk through on how to DDoS as I'd rather not advertise the programs people
 use.</p>
<p>Not quite sure if this is even something I should post here but he literally stopped me from connecting to xbox and my entire internet for a good five minutes and claims to use it to cheat in various online games. The GT would be
<strong>[mod removed]</strong>. My biggest gripe here is someone is using my xbox live service as a way to actually drop my entire internet. Pretty skeevy. Supposing it happens again I'll contact my ISP and see what their policy is regarding private DDoS cases
 like this. But I figured I'd try to give the admins on LIVE a heads-up besides a simple complaint over tampering.</p>
<p>I'm sure there are actually strict rules concerning such tampering. Can someone refresh me on any LIVE policies that apply concerning using the service as an internet terrorism device?</p>

<p>Considering the fellow used LIVE to get my IP via a party connect. And being that his DDoS was aimed at knocking my XBL connection off. Yeah I'd say XBL has a lot to do with it. In fact everything. I never would have come across this guy without meeting
 him in an XBL party. So yes. 100% to do with XBL.</p>
<p>I of course couldn't contact my ISP today as their offices were closed.</p>
<p>Does LIVE really consider this "out of their bounds" when someone is using their service to tamper with other people's ISP primarily to stop them from connecting to XBL and to lag games to give them an upper hand? If so that's good to know and I'll go ahead
 and keep this in mind when it happens in the future. Thanks LIVE. Always a prompt and helpful response.</p>

<p>Sorry, but the fact, that the user threatened you through Xbox Live doesn't make the DoS a Xbox LIVE issue. Especially as it dropped your WHOLE internet connection and not simply LIVE itself. You CAN report him for threatening
 you. However the DoS attack itself is something for the police and your ISP to figure out.</p>
<p>The DoS tool the person used doesn't use the LIVE System for the attack. The attacker could have gotten your IP address by chatting with you via ICQ or other direct connections between you.</p>
<p>To make a stupid car analogy: It's just like a Gangsta driving next to you in a Chrysler and threatening to "bust a cap in yo [synonym for donkey]". Is Chrysler to blame for the fact that he threatened you from within the car?
 Or would you complain to <a href="http://www.tomtom.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">TomTom</a> for providing the Gangsta directions to your place so he could threaten you there?</p>
<p>No. In that case you go to the police and let them handle that.</p>
<p>And that is what you need to do here, too. The attacker simply used your LIVE connection to find your IP, as this was the currently active service that connected you to his network. He could have used any other means to find
 your IP if he really had the knowledge instead of going the Script Kiddie route and only use readymade tools. The following DoS attack could also happen without Xbox LIVE.</p>
<p>To sum it up: As quickly as possible report the attack with EXACT TIME AND DATE to your Internet Provider and contact the police. Report the Gamertag through the console's reporting feature for his threatening behaviour.</p>

<p>I'm confused then.</p>
<p>They're worried about pirating obviously. That makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>And worried about modding. To the point that they ban accounts fairly regularly for using mods.</p>
<p>Profanity and vulgarity is also a bannable offence with possible penalties and yet, it's unlikely that they'll take action against someone who specifically told me personally and a full party that he was intentionally lagging people off XBL?</p>
<p>I mean it's someone intentionally using XBL to stop someone ELSE from using their XBL. I'm not saying I expect LIVE admins to flip out and try to prosecute some packet kiddie for trying to overload my connection.</p>
<p>I'm saying SURELY there are penalties for such behavior. If this kid wants to start a criminal harassment case with me I'll cross that bridge when I come to it. But as of this very moment I feel as though I was harassed unjustly and I know for sure the user
 in question broke the LIVE TOS. And I was personally curious as to how the LIVE staff would approach such a thing. My own PERSONAL experience aside, I watched the person in question lag anyone he wanted to out of the party at his own call. I watched him lag
 a game almost entirely out.</p>
<p>It's clearly more than an isolated incident and in a world where some people are likely to "just keep their mouths shut" about things like this. Sometimes you'll never know if the support and staff team of a corporation is willing to handle their business
 unless you get the word out there that there's a problem at hand.</p>
<p>But it's all good. As far as name and shaming goes. Yeah I'll do it all day. If you willingly cheat and play a game unfairly on purpose why wouldn't I want to share your name with other people opposed to cheating? Haven't you ever heard of black balling?
 Is this community HONESTLY opposed to revealing GTs that are OBVIOUSLY violating the live TOS?</p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>You're too much focusing on Xbox LIVE itself. The attacker brought down your INTERNET CONNECTION. As the LIVE service runs on that very same internet connection, the DoS also kills your Xbox LIVE.</p>
<p>Let's say the guy threatened via Xbox LIVE to blow up your house or cut the powerline to the house. With your house blown to pieces or power cut, you
<p>So, the only thing that falls into the Enforcer's jurisdiction is the threats he gave you through Party Chat. The DoS attack was done outside the Xbox LIVE system, it just happened to disturb the LIVE service, too, because the
 disruption of another necessary service: Your Internet connection.</p>
<p>[quote user="Machiavellus"]</p>
<p>I mean it's someone intentionally using XBL to stop someone ELSE from using their XBL.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>No, they are not using Xbox LIVE to stop someone else from using LIVE. They use a tool, that looks for network traffic, and since those kids wouldn't know an ICMP Packet from a FTP connection, the tool is simply set to look for
 LIVE connections, and gives the Script Kiddie your IP address.</p>
<p>If they had more knowledge, they could have used other means to find your IP address and DoS that. Without ever using Xbox LIVE.</p>
<p>[quote user="Machiavellus"]</p>
<p>I'm saying SURELY there are penalties for such behavior. If this kid wants to start a criminal harassment case with me I'll cross that bridge when I come to it. But as of this very moment I feel as though I was harassed unjustly and I know for sure the user
 in question broke the LIVE TOS.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Okay, you obviously want that guy punished, which is fine and understandable. But see it like this: If you just tell the Xbox LIVE enforcement team, they will look at the conversation, see that he threatened you through LIVE,
 but didn't use any technical flaws of Xbox LIVE itself. It's just that if your Internet Connection goes down, so does your LIVE connection.</p>
<p>So the offender gets a slap on the wrist, a few days ban for threatening you, and thats it.</p>
<p>As a DoS Attack is illegal in most countries, you can go to the Police, whi then drive to that kid's house, ring the bell, tell the mother of the kid that he has broken the law, the parents are shocked, the kid gets lead to the
 police car while the neighbours can watch this thing happen, and will be interrogated. The ISP can press charges for the damage he did, and he might need to pay a hefty sum (or if he's not old enogh) his parents need to pay it.</p>
<p>So what do you choose:</p>
<p>A forum post telling us that some anonymous Gamertag did a DoS Attack on you and giving him a week without LIVE, or...</p>
<p>... have the whole neighbourhood watch that "nice guy from next door" being arrested and led off, with their parents in tears because he did something illegal. Add to the fact, that the parents wouldn't know what a DoS attack
 is, and imagine their son hacking the FBI and stealing all the gold from Fort Knox. All the while neighbours are gossipping and making up all kinds of stories what the kid did to get arrested. And these stories will ruin his live a lot more than a forum post
 telling us, that someone we don't know from somewhere we are not, said something to you.</p>
<p>[quote user="Machiavellus"]</p>
<p>...But it's all good. As far as name and shaming goes. Yeah I'll do it all day.</p>
<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Well as I said above, you're doing it wrong. Telling us here in the forum that ABC did XYZ just makes us all go *shrug* "Yeah, whatever." Seeing your neighbor kid being dragged off in a police car while the parents stand in the
 door with tears in their eyes, will ruin the reputation in the very social context of the kid.</p>
<p>What is more satisfactory to you then?</p>

<p>Machiavellus, totally appreciate where you are coming from, but from a technical perspective from Microsofts point of view its hard to investigate and punish.</p>
<p>Because they aren't "using" the Microsoft service to attack you, the DDOS traffic doesn't go through Microsoft servers or Xbox live itself, it comes from the person(s) carrying out the attack (botnets etc) direct to you, it doesn't go via Microsoft.</p>
<p>So... you report the issue to Microsoft and say "Hey XYZ DDOS'd me", how do they prove it was that person that gamertag?</p>
<p>I'm speculating that they can see and record centrally the ip address of the people in a match at one time, but then they would have to go to each persons ISP and request records to see if they had carried out an attack on you. But... also bear in mind that
 person might not be DDOS'ing from their own machine, they might have triggered a bot net so the traffic comes from lots of other PC's &nbsp;(different ip addresses), so its very hard to prove which is why its for the ISP to investigate not Xbox Live, its hard to
 prove and link to a gamertag.</p>

<p>I understand how you may feel about the outrage of being DDoS'd, but keep in mind that its just a flaw of the INTERNET, not Xbox Live itself. The truly best way to deal with this is to:</p>
<p>-Mute and Block Communications with the offender in question</p>
<p>-Contact your ISP, not microsoft. Ask for assistance which a new IP address can be given to you.</p>
<p>-If needed, contact your local police as DDoS is abosolutely illegal.</p>
<p>-And of course, file a complaint through Xbox Live on their GT, let XBLPET take over from there.</p>

<p>If he was smart, He would be behind a VPN and if you where to involve the police, they would track it back to some other country where the vpn is registered. Your best bet is to not join partys with the same people</p>

            <p>You may be able&nbsp;to find someone selling just the wireless dongle.&nbsp; A brief search didn't locate one for me, however. &nbsp;What I could locate is
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/326246" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/326246</a>, which provides ways to replace damaged Microsoft hardware.&nbsp; The article does mention "Microsoft Wireless USB 2.0 Adapter", but that may not be the same
 device.&nbsp; Anyway, at the top of the "More information" section of that article are the phone numbers.&nbsp; The British English starting point is
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/gp/cu_sc_replace_rrr_master/en-gb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/gp/cu_sc_replace_rrr_master/en-gb</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Otherwise, you can find replacements for the entire&nbsp;package for US $33 on Amazon, where you'll also find a better-rated Logitech set for even less.</p>

<h2>            Input language switch with Super&#43;Spacebar stopped showing the language list window after some update</h2>
                    <p>Hi, i'm using multiple language input (keyboard layouts) and&nbsp;I have become accustomed to using the combination Super(Windows key) + Spacebar to switch the languages.</p>
<p>But after some update, it stopped working as expected. It still switch the language but not show the list (the window at the right side of the screen). But if I tap the spacebar 2 or more times then it shows up.</p>
<p>Sometimes I can see that it showed for a very little time and disappears instantly (its very fast).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like a week ago I did a new clean installation of windows on my PC because of migration to SSD, and the problem is still here, exactly the same problem as in the previous installation. I did not restored any system backup nor settings and not using a Microsoft
 account for login.</p>
<p>It happens on any window, chrome, notepad, games, etc.</p>
<p>My system is Windows 10 Home Single-Language x64</p>
<p>I tried with another USB keyboard to discard a key malfunction.</p>
<p>And there is no other problems. No errors on the event viewer.<br />
</p>
<p>Please help, because I don't know what else I can do to diagnose the problem, the only hypothesis I can think of is that problem was introduced by some update, because it started a random day without any change from my side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here a video demonstrating the problem (I always changing the language using the same key combination, but you can see that not always the black window is shown, but the language is changed anyway):&nbsp;<a href="https://youtu.be/u7MwbHQbnE4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Video</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/u7MwbHQbnE4?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/u7MwbHQbnE4?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>

<p>Hi, here is the information requested:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edition: Windows 10 Home Single Language</p>
<p>Version: 1709</p>
<p>OS Build: 16299.19</p>
<p>
</p><p>--------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have done some tests. First, I tested it on another PC with Windows 10, and it has the same problem. Not mine PC, and it has almost no third party software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I think I have found a more reproducible way to see the problem.</p>
<p>On a fresh start the language list works OK. But starts to fail after you open a file explorer window.</p>
<p>So the steps to reproduce it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start windows, logon, but do nothing more.</li><li>Hold down Super key and press (keydown + keyup) the spacebar, ensure that the language list has appeared and then release the Super key, ensure that the language in the taskbar changed in this moment. Do this about 15 to 20 times to ensure that the behavior
 is consistent. It should be at this time.</li><li>Open a File Explorer window. You can leave it opened or close it or minimize, it doesnt matters.</li><li>Repeat the step 2. You should see some % of fails now. Some times the list will not appear and the language will change on spacebar keydown. It appears to be random, but testing it 15-20 times you should see some cases.</li></ol>
