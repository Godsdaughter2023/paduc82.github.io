<h2>            Microphone distorted, and making noises Windows 10</h2>
                    <pre><p style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1); text-align: justify"><span>Hey Microsoft</span><br /></p><p style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1); text-align: left"><span>I have now been trying to fix my soundcard and it's noises for quite a while, and i feel like I have been trying everything.
I know all things work in Windows 7, but when I started Windows 10, so it works well enough not bad.

My error, is that my microphone makes crazy noices, like distored alot, and when i speak it only send out quack and noise.
I found one that had the error itself, but none have figured out the mistake it seems.

We are talking about a onboard sound device, on a Asus P9X79 LE, which have the Realtek technology. I have already tried to install the newest windows update driver, and even the driver from realteks homepage, and from asus's own driver folder, And nothing have seemed to handle my problem, everything remains the same, a microphone which is distorted as sick, and everything it sends out is quack and noise.

If you any have some ideas on how to fix this, I'd be quite happy.</span></p><p style="color: rgba(33, 33, 33, 1); text-align: left"><span>

            &nbsp;Hi,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Welcome and thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. We appreciate your interest in Windows 10</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This issue might be because of settings related to Microphone.&nbsp; </div>
<div>The issue cab be resolved by making Microphone as the default device and updating the sound card drivers.
<div>Let's ensure that the microphone that you are using is not disabled and is set as default in the computer. Follow these steps to check this:</div>
<div>a. Right click on the volume icon and select “Recording devices”.<br />
b. Now, right click on an empty space and select, “Show disconnected devices” and “Show disabled devices”.<br />
c. Select “Microphone” and click on “Properties” and make sure that the microphone is enabled.<br />
d. You may also check if the microphone that you are using is set as default.</div>
<div>You can also refer to the following link, which has troubleshooting related to “No Sound”.<br />
No sound in Windows (Steps referred in the following link are applicable to Windows 10 as well).</div>
<div>For reference follow the below link by Niranjan. M</div>

            <p>Hey Akheel Achmed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like i stated in my first message, i have tried to install all the different sound card drivers, like i used the newest from REALTEK, and even the one that was placed on the motherboard manufactures. Furthermore it was set to Default last i tried this..
 And yes my microphone is active. </p>
<p>
</p><p>HOW would it otherwise be able to make noise, when i'm listening to the device?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can hear my microphone, getting the input through the Listening to device. But it's distorted, and scratchy... I can make a little of what im saying out.. but it's still like distored, not as if you were only having microphone boost on.. but simply it
 makes scratchy and distorting noises..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tho if i use a USB microphone this won't happen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regard </p>

            <p>I am using a Samson C01U Pro and same thing is happening to me. I tried:</p>
<ul>
<li>merging all audio inputs into one through Realtek</li><li>separating them</li><li>upgrading</li><li>reinstalling</li><li>uninstall and re-install</li><li>unify sample rate to 16 bit 44100hz</li><li>deactivate components (everything except realtek audio output and C01u mic imput),</li><li>giving o removing exclusive control to that device in the options,</li><li>deactivating all sound effects through Realtek and WIN10 control panel</li><li>Setting the mic to 0% (yes, it also distorts and sounds huge)</li><li>Removing any software control over volume (reducing X% all windows sounds when using this as well as in Skype)</li><li>Tried uninstalling ASIO drivers, reinstaling and so on (also affects ASIO)</li><li>Perhaps other coulple of things I forgot already like disable Cortana and everything that might require audio input level control.</li></ul>
<p>and still happens randomly. As a matter of fact I kept an audio test in case you need to listen to how it sounds. It feels more like a change of hardware using the driver. Like if Realtek decided mid-recording to switch from Motherboard to GPU or external
 audio card or front connector or whatever might happen that makes the signal a duplicate and reproduce at the same time. Perhaps it´s a matter of dll´s...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never found an answer, nothing works. It just happens randomly even in the middle of a recording. When it´s not audio distortion, random jumps happen not recording during periods of half a second or so. This makes all other audio recording programs as well
 as Windows 10 useless for audio recording.</p>

            <p>The solution to this problem seems to be moving around. It started <a href="http://feedback.screencast-o-matic.com/knowledgebase/articles/693249-microphone-voice-sounds-low-and-distorted-after" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here </a>and moved to <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/disable-audio-enhancements-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>... and it has moved again!</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can fix the problem of distorted microphone input on Asus computers running Windows 10 by following these instructions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>right-click on the Speaker icon in the bottom right</p>
<p>Select <strong>Recording devices</strong></p>
<p>right-click on the Microphone symbol</p>
<p>Select <strong>Properties</strong></p>
<p>Click on the <strong>Microphone Effects</strong> tab</p>
<p>Check the <strong>Disable Microphone Enhancements</strong> box</p>
<p>Click <strong>OK</strong></p>

<p>One if the biggest fails for Xbox is that you can't share digital downlowded&nbsp;<span>games with immediate family. We have 3 Xbox One consoles in my house(Mine, My Brothers, and My Nephew). If I buy a game and my nephew likes it we have
 to purchase an additional download and a third one if my brother likes it. At $59.99 for new releases it would run us about $180 just so we can play together. I mean ya we can put our accounts on each others systems and download the games but the moment the
 original buyer turns on their system everybody gets kicked off. They don't even have to play that particular game, they can be on YouTube.</span></p>

<p>You have to buy 3 copies of a physical game too , no? how is it any different?</p>
<p>And by the way 2 consoles in the same house hold can share digital games and play the game together at the same time. The person that buy's the game on their console would have to make the other console their home console example : you download the game
 on your console and then sign into your brothers console and then go to settings and check the box that says make this my console and then DL the game again. Now be careful because you can only do this 3 times per year. Also if XBL is having issuse when your
 set up you have to go to play offline in the settings or you will be unable to play on your xbox.</p>

<p>actually you can share your whole digital libary with 1 other person, by making thier console your home console, so if you wanted to share your games with your brother you can by making his console your home console, but your nephew would be required to
 purchase the games, you can change the home console 3 times a year, so your best option would be to make your brothers console your home console and your console your brothers home console and purchase all your nephews games on disc.</p>

<p>Money hungry made me laugh. Even if Microsoft was willing to give away multiple copies, I believe the publishers would have a problem with it. Could you imagine Activision s reaction to M.S. giving you, your brothers (Maybe you have six? Lol.), and nephew
 a copy of Black Ops III for price of one?</p>
<p>It's why I believe the original "vision" about the family share (Buy one get ten FREE!) was NEVER going to happen; even if M.S. offered their published games...</p>
<p>Now lets talk about that money hungry Harley Davidson dealer...don't they understand I want free bikes for my brothers, nephews, and nieces, without actually paying for them?</p>

            Hi PatThorne1 
<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />Most likely you are using a different ID to login. You need to use your Skype ID not mail ID to login to Skype. Microsoft has been moving all to a single Microsoft Account based services including Skype. Hence, a new Skype ID seems to have been given to you on the basis of your Microsoft Account. So, when you use your mail ID to login, it gets into new Skype ID. Your Microsoft account, in this case, gets 2 Skype IDs attached - this new ID which is default now and your old Skype ID. 
<br />
<br />Just use your old Skype as user name. 
<br />
<br />If you want - You can transfer Skype Credits and Contacts to your new account

            Hi Pat
<br />
<br />Has your Skype Name (Skype ID) changed to something like live: . . .
<br />
<br />If so, if you had an old Skype account with something more friendly, all old Skype accounts are being updated to the new ID system and at the moment, it is not possible for us to change that new Skype Name
<br />
<br />This is one of the most requested features in Skype, so hopefully Microsoft are going to give us the option to change out Skype Name soon . . .

<p>You would have to pay to change your name twice. You would have to first change the gamertag to a different name, then change it again to the way you want it.</p>
<p>The system doesn't see upper and lower case as making gamertags unique. So if you try to change it directly it will show the name as being taken already.</p>

<p>@PhD - There are only 2 ways to get a free name change. 1) a forced name change 2) If the system created a random gamertag for you you are given a free name change, but it can only be used in the first 30 days of the account. So the OP would have to pay.</p>

    <title>Disabling File and Print sharing enables Windows Firewall - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> erikjr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disabling File and Print sharing enables Windows Firewall</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Disabling File and Print sharing enables windows firewall and vice versa</p>
<p>
</p><p>The goal is having File/Print sharing AND Windows firewall disabled at the same time. If I disable File and Print share on my home or public domain, it enables windows firewall. If I then turn off windows firewall , it re-enables File and Print Sharing.&nbsp;
 It's a little frustrating as I manage my own security policy via a Cisco ASA and have no need for File/Print share. Alternatively, if I go into services and disable the firewall entirely, I can disable file/print share and save, but when I refresh , it was
 automatically re-enable after saving it.&nbsp; I have also tried to restore the firewall to the default policy as mentioned in other threads, but to no avail.

            <p>You can always partition the hard disk after installing Windows 7;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a large hard disk installed in your computer, you can split it up and create small partitions. This can be handy for backing up your data safely from the system drive where Windows is installed. The key advantage to this is, when you are reinstalling
 Windows, you can just reinstall on the system drive. Although I still strongly recommend you do a thorough backup of your data, partitioning also allows you to simply backup just the data drive.</p>
<p>Lets take a look at how to create a simple partition in Windows 7:</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image88.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f02%2fimage_thumb88.png" height="232" width="428" /></a></p>
<p>Click Start, right click Computer then click <strong>Manage</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image89.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f02%2fimage_thumb89.png" height="405" width="563" /></a></p>
<p>Expand <strong>Storage </strong>then click <strong>Disk Management</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image90.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f02%2fimage_thumb90.png" height="246" width="519" /></a></p>
<p>Select System Drive, where Windows 7 is installed, usually labeled <strong>C:</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image91.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f02%2fimage_thumb91.png" height="394" width="524" /></a></p>
<p>Right click it and click <strong>Shrink Volume</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image92.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f02%2fimage_thumb92.png" height="109" width="404" /></a></p>
<p>Preparing to Shrink the hard disk</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image93.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f02%2fimage_thumb93.png" height="331" width="489" /></a></p>
<p>When the Shrink dialog appears on screen, click in the <strong>Enter the amount of space to shrink in MB
</strong>field<strong>. </strong>As you can see, the default recommendation is 9,690 MBs which is 9.6 GBs. I want something a little smaller, so I will enter
<strong>3690 </strong>which is <strong>3.6 GBs. </strong>Depending on the size of your drive you can choose a different size. After entering the amount, click
<strong>Shrink </strong>the<strong> </strong>button</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image94.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f02%2fimage_thumb94.png" height="160" width="531" /></a></p>
<p>The partition we just created will now appear as <strong>Unallocated. </strong>
We need to prepare it for use.</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image95.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f02%2fimage_thumb95.png" height="265" width="543" /></a></p>
<p>Right click it and click <strong>New Simple Volume…</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/image96.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fnotebooks.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com%2fwp-content%2fuploads%2f2011%2f02%2fimage_thumb96.png" height="370" width="474" /></a></p>
<p>This will start the new simple volume wizard. Click <strong>Next</strong></p>

<p>If you want, you can further reduce the size of the partition you just created and create an even smaller partition. Click
<strong>Next</strong></p>

<p>You can browse it and copy files to and from it just like any normal volume. If you want, you can go back to Disk Management, and create even smaller partitions from it using the same instructions.</p>

    <title>A Case for Microsoft to start listening to it&#39;s users&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michealkinney  say:</h3>
<h2>            A Case for Microsoft to start listening to it&#39;s users&#33;</h2>
                    <p><strong>My case in a nutshell</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to make a case for Microsoft to start listening to it's users! I am not the first to propose that Microsoft does not listen and I am certainly not the last to vent about it. I hope you will join in the debate. Thanks for reading in advanced.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>A message to Microsoft:</strong></p>
<p>Microsoft, many people have asked the same question and you don't listen. You have advocates and moderators that will brush off every concern and feed a garbage cookie cutter response. If someone poses a question you don't like, you lock the thread and disable
 Reply. You are unethical by nature Microsoft, it must just be in your blood because I have no other answer for it but greed. And before you try your stupid little mediated response and rebuttal, consider it doesn't always require a technical fix, in most cases
 simply informing customers of changes you made would be enough, but you don't. What you will not do is take responsibility and address problems YOU have caused, and time YOU have wasted of ours.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Class Action Lawsuit? Where do I sign?</strong><br />
<br />
I mean, if Microsoft doesn't want to listen to it's users, we have the right to sue for services not rendered and loss of work. How many hours has debugging Windows issues caused us? And how much does a Windows License cost? If you take just a small percent
 of the 1 billion Microsoft Users, say one million and each counted as a $100 claim (and that's just the OS cost, not maintenance which is poor, the cost of a tech's time, frustration, anguish. Just $100 for a small group would be a $100,000,000 payout. And
 all I want is Microsoft to do its job ethically and not with such shady practices, such as forcing updates that break things without informing their users. There software is fundamentally flawed and the problem isn't inherently a technical one. I for one am
 tired of it.<br />
<br />
<strong>Windows 10 Update Removed Remote Server Administration Tools</strong><br />
I can understand compatibility issues being the cause and need to remove the RSAT, that's not the problem to me. The problem to me is that they removed them without asking or informing that they were gone. Instead, techs are screwed when they need to do something
 and the tools are not there. Microsoft pushes updates that break things and don't care. It's stupid and unethical, not to mention they are obviously not testing everything. And besides, someone developing the updates or fixes knows that the RSAT will be removed/uninstalled
 so it's their fault for being utterly useless in transparency. The resolution to this is not technical, it's simply informative. I would not have had a problem if say after the update procedure I got met with a notification of changes made to my system.. like
 a splash page stating what software was removed and a link to install an updated version. There are several other issues that the latest updates break and Microsoft does not care, and as consumers of their products we shouldn't stand for such horrible standards.
 You can't not care in a commercial world and expect there not to be consequences, there's reasons why people heavily advocate against Microsoft. I have been a user of all Microsoft software for most of my life, I know the work that has went into it, and love
 certain software (like Microsoft Office which is worlds superior to Open Source equivalents if you need advanced features) but F*** YOU MICROSOFT!</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What is the fundamental problem and/or solution?</strong></p>
<p>Current Windows updates broke several Sysprep and automation features, it broke certain programs from operating, it removed software without warning. They should be required to give notice, it's the simplest solution and quite frankly obvious and ethical.
 You have to do it for everything else in life and often it's a legal requirement. Furthermore, if they, Microsoft, get a negative question or review, they lock replies. No one who has been wronged can get help with their problem and Microsoft just turns a
 blind eye to its users in need. It's their software and they are breaching the terms of it, not to mention fiduciary duty, they are required to offer a level support and a level of communication.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>A message to readers.&nbsp;</strong><br />
I can't even come close to covering the grounds required in my frustration and countless hours lost to "resolving" issues created by Microsoft. Besides, I'm quite angry at the disregard Microsoft has at this point and this article is the most level headed I
 could be at this point. Plus, I needed to vent and this gave me a chance to do that. I'm not sure what to expect and whether this article will be removed, blocked, or if people will even reply but lets see. At some point I think you have to get fed up, don't
 you? Please leave your story (either good or bad) about Microsoft making a case whether they do, or do not listen. If the discussion gets removed, I will simply repost it. And if there is an open class action, please let me know because until Microsoft wants
 to even start a discussion a roadmap to resolving countless issues, they to me are unsympathetic dirtbags that can rot in hell. And before you ask the stupid question, yes it's gotten to that point, and I am angry. As should you be.<br />

<p>Real Microsoft employees rarely, if ever, visit these forums so it is unlikely they'll see your rant.</p>
<p>If you want real change to happen provide thoughtful suggestions via the Feedback app in Windows 10 or at the UserVoice website.</p>
<p>These forums are just peer-to-peer, so we have no influence on decisions made on the products that Microsoft produces.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Perhaps you didn't think this through, but it seems ironic that someone who has given examples of the
<em>many</em> threads here where people have complained about Microsoft in one way or another thinks that one more will have a salient effect.&nbsp; It won't, in part for the reasons given by Solar-Eclipse, but also because (a) the idea of class actions against
 MS has become tiresome and completely impotent at this point, (b) what seems to be the primary source of your angst (removal of RSAT and other Sysprep tools) is misplaced in these consumer-oriented forums (that's what the MS
<a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/forums/en-us/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Technet forums </a>are for) and (c) it still seems to me that in a population of <a href="http://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-installed-base-hits-500-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
&gt;500 million Windows 10 installations</a>,&nbsp; bad things can't possibly be as widespread as some people seem to think they are.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, I don't begrudge you your opportunity to vent.&nbsp; Just don't expect anything other than a possible reduction in your blood pressure to result from it.</p>

            The first two responses, in my opinion, are funny because they miss the point entirely. Nowhere did I mention that I expect my rant to make a noticeable impact. I was very frustrated with Microsoft this morning and I'm sure it won't be the last. I've exhausted
 other avenues of feedback to Microsoft and I do agree with you on most points. I do not agree that problems are not widespread however, just that most people have learned to deal with issues, work around them or just stay quiet. End users do it all the time,
 if you go out of your way to ask you'll realize many people have the same issue but they just accepted it. That's pretty sad to me, we simply "accept" Windows and make excuses for them because there aren't real alternatives and it "doesn't seem that bad",
 so we brush it off. I don't think you're wrong though and I've made the same excuses, I work in an large enterprise environment and have to support users. But none of the excuses make it anything better. It is what it is perhaps, we

<p>I think it's closer to the truth that many people (perhaps not most) haven't learned to deal with anything.&nbsp; Read through the fourth thread you linked to.&nbsp; The thread is littered with woefully ignorant people who absolutely refused to listen to reason and
 whose problems were most likely self-inflicted in one way or another.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Although I have no real way of knowing whether I'm typical or not, I've never had
<em>any</em> problems with Windows 10 other than the Fall Update (the first full "feature" update of Windows 10) refusing to install.&nbsp; I had to do an uneventful&nbsp; clean install to get it done, which I would have done at some point anyway.&nbsp; I think that of the
 half-billion or so installations thus far, I probably am fairly typical.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Many people seem to forget the manifold problems attendant upon the introduction of the beloved Windows XP.&nbsp; Service Pack 2 was a debacle on a grand scale, and it wasn't until Service Pack 3 (some
<em>seven years</em> after XP was released) that things really settled down.&nbsp; </p>

            Installation and adoption is one thing, support is another. Keep it civil man, I respect your opinion so please respect mine. I work for government, I work in a large enterprise environment. So what message is that, that people use Windows? That Windows
 comes pre-installed? That governments exclusively employee large Microsoft contracts? No, I think I do get it, doesn't mean THEY listen.

<p>Try to go back to Windows 95, 2000, Windows ME.. we've learned to deal. I work with a lot of machines and I've been building deployment images for years. I've had several machines repeatedly fail on updates, I've had many county software stop working after
 updates and rolled back and deferred updates as long as I could, I've had a bunch of users complain about their machine slowing down after updates, I've had shadow copy/previous version issues, I've had issues with sysprep practically stop working, and today
 I had an issue where RSAT (Remote Server Administration Tools) uninstalled itself without warning after an update. It's a non-technical issue, plain and simple, I should be notified if something is going to be uninstalled from a system. A simple splash screen
 with what changes were made would be great. Just don't uninstall something I need on a daily basis, to have me "find out" when I need it. I am an end user sure, but moreover I'm support as well and there are enough problems not being resolved or listened to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's interesting though, all the responses at this point seem one sided, standing up for Microsoft. I guess there's a lot of fanboys, but it is after all a Microsoft forum. And the issues I speak of are issues I've personally had within the last year, so
 I know there are a lot more like me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your input, and again like I've responded before, I'm like you.. I tell people, "oh, yeah, that's just a Windows quirk. Just reboot." Re-install a "clean" copy of Windows and that will resolve the "bug". At some point I guess I just got to the
 overwhelming point to where one more "excuse" of **** support and broken software by updates broke this camels proverbial back.</p>

<p>I get your point, but I don't consider "fan boy" an insult. I'm a fanboy of certain Microsoft software, namely Microsoft Office for professions is much better than any open source alternative or Google Docs in my opinion, and I'm also a Linux fanboy. I realize
 I am being harsh to Microsoft but I mean no I'll will towards any individual, especially if you took the time to respond.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My points are still valid and no one has addressed a single one but I guess in "your defense", you are right that this is more a user forum. Many of my issues as an end user wouldn't be an issue but several are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for your comment "<span>Being rational in an irrational world has its price, I guess", I'm not sure I understand. Are you saying you are rational and the world is irrational, because I don't think that is the case and
 stating that one person is rational over another is naive&nbsp;because it's by definition an opinion. But I digress, it's not a philosophical&nbsp;debate. Lol.</span></p>

<h2>            when scrolling or paging down, cursor keeps jumping back to top of page &#40;occurs in all programs including email, words, etc.&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>While I&nbsp; am working in an application program, it seems that some keystroke(s) (shortcut keys I am not aware of and not&nbsp;intending to use?) cause my cursor to jump back to the top of the page and get stuck there;&nbsp;when I scroll or page down to go to the point
 where I want my cursor to be to continue working and entering text or data, it won't let me do it; it jumps back to the top of the page.&nbsp; Simualtaneously, if I try to solve the problem by doing CTRL+G to go to a certain page, the view goes to very large print&nbsp;(over
 100%) as soon as I hit CTRL and that's all that happens.&nbsp;&nbsp; It happens a lot in Word and when it happens there, it also does it in my email application&nbsp;and Internet Explorer&nbsp;and Windows Explorer.&nbsp; I havde printed&nbsp;the list of keyboard shortcuts to see if I can
 detect what I am&nbsp;doing when typing that could cause this to happen, but so far I have not been able to find out what it could be.&nbsp; I do not see any description of this type of behavior associated with any shortcut key; and&nbsp;I am not sure which keystrokes are
 causing it (by the time it&nbsp;starts occurring &nbsp;I don't remember what&nbsp;keystroke I&nbsp;used perhaps inadvertently).&nbsp; Someone in my support team at the university suggested it might be my mouse; I changed mouse and the same thing happened.&nbsp; The only thing is that I
 have not seen it appearing is when I use the keyboard roller ball to navigate (not the mouse); since I ususally only dispense with the mouse when doing email away from home, I am not even sure it won't happen that way either.&nbsp; Ia m at a loss; it's very annoying
 since I have to shut down the file I am working on to stop the behavior; and sometimes it won't even do it, I have to log off,<br />

Thank you for visiting the Microsoft Answers community forum.<br />

I am going to include links to articles that show you all the possible short cut keys that you could be inadvertently hitting to create this behavior.&nbsp; If none of these prove to be the issue, you might check your laptop manufacturer's web site as they sometimes
 have proprietary software installed on the laptops that is seperate from the operating system.<br />

<h2>            After Windows Update, Windows 10 OS Fails to Load</h2>
                    <p>Hello community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my issue and my specs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AMD A10-7860k Radeon R7</p>
<p>3.6 GHz Using Sata</p>
<p>A68HM-E33 V2 MSI</p>
<p>
</p><p>so, after the most recent update my CPU will no longer boot past the windows loading screen. I will be taken to a "windows offline defender" scan, after being prompted that windows is preparing to make repairs. Even after the scan and the apparent "repairs"
 my OS is still failing to load. Is there any way to get into safe mode or to resolve this problem? Stuck at the windows emblem with the spinning dots every time. Cannot get to sign in. Cannot get to safe mode. (that i know of) Please help!</p>
                </div>

<p>Basically you need to crash out of Windows booting 3 times to enter the WinRE (Windows Recovery Environment)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Start your System, then just after the Manufacturers logo disappears and Windows 10 tries to boot, press and hold the power button down for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a hard shut down<br />
<br />
<strong>Do this Twice</strong><br />
<br />
On the third boot attempt, Windows will boot into the Windows 10 Repair Environment, from there you can access Startup Recovery, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.<br />
<br />
Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - System Restore, see if you have a recent restore point you can revert to<br />
<br />
If you do not have a recent restore point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Startup Settings, click restart.<br />
Upon restart press 4 to boot into Safe Mode, if you can get into Safe Mode, backup your data, reboot and see if your system boots normally<br />
<br />
If all this fails go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC, choose to keep all your files and Apps<br />
This will re-install Windows 10 whilst keeping your data and applications<br />

            Unfortunately, the entire process is not working. I cannot get my CPU to boot up to the repair environment. No matter what I do, the only thing it boots up into is windows offline defender, then after that becomes stuck at the windows emblem with the spinning
 dots.

<p>Why are you using Bootcamp on an MSI?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need to use Windows 10 Installation Media to get into the Recovery Environment, if you do not have Windows 10 Installation Media,&nbsp;<span>Media Click&nbsp;</span><span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>HERE</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;to
 download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 4GB) using that tool or create the ISO file
 which you can later burn to DVD</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Then insert the Installation Media, boot from it and choose 'Repair this PC', the repair will probably fail, that will then allow you to enter the Recovery Environment!</span></p>

<p>DaveM - there seemed to be an error in my system registry that had developed, or been planted there intentionally. I was able to get to my OS and save the files that I wanted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After running a registry optimization though, my OS would recurringly again fail to load. What I did was use the Flashboot to install a new version of Windows 10 Pro. However, I have now realized that I do not have a windows 10 pro product key, therefore
 I cannot activate. How big of a problem is this? One thing that I have noticed is that I now cannot play a game that I have installed. Upon opening it for load I am receiving an error message stating "Initialization Failed". What might be the reason for this?
 It has never occurred in the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the help this far.</p>

    <title>Since Windows 10 tablet mode keyboard doesn&#39;t work, does it still - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> todddonald  say:</h3>
<h2>            Since Windows 10 tablet mode keyboard doesn&#39;t work, does it still work in Windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    I just bought a Surface Pro and was totally shocked that the tablet mode keyboard doesn't work properly. It seems as though this has been an ongoing issue Microsoft is choosing to ignore. I need a decent tablet with Windows that has a functioning tablet
 mode pop-up keyboard. Does this feature still work on Windows 8 tablets, or did MS goof it up with an update? I was thinking maybe i could find an older high end Windows 8 tablet on eBay perhaps.

<p>Hi, lol yes that option is selected. The pop-up keyboard not working properly in tablet mode is a super common problem and looks like it has been for at least a couple years. It's all over Google and your own Microsoft forum.&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/search/search?SearchTerm=Tablet+mode+pop-up+keyboard+not+working&amp;IsSuggestedTerm=false&amp;tab=&amp;isFilterExpanded=false&amp;CurrentScope.ForumName=&amp;CurrentScope.Filter=&amp;ContentTypeScope=#////1</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the pop-up keyboard&nbsp; on myblet with Windows 8.1 RT had always and still works perfectly. It doesn't work on Surface Pro unfortunately, so its got to get returned to the store. I need a tablet that has a working onscreen keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm in need of a faster tablet than my ARM powered Nokia though, so i hope you're right about the keyboard still working on the windows 8 and 8.1 tablets that are a few years old. I just assumed because MS broke it for Windows 10, they would do the same
 to Windows 8 through updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently the way Microsoft has windows 10 setup for tablet mode, is to only show the pop-up touchscreen keyboard intermittently and randomly. For example, on my surface pro and all the windows 10 tablets I tested at Best Buy and OfficeMax, what it does
 is pop open the keyboard in most fields, except for ones like search bars, input fields, username and password fields, internet address bar, etc. It'll also quickly flash open and close instantly, sort of like Microsoft's joke on users like "Ha ha almost fooled
 you into thinking the keyboard works!"</p>

<h2>            Sound problems on Windows X with Xonar DG and Realtek High Definition Audio</h2>
                    <p>I have both of these sound systems in my computer, have tried the audio troubleshoot for both (ie update, then uninstall and reinstall, then try with generic drivers) and still have incredibly low volume with both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried installing the Asus Xonar DG drivers for windows 8.1 (they have no win 10 drivers) and that has not worked either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Its about 1/4 as loud as it used to be, even on max volume it is kind of too quiet to be comfortable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Any ideas on how to fix this?</p>

            <p>Neither worked I am afraid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Modifying the Xonar drivers to work with windows 10 (they wouldnt by default) allowed the sound to be loud enough, but the drivers not being correct kept causing sound glitches that I would rather get rid of by using compatable drivers on the realtek.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas if I can get the realtek loud enough?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also getting another problem that I thought was due to the Xonar drivers but I guess not due to them being uninstalled and me listening through the realtek at the moment.&nbsp; I keep getting popping and stuttering in the audio, everything else seems to work
 fine.&nbsp; It effects all programs, but does not seem to have anything which will definitely cause it to happen.&nbsp; Even watching the same vid can have varying amounts of stutter.</p>

<h3> swathedsinger3  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I create an xBox live account for a child who has progress saved in offline account&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>There seems to be a very unacceptable feature missing from the xBox Live account setup. &nbsp;An adult can join xBox Live through an existing offline profile, which allows their online account to start with all of the progress that was saved under the offline
 account. &nbsp;But if you try to join xBox live through an existing offline profile for a child, the sign-up fails and you're instructed to go to xbox.com, sign-in as a parent and create an online profile for your child. &nbsp;This works fine, and one can download the
 new online profile to the xBox, but it's a clean slate... no progress. &nbsp;I have not been able to find any instructions anywhere that explain how to associate my son's offline account and/or progress with the new online account and now have an obviously very
 disappointed child. &nbsp;One solution would be to lie about the child's age, but that is an unacceptable solution as it circumvents all of the existing parental controls.</p>
<p>There is no way that my son and I are the first parent/child who have run into this issue. &nbsp;I can not think of any reason we should not be able create a new online account with all of his saved progress.</p>
<p>If it's possible, can someone please explain how to do this?</p>
<p>If it's not possible, can someone please explain why?</p>

<p>Update - Did not receive a reply to this post and everything I was able to find online indicated it was not possible to do what I wanted, so I had to lie about my son's age... great... not the type of thing I want to teach him, but unfortunately it was the
 best option. &nbsp;He now has an online account associated with his offline account, so he didn't "lose" all of his progress, but we're now circumventing age based parental controls and/or age based restrictions.</p>

<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>Welcome to the forums</p>
<p>When looking through your question. I find it a bit strange why you couldn't upgrade the Child's Offline account to a Xbox Live Account. I think its mainly because of security. However Microsoft could have a parent to verify with their email etc... Like
 they would when you create an account for a child. </p>
<p>I think its a great suggestion to have, and would recomend posting it in the Xbox Wish List forum. Please follow the link below</p>
<p><a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_feedback/f/2603.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">forums.xbox.com/.../2603.aspx</a></p>
<p>Also, If you can send me a link with the post you create, I would vote for it as I think you should be able to vote for it</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
        </p>

<p>We are just now having this exact same issue. After a few years we feel our kids can now go online with XBOX live with parental controls but there is no way to migrate an existing profile.</p>
<p>What a load of BS, I get the same issues everyone else reports that you go to the child's existing profile and choose join XBOX live to only get it is associated with another profile.</p>
<p>yet other topics suggest you are able to take an offline profile and "promote" it to an online one. Seems like the only way to "promote" a child's offline account is to lie when signing up for a new XBOX live account when it asks for their age.</p>

<h3> motorhead45102  say:</h3>
<h2>            When saving a screenshot or gameclip game crashes on the Xbox one X.</h2>
                    <p>Just like the title says every time I create a screen shot or record a game clip while playing assassins creed origins the audio will disappear and then 10 seconds later I'm returned to the dashboard and have to restart the game. It does this with the screenshots or game clip doesn't matter. I may test other games to see if its doing it on those as well, but so far it seems only on this game. I tried another game that I actually have on the hdd and not a disc and it worked fine. Also want to note the game I tried is not a 4k or one x enhanced so I do not know if it is specific to assassins creed or if it will happen on other One X enhanced games. But other than this issue I didn't have on my older xbox one the new project Scorpio edition is running great, really like the HDR and how much better my games are running.</p><p>Thought i'd stick this out there, maybe someone else experienced this or can see if it happens to them.</p>
