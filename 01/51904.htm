<h2>            Skype logon with new computer</h2>
                    Anytime I try to login to Skype, the actual app that I download to my computer, it tells me that Skype is currently offline and has for three days. I try to use my skype name and also my skype email address but it keeps telling me the same thing. I've
 uninstalled it and reinstalled it but the same thing keeps happening. I can login on skype for web, through a website browser, but the app won't work and I would like to know why so I can use it instead of having to go to a web browser.&nbsp;

<h2>            BITSADMIN and Scheduled Tasks</h2>
                    
<p>Does anyone have any experience making bitsadmin more than useless in a scheduled task?&nbsp; It seems to be restricted&nbsp;to logged-on command line use except for the /create command.&nbsp; Otherwise it fails because user is not logged on (will run even as scheduled
 task if you are logged on and "run now"), but when you are logged off, the task runs but bitsadmin gives errors like:
<br />
Unable to add file to job - 0x800704dd<br />
The operation being requested was not performed because the user has not logged on to the network.</p>
<p>The specified service does not exist.<br />
<br />
This behavior same in Xp and S 2008 / Vista.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>What is the format of the file?</span></li><li><span>Are you able to open the files from the original location?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>.Lnk</strong><span> is a shortcut file type. <strong>LNK </strong>is Windows Shortcut file which links to a program, file or directory. This type of file creates a link to a program or application, from another location. These files are used as placeholders
 for executables and other files. If the real folder has been deleted from the drive, then you can’t open it using the shortcut.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>This could be due to virus infection. </span>I would also suggest you to run
<strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong> to remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: The <strong>Microsoft Safety Scanner</strong> expires 10 days after being downloaded. To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again. Any data files that are infected may
 only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to refer to the article and run the hardware troubleshooter to check if the issue is with the USB (Universal Serial Bus) device.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>Method 3</strong><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue is not resolved, I would suggest you to try copying the files again and check if you are able to access them.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let us know if you need further assistance and we’ll be glad to help.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Rohit and thank you for your reply.......not sure of file format... but a little bit of background...I am doing a course in Excel (is that the format?) and in the class I copied /sent a file from the server to my documents to work on. Later I copied/sent
 this file to my usb key so as I could work on it at home. But when I opened it it gave me the message i posted at the outset. I have been able to work on files form the server before having placed them on my usb key. So not sure what the issue is.</p>
<p>Is there a difference between me copying and and pasting a file as opposed to sending a file from a location to my usb or other destination. Maybe that is part of the issue?</p>
<p>Thanks for any help.</p>

</p><p>When you created your account, you agreed to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/legal/codeofconduct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft's Code of Conduct</a>&nbsp;that includes negative speech towards another user. This can include the words that you

<h2>            Slow Windows Boot - Need Help Troubleshooting</h2>
                    <p>My Windows 7 install is taking over 2 minutes to boot. I've been trying to troubleshoot this but am running up against my own lack of expertise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Event log shows event ID 16962, <strong>"</strong><span><strong>Remote calls to the SAM database are being restricted using the default security descriptor"
</strong>which appears to be eating up about 90 seconds so I think this may be the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I am unable to figure out exactly what is happening, though. This problem persists even in diagnostic startup or without networking enabled.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have cleaned the registry, disabled all startup programs, run malwarebytes (no issues)...but I don't know what could be triggering this event. Seems something is querying and timing out.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Everything else on my machine is running just fine...once Windows boots I have no issues as far as I can tell.</span></p>

<p>Some additional info...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Went back in the event viewer to some earlier boots...event ID 16962 is present but the time gap between the event before it was only one second...system was booting in under 30 seconds on average.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was only yesterday, and unfortunately I had system recovery turned off, but I uninstalled some programs I had installed since (Microsoft Office 2007, Adobe Flash, and WinRAR) but this did not have any effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All Windows 7 updates were installed PRIOR to this happening, since I was completely updated two days ago, so it looks like something I did last evening brought this on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem persists, as I stated, when booting into diagnostic mode. I just rebooted into safe mode and the time gap of 90 seconds was still there.</p>
<p><br />
Thanks</p>

</p><p>Uninstalled those programs but the problem stayed. This happens in safe mode and without network access. I don't even know how to find out what applications or services are making requests to the SAM.</p>

Hi Pat F 203,</p>
<p>Thank you for posting your query in the Microsoft Community. Welcome to our Microsoft Family.<br />
Apart from the issue, how are you doing today?<br />
Print Spooler is a windows service that is required for the printer to function. When the print spooler stops working then you will not be able to use the printer. You have an issue with the print spooler service not working on Windows 7.&nbsp; It can be difficult
 when something that is important to you does not work as expected. It is pretty simple and we are here to help you fix the issue. We will work as a team and get this sorted out.</p>
<p>Please answer the questions-<br />
1)&nbsp;What is the version of Windows installed on the computer?<br />
2)&nbsp;What is the make and model of the printer?<br />
3)&nbsp;When do you get the error message?<br />
4)&nbsp;Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?<br />
I would like more information regarding the issue.</p>
<p>Method 1-</p>
<p>I would have you run the fixit-<br />
Diagnose and fix printer and printing problems automatically<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/printing_problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/printing_problems/</a></p>
<p><br />
Method 2-</p>
<p>You need to make sure if the dependant services for the Print Spooler are running.</p>
<p>Refer the steps-<br />
a)&nbsp;Click “Start”, type “services.msc” (without the quotations) and hit “Enter”.<br />
b)&nbsp;Double Click “Print Spooler” in the services list.<br />
c)&nbsp;Click “Stop” and then “Ok”.<br />
d)&nbsp;Go back to “Services”, Right Click on “Print Spooler” and select “Properties”.<br />
e)&nbsp;On the “General Tab”, make sure that the “Startup type” is set to “Automatic”.<br />
f)&nbsp;Now, click on the “Dependencies” tab and make sure that the “dependent” services (Remote Procedure Call RPC)&nbsp;are set to to "automatic" and running.<br />
g)&nbsp;Click on “Apply” and “Ok”.<br />
h)&nbsp;Restart your computer and check.</p>
<p><br />
Method 3-</p>
<p>I would have you refer the article-</p>
<p>Fix printer problems<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/printer-problems-in-windows-help#fix-printer-problems=windows-7&amp;v1h=win8tab1&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/printer-problems-in-windows-help#fix-printer-problems=windows-7&amp;v1h=win8tab1&amp;v2h=win7tab1&amp;v3h=winvistatab1&amp;v4h=winxptab1</a></p>

            I tried these.&nbsp; The problem still persists.&nbsp; This caused when I replaced spools &amp; spoolsv files in windows\system32 folder as per instructions from one of the posts in internet.&nbsp;

<h2>            Is it possible to redirect the LPT1&#58; port to a usb port</h2>
                    I have an old DOS recipe program with tons of recipes I entered. I have so far been able to use it and can still access the program and files but it wants me to print to LPT1:. No problem until my old printers crapped out. Is it possible to redirect the
 LPT1: port to a usb port or network printer.

<p><strong><em>Original Title: Unable to access files on a usb hard drive folder after turning off sharing on a network.</em></strong></p>
<p>About a week and a half ago I setup my external usb hard drive to be shared on my home network so my brother could access some files from his laptop. &nbsp;I was playing around with the security of some of the files on the hard drive and made it so he couldn't
 access certain ones. &nbsp;I don't remember exactly what I did unfortunately. &nbsp;After I had changed the security access I was still able to access all the files and my brother was unable to access them. &nbsp;He got the files off the hard drive and I turned my computer
 off. &nbsp;A couple of days later I tried to access the files that I had restricted and I was blocked. &nbsp;When I went back into the drive to get some files, I was given an error "You don't have permission to access this folder. &nbsp;Click continue to permanently get
 access to this folder." &nbsp;When I click continue another dialog box comes up saying "You have been denied permission to access this folder. &nbsp;To gain access to this folder you will need to use the&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">security tab</span>."&nbsp;&nbsp;I
 click on the security tab link and another dialog box pops up asking "To continue, you must be an administrative user with permission to view this object's security properties. &nbsp;Do you want to continue?" &nbsp;I'm obviously the administrator since I own this computer
 and I'm the only account on it. &nbsp;From this point I have no idea what I'm doing or what I'm supposed to be doing to get my files back. &nbsp;I played around with a couple of things and I was able to get into some folders but its an extremely lengthy process that
 I don't have time for. &nbsp;A side effect of making it so I can see the files is that for any movie file I try to access I get an error. &nbsp;When I try to open with Windows Media Player, I get the error "Windows Media Player cannot access the file. &nbsp;The file might
 be in use (which it is not), you might not have access to the computer where the file is stored (which doesn't make sense because the computer it is stored on is my personal computer), or your proxy settings might not be correct (what??)." &nbsp;If I try to use
 another media player program like VLC, I get a similar problem where an error comes up saying that it was unable to access the file. &nbsp;I can see the file and see the properties but am unable to actually view the movie. &nbsp;I also cannot move the file anywhere
 because I don't have administrative rights. &nbsp;I am running Windows 7 Ultimate and if anyone could please help me, that would be greatly appreciated.</p>

            Hi Ridley,
<div>I see this problem is quite old but you (or other people) might still have trouble with it. Here's what I did:</div>
<div><br />
<div>- Got to your hard drive and right-click the folder that's causing all the trouble.</div>
<div>- Click Properties.</div>
<div>- Click the Security tab</div>
<div>- Then click Advanced</div>
<div>- You'll see a window with some usernames. Now click Owner in the tabs above.</div>
<div>- Click Edit, then select the username you wish to be able to open the folder and be sure to check the box that says "Replace owner on subcontainers and objects" then hit Apply.</div>
<div><br />
<div>A pop up will come up that says something like 'You have replaced the ownership for the selected folders' or something in that manner. It worked for me and hopefully this post is still useful to some people.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Nina</div>

<p>If you play the "Easy 1" challenge for each of the Game Collections (Klondike, Spider, etc), you'll have 50 stars to use to continue with TriPeaks.</p>
<p>In the Mixed Collections, the first three challenges of Classic and Easy are unlocked, and the first challenge of Tournament is unlocked.</p>
<p>It doesn't look like it's possible to play one Collection straight through as you're trying to do.</p>

                    I am having issues with fast battery drain on my Surface Book 2 15" model 2-n-1 laptop. This has been happening for several months now, this is happening while just doing simple task and surfing the internet and no videos playing.&nbsp; Battery #2 is the one
 that is draining fast, I am looking at maybe 2hrs to 3hrs tops before both batteries are down to 40%. How can I get better battery life on this laptop? What am I missing here? I have looked into the battery settings only to find out that Google Chrome is using
 heavy usage and is a resource hog but even when I am not using Chrome I still seem to loose battery life quickly. I NEED HELP! I shouldn't have to stay plugged in all the time even when using Chrome. Chrome is my go to browser, something has got to give!

<p>Hi,</p>

</p><p>McAfee may be actively running. Have you uninstalled McAfee already? If it is still installed, kindly uninstall it. After doing so, you'll have no problems deleting the folder.</p>

<h2>            Setup&#47;Uninstall has stopped working.__A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available.</h2>
                    I tried to download a program:System Mechanic Professional 9.0 from <a href="http://www.iola.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.Iola.com&nbsp; </a><br />
I saved it to the desktop, right clicked to Run as Administrator, at this point it start to download but then the following message comes on the screen: Setup/Uninstall has stopped working.<br />
A problem caused the program to stop working correctly. Windows will close the program and notify you if a solution is available.<br />
Of course, nothing happens after this and I close out the message. I bought this on the internet and I have the activation code. It is good for 3 pc's. I put it on my desktop and it works fine. My laptop's system is Vista Home Premium with 64 bit operating
 system. Everything else seems to be working fine on my laptop but I desperately need this program. Laptop is running so slow and Firefox takes forever to open pages. I get a lot of messages that it is not responding!<br />
I so appreciate any help you can offer. <br />

<p><span>Hi
<span>luv2shop,</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue may occur due to the conflict by the security software present on the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: Disable the security software, follow the steps mentioned below</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Disable-antivirus-software</span></a>
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span> Enable
 the security software back once everything is done.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: Use the Windows Installer Cleanup utility to
</span></strong><strong><span>remove any entries that are related to the product that you are having difficulty installing:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Download and then install the Microsoft Windows Cleanup utility. To do this, visit the Microsoft Web site:
</span></p>
<p><span><span><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/e/9/d/e9d80355-7ab4-45b8-80e8-983a48d5e1bd/msicuu2.exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://download.microsoft.com/download/e/9/d/e9d80355-7ab4-45b8-80e8-983a48d5e1bd/msicuu2.exe</span></a></span></span><span><span>
</span></span></p>
<p><span>Save the file to the desktop. When the download is complete, double-click the file, and then follow the directions.
 When installation is complete, click <strong><span>Start</span></strong>, point to
<strong><span>All Programs</span></strong>, and then click
<strong><span>Windows Installer Cleanup</span></strong>.<br />
<br />
In the <strong><span>Installed Products</span></strong> list, remove any entries that are related to the product that you are having difficulty installing. If there are too many entries, click
<strong><span>Select All</span></strong>, and then click
<strong><span>Remove</span></strong>. When you have removed all the entries, click
<strong><span>exit</span></strong>, and then start the installation of the product</span></p>

    <title>Pinning desktop shortcuts to taskbar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kemperhill  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pinning desktop shortcuts to taskbar</h2>
                    Here's my problem. Does anyone know how to pin shortcuts, like my computer, on the taskbar on an Acer W500 tablet. I unlock the taskbar, the way I have always done it on my desktops and laptops, and tried to drag the shortcut and drop it on the taskbar.
 But on the Acer tablet I can't drop the shortcut on the taskbar.<br />
<br />
This is confusing as I found a way to install Works 9 on the tablet and when I dragged and dropped the Works 9 icon on the taskbar it worked. But when I try to drag and drop icons like My Computer and Control Panel they won't pin to the taskbar.<br />
<br />
So does anyone know how to accomplish this. Thanks

<h2>            Miracast is dropping after few seconds of usage</h2>
                    <p><br />
</p>
Hi,<br />
<br />
I am having a problem with my ultrabook while trying to miracast to my TV.<br />
<br />
I have a Sony Bravia KD65X9000B TV, I can mirror my android phone with no issue. But when it comes to mirror my Sony Tap 11 everything looks ok in the begining. My ultrabook identifies my TV as a wireless monitor and connects but after a few seconds (generally
 around 10), my TV screen freezes and drops the connection.<br />
<br />
How can I solve this problem?

    <title>Remote Desktop - access denied error after logon - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> oldgrouch  say:</h3>
<h2>            Remote Desktop - access denied error after logon</h2>
                    <p>When trying to remote into my desktop, I am getting an "access denied" error after entering username/password. (This used to work for me, but I think some changes made by a support technician working on another problem has somehow broken remote desktop.
 I tried going back to an older restore point, but that did not work.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Windows 7 64-bit. My user account is a member of the Remote Desktop Users group.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a step by step procedure I can use to diagnose the problem, or a Microsoft Fix-it tool available?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is some information on "Remote..." services:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remote Access Auto Connection Manager,Creates a connection to a remote network whenever a program references a remote DNS or NetBIOS name or address.,,Manual,Local System<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Taskbar and Search Not Working - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> weltschmerz7  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Taskbar and Search Not Working</h2>
                    I installed Windows 10 on my laptop without any problems. However, about 30 minutes after it was up and running I got a black screen and a complete shut down. &nbsp;After I restarted, the Windows 10 home button and the search bar in the taskbar would not work.
 &nbsp;Both show the effects of the mouse cursor, but clicking on them does nothing. &nbsp;I installed all recommended and optional Windows updates, thinking that it might have been fixed. &nbsp;After restarting my computer many times, this issue still persists. &nbsp;I saw some
 forum posts on the technical builds having similar issues back in March, perhaps this is related?

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I experienced the same thing. </p>
<ul>
<li>No start menu function except right-click</li><li>No search function in taskbar</li><li>No right-click functionality in taskbar</li><li>No calendar function in systray</li><li>No Cortana</li><li>No ability to add new users in Settings</li></ul>
<p>After hours (days) of searching and trying every possible option I came across (powershell, registry edits, DISM, sfc \scannow, etc.), I recalled that everything seemed to work great when I originally was logged in as a new account. Unfortunately, my settings
 screen would not allow me to create a new account at all. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Ultimately I created a new user using CMD and was able to assign administrator rights to the new account allowing me to access the files that I'd saved within my original account. The new account works at about 98% - still can't access Microsoft Store and
 Edge won't allow me to set a new default search engine - but overall the machine is working properly. My suggestion, if you're faced with the same problems, is to create a new user account via elevated CMD (i.e. CMD as Administrator)
<em>* See instructions for launching an elevated&nbsp;cmd prompt below,&nbsp;if needed</em>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To create a new user with elevated CMD prompt:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">1. Make sure you're logged on under an admin account.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">2. <strong>To add a new user account on the local computer:</strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 60px">Example:&nbsp;Adds a new user account with the loginid <em>
Bill</em> and with password <em>jd8ufi1k9</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">&nbsp; </p>
</p><p class="contentStandard" style="margin-left: 30px">3. <strong>To add new user to the Administrator group:</strong></p>
</p><p class="contentCodeblock" style="margin-left: 60px">net localgroup administrators&nbsp;Bill /add</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point you <em>should</em> be able to access a "working" instance of Windows 10 from which you can transfer files, continue to troubleshoot why your other account isn't loading properly or whatever.
<strong>To find the files from your original user account, launch File Explorer and navigate to the original user account folder&nbsp;by scrolling down the left-hand navigation window and clicking This PC -&gt; Local Disk -&gt; Users and selecting the original user account.</strong>
 From there you can move files to the new user account, etc. as you wish. Do note that any documents/files/procedures you may have written that explicitly include path names referring to the original account will need to be adjusted.
</p>
<p>I'm no Windows expert so there may be a better solution or way to go about it. That said, I was
<em>super</em> frustrated with the way Windows 10 was misbehaving and this worked for me. I hope it works for you, too.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>* There will be some people who read this and have no idea how to access CMD as Administrator. Here are a couple of ways to do it:</p>
<ol>
<li>If your&nbsp;right-click works on&nbsp;the Start menu, you should see "Command Prompt (Admin)" as the last option in the top section of the menu that appears</li><li><strong>Ctrl + Alt + Del</strong> and access Task Manager. Go <strong>File -&gt; Run new task. In the "Create new task" dialog that comes up, type
</strong><strong>cmd </strong>and <strong>check the box that says "Create this task with administrative privileges" and click Ok</strong></li></ol>

            Thanks to those that have offered an answer this problem&nbsp;But, his is no help at all for me. After trying I find it's far to complicated for me to understand. Still unable to get the taskbar to work with mouse left click. Now I'm just trying to find a way
 to get back to windows 8.1 where everything worked right.

<h2>            In need of a gamertag</h2>
                    
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Well by reading the subject title, it's obvious what I am asking for; I need a new gamertag, my current gamertag "SassyElite69" was a joke when I first got Xbox years ago, I am an idiot for accepting
 it, I got messages from 12 year olds calling me a "***" and other names, which was funny but it does get quite annoying after a few years. Anyways, I am just hoping I could hear some good ideas for a new gamertag, something I would like to keep for a while
 because I don't like to change it every month like some people.</span></p>
<p><span>A little more information on the type of gamertag I would like: Well I am a female gamer, I love to play first person shooters, but I don't want anything to do with a game I play, or related to a game for example:
 HaloGurll121421 or something like that. I would like something that sounds dark and mysterious, or something funny, I am not looking for girly names just because I am a female example: FLUFFYKITTYCUTEGIRL90 I would like something that both genders could use.
 I do not like anything with "Girl" in it, because it just seems so lame to me. As for music, I listen to Hardcore Death Metal, Hardcore Rock, pretty much anything hardcore, example: Whitechapel, Chelsea Grin, Slipknot, etc.</span></p>
<p><span>Here are some names I've come up with myself:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">ToxicDeathAngel (Death Angel = Grim Reaper)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">ToxicNova</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">VixenNova (Vixen = Female Fox)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">BloodyVixen</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">ToxicBulletShot (I think I actually like that one)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">JannyBrootal (My name is Janna, some of my friends call me Janny)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">MiseryMae (Mae is my middle name)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">DeathDealingAngel (Also meaning Grim Reaper)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Y U KILL JANNA (I just love memes.)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">KrossRoads (Idea from Avenged Sevenfold - Cross Roads)</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">KoolAids</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">DeathMetalMae (Ohh yeahyuh.)</span></p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">And that's about all I can think of really, I guess I will get your opinion, if you like the gamertags I posted above, just comment the one you like and I will use that one, I
 really would like to be original, so if one of the gamertags I made up are good then I would want to use them instead of getting other people to think for me, I am just clueless. But of these gamertags all suck, then I am willing to take others ideas.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Thank you.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><br />

<p>I find it really funny that you want a gender neutral name but alot of the ones you came up with are girly lol.
</p>
<p>I like the toxicnova one, very short names with no numbers are always pretty neat. But if the gamertag you want has anything girly in it just go for it.. if people talk trash then just mute them or whip their butts ingame and they won't be talking anymore
 :). </p>
<p>BTW: did you check if all those names are even available?</p>

<p>These names are just gamertags I thought of long ago, and was curious to see what people would think about these gamertags, I don't really find them girly at all, but that's just my opinion, I liked ToxicNova also, and I agree short names with no numbers
 look good, that's why I choose to put no numbers in my name, but I made this current gamertag when I was new to Xbox, this would be my first time changing it, the "69" in my name was a joke, it was funny at first but now I am bored with it, and "Sassy" was
 my name on Halo Combat Evolved when I first started playing back in 2004. I did check to see if these were taken, I try to keep it original, and I honestly can't think of anything that is gender neutral so I picked random ones I could think of.
</p>
<p>The "Elite" in my name came from Halo, so obviously I am not afraid to choose silly gamertags, I mean "SassyElite69" sounds like a desperate homo, or that's what people on Xbox live say anyways when they message me calling me a ***. XD

<p>Unfortunately i am in the same vote as of late, trying to think of a cool yet dark and mysterious gamertag that could also resemble horror. I try to think of my own, but specific gamertags can be difficult to come up with without others assistance. Which
 is why i have now decided to reach out. The two best ones i have come up with recently are "BrokenMystery" and "SuspectShadow". Although i do love the name Maverick, i don't wish to use it as it's a guy's name and most people may be confused. I ask if you
 could give me suggestions, that would be highly appreciated.</p>

<p>original title: BSOD - DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL</p>
<p>I've been added to the list of users that are suffering from the BSOD&nbsp;DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL. &nbsp;I've opened the minidump file (<a href="http://cid-546b26883e0d1c28.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/.Public/053010-27690-01.dmp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://cid-546b26883e0d1c28.skydrive.live.com/self.aspx/.Public/053010-27690-01.dmp</a>)&nbsp;but
 have no idea how to locate and resolve the issue. &nbsp;This happened for the first time around a month ago one evening and does appear to be linked with the Wifi connection. &nbsp;Windows 7 is up-to-date and I ran the scannow in cmd with the result that there were
 no integrity problems so any help or pointers would be greatly appreciated:</p>
