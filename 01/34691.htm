<h2>            Tracking I.P over Xbox Live&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>My friend and I today were playing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, when my friend started talking a little bit of smack on a Xbox Live User. I was laughing due to the conversation, and the User said her "job" was "finding" people. I was skeptical, but I
 muted her and avoided her just to make sure. Is it really possible to locate and Xbox Live User over Xbox Live? I was thinking it would be impossible, and probably illegal. And besides which, we really didn't do anything wrong...&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most likely nothing to be worried about. Even if they could find your IP address, they can't find your location with that. Maybe the city you're in (which is incredibly general) at most.</p>

<p>Exactly, but consider that not all are hackers, there are also script kiddies, people who use programs maked by other people. Just to have "fun" scamming and "hacking" other people's pcs...&nbsp;</p>

<p>Ip can easily be gotten while over xbox live, If they have the correct smarts they can find out: Open ports, city, state, isp, etc.</p>
<p>But with people getting your ip address over the internet the major thing you would have to worry about is being &nbsp;'DDOS'ed' 90% of the people who will tell you you're ip address cannot do anything with it, but there is a few who can.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Facebook / Twitter? To contact Microsoft to discuss and deal with product related questions and issues?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am a bit confused but if the method for customers to engage a vendor is through some type of chat forum or 3rd party social media site then they are getting a bit confused.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We want to speak to them directly, clearly, distinctly and want concrete responses not some off the cuff "hey what is going on..." we are not all 18 years old and happy to see our thoughts "liked" with the world.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is a serious method of communication with this product team and business I would like that contact information if there isn't then this product will be relegated to "cute" status.</p>

<p>Hi George, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm now slightly confused.&nbsp; You'll relegate this product to the Cute pile, if&nbsp; you do not have a way to speak to the Product team?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do any of the major players do this on a regular basis?&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've seen podcasts, reddits, available where communication from and with the product team is available.&nbsp; The Twitter and Facebook feeds are designed to promote the product. yes, but are indeed monitored by teams that report highlights and questions back
 up the channel.&nbsp; This Answers forum, though sometimes 'stretching' things when they mark some replies as answers, is indeed monitored by Microsoft Customer Support Services, and not just a vendor.&nbsp; Hot issues, feedback and suggestions are indeed passed up
 the chain in a timely fashion.&nbsp;&nbsp; I've seen this happen. Its happened to me, and several others in this forum.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>No need to explain to a savvy veteran like you, the business of support is costly.&nbsp; Though not always effective, forums like this are designed to share 1 answer with many.&nbsp; Can you imagine the feedback channel to the product team if there were not filters
 in place? </p>
<p>
</p><p>I've even seen in post corrections by members of Microsoft, right here in this forum.&nbsp; They are reading and they are watching.&nbsp; They just may not reply often enough to satisfy us.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I don't know what the expectation here is.&nbsp; I don't know, does Apple or Google respond directly in their forums, by someone other than 'vendors'?&nbsp; Are you able to communicate directly with the iPad developers or other members of the product teams? Are
 you so positive that each reply is indeed, 'not a vendor' or an 18yr old kid?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I'm certainly unsure what your expectation is....</p>

            <p>Hello George</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking at your post, but can't identify what it is you are looking for.&nbsp; You must understand, as the Community has pointed out, that non publicly facing information will not be presented in a publicly facing channel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, there is information available, most of which you have probably already seen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can find the currently available details about Surface Pro 3 and related accessories&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/news/presskits/surface/materials.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Various <a href="http://blog.surface.com/2014/05/businesses-are-committed-to-surface-pro-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Blog</a> posts talk about business partnerships that we have in place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can access <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/support/business" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Business Support</a> information or look into
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/business/order-now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Business Purchases</a> as appropriate.&nbsp; Smaller scale preorders&nbsp;are available directly from the Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are happy to help through any of the available Support channels, but understand that we must operate within the limits of those channels.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards</p>

            <p>You are comfortable with the degradation of quality over time. &nbsp;Forums/Facebook/Twitter or any other means of information that may exist is fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, what we are looking for is Vendor/Mfg contact information relating to the product, if this is too much to ask for then they are not in a position to sell the product, fairly simple. &nbsp;We are not employees of Microsoft nor are we required to WORK
 hard to find information. &nbsp;It is incumbent on them to facilitate this. &nbsp;The information they provided isn't clear enough, if it benefits Microsoft in terms of cost to use online forums that is fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the quality of the responses by Microsoft staff needs to be meaningful, if it isn't and there is no way to communicate effectively with the product teams and sales then it simply doesn't work...in terms of us writing a check, which I believe ultimately
 is their goal, right?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand that this product has been announced and released, if that understanding is incorrect then we may be a bit premature in our expectations but if this is an announced and released product then 100% of all information relating to that product
 should be available, if it isn't it simply prevents us from understanding if it meets our needs and ultimately prevents us from becoming a customer, again something I dont think Microsoft is interested in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding other vendors, every vendor has a way of doing business, Microsoft is more business oriented and generally understands the needs of business, but they have been a bit caught up in the consumer area recently and have been morphing in that direction
 for some its fine but for others the "simplistic" non-informational mode is a deal breaker. &nbsp;Ultimately, business and those customers are the core and the addition of consumer would be a great growth area but it cant come at the cost of the business community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So support may be costly but we are talking sales here not support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, we dont need to banter back and forth between us we have our opinions and yes I have been involved in this arena for quite some time in fact from its inception so I have a pretty good idea of what I am talking about... it doesn't mean we will accept
 decline and simply state it is the current state of affairs... not interested in that. &nbsp;Sales Support and Support and the method in which they are delivered is just as important as the product itself.</p>

            <p>I think what you may need to do is click on the "Additional Support" link at the top of this page and navigate to the Contact Us and get with a live chat.&nbsp; That is the only contact information that there is in a direct fashion with Microsoft with the exception
 if you are with a business.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also gathering that you are thinking that these machines have been released.&nbsp; They have not.&nbsp; Nobody has any Pro 3 model in hand at this time.&nbsp; There are only about 200 machines floating around being used for marketing, advertisements, and to the press
 for 'loan' to do reviews with.&nbsp; The earliest that any Pro 3 model that will be shipped out is June 20th of this month and that will be for the i5 model.&nbsp; The keyboards designed for the Pro 3 models will also be available for shipping on June 20th as well.&nbsp;
 The Intel Core i3 and i7 models do not ship out until August 31st at the earliest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only information about the machines are posted and that is it.&nbsp; The Microsoft employees DO NOT have them in hand for reference.&nbsp; The information you see on the web page in the Surface section is all the information released.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here on the forum, all of us are trying to dig around and get information on the 'fine line' details about them and that is the information that you are looking for as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Corporate does not allow the employees to talk in details about the products and services they have.&nbsp; A lot of companies do that now just in case something happens and a change comes in effect.&nbsp; It is not impossible that the tablets could finally
 get here and something happens and maybe a recall on the battery packs (this is just an example).&nbsp; That can create confusion and misinformation that nobody wants.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to get the Live Chat in Customer Support.&nbsp; They may have more information available to release than what is published.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Give that a try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This forum is for helping people who have problems with their Surface tablets.&nbsp; Everybody here are volunteers and NOBODY works for Microsoft with the exception of a few employees get on the forum to help out as well.</p>

</p><p>We understand that this product has been announced and released, if that understanding is incorrect then we may be a bit premature in our expectations but if this is an announced and released product then 100% of all information relating to that product
 should be available, if it isn't it simply prevents us from understanding if it meets our needs and ultimately prevents us from becoming a customer, again something I dont think Microsoft is interested in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regarding other vendors, every vendor has a way of doing business, Microsoft is more business oriented and generally understands the needs of business, but they have been a bit caught up in the consumer area recently and have been morphing in that direction
 for some its fine but for others the "simplistic" non-informational mode is a deal breaker. &nbsp;Ultimately, business and those customers are the core and the addition of consumer would be a great growth area but it cant come at the cost of the business community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So support may be costly but we are talking sales here not support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, we dont need to banter back and forth between us we have our opinions and yes I have been involved in this arena for quite some time in fact from its inception so I have a pretty good idea of what I am talking about... it doesn't mean we will accept
 decline and simply state it is the current state of affairs... not interested in that. &nbsp;Sales Support and Support and the method in which they are delivered is just as important as the product itself.</p>

<p>Thanks. It took me a little while to figure out Desktop mode but I was able to make it work. I posted a reply to another thread which provided clearer instructions than those posted here. I made a step by step list and am posting here which should help others.</p>
<p>
1. Go to your Desktop<br />
2. Right-swipe for Charms, select the gear for Settings<br />
3. Control Panel<br />
4. Device Manager<br />
5. Other Devices - Unknown Device<br />
6. Press and hold on the banged out unknown device or right click and select Update Driver Software<br />
7. Select Option "Browse my computer for driver software"<br />
8. Select Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer<br />
9. Select the Keyboard Node<br />
10 Select "HID Keyboard Device" as the model&nbsp;<br />
11. Click Next and install the driver software<br />
12. Keyboard should work properly now.

<p>Thanks for posting your query. I understand that you want to repeat the audio file you used in your project. Unfortunately, we do not have that option in Movie Maker. However, you can try adding again the same file in your project to repeat it.</p>

I would like to do the same thing but find trying to add the song at the end of current photos doesn't align well at all. Is there any chance that MS will add this option in the near future? It just makes so much sense.<br />

            <p>Notepad is a simple text editor it is not designed to open .docx files, only .txt files.</p>
<p>Windows 7 comes with Wordpad (a very basic word processor) that can open and edit .docx files. To find it click:</p>
<p><strong>Start-&gt;All Programs-&gt;Accessories-&gt;Wordpad</strong>.</p>
<p>If you have Microsoft Word (not part of Windows 7) then this will also open .docx files and give you far more functionality than Wordpad.</p>

<h2>            DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL &#40;CH341S64.SYS&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Been having some issues with bluescreens lately. It appears to be related to Arduino drivers and software related to controlling a relay through it. The problem is the bluescreen screen hangs at 100% complete, so there is no dump file to be found. I did
 enable DisplayParameters for more info, though I'm at a loss about where to continue looking after that. Appears to happen fairly consistently if I let my program run for a good ~30 minutes and then try to activate the laser through it. I got some advice that
 the driver failing is part of the <span>WDM_64 driver for CH341 serial, developed by
</span><span>www.winchiphead.com. It was a bit hard to find info on this, being Chinese components and all, but most likely, it's the USB driver for the Micro USB ATmega328P Development Board for Arduino UNO R3 I'm using.
</span><br />
</p>
<p>Stop code is of course 0xD1 DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL</p>
<p>CH341S64.SYS failed</p>
<p>Parameters:</p>
<p>0xFFFFD906C3F81E39</p>

<p>0xFFFFF8027D9FBF40</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aside from it being a read operation, I don't really know where to start looking here. Anyone have any advice?</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Of course the most likely cause is the Micro USB ATmega328P Development Board for Arduino UNO R3. However it is worth checking everything else at least as a process of elimination.<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: D1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x000000D1<br />
<br />
</strong>Think Video drivers mainly though it can be others. See the driver section in my
<br />
generic&nbsp;bluescreen troubleshooting methods below. <strong>BIOS</strong>, <strong>
low level chipset <br />
</strong>
<p><strong>drivers, </strong><strong>antivirus/antispyway/security programs, and other drivers
</strong>can also <br />
cause this.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: d1&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x000000d1&nbsp; &lt;-- read this link<br />

</p>
<p>==================================================<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : <br />
<br />
Run DriverView -&nbsp;<strong>set&nbsp;VIEW to Hide&nbsp;Microsoft drivers </strong>- update&nbsp;those without
<br />
Dump in their names (and&nbsp;update<strong> BIOS </strong>and <strong>chipset</strong>).<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver,&nbsp;description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Right Click the Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down
<br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks&nbsp;that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory.&nbsp;So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to&nbsp;show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<h2>            Gears of War 4 is currently not available in your account. Here&#8217;s the error code, in case you need it&#58; 0x803F8001</h2>
                    <p>2 Days ago i was able to play Gears of war 4 on my Windows 10 Pc just fine. That morning things were fine. Later that day the error in the title appeared:&nbsp;Gears of War 4 is currently not available in your account. Here’s the error code, in case you need
 it: 0x803F8001</p>
<p>So i'm sitting here like....what? So i looked online and maybe a redownload was in order. I redownloaded the whole 118gb game and it worked! for like yesterday morning. Later yesterday is started to do this again. Keep in mind i have not changed anything.
 No new downloads. No updates. Before the CU and FCU everything was fine. but these updates only appear to make things worse as the haven't helped me in any way. I have to use my phone data to download this game and its really annoying as its a 2 day-ish overnight
 download. Microsoft's Virtual agent thing never connects me to a freaking human so i can't get help from them. I just want to play some Gears of War man. Its in my account, i just checked. What is this ****. This is why i have to debate getting a game on Windows,
 because of **** like this. So i have 0 help, 0 support, and 0 game, but less game, and less money. What the hell?!?!?!?!? My last resort is to do a clean install of Windows and never update it. So i'm gonna wait for whoever suggests something.</p>
<p class="contentStandard">Don't suggest using my Microsoft account to sign in, don't suggest powershell, and don't suggest cmd. Nor regedit. I've already done these and have reverted settings if i changed them. Redownloading the game only lets me play for
 some extra hours and then nothing. 128gb of phone data gone down the drain again.</p>

<p>So these tips are false hope. This actually worked for me one time. As far as I'm concerned it's just a coincidence that it worked.
</p>
<p>I think you guys do have a legit problem. I have Gears 4 installed on my Xbox One, Ryzen PC &amp; Mini HTPC and the only place it will reliably run with no problems is on my Xbox One. But playing on PC, the experience is far far smoother so I prefer it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could it be that somehow the system is seeing the game run in to many difference places? It's strange because today, I played earlier for a few hours on my Ryzen PC. I just tried to play again a few moments ago and now it's telling me the error above. Nothing
 changed in the 4 hours since the last time I played earlier today. </p>
<p>
</p><p>This is annoying. What could it be? How does this work? Is it a network issue maybe?</p>

 the users the option to play the game Or Update based on user's choice and not force the upgrade. I haven't finished with the game yet and I was forcibly being asked to upgrade to latest version . I simply wanted to be able to play the game and complete once.

<h2>            Windows 10 Upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Right it's now July 29 and I've turned on my computer and allowed it load up and then went and investigated the upgrade to Windows 10. &nbsp;And bang, it's not there. &nbsp;The Windows Update is no longer showing the message 'You have reserved Windows 10, we will
 send you a notice when it's here' and the Windows 10 icon in the taskbar is showing no change and it says that I've reserved the OS, which I know I have as I remember doing so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is, what time is Microsoft rolling out the upgrade?? &nbsp;Or for the UK is it not being rolled out on July 29??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that you're able to answer my question.<br />

<p>1. When exactly do you receive this error message?</p>
<p>2. What’s the exact error message that you receive?</p>
<p>3. Were there any hardware or software changes made in the Computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>Based on my research, SDL.dll ("Simple DirectMedia Layer") is a file that should come with the game itself and be in the game's folder.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’ve trouble installing or running a game properly on your computer, the DirectX Diagnostic Tool can help you pinpoint the source. Performing the following methods and check
 if it helps:</p>
<p><b>Method 1: Diagnosing basic problems with DirectX</b></p>

<p>If the issue still persists, then provide some more information regarding this issue so that we can guide you in the right direction.
</p>
<p>Hope this information is helpful.</p>

<h2>            How to save current windows configuration</h2>
                    
<p>Original title: how to update the "previous safe configuratin"</p>
<p>Periodically my MS Vista dosen't startup. I complete power down, then restart my HP laptop. The HP BIOS works, then windows comes up with the "do you want to troubleshoot and restore screen." I say troubleshoot. After a while it asks to restor to a previously
 safe point. This is the out-of-the-box initial look, with all the ____ from HP and Windows that i have to spend 20 minutes to reset to what I like. How can I save the new updated look as the previously safe so I don't have to do it every time?</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<div>Hi spike,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Did you make any changes prior to the issue?</div>
<div>2. What happens if you don't select the restore point and select the option to boot windows normally?</div>
<div>3. When you select restore point, does it go through the HP recovery process or does it perform system restore (which is part of Windows)?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 1: </strong>If it is HP recovery process, we recommned you not to try it.</div>
<div>You can also get in touch with <a href="http://welcome.hp.com/country/us/en/contact_us.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HP Support team</a> for more assistance on this.</div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Step 2:</strong> If it's windows system restore feature, try last known good configuration</div>
<div>a. Start computer and tap F8 key continuously to get advanced boot options menu.</div>
<div>b. From the menu items, choose last known good configuration and hit enter.</div>
<div>c. Restart the computer and check if the issue still persists.</div>

<p>If you can buy 400 but not 4000, then these 2 things come to mind:</p>
<p>Point of Sale Transaction limits</p>
<p>Very common on all credit/debit cards and even more common for people to be unaware of. Say your limit is $1,000. (not your credit limit, your daily PoS limit).If you have spent $972, then 400 will go through, but not 4000 and you have more than $5 but less
 than $50.</p>
<p>20,000 MSP limit</p>
<p>This is crazy rare to come up, but any account can not have more than 20,000 MSP at any given time. If you have 16,910 MSP, 4000 would place you above 20,000, but 400 would not.</p>

            Once logged on go to start menu then settings then update and security. Once there go to recovery and select go back to win 7. Once back in win 7 check to see if you have any NCH software. If you do uninstall all of it. NCH software uses a driver file
 stdriver64.sys which causes this to happen. I was having same problem and this worked for me.

RonBwa</a>! I managed yesterday to enter the safe mode. I will try to solve this later today when back home, but before doing so, one more question: can I try to remove the NCH software (if any is found) from the safe mode in Windows 10 or is it necessary to
 go back to win7? Thank you for your answer in advance!</p>
 later today or tomorrow.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>It is normal to see IPv6 status as ‘No internet access’ unless you are using an IPv6 or dual stack. IPv4 is more preferred than IPv6. You can find more information about IPv4 in this article:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>&nbsp;</span>The details that you have provided in your post shows that there was internet connectivity in IPv4 but shows a poor signal strength. So this issue could have been caused due to a temporary signal loss or due to temporary
 connection issue in the provider side. We cannot&nbsp;determine the exact reason for the issue&nbsp;as the issue has been resolved now.&nbsp;When you ran the Internet connections troubleshooter, it must have shown the issue found (reason for loss of internet) and whether
 it was fixed.</span></p>

<h2>            Chivalry Medieval Warfare</h2>
                    
<p>I would really like my money back on this game that I just got less then a hour ago from the store, I spent 29.99 on the Ultimate editon however non of the DLC is there, and the game is just terrible, I shouldn't have to pay for a game and then wait months
 and months for them to hopefully get it right with a couple of updates, if I here they fix it then I can just re buy the game, But I need a refund so I can get a different game because this game is broken, super laggy, awful. I can't ever describe how bad
 of a experience. the game is online only, however when I try to find a match in multiplayer, it throws me into a lobby by my self. I was really excited to buy this and start playing :(</p>

            Hi Stephanie.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />One thing you can try is to go into Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button, choose the Mouse device, then Driver tab, then Roll Back if available, or if not Uninstall, restart PC using keyboard to Ctrl Alt Del, on blue screen tab to Power Icon in bottom right, press Enter, arrow down to Restart, press Enter to restart to reinstall the driver. 
<br />
<br />If this fail try other USB ports.  
<br />
<br />If nothing helps contact the mouse Support because all hardware has a one year warranty during which time they must make it work or replace it.  Same with the PC. 
<br />
<br />To go over your PC most thoroughly work through this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />What I'd do at this point is wait a few days for Spring Creators Update to be released, install Media Creation Tool from this link and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />You can monitor the Windows 10 Blog here to get notified of the exact date for release of Spring Creators Version 1803 which is soon:   <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#utpDefLLBfmPO4gr.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#ut...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            Certain Control Panel applets and links won&#39;t open</h2>
                    <p>Good day everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a weird issue with a fresh install of Windows 10. At some point Windows stopped to respond to certain menu items. When I right click on start menu and choose CPL items such as "Programs and features", "System" or "Power options" nothing happens. At
 the same time, if I click MSC items such as "Event viewer" or "Disk management" they do show up. The exception would be "Device manager" that doesn't show up despite being an MSC (and it does open up when I simply run devmgmt.msc).</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Control panel" does open up, and I can open "Programs and features", "System" and "Power options" from there. However, some links within those applets don't work. For example, when in System settings, I can't click "Device manager", but I can't click "Remote
 settings", "System protection" and "Advanced system settings". When in "Power options", none of the links in the left column ("Require a password on wakeup" etc) work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Windows version is 10.0.10240. I tried to run SFC and it's reporting that "Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions appreciated.</p>
<p>

<h2>            I am getting seriously high DPC latency due to many drivers which is causing my system to lag and the audio cracks and pops and mouse lags.</h2>
                    <p>I am getting <em><strong>high DPC latency</strong></em> due to <strong>many drivers like ndis.sys, nvlddmkm.sys, Wdf01000.sys</strong> which is causing my system to lag and the audio cracks and pops and mouse lag. I have tested these latency values of&nbsp;these
 drivers by using Latencymon application. Please do help me I am on the verge of replacing my machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried disabling drivers one by one to check which one is culprit but no results :( .</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have attached some screenshots of LatencyMon application indicating the driver latency.</p>

<p>So I had the same problem on my Dell XPS 13 2in1 (9365) running Windows 10.&nbsp; For me the option in the wireless card is called Bluetooth AMP.&nbsp; Enabling this has significantly reduced the latency I was having on the Bluetooth wedge mouse.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I have the AC-8265 WLand card from Gigabyte and using windows 10 with microsoft sculpt touch mouse.<br />
<br />
I do not see "Bluetooth Collaboration" or "Bluetooth AMP" option anywhere in the advanced tab of the device properties.<br />
<br />
Anyone have another idea?<br />
<br />
PS. I cannot seem to associate the cause of lag with any special activity. I realize I notice it more when im surfing on internet than when i code but it seems to happen in just about any condition or so it feels.</p>

<p>Hi all:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have mouse cursor/pointer lag/latency using a Logitech M557 Bluetooth mouse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Dell Vostro 3550 laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This lag seems to still occur even when I turn off my Bluetooth keyboard and Bluetooth speaker.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I seem to get the terrible mouse pointer lag only when I'm browsing the Internet. &nbsp;So I don't think it would be interference, since I would think interference would cause the same mouse pointer lag when I'm not browsing the Internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else have any ideas on why my computer seems to only give mouse pointer lag just when I'm browsing the Internet?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have a 300 Meg up and down FIOS connection. &nbsp;So I don't think it's a slow Internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks much,</p>
<p>Bob</p>
