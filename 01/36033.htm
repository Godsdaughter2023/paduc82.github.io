<h2>            REMOVING STUBBORN PROGRAMS -- REMOVING ALL TRACES OF PROGRAMS</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes I struggle to remove programs the usual way -- Control Panel -- Installed Programs, etc. Sometimes programs refuse to uninstall, and sometimes they ask for&nbsp;Administrator&nbsp;rights (I am the only user and have Admin account.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it safe to use an "aggressive" uninstaller -- such as IObit Uninstaller -- or can this "deep cleaning" potentially cause problems.</p>
<p>Does MS provide an alternative?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            NTASN1 error and other problems</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this morning my computer is not running properly (Windows 10)</p>
<p>
</p><p>When i start it and get to my desktop I get a ntasn1 error bad image ".dll is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error"</p>
<p>That happens at the point when skype for business would normally launch automatically</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then the start menu is not working. I have to access applications from Windows Explorers.&nbsp; MS Office applications are also not working</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried doing a SFC scan under command prompt. It stopped at 39% with the message "Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a startup repair - it did not work</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer will not start in safe mode - after I enter my password the screen freezes with an error window "sihost start hard error"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did not instal anything recently. The only unusual thing that happened yesterday is that the wifi connection options disappeared.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advise please? Can you help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks</p>
<p>

            This was fixed way back in 1511 version. Looks like you are on an older build on Windows. Type in winver in run dialog box and press Enter.
<br />If the build number is either from 10586,14393 or 10240 then you are not up to date. 
<br />A newer build 16299 is about to release later today, so I would recommend upgrading to it directly. Steps are for the latest build as of now, but would be same for Fall Creators update as well.
<br /> You can try updating to the latest Windows 10 build using the upgrade assistant or Media creation tool. Steps are here:

    <title>Windows 10 May update bricking hard drives - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> peterpaul_69  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 May update bricking hard drives</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; I run a small computer repair shop and over the past week have gotten 7 computers in with the hard drive failed. All had just upgraded to the May update or were in the process of upgrading. I had one customers computer I was working on and it downloaded
 the update and was running terribly slow after the update. I checked task manager and when it finally came up the disk was running at 100% and did this for several hours before I finally shut the computer off. When i rebooted it went straight back to 100%.
 Prior to the update upon boot it would only run about 2-3%. When windows 10 first came out I was getting similar results but was eventually fixed by a patch. I have seen MANY posts on different forums with people having similar issues with drives of various
 ages that were working fine before the update. I have a couple of these drives that are bricked now if you want me to attempt to run any tests on. not going to promise any of the tests will be able to complete though. The last 2 the computer would just go
 to a blank screen just after the windows swirl goes away and never go any further. Can not get into automatic repair either. Booting up off external device will stop at the same screen. Unplug the drive and you can do anything you want (other than boot into
 windows obviously).&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; I have connected each of these drives to my shop computer to try and recover customers data and within a few seconds with each drive my computer comes to an almost standstill. Previously when windows 10 first came out drives did the same thing. Some of
 the drives I could eventually get back working after using several repair tools but would have to delete the partitions on the drives. I haven't had a chance to test it any on the new updates but with the initial windows 10 I cold disable superfetch, search,
 and windows update and the hard drive % would drop to a manageable rate. Please check into this and if there is any testing I can do to help eliminate others from losing drives and data let me know.</p>

<p>Windows does not have the ability to physically damage a hard drive. Microsoft is not the NSA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible that your customers brought you a computer that was so scr*wed up that an update was enough to finally kill it?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Here in this community forum, we deal on a daily basis with people who have crazy ideas about how to operate a computer. You would not believe - or maybe you would - what messed up things people have done to their computers, or have in mind to do to their
 computers. Then they come here to post their poison pen letters, looking for someone else to blame. There's nothing that Microsoft can do about that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a hard drive is not physically damaged, it's not only possible to extract the data, it's easy. I've done it enough times myself. All you need is a PATA and/or SATA-to-USB adapter with a power brick. If you want to get fancy, put the whole thing into a
 drive enclosure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time there's a major update to Windows, community forums are flooded with people who claim it 'destroyed' their computers ... how can Microsoft do this to its loyal customers ... don't they even test these things, etc. Happens with Windows 10, and
 it happened with&nbsp; Windows 8.1, Windows 8, 7, Vista, XP, etc. Nothing new here.<br />

            Oh I'm sorry.&nbsp; For some reason I was thinking I was thinking one wrong or bad line of code could do whatever it wanted. Windows is just programming and a program bad or intentional can damage hardware.&nbsp; Can't tell me a hard drive running at 100% for hours
 can not do damage.&nbsp; Glad I have been corrected. (sarcasm inserted). I have been building computers and writing programs since the early 80's so I think I am familiar with then things programs can do. I was just stating what I have observed. After all, we are
 all Microsoft's beta testers.

<p>I might add too,&nbsp; that most do not utilize, "Disk Cleanup," after installing or uninstalling software/programs, including after new MS updates. &nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other thing too, how many clean out their search engines via "Privacy &amp; Security," on a regular basis.&nbsp; Or so called "Browsing History."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Long story short, doing the above, will, maintain a smooth running system.&nbsp; Are they using Windows Security for example, if using Win 10.&nbsp; Might they run Free Malwarebytes every so often as another check?&nbsp; Maybe they are using some FREE ware security software?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, another issue might be that they think they need to update/upgrade their BIOS as manufacture recommends w/o knowing possible repercussions.&nbsp; Or they go in and check for any driver updates,&nbsp; w/o further thinking/investigating, before updating.&nbsp; This
 saying may apply to your computer, "If it ain't broke, Why fix it?"</p>

            Will it let you boot to automatic repair? If so, go to troubleshooting, then command prompt and try running sfc /scannow and see if that will fix it. If not do you have another computer you can redownload the windows 10 iso? If so you could try the repair
 my computer option and thy the repair that way. Otherwise you will probably have to do a clean install, unfortunately.&nbsp;

    <title>How set French display and Japanese IME input by default - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How set French display and Japanese IME input by default</h2>
                    <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm French and I've bought a japanese ultrabook. I'm under Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want set the display language to french but i want also keep Japanese IME input method to keep the real layout of keyboard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But it seems to be no solution to do this. Just i can set french display and set Japanese keyboard... not Japanese IME input method...&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's boring because the Japanese keyboard in French language don't match with JIS layout.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any solution ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a lots</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>Hi&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your answer but I'm a bit surprised because my edition is "Home" and not "Pro" (see below)</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/33bec03a-8263-4fa1-82dd-7f94d23eaadf" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>and I've IME method available (with display language set on Japanese)</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/38e996ba-768f-428b-b5c3-034202f598e6" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>So i can activate IME method but I can't set it by default only if display language is set on Japanese, not when it's set on French.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So are you sure that in "Pro" edition, this setting is possible ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recognize that this is just a parameter of comfort. But Windows being in basic Japanese version, I find it curious that we can not change the input method to the keyboard regardless of the display language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your answer, one more time :)</p>

    <title>Xbox Beta game pass PC. SLOW Download speed for all games - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spardaknightz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Beta game pass PC. SLOW Download speed for all games</h2>
                    Hello i have fiber internet and i am trying to download metro exodus with the pc xbox beta the download is extremely slow like 2 MB/s if i run a bandwidth test i get 800Mbps down and 800 Mbps and i do not have any issues downloading with Steam or Origin
 when downloading i normally get at least 80MB/s when downloading games and yes i know the difference between bits per second and bytes per second. Anyways are their any ports or anything that need to be open for better download speeds or is this just because
 everyone is trying the beta at the moment?

<p>Change your router setting to ipv6 only for the xb1x connection, change your dns one the console or for your router to a bettter one,I use cloudflare, 1.1.1.1,1.0.0.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Settings&gt;network&gt;advance&gt; DNS&gt;manual&gt;1y1y1y1 and 1y0y0y1(y is the space button on the xbox controller)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The rapid change in speed is likely do to a nat issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>Search your router online usually&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lifewire.com/192-168-1-1-818067" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">192.168.1.1</a>&nbsp;in a web browser to access it, if your router has the option make it ipv6 only, ipv6 doesnt use a nat or DMZ the xbox
 connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its alot better now then it was, xbox live was heavily&nbsp;throttled in the past.</p>
<p>
</p><p>QoS features on routers can be a issues, turning them off will get better speeds too.</p>

<h2>            Windows snapping leaving gap and white bar</h2>
                    When I snap a window by hitting it at the top of the screen it will maximize but if I do it again it will leave a gap and a white bar. Also the window is lower than it should be Help?

            I do believe this is actually a discord problem almost entirely. I only know this because I have the exact same issue with discord and not anything else, not games, not twitch, not every browser, or any other window. It may happen with some other random things but I believe it's just a bug right now.
<br />
<br />This is actually just a known bug with discord as you can find here: <a href="https://trello.com/c/405FvAO6/1898-window-doesnt-fully-maxmize-windows-1803-only" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://trello.com/c/405FvAO6/1898-window-doesn...</a>

            Thank you for the quick reply but I am facing this with oculus and spotify too. This wasn't happening a couple days ago before I did a fresh install of windows. So I believe it may be a problem with windows.

            Yes. Have you checked for any pending updates in your settings? This bug was fixed for a lot of people via a recent update. 
<br />
<br />Settings &gt; update &amp; Security &gt; scan for updates and apply them 
<br />
<br />If that didn't work then The only solution is sadly waiting for Microsoft to send out the update that fixes your system. As of right now there is no fix or troubleshooting other than updating windows. 
<br />
<br />This is a bug with the way the OS handles apps that have custom title bars - even Microsoft's own "Teams" app had this problem

    <title>New Intel Graphics Driver for SP3 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kaymack  say:</h3>
<h2>            New Intel Graphics Driver for SP3</h2>
                    <p>Has anyone tried the very recently released Intel Graphics Driver for their SP3? Intel is claiming 10% gain for gaming and 30% gain for GPU compute for 4th generation Haswell processors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.dailytech.com/MacBook+Air+Surface+Pro+3+Boosted+by+Intel+Graphics+Update/article36525.htm</p>
<p>GPU compute</p>
<p>30 percent faster OpenCL 2.0 performance</p>
<p>Accelerates your browser's rendering engine, Adobe Systems Inc.'s (ADBE) Photoshop, etc.</p>
<p>Support for new gaming standards</p>
<p>OpenGL 4.3 support</p>
<p>DirectX 11.2 support</p>
<p>Support for new algorithms</p>
<p>Conservative morphological anti-aliasing (CMAA)</p>
<p>A new technique for lower-end devices to perform anti-aliasing, the smoothing of jagged edges</p>
<p>Adaptive rendering</p>

<p>Game framerate improvements</p>
<p>Generally 8-12 percent in select titles, 3-7 percent in some additional titles</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wondering if it's okay to apply this update manually now without issue or if it's best to wait until MS issues it via system update (in case MS tweaks it before general issue to play better with SP3)?&nbsp;</p>

    <title>KB4057142 Cumalative update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            KB4057142 Cumalative update</h2>
                    <p>The newest cumulative update for Windows 10 keeps trying to install KB4057142. I have had no other issues with installing the updates before. The computer restarts many times and at the 75% point it fails and restores the previous version. Then it downloads
 the update and the cycle starts again. Using troubleshooter does not fix the issue, Any suggestions? I am purely an end user who can follow directions but not very knowledgeable.</p>

Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?<br />
Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.<br />
<br />
You can download it at the following link:<br />

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep getting a failed install on this one:</p>
<p>2018-01 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1607 for x64-based Systems (KB4057142)</p>
<p>
</p><p>8 failed attempts today alone according to the Windows Update History</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am <strong>beyond frustrated </strong>coming home every day from work and having to go through a painful exercise of restoring my previous build of Windows 10 because of the automatic install that occurs during the day.&nbsp; &nbsp;I am currently<span>&nbsp;on
 Windows 10 version 1607 OS build 14393.2207.</span></p>
<p>How can I stop these automatic updates that are consistently failing (stalling) each time at the 75% mark???&nbsp; I really don't see how your suggestion to Peggy to "manually" attempt the install will help
 to avoid the problem my install is having.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Scott,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Manually installing a Windows Update would avoid any conflicts with installing other updates. This way, it would tell us if the problem is related to a single update or to Windows Update core components. May we know if you have attempted to manually install
 the update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the problem persists even if installing it manually, have you tried blocking the update as what
<strong>Andre Da Costa </strong>have suggested? This is for us to know and to proceed with troubleshooting the update problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

<p>Hi, Peggy, I had the exact same problem as you. I searched many threads and found this reply in another thread:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Quote</p>
<p>I was having a similar problem, and after multiple attempts (over 7 times) trying different solutions like disabling virus protection, disabling startup programs, running update database corruption repair, etc. My computer never got past 81% before freezing
 and not updating.</p>
<div>I stumbled across a forum talking about problems with&nbsp; Anatel&nbsp; PCI-E Wlan cards (wi-fi) and old drivers that would hang up their computers and after removing the card (not just disabling) their machines would update and run fine. Since I was running my
 machine through an Ethernet connection, connected to an access point, I could remove the Anatel card in my computer and still have an internet connection. I tried it, and my computer a Gateway FX6860 updated to Windows 10 Fall Creators version without any
 problems. </div>
<div>
<p>Check to see if you have an Anatel wifi card and remove it and replace it with something newer or an Ethernet or usb connection to the internet and try the update. this worked for me."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have internet though a usb port so I simply took out the Wi-Fi card (which was an Anatel card) and tried the update and IT WORKED.</p>

<p>i am having a problem trying to install the creator update i assume because my computer does not have drivers out for it yet.</p>
<p>it does the same thing as everyone here but i have tried to block the install and it never shows anything. yet everyday it starts the download all over again. Never gives me an error just after installing it goes to a blank screen and then sits there for
 hours until i restart the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is when it says restoring to previous windows, and once again the endless cycle begins until finally it will kill my hard drive from having to hard shut down so many times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>how do you stop the dang update if the tool does not show the update.</p>

<p>Hi Shawn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the Creators Update is not installing on your computer, there might be compatibility issues with the computer with Windows 10 or that the downloaded update may be corrupted. May we know if you have checked with the manufacturer of your computer if it
 is compatible with Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a lighter note, you may check this <em><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/check-this-list-to-determine-if-your-computer-is/5152bb37-f95d-48a6-b7b2-ad0d5c738923">Forum Article</a></em> created by
<strong>Andre Da Costa</strong> to check if your computer is compatible with the Windows 10 Creators Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, aside from running the troubleshooter to hide updates, may we know what troubleshooting steps have you done so far? This is for us to know and to avoid any duplication of efforts on your end.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We look forward to your response.</p>

<p>Hi Scott,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Manually installing a Windows Update would avoid any conflicts with installing other updates. This way, it would tell us if the problem is related to a single update or to Windows Update core components. May we know if you have attempted to manually install
 the update?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the problem persists even if installing it manually, have you tried blocking the update as what
<strong>Andre Da Costa </strong>have suggested? This is for us to know and to proceed with troubleshooting the update problem.</p>
<p>

<p>I'm completely confused now.&nbsp; I attempted the manual installation of&nbsp;KB4057142 and once again it stalled at 82% (the stupid little circle of dots were frozen for several minutes until I gave it a hard reboot.&nbsp; Several hard reboots later and Windows told
 me it was restoring my system back to the previous build.&nbsp; The strange part is my Update History tells me&nbsp;Update for Windows (KB4057142) was successfully installed tonight.&nbsp; My About screen still says I'm on version 1607 OS build 14393.2035, meaning nothing
 has changed there.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will find out tomorrow morning whether Windows has attempted to install something else automatically (Windows Update tells me everything is up to date, but that statement has proven to be inaccurate on my system already).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advise on next steps.</p>

<p>Hi Scott</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been messing around with a clients computer for 2 days trying to update remotely I got 1603 in manually but 1709 is a no go. I have tried it all and I have been in the IT game 10 years. I will have to be physically at the computer to back it up and
 install from an ISO. My temp fix was to make the Ethernet and wireless ports managed you can do this via the settings page in some versions, if not you can do this via the registry you need to take ownership of the key though. Then I went and deleted the software
 distribution folder in C:\Windows. This way there is no update on your computer and Windows will not download it due to the fact you have made your networks managed. Hiding the update does not work and disabling windows update service takes butchering the
 PC. MS have messed up with their cleaver "We take all control away from the users" method. This is going to affect so many home users that don't have the technical knowledge to find work around's. You will be able to google the 2 steps I took.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this temp fix works till MS pull finger out, the last 2 updates have been a disaster.</p>

<h2>            &#40;Not solved&#41; Windows 7 Hangs at &#34;Starting Windows&#34; - Clean Boot No Effect.</h2>
                    <p><strong>Situation</strong></p>
<p>I have just upgraded Vista Home Premium (SP1) to Windows 7 Ultimate, both 32bit. The Vista install I started with was clean. I upgraded instead of custom installed, because some of the drivers for my machine are hard to find.</p>
<p>Initially, Windows 7 worked fine. There are no apparent driver or software conflicts (left). At one point it started hanging at "Starting Windows."</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Observations</strong></p>
<p>At the least, it seems the problem isn't with 3rd party drivers or software.</p>
<p>For a while, it was possible to get in via Last Known Good Configuration, but mostly that doesn't work anymore.</p>
<p>Windows will boot occasionally, (directly or via Last Known) even when no settings have been changed in the last session.<br />
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Windows will boot every time, after chkdsk runs at boot.</span> After that, it will hang again.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">The situation was temporarily resolved</span>, for about 10 startups back to back, by moving the partition to another location on the harddisk. Failure resumed when I tried to install software. (This software was not
 installed before, when the problem started and is not the cause itself, but may point to a problem with the boot data.)</p>
<p>I have seen several warnings that the system did not shut down cleanly, but the shutdowns seem clean.<br />
</p>
<p>The odd thing is that neither chkdsk or other disk software finds disk or boot sector errors, nor did sfc find problems with system files.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Tried</strong></p>
<p>Startup Repair - Can not find the cause.</p>
<p>Device Manager - No problems.</p>
<p>msconfig (services and startup) - I have tried disabling half the services and startups with msconfig, then the other half, then all, then all, including Microsoft services. Even with all services and startup disabled in msconfig (Safe Mode), Windows 7 hangs
 at "Starting Windows."</p>
<p>msconfig (bootlog) - Everything loads up to CLASSPNP, then lots of "did not loads".</p>
<p>msconfig (no UI) - Everything loads up to CLASSPNP, then nothing happens.</p>
<p>sfc - No problems.</p>
<p>dism - No problems.</p>
<p>chkdsk (/f) (1st) - Fixed several problems at boot. First boot after always succesful, after that as before. chkdsk reports no further problems.</p>
<p>C: /Properties/Tools/Error checking/Auto fix &amp; Scan bad (chkdsk /f /r) (2nd) - No problems.</p>
<p>perfmon (/report<em>) - </em>No problems.</p>
<p>bootrec (/fixboot) - Completes.</p>
<p>bootrec (/fixmbr) - Completes.</p>
<p>bootrec (/rebuildbcd) - Including rename C:\boot\bcd bcd.old. Finds OS and completes.<br />
</p>
<p>bootrec (/scanos) - Finds no OS.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />

</a></p>
<p>When I'm trying to hit up the Activision Support to help me, you can't even choose what game you want help with! Atleast there is no option for Call of Duty 4. And when I'm trying to write a message to them I have to select one option where to send it too,
 of course, it's the customer support, and when I press this alternative I get back to the same website again where I can do nothing. I'm really tired of this and I have wrote a long message to Infinity Ward about my rank etc. got deleted/reset. I haven't got
 any answer yet, but I think this is really ridicoulus how you buy a game that is really fun and it all just get messed up!</p>

<p>Short answer: No</p>
<p>Long answer: Many electronics may produce a metal smell when they are used. For example if you smell the top of your controller after a bit of play you will recive this smell. If that smell of the controller and the smell of the console are the same they
 you're fine. If not... They're may be further problems. Also could it not be the console? Maybe where it is placed on a table with a certain type of pain or near other items that give off scent?</p>

<p>It could be, its on a plastic container. But theres a pillow case and bag between the case and the console

<p>I have 3 different codes from 3 different games/bundles that all say invalid. &nbsp;I bought the Kinect Star Wars System Bundle(160 code) a little over a month ago, the code said invalid, but I thought nothing of it, but over this past weekend I bought Dance
 Central 2(240 code) &amp; Disneyland Kinect(160 code) for the kids, both of which also came with a code, but also both say invalid. &nbsp;Everything was bought new, so I know they haven't been previously used, besides, if they were they would say "redeemed", right?
 &nbsp;Just wondering if anyone can help me.</p>

<span>The codes you are trying to redeem may very well have been used, If you bought it new i suggest take it back to the store and tell them your situation, I'm am sure they will be glad to help you get a new game code or refund you

<p>I've typed, and retyped the codes more times than I'd like. &nbsp;I did bring it to the stores attention, they said that if the games were sealed, as they were, then it is on Microsoft's end, and I should contact them, which is absolutely correct, so I am. &nbsp;Besides,
 even Microsoft Point codes say "This code has already been redeemed." if it had indeed been used.</p>

<p>Hey there Slevin! I'm a little unfamiliar with the codes you are referring to. Are these cardboard cards that came in a game case? Was it an advertised bonus on the box, or was there just one inside? Also, do these code cards have any indication of an expiration
 date on them? Thanks for the info! </p>

<p>The two 160MSP codes that came with Kinect Star Wars Bundle &amp; Disneyland Kinect are both paper Kinect ad booklets with a code on the back and don't expire until Dec. 30th, 2012. &nbsp;The 240 MSP code that came with Dance Central 2 is a cardboard(I guess) slip
 that expired on June 30th, 2012, which is the day(last Saturday) I bought the games. &nbsp;Either way, I've never encountered an expired code. &nbsp;They've always work well beyond any expiration date.

For the other two - can you PM me the codes so I can take a look at them? We can verify if they are expired, used already or invalid. Thanks! </p>

<h2>            Roll Forward again to Win 10</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a spare computer running Windows 7. I installed on it Win 10 during the free upgrade period, but because of difficulties connecting to the internet, I rolled back to Win 7.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now I would like try once more to get Win 10 up and running on this computer. I seem to remember a message when I rolled back saying I could roll forward again if I chose to.&nbsp; How can I do this? I still have the Win 10 ISO disk. Will it still work?
 Or is there another way?</p>

            <p>if you have previously installed and activated windows 10 on that device you can reinstall it any time.</p>
<p>the iso you have may be out of date and will mean a lot of updates (possible including the anniversary update) to download.</p>

<h2>            photo app print quality</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I print photos through the photo app, it does not print evenly.&nbsp; There is a thick line that prints brighter than the rest of the picture so it looks like a fat line through people's faces. This is not a printer issue- it prints fine if I print through
 the edit/paint app, but then I can't adjust the size (e.g., 5x7, 4x6, etc.).&nbsp; Is this a Microsoft issue that the company needs to fix through an update?&nbsp; Or is there a way to fix this?</p>

            Hi Heather.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />To try to fix Photos app Reset and Repair Photos app at Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features &gt; Photos app &gt; Advanced Options.  Your pictures will be safe in the User Pictures folder.  
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help try re-registering the Photos app from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can try a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1903 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  There are improvements in Photos app in Version 1903 so I would do this without hesitation.
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Heather
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Does this happen if you try printing the image through File Explorer instead of in the photos app?
<br />
<br />You right click the image then click Open file location
<br />
<br />Right the image then click Print
<br />Try using the Photo printing wizard to print it. 
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />	Click Windows PowerShell (Admin). 
<br />
<br />	At the command prompt, type the following, hit Enter the restart. 
<br />
<br />get-appxpackage *Microsoft.Windows.Photos* | remove-appxpackage 
<br />
<br />Download again from the Store:
<br />
<br />Get Microsoft Photos - Microsoft Store

<h2>            I am having trouble with windows live mail authorizing with my ISP when I try to download my email.</h2>
                    When I open my windows live mail to get my email the log in box pops up requesting that I input my username and password even though it is saved in the program.&nbsp; I have tried reentering the information with no success.&nbsp; The problem is intermittent, sometimes
 windows live mail will connect and download and sometimes it won't.&nbsp; I have contacted Windstream (my ISP) on several occasions and they say the problem is not on their end.&nbsp; When windows live mail will not connect I can still access my email remotely through
 the Windstream website.

            <p>Hi Herman,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting your query about Windows Live Mail. Since you can access your account through your email provider's site, what I can suggest is to reconfigure your account so we can isolate if the issue is caused by misconfiguration of your account. You
 can do this by following the steps <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/mail-add-email-account-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>here</strong></a> on how to remove and add again the account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kindly update us afterwards.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Richard</p>

            I have reconfigured and reconfigured.&nbsp; I have even completely deleted and then completely set my email account back up.&nbsp; Nothing seems to work.&nbsp; Just before this reply my email downloaded out of the blue.&nbsp; We will see what tomorrow holds.

<h2>            Wifi stays connected while device in sleep</h2>
                    Hello.<br />
<br />
I just got my new Surface RT, and I can't find how to disable that the device stays connected to the wifi network while the device sleeps. After I have closed the device, or put it to sleep with he power putton, people can see me online in msn, facebook and
 skype, and are sending me messages, assuming that I'm online. That is quite ennoying, especially if the device is just sitting in my backpack.<br />
<br />
Any one else with this problem ? Anyone knows a solution ?<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
<br />
Bert Lagaisse<br />

            Hello BertLagaisse,<br />
<br />
You can turn the Messaging app off from running in the background/lockscreen.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
1. Open the <b>Messaging </b>app<br />
2. Swipe from the Right<br />
3. Touch <b>Settings</b><br />
4. Touch <b>Permissions</b><br />
5. Turn off the <b>Lock Screen</b> option<br />
<br />
Let us know if that helps.

            <p>There should be a way to stop all communication if the device is sleeping without us having to go to each app to disable them from running.&nbsp; I should be able to have my WiFi on and simply hit the power button to have EVERYTHING sleep, not just some things.&nbsp;
 This causes the battery to drain overnight.&nbsp; I want my WiFi on when I wake up the surface, which is why I don't want to disable WiFi each time I put the surface to sleep.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this possible?&nbsp; If not, can you submit this as feedback?</p>

            <p>Windows 8 and Windows RT use Connected Standby (S0iX) which is a new power state similar to what we have on Smart Phones, currently supported on ARM and Intel's Clover Trail SoC and will come to Intel's Core i-CPUs with the Haswell Chipset. This allows for
 email, and other connected apps to receive data while it is in a low power sleep state. This way we don't need to wait for information to download.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is by design, you can adjust the applications or shut the computer completely off....also if your Network Connection is metered it will not download information while in the Connected Standby state.</p>

<p>I did try the permissions setting for E-mail and closed the E-mail client before hitting the power button.&nbsp; When I came back a few hours later new E-mail was waiting for me.&nbsp; Any other way to get it to not check mail when not in use?&nbsp; For now I'll just have
 to remember to turn off WiFi before hitting the power button, and turn it back on when I want to use the tablet.</p>

If you really want to make sure it cannot connect to anything while in Sleep mode, you can enable Airplane mode so it shuts all radio's off.

            <p>How does it know that you're on a metered internet connection? I live in Rwanda and have to pre-pay for internet ($150 for 30 GB) and every time I put my surface to sleep I come back later to see it's eaten through all my data. I've spent nearly $300 this
 month, most of it for a sleeping Surface Pro 3 to chat with people while I'm not home.</p>

<h3> n00bsysadmin  say:</h3>
<h2>            GPO issues on Surface Pro</h2>
                    <p>I have a Surface Pro in my environment that appears to be getting a GPO applied successfully which is set to append the local admin group and make a specific user an admin on a specific machine. &nbsp;This is done through item level targeting the computer name
 and adding the specific user to the local admin group. &nbsp;There are over 150 different targets with different users working fine. &nbsp;This is the second time there has been an issue and both times have been with Surfaces. &nbsp;One running win8 this one running win10.
 &nbsp;The RSOP returns that the policy is being applied, and it kind of is, but what is happening is the other approx 100 users are being added to the admin group and the one and only person that should be added is not. &nbsp;If I add this user to another computer object
 it works as expected and they are an admin. &nbsp;It only seems to be this machine which leads me down the Surface path. &nbsp;I have checked wmi filters on the policy and there isn't anything there to exclude, but I know something isn't functioning as it should. &nbsp;Any
 suggestions? &nbsp;I was looking down the path of chassis type or windows version but again I don't see anything that is looking at that to filter. &nbsp;Thanks.</p>
