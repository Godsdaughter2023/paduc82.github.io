    <title>Windows 8.1 refresh deleted all my programms. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jutradzargo  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 refresh deleted all my programms.</h2>
                    I had to do a refresh because my pc couldnt run without disabling the driver signature verification (had errors that tell me to repair my pc). So i did a refresh. After the refresh, my pc got downgraded to windows 8 (i had windows 8.1) and all my files
 got deleted, but when i check my hdd space, it got the same free space as it was before the refresh. I feel like m progs are still there but hidden. Any solutions to get back to windows 8.1 and get my progs back if they are still there but hidden. ?

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would like to know some information.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to perform clean boot and check, using this Microsoft Article because may be a third party application is causing this issue.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>NOTE:
</strong>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot
 or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When
 you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent
 you from following these steps. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><span>https://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”</strong> to boot the computer in normal mode.</span></p>

    <title>My pc won&#39;t reset - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alexander&#39;1  say:</h3>
<h2>            My pc won&#39;t reset</h2>
                    <p>My problem is pretty simple, I think</p>
<p>I want to reset my PC because I want to clean it from all of the stuff that I have been doing to and in it.</p>
<p>For some reason that I can't understand, my pc won't reset.</p>
<p>I went to settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Recovery &gt; Get Started &gt; Remove Everything &gt; Just Remove My Files (I want to keep my own computer, obviously) &gt; Reset &gt; Infinite wait with the text "
<strong>Resetting this PC&nbsp;</strong>- <em>This will take a few minutes and your PC will restart</em>" and a cancel button.</p>
<p>You could respond me something like "Well, just leave it there waiting until it works!"</p>
<p>There are two problems with that answer</p>
<p>1: I left my computer around 2 to 4 hours waiting "a few minutes." When I came back from my stuff nothing happened, I found my PC in sleeping mode.</p>
<p>2: I have already "reseted" my PC before. There was no "infinite wait" loop and it only took about 10 to 5 minutes for my PC to start the process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now that I have stated properly my little problem, can somebody help me and tell me a solution that would make my PC finally reset?</p>

<p>Hi Alexander,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please take note that using <strong>Reset This PC</strong> with the <strong>Remove Everything</strong> option will take some time to complete, but in the end, you'll find that it is a straightforward operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Resetting your PC through Windows Settings option didn't work, here's another way to reset your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can get to reset by restarting your PC from the sign-in screen. Press the <strong>
Windows logo</strong> key + <strong>L</strong> to get to the sign-in screen, then
<strong>hold the Shift key down</strong> while you <strong>select Power</strong>&nbsp; &gt;
<strong>Restart</strong> in the lower-right corner of the screen. After your PC restarts, select
<strong>Troubleshoot</strong> &gt; <strong>Reset</strong> this PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please see this <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Hacked Account being investigated - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> appstsundance  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hacked Account being investigated</h2>
                    
<p>My account was hacked into about a month ago. The person took all 6,000+ Microsoft points that I had and downloaded them to their console. I immediately contacted Microsoft and spoke to a rep that took my information and gave me a service request #, telling
 me that the investigation would take about 3-5 days, and that they would either email or call me with an update of what they had found.</p>
<p>After a week of not hearing anything, I called back again. I gave the new rep my service request # and they told me that it had been escalated and that the investigation team was looking at it. They said that it shouldn't be much longer now since a week
 had already gone by, no longer than another week. Again, I was told that I would receive email updates and/or a phone call about this issue.</p>
<p>10 more days went by and I called back again. This time the rep on the phone told me that they could see that it was still escalated but could not tell me anything about what was going on with the issue. Apparently no one at the customer service center can
 contact the investigation team and get any updates. So he basically told me I would just have to wait until they are done. I asked him how he knew they were actually looking into it since he can't communicate with them in any way, and he didn't have a good
 answer for me.</p>
<p>Above all, I am just really frustrated. I understand that some things can take time, but I was told that I would be updated on what was going on, not to mention that it has now been a month since I first reported the issue. 6000 points is almost $80 worth,
 on top of the fact that I pay $60 a year for xbox live, I would expect better service than this.</p>
<p>Is my only option to keep calling back over and over and over, and get the same answers every time? How is it that customer service can have no communication with their investigation team? That just seems really hard to believe. Do I have any other options?
 I am beginning to wonder if they hope will just stop calling and give up getting my points back.</p>
<p>In any case, they are losing a loyal customer in the process.</p>

<p>Well, it's not that I can't be patient or don't mind waiting for them to do their job. But when they tell me that I will get emails updating me within the week and now it's been a month and I still haven't heard anything back, it's just frustrating.</p>
<p>I just feel there should be better communication to the customer, especially when it involves an investigation into their account. I'm doing my part by calling 4-5 times to check up on it, but I should be getting updates from them, which has not happened
 one time.</p>

<p>It was most likely the fact that I used the same email and password for other website/services. I've never given out my log-in information and am smart enough not to go to websites that promise free MS points. I've also never played my account on anyone
 else's Xbox.</p>
<p>The first rep on the phone figured that they might have got into my windows live id, because I had to change the password when he walked me through it. So apparently the person obtained my email and password, then recovered my gamertag onto their system.
 Downloaded 6000 pts worth of DLC to their hard drive and logged out.</p>
<p>When I went to log-in, it gave me an error, telling me that I could not log in to this system with that information. So it was obvious that the person recovered my gamertag. Also, none of the DLC that was downloaded was on my harddrive, so I gave the rep
 my console ID so that they could &nbsp;track's whose it went to during the investigation.</p>
<p>Now, I can only guess as to this is what happened. That's the only conclusion the first rep could figure when looking at all the facts of what happened. Hopefully now that I've changed my email and password, that person cannot get back in, or anyone else
 for that matter. I've also gone on my other social network accounts and changed all the passwords on those as well as my PSN account.</p>
<p>If you have any other ideas to what might have happened, let me know. This is the first time something like this has happened to me. Hopefully it can get resolved soon, and I hope Microsoft has a policy to punish the person who broke into my account. Do
 they take legal action against those people?</p>

<p>Something you should look at is whether or not your password was on one of your social networking profiles. I don't mean you had something like "my password for my WLID is dave" on your profile somewhere but say your password was the name of your dog and
 you had a picture of your dog on your profile with his name. Social Engineering hackers especially will trawl people's social networking profiles for potential passwords. Could be worth looking into.</p>

<p>VernierSlake - Now that you bring that up, this is a good possibility. Now that this has happened, I'm a lot more careful with choosing a password that can't be as easy to figure out.</p>
<p>One more question I thought of, though. Once MS investigation finds the owner of the console ID that my MS points were used on, will they wait to get back to me after they have contacted that person and taken action, or will I be updated beforehand? I really
 have no idea how these things work. </p>

<p>How it works is this - </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once you've got an unauthorised access investigation under way your account is locked and rendered unusable for the duration of the investigation. Once the investigation is complete the account will be returned to your possesion (I think they tell you to
 recover it) and you're back in business. The first indication the thief will have of the net closing in is the account ceasing to work then the account disappearing from their console and finally them being banned for pinching accounts, as far as I'm aware
 XBLPET don't inform the suspect that such an investigation is going on and I know for certain they aren't told in advance of any pending banning. You won't be informed of what action will be taken against the thief (but it's a guaranteed permaban) nor told
 of when that action was carried out or who it was that did it. However you are free to peruse the "my account was suspended" forum looking for anyone you suspect that has been banned for account theft.

<p>Well, they actually recovered my account for me the first day that I called; once I verified my console ID and security question. I'm able to play on XBox Live and use my account. I'm just still waiting on the investigation in order to get my 6000+ points
 back.</p>
<p>The rep on the phone when I called the first time said something about being able to see the console ID # that the DLC went to with the points that were used. And something about that being how they would track the thief down. Not sure how that works, but
 I'm guessing MS has a record of all console ID's on file and who owns XBL accounts for each one?</p>
<p>I'm glad I got my account recovered though. That would have been terrible to have to wait this long without being able to log in. I just really want my points back though :(. I traded a lot of my regular 360 games and bought MS points for the summer of arcade
 this year. Just hard to wait after a month now : /</p>

<h2>            My Windows DVD Player App is not working</h2>
                    I recently bought a new laptop and was very annoyed to find that DVDs would not play. After upgrading to Windows 10 I decided to give in and purchase the Windows DVD Player app (which cost £13). It does not play DVDs at all, and continuously tells me to
 insert a DVD, no matter which disc I try. I've tried troubleshooting and restarting, but nothing is working.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions:</p>
<p>1) Yes it is visible under the devices and drivers.</p>
<p>2) I cannot open disks from the DVD player, it does not recognise that there is a disk and tells me to insert one.</p>
<p>3) I'm not sure? What are the drivers and how would I install them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>You probably already know that win 10 Media Player cannot play video dvds. The dvd player has been removed from Windows Media Player. The Windows dvd app has had a lot of complaints about not working especially since you have to pay for it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You need another 3rd party player to play videos. See this--</p>

            Thanks for your reply but I've tried third party players such a VLAN and these do not work either.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried the App troubleshooter&nbsp;and it made no difference.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can see the DVD in the Device and Drives folder, however, when I put a dvd in via windows dvd player&nbsp;and click on the "play" triangle, nothing happens at all.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've also tried just clicking on the dvd via the device and drives folder and all it always does is pop open the dvd tray and says "please insert dic" when there is already a disk inside.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not interested in going into the whole "debate" about this not working, I'm just hoping that you will be able to rectify my problem, if not then I assume that you will refund the £11 as quite clearly the app doesn't seem to work for anyone.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm optimistic though, that you will be able to offer solutions.</p>

            App trouble shooter could not identify a problem. This is absolutly frustrating. Paid for an app that does not work...breach of contract. Ive had the app since upgrading to Win 10. Why do Microsoft not just start paying the licensing fees to the companies
 and let us watch our DVD collections....it's not like you can't afford the fees! Very angry!!<br />

<h2>            Blue Screen at seemingly random times, becoming more frequent the last couple days.  BCCode&#58; d1</h2>
                    It went to BSOD a couple times over the last few weeks, usually when playing games. Then it happened when I was typing on a word document. It has become more frequent over the last day or two, peaking today. I had to run in safe mode because it would go
 to the BSOD within 5-10 minutes. I'm running Windows 7 Pro 64-bit. Here are the crash details from the first two times it happened. I have the dmp files as well, if there's somewhere I can send upload them.&nbsp; Thank you.<br />

            <p>The minidump files showed various stop errors such as <br />
SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED_M (1000007e), and PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA (50).</p>
<p>Most of the errors pointed to the atikmdag.sys which is the ATI display driver.</p>
<p>Two of the errors pointed to a Norton driver or process causing the crash.</p>
<p>What i would suggest is to update the ATI display driver to the latest version available.</p>
<p>Also, uninstall Norton and use alternative security such as Microsoft Security Essentials.</p>
<p>Consider also updating the BIOS as there been several updates since the version (0402)&nbsp;now installed with some of the updates&nbsp;improving stability.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8 Bootcamp BSOD &#124; System thread exception not handled igdkmd64.sys</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
I'm running Windows 8 (which is awesome btw) on my Imac over Bootcamp.<br />
Couple days ago I installed some Intel Graphics ... update through Windows Update. I can't remember the full name of that update but it was optional update. I can't find it in the update history either<br />
<br />
Anyway, after that update my computer has been crashing every time when waking up from sleep mode<br />
<br />
Is there way to unistall that particular update or revert system back to the state it was prior that update?<br />

<p>This is associated with&nbsp;an Intel Graphics device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Problems with Solitaire</h2>
                    <p>My OS is 7x64 IE9. I've encountered problems when playing Solitaire. When I first play the game the cards shuffle out okay. However, when I click on "play again" the cards just appear - no dealing. another an instance is that sometimes it acts as if have
 double-clicked on the stack. The last problem is that when I try to undo a previous turn of the cards it won't let me go back until I continually click undo.</p>
<p>I have uninstalled and re-installed the game - nothing changes. I tried to find tutorials dealing with similar problems - no answers! Thinking maybe it might be a malware issue I ran scans with Malwarebytes and MSE and nothing was found. Some time ago I
 read where some malware exploits solitaire.exe. I don't know if that is the case and the security software can't detect. FWIW I also ran SuperAntispyware and the results were negative. Suggestions, anyone?</p>

            <p>&nbsp;It tells me your computer has a case of the flu.&nbsp; I'd back up any data I want to keep before it develops into pneumonia.&nbsp; The fix is to restore your computer to factory settings,so get those backups done while you can, and read up on what you need to do
 to restore your computer.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Good luck.</p>

    <title>Power media won&#39;t play DVD&#39;s - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> curtis2015  say:</h3>
<h2>            Power media won&#39;t play DVD&#39;s</h2>
                    <p>I accidentally deleted the pre-installed version of Cyberlink Power Media (while chasing some adware).&nbsp; So I went to the Microsoft store and purchased and downloaded it.&nbsp; Store said download was successful.&nbsp; However when I insert a DVD, I get an error message
 stating "desktop version of Power Media not installed".&nbsp; This is followed by and endless circle of "loading".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!!</p>

    <title>Skype using too much CPU - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rebecca1mc  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype using too much CPU</h2>
                    <p>I've been having an issue where Skype is using too much of the CPU. It will use a very high percentage, my idle will go down to just about 0%, and the computer will freeze and force me to restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happens when trying to do almost anything else while also on Skype. I can't watch a YouTube video, load pages that have a moderate number of pictures, and certainly not Photoshop at the same time as I am on Skype.
<strong>This has not always been the case</strong>, up until maybe two weeks ago I could load videos on YouTube and multiple websites with ease and also use Photoshop (though at a slightly slower pace).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried doing other potentially taxing things with my computer and the percent that is idle remains in the 90% range when things are already loaded and open and drops only to the mid to upper 80% range when opening programs or loading things.
<strong>That is why I believe it to be a Skype issue.</strong> Should I uninstall and reinstall Skype? I also read about clearing the cache for Skype but I just want to make sure I will not lose my chat messages by doing that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a mid 2012 Macbook Pro running El Capitan with a 2.5ghz i5 processor, and 16gb of ram and a 480gb SSD I installed myself.<br />

<h2>            Windows Media Center w&#47;Windows 7 &#38; AVerMedia H339 TV Cards Fails SetUp</h2>
                    
<p>I have a new Dell XPS L701X with the AVerMedia H339 Hybrid Analog/ATSC/QAM TV Card, Driver version 2.2.64.69....</p>
<p>I have tied the shipped Rabbits Ear antennea which located several digital channels but none with a signal strength over 2 bars, not enough for a picture.</p>
<p>I tried connecting my local cable with the provided adaptor (Time Warner Cable,&nbsp;Analog set-top box (Ventura, CA.))&nbsp; I ran through the entire setup process all the way to the point where it asks which channel to use (2, 3, 4)&nbsp; 3 is my channel.&nbsp; It then opened
 a small preview window and dispalyed the channel, I was even able to change channel.&nbsp; BUT when I pressed the Finalize button it said the IR cable was not connected.</p>
<p>I contacted Dell, who had no idea how to resolve the message.&nbsp; I then contacted Time Warner who said the IR port on the back of the Set Top box was not supported or used by them.</p>
<p>Does anyone know how to get the TV card to work?&nbsp; Or was I ripped of?</p>
<p>Thanks<br />
Phill</p>

<p><span>I used the wrong word in my description, to be precise, you will need to select antenna.<br />
Here are the steps:</span></p>
<p><span>Open Media Center and go to Tasks, Settings, TV, Setup TV Signal, follow the steps until you get to the Setup your TV signal page. On that page, select I Will Manually Configure My TV Signal, select Antenna,
 then Analog only antenna. After you select that option continue through the setup process. After it is finished, change to channel to what the box is set for and you should see the video.</span></p>

                    <p>I purchased a laptop two years ago which was pre-loaded with OEM Windows 8.1 Home. I have since tried/upgraded to Windows 10. I prefer Windows 7 Home for my laptop. I have identified the Windows 8.1 product key within my laptop's BIOS using a software utility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I use this product key I've identified which is from a Windows 8.1 Home installation to activate a fresh Windows 7 Home installation?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Windows 7 Home disc which I want to use after formatting my Laptop.</p>

            <p>Windows 7 Home Basic uses its own unique product key. A Windows 8.1 product key will not activate Windows 7 Home Basic. You will need to purchase a license for Windows 7.

            Been having the same problem, but it's been going on for months. It's driving me nuts, because Win10 will kick me out in the middle of whatever I'm doing to remind me I need to update, but every time the update fails. I'm ready to go back to Win7.

<p>Thanks PA Bear,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To answer your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1)&nbsp; Computer purchased in 5/2013.</p>
<p>2) I came with Windows 8 installed and later an upgrade to Windows 10 was done.</p>
<p>3) It's an HP desktop.</p>
<p>4) I purchased a Norton Security app some time ago,&nbsp;but a few years ago cancelled and deleted it and installed the McAfee security app available for free through my ISP provider - ATT U-Verse.</p>
<p>5) Not sure about this answer.&nbsp; If by removal tool you mean deleting the program from the computer, &nbsp;I would have done this with Norton, not with McAfee.</p>
<p>6) The OS build is 15063.413.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to mention it, I've done many Windows Updates on this computer over the years and have never had this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help,&nbsp; I certainly appreciate it.</p>
<p>PBEX</p>

<p>Sorry for the slow reply,&nbsp;other stuff and holiday getting in the way.&nbsp; To answer your 6/28/17 questions:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I was unable to find the AT&amp;T Internet Security Suite created date through your directions.&nbsp; However, in the notes I keep about changes/additions to the computer I found that I cancelled and deleted Norton in 8/2015 at which time I believe I actuated
 my McAfee AT&amp;T Internet Security Suite.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Yes</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) 6/13/17</p>
<p>
</p><p>4) A manual check for updates in Windows 10 result:&nbsp; "Device is up to date". </p>
<p>
</p><p>5) Creators update not shown in Update History for 6/2017.&nbsp; I think I remember that update being offered through Windows Update recently.&nbsp; I only do my updates through Windows Update.&nbsp; I check it most nights.</p>
<p>

            <p>This is not a question or the start of a discussion.&nbsp; I'm just hoping I can get this message to Pa Bear in this forum.&nbsp; He had been trying to help me with a "Windows failed to install" (KB 4020102&nbsp; 6/16/17) problem.&nbsp; We messaged each other a few times, but
 when I tried to reply to his third message I received a Mailer Daemon error, unable to deliver.&nbsp; At that point I threw in the towel and called a computer repair guy we know and we've been able to resolve the install problem.&nbsp; Just want PA Bear to know I wasn't
 ignoring him,&nbsp; rather I just couldn't respond to him. &nbsp; I very much appreciated the time and effort he put in to try to help me.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>What you are experiencing with your screen can be caused by certain scenarios that may include software issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To address this concern, we suggest that you perform a <strong>two-button shutdown</strong>. Here's how:<br />
<br />
1. Press and hold the volume-up button and power button at the same time for at least 15 seconds and then release both.<br />
2. The screen may flash the Surface logo, but continue holding the buttons down for at least 15 seconds.<br />
3. After you release the buttons, wait 10 seconds.<br />
4. Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. You should see the Surface logo.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, follow the steps provided by <strong>CindyMonteiro</strong> from this
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfpro2-surfhardware/black-screen-trusted-platform-module-tpm/d559a47f-5a65-448e-8116-4c439fe8b022">

 Drive Encryption to help protect your files on an entire drive. BitLocker can help block hackers from accessing the system files they rely on to discover your password, or from accessing your drive by physically removing it from your PC and installing it in
 a different one. <span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To setup bitlocker for the drive, refer to the below link:</span></span></p>

<p>Note: This is a Roleplaying Thread hence you have to be in <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
Character</span>&nbsp;and all people who join the thread have to join the town at a starting position. This post is where all new people join in. Please try to use your gamertag. Normally to do and say stuff you go as follows:</p>
<p><b>*</b><i><b>Italic and Bold*</b> = To do something</i></p>
<p><i>Hello = To say something</i></p>
<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p><b>*<i>You awake in a world filled with lush colors and plant life covering the trees. You get up and start walking and within minutes you see a small village on the horizon. It's the only people you have seen since you got to... to this place and soon you
 find yourself running towards with nearly no thought needed. You reach the village gates and are greeted by greetings of 'hello'</i>*</b>
</p>
<p>"That, young child, is where I come in." You hear a man say, in a experienced tone, behind you "I am BiotecKiller and you have landed in this world where we all have all been trapped. Many of us have started out just as you have. Feel free to explore the
 town. Come see me in my office in Town Hall.</p>
