<h2>            Windows 10 Computer hanging up</h2>
                    <p>Every now and then, seems like at odd times but my computer hangs up for a solid 30 seconds or so. It's gotten to the point where I really want to get this figured out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've come across this event during Heroes of the Storm game, Photoshop, Fusion360 and Adobe illustrator. And I was just trying to create a new folder and it hung up on me. Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Ghost.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />Updating drivers from the Device Manager or Windows Update is rarely enough. The most basic thing we need to learn to maintain a PC is keep the latest manufacturer's drivers installed from the PC or Device maker's Support Downloads web page.
<br />
<br />2) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />3) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br /> I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

 the screen, I didn’t know how to handle the situation and force shutdown my pc by holding down the power button. From there i was still in the recovery tools however some options were gone and all didn’t work. By that time i had looked online for assistance
 and found that going into the command prompt and doing commands such as chkdsk /f/r c: would help or solve these issues. However it didn’t work, I eventually tried a command /fixboot i cant remember the command then i did chkdsk again. When it was finished
 I restarted my pc and now i am on this screen.</span></p>

            Hi Armin.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year WIndows MVP here to help you.
<br />
<br />1) Use whichever method works in this link to access Advanced Startup Options: <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br /> 
<br />If none of the other methods work it may be necessary to Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer.   If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br /> 
<br />2) In the Advanced Troubleshooting options try to System Restore  to a point before the problems began. If this fails try a Startup Repair. 
<br />
<br />3) From Startup Settings try to get into Safe Mode with Networking.  If Startup Settings aren't available you can force Safe Mode from Command Prompt using the command to unhide F8 Advanced Startup Options given here: <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2984712/windows/how-to-enter-windows-10s-safe-mode.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcworld.com/article/2984712/windows/...</a>
<br /> 
<br />From Safe Mode w/Networking work through this Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>  
<br />
<br />4) If Safe Mode doesn’t work or help stabilize things then return to Troubleshoot options to Reset Your Windows 10 PC:  <a href="http://www.laptopmag.com/articles/reset-windows-10-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.laptopmag.com/articles/reset-windows...</a>
<br /> 
<br />5) If that fails or you want the gold standard install do the Clean Install at  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.   You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the tutorial linked. It is a better install than any amount of money can buy.  
<br /> 
<br />6) An alternative is to run Factory Recovery from it’s hotkey at boot; find yours by googling the “PC make/model + Run Factory Recovery.”   But keep in mind the Factory install is greatly inferior to a Clean Install, a Windows-only Reset or a Refresh without the crippling factory bloatware.  After Recovery mitigate the inferior factory install with the Checklist steps from earlier.
<br />
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

<p>"Deleting" a file doesn't actually delete it; it just marks the space<br />
as available to be used. There are third-party programs that can<br />
sometimes recover deleted files. The problem is that the space used by<br />
the file is likely to become overwritten very quickly, and this makes<br />
the file unrecoverable.</p>
<p>So your chances of successfully recovering this file are decent if you<br />
try recovering it immediately after deleting it, and rapidly go<br />
downhill from there. If you've been using the computer since then (for<br />
example to write this question and read this answer), your chances may<br />
be very poor by now.</p>
<p>But if the file is important enough, it's worth a try anyway. Stop<br />
using the computer in question immediately, if you haven't done so<br />
already. Download an undelete program (here's one:<br />
<a href="http://www3.telus.net/mikebike/RESTORATION.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www3.telus.net/mikebike/RESTORATION.html</a> but there are several<br />
others to choose from; do a search) on a friend's computer and bring<br />
it to yours on a floppy, CD, or thumb drive to try.</p>
<p>If this fails, your only other recourse is to take or send the drive<br />
to a professional file recovery company. This kind of service is very<br />
expensive and may or may not work in your case.</p>

<p>" first of all sorry for that i mistakenly type incorrect model no earlier of my sony vaio it is actually SVE15136CNB and i check it compatible to win 10...the upgrading problem is that from media creation tool 1809 setup is starting 100% progress completed
 downloading it consumes approx 4gb of hard disk the check for updates and around 46%struck then after hours its shown then the complete message is shown&nbsp;</p>
<p>This device is not compatible to win 10 contact the manufacturer for more info AMD Radeon Hd 7550/7650M graphics (you will have problems with your display in win 10) then shows a confirm option upon which when i click the installation on blue screen is started
 and after 100% restarting black screen comes and same win 8.1 startup screen comes after login all the downloading 4gb space consumed is gone and failed to upgrade in 10. One more problem besides this is that when i upgraded to win 8.1 the check for updates
 in the control panel also doesn't&nbsp; works it shows endless loop of checking for updates but shows nothing just everytime checking for updates i run sfcscan where it shows your window resource protection component is coruurpted or failed like message&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Which version of Windows is installed on the computer?</p>
<p>2. Have you made any changes to the computer, prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Run the fixit available at the following link.</p>
<p><b>Diagnose and fix Windows Firewall service problems automatically: </b><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/windows_firewall_diagnostic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/windows_firewall_diagnostic/</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Restart the Windows remote service.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a.<span> </span></span></span>Click on <b>Start</b>, then on <strong>
Run</strong>. In the open box, type in <b>services.msc</b> and hit enter.</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span> </span></span></span>Locate <b>Windows remote</b> service, right click on it and select
<b>Restart</b>.</p>
<p><span><span>c.<span> </span></span></span>Locate Windows Firewall service, right click on it and select
<b>Restart</b>.</p>
<p><span><span>d.<span> </span></span></span>Now, check for the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3:</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the issue related to missing Base Filtering Engine, follow the steps suggested by
<b>ChrisToop</b> on <b>November 29, 2011</b> in the following link.</p>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For
 added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft

<h2>            Windows 8&#58; Can I have multiple users without having an admin&#63; Or without a master password&#63;</h2>
                    I just installed Windows 8 x64 Professional on my computer. So, my brother and I are going to have separate user accounts, and he was the administrator. I went on my user account, but I couldn't install any softwares because it requires a password. We
 were wondering if it was possible, so everyone (including guests) is able to go do whatever without a password. Also, of I install something , how do I prevent other users from having programs downloaded too?&nbsp;

<h2>            Switching between windows 10 and 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hello dear community</p>
<p>I have windows 8.1 single language(genuine) and I want to upgrade to windows 10 and I want to be able to go back to 8.1 even after the 31 days free timeframe. What should I do ? I heard that windows image backup basically reinstalls my windows alongside
 my data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In other words, How to switch between windows 8.1 and windows 10 at any given time while maintaining personal data?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you advice for gamers ? Stay 8.1 or upgrade ? Since that is what I do most of my time on my laptop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>That is what I keep reading because of the Digital Entitlement once a person has upgraded a qualifying operating system 10 can be reinstalled at anytime.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Buy win-10 is self explanatory many places are selling win-10 at Newegg/ Amazon for 140 &amp; 99.us and even the Microsoft store,</p>
<p>Buying 10 insures dual booting is legal on the same disk there really is no telling when Micro$oft will enforce switching back and forth between the upgraded os and win-10 :D</p>

<p>
</p><p>Yep digital entitlement :)</p>
<p>A upgraded activation key from in your case win-8.1 can always be reused as long as the win-10 is not being used,</p>
<p>Kind of tough to use 2 os's on the same machine at the same time :)</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade from 7 camera app not working on Lenovo B490 laptop</h2>
                    I just upgraded from Windows 7 to 10 on my Lenovo B490. All good but camera app shows black box with message: Camera won't start, check its connected and installed properly. Error code 0xA00F424A(0xC00D3704)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have followed all advice on every forum
 with no luck. Yes, I have updated drivers from Lenovo and rolled them back and done everything else. I really need this app for my teaching videos. I can still use Skype video conferencing and Tencent QQ also but not the Win 10 camera app.&nbsp; Why? This one should
 be a no brainer for Microsoft to fix!!! Can someone please.....please help me as I am at the end of my tether with this one. Thanks...Ai

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern here in Microsoft Community and welcome to the Windows 10 Family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description provided, I understand that you want to change the default view settings in File Explorer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the below steps and see if it helps.</p>
<div>1. Open up a window in File Explorer (or hit START BUTTON followed by the letter E).</div>
<div>2. Open up the View Ribbon, and select the view option. In your case, you would select "details".</div>
<div>3. Still in the View Ribbon, select the "Options" icon (on the far right). If a menu drops down, select "change folder and search options".</div>
<div>
<p>4. From this point, things should look just like Windows XP or Windows 7. The "Folder Options" dialog should pop up. Select the "View" tab, and click the "Apply to Folders" button.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope the above information was helpful. If you need further information, feel free to write to us and we would be glad to help you.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank You.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Nor did this change of default view appear with addition of New folder or a subfolder of New folder.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It’s unfortunate that Sony VAIO is not detecting SD slot or MMC. I do understand the inconvenience. I am here to help you.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1)<span> </span></span></span><span>Do you get any error message?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span> </span></span></span><span>Is the reader being used is working on the other computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3)<span> </span></span></span><span>When you insert the card inside the computer does it shows up under device manager or “Computer”?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform the following methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: A Secure Digital (SD) card may not be recognized on a Windows 7 based computer.</span></b></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/981642" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/981642</span></b></a><span>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: My Drive does not appear in Windows Explorer view</span></b></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/330140" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/330140</span></b></a><span>
</span></p>
<p><span>Note: This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection,
 back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base. How
 to back up and restore the registry in Windows: <br />
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Back-up-the-registry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Back-up-the-registry</span></b></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3: Uninstall and reinstall USB drivers</span></b></p>
<p><span>As all the hardware devices have drivers associated, similarly USB devices also have it. Sometimes proper drivers are not detected after the initial installation so reinstallation of the drivers helps resolve the issues.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You may check after uninstalling and reinstalling the USB drivers if you are able to connect. You may disconnect all USB devices and then perform the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1)<span> </span></span></span><span>Click on <strong><span>Start</span></strong>, and then click
<strong><span>Control Panel</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span> </span></span></span><span>Click on <strong><span>System and Maintenance</span></strong>, click
<strong><span>System</span></strong>, and then click <strong><span>Device Manager</span></strong>.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>3)<span> </span></span></span><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span> If Control Panel is in Classic View, double-click
<strong><span>System</span></strong>, and then click <strong><span>Device Manager</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4)<span> </span></span></span><span>If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click<strong><span> Allow</span></strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>5)<span> </span></span></span><span>In Device Manager, double click to expand "Universal Serial Bus controllers", right click on the Host Controller, click "Uninstall" and click "OK".<br />
<strong><span>Check if at all there is an exclamation mark along the driver, it suggests issues with the driver installed.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>6)<span> </span></span></span><span>Repeat the step 2 to uninstall all items under "Universal Serial Bus controllers".</span></p>
<p><span><span>7)<span> </span></span></span><span>Then, restart your computer and Windows 7 will reinstall all USB controllers automatically.</span></p>

    <title>Windows 10 USB wireless adapter issues - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lambey332  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 USB wireless adapter issues</h2>
                    <p>I decided today to upgrade to windows 10, and initially found it to be a great experience</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I shortly found I have intermittent problems with my adapter resetting, (losing&nbsp;connection then gaining it back). I'm currently using a Belkin N600 dual band adapter, which currently has no windows 10 drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I decided to reinstall the drivers as suggested by a member of Microsoft support staff. Since then, I have noticed that the lights on my keyboard (for scroll, caps and num lock) will sometimes go out at the same time as the wireless adapter. These are both
 using USB ports that previously worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have ALSO (as of writing this) found another issue, with the adapter showing nothing on the list but having a limited connection.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/88d4bc00-7522-430e-8bc7-4da85f810613" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any recommendations / solutions to these problems? any adapters that we know 100% work?</p>

            I have a similar issue with wireless adapter. &nbsp;I just upgraded from W7 to W10 and if I try to connect to my NETGEAR WN111v2 wireless-N adapter, my screen starts flashing on &amp; off. &nbsp;As long as I don't try to connect, my computer is fine...useless, but fine.
 &nbsp;NETGEAR site shows no W10 driver for my product. &nbsp;I think I will revert back to W7 and chalk the W10 failure alongside all other WINDOWS failures.

            I'm having the same problem with my Netgear USB wireless adapter. Sometimes it's fine, sometimes it's connected with limited connectivity, sometimes Win10 isn't even reading it as there. I can "fix" the problem temporarily by right clicking the start button,
 selecting "Device Manager" and my adapter under "Network adapters." Usually just re-enabling it from there works; sometimes it is enabled, but Win10 has changed the settings for the device and I have to restart my computer; sometimes I have had to unplug and
 re-insert the adapter; or, a combination of the three usually gets it done.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I reeeally hope Microsoft reads these pages because this is a real pain in the neck with Win10. Win10 also doesn't detect the touchscreen drivers for my Win7 and Win8-compatible touchscreen monitor. Seriously thinking of downgrading back to Win7 until they
 get their collective sh...tuff together. Maybe I should start thinking about a different OS next time.&nbsp;

            <p>I am having a similar issue with my Linksys WUSB6300 dual band adapter after upgrading to Win10 from Win 7 (and in the process doing a Win 7 system image restore followed by a re-upgrade because of other issues). Linksys support reported to me via a chat
 support session that&nbsp;NONE of their adapters are compatible with Win10 as of Oct 13, 2015. Yet Windows scanned my machine and reported there would be no upgrade problems. I am a little annoyed with Microsoft. Again. Seems the wireless network adapter suppliers
 are co-conspirators this time. (The 50'&nbsp;Ethernet cable temporarily running through the middle of my house works fine though)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Probably going back to Windows 7.</p>

<h2>            Backup job task scheduler error - 0x80090016&#58; Keyset does not exist</h2>
                    
<p>A number&nbsp;of our customer's customer sites&nbsp;are experiencing this error. They have been successfull resoving the issue with the fix in Article<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/246183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/246183</span></a>,
 but they would like know what is causing the failure to begin with. What causes the Crypto subsystem&nbsp;to become corrupted?</p>
<p>I am trying to get more information from the customer like at what point this occurs during task scheduling (i.e. create new tasks, or using previously working tasks) as well as when the problem starting happening and what updates to the system have ocurred
 before the problems started. Until I receive this information from the customer, any insight would be helpful.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Lee</p>

<p>Thanks Diana,</p>
<p>I'm not sure if these are part of a Domain. If they are, what impact does that have?</p>
<p>I understand the possible causes of the error in the subject, but what causes the corruption of the Crypto Subsystem or Protected Storage services files? Since this is occurring on multiple systems I have a hard time believing that there is faulty hardware.
 My theory is that there was some Windows update that caused the problem. Do you know of any that might do this?</p>

    <title>how do I reply to a thread&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            how do I reply to a thread&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I was just wondering how to reply to a thread now? I used to use these forums almost everyday, but now I come on once every two weeks to see if they work any better.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every time I hit the "reply" button, the word "reply" in the green box disappears. I wait and wait&nbsp;for a box to pop up so I can type a reply. The option never appears.&nbsp;I have 3 computers in my house and it is the same for all three pcs. I didn't use the
 search function because I get about 5 mins before it signs me out. Maybe it's my browser, but it's the same as I have always used and there was never a problem before.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            outlook express 6 message view problem</h2>
                    I have outlook express 6..when I select a message to read, instead of the message being displayed, a second window shows up, and the message text itself is shown as a choice of either a ".txt" attachment or a "htm" attachment. &nbsp;I must then click on one
 of those to see the message text. &nbsp;On the pane that should display the message, the "From:", "Date:", "To:", "Subject:" &nbsp;all show correct stuff from the message. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;but, again ,the message text itself does not show up, but instead shows as an attachment
 that must be clicked on.

<p>Hi Ken,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>BEV</strong> stands for <strong>Boot Entry Vector</strong>. It is a pointer that points to code inside an option RO0M that will directly load an operating system. To know more about BEV, we suggest contacting Intel for further information about it.</p>

<h2>            Company of Heroes - &#40;Series&#41; &#58; Issues pertaining to manual patch the game&#59; display message &#34;Could not verify media&#34;&#59; incorporation of original CoH with expansion pack</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: justify">In this article I'm going to discuss some of the major and common issues pertaining to installation/running of one of the most renown RTS (Real-Time Strategy) WWII-based game series - Company of Heroes (often abbreviated as CoH).
 The game was released by Relic Entertainment in collaboration with THQ in 2006 and later its standalone expansion pack "Opposing Fronts" was released in 2007 (abbreviated as CoH:OF) followed by second standalone expansion pack "Tales of Valor" in 2009 (abbreviated
 as CoH:ToV). The publishers have stringently protected this game series via CD key verification as well as usable media verification system in order to ensure that ONLY legitimate owners can get access to the purchased retail CD/DVD. However, the publishers
 simply left out of consideration the legitimate owners of retail CD/DVD who wanted to backup their game in image formats (.ISO/.FLT, etc.) or who, in severe circumstances, lost the source media of game (CD/DVD), they won't ever be able to successfully install/run
 their game again for which they have really dearly paid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Having considered one of these issues, this article revolves around the question of running this game via backup image (.ISO/.FLT, etc.) on the system as well as manually patching the game for upgrade purpose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">NOTE: Owners of Direct2Drive via Steam should not have any issues regarding patching the game as it will be done automatically once got connected to their servers over Internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">First, let's have a look at the details of retail copy of each game in this series:</p>

</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">NOTE: Each game from this series are perfectly compatible with Windows 7 (x64) yet before proceeding further it is advisable to have a look at the minimum system requirement (as specified
 above) of the respective game from the series to be installed on your system. Or you can simply get it checked if your system is compatible enough to accommodate this game by visiting this website&nbsp;</span><a href="http://systemrequirementslab.com/cyri" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://systemrequirementslab.com/cyri</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Let's jump to the issues pertaining to this game in the order as they are put in the heading of this article.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Issue 1: Unable to upgrade the game via manual patching (for the owners of legitimate game image such as .ISO/.FLT, etc.).</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Discussion</strong>:</span> As I have mentioned above the publishers have well protected this game series pretty stringently that only the owners of retail CD/DVD have the only privileges
 to get hands on their owned games in terms of installation/running the game on their systems. This tight protection method of CD/DVD key verification incorporated with usable media verification system comes into effect via the patching upgrade beyond patch
 version of 1.71.0 to Company of Heroes Original game. Therefore, not to mention, the standalone expansion packs of this game series will already contain this effect whether or not one tries to avoid patch upgrade to them. Yet, it is always essential to upgrade
 the game through patching because these patches contain bugs/texture/glitches fix and sometimes add-ons in missions and so on. The resultant issue of "Could not verify media" will be discussed following the resolution of this issue. First, we are going to
 overcome the problems of manually patching the game from Company of Heroes Opposing Fronts expansion pack onwards.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Take a note about the retail version of these games when they were first released from this series.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Company of Heroes - Original </strong><em>released with
</em><strong>Retail Version of 1.0.0</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Company of Heroes - Opposing Fronts </strong>
<em>released with</em>&nbsp;<strong>Retail Version of 2.100.0</strong> <em>(patch upgrade from version 2.100.0 onwards will be applicable)</em></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Company of Heroes - Tales of Valor </strong>
<em>released with</em><strong> Retail Version of 2.500.0</strong> <em>(patch upgrade from version 2.500.0 onwards will be applicable)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">The knowledge of retail version of each game in this series is really essential when one wants to know from what point of patch version they should begin manually patching it otherwise one would simply get stuck on the messages
 from installation wizard displaying <em>unable to identify the version of the game and that the wizard could not patch it</em>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Solution:</span></strong> This solution will be beneficial to those who own the legitimate game image in formats such as .ISO/.FLT, etc. in the absence of having the original retail
 CD/DVD. </p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">NOTE: This is applicable to standalone expansion packs only, i.e., Company of Heroes - Opposing Fronts and Company of Heroes - Tales of Valor</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Install the standalone expansion pack either Company of Heroes - Opposing Fronts or Company of Heroes - Tales of Valor using the game image (.ISO/.FLT, etc.) you own via virtual drive emulator (such as
 Daemon Tools, Alcohol, etc.) or using a burnt CD/DVD containing the game image.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">NOTE: DO NOT USE ANY NO-CD/DVD EXECUTABLE IMAGE FIX (CRACK) FOR NOW WHILE YOU FIRST NEED TO UPGRADE THE GAME WITH MANUAL PATCHING SYSTEM.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Run the game image (.ISO/.FLT, etc.) one more time either via virtual drive emulator or using a burnt CD/DVD and let the "Autoplay" dialog box appear and instead of doing anything else just explore the
 contents of the game image or CD/DVD by clicking on "Open folders to view files".</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Step 3:</strong> Go to "Data" folder and extract a copy of "RelicCoH.exe_NEW_FILE_xxxxxxxxxxxxx" (where xxxxxxxxxxx is denoted as some alphanumerical value in the file), and paste it somewhere on your hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Step 4:</strong> Locate the pasted file "RelicCoH.exe_NEW_FILE_xxxxxxxxxxxxx" on your hard drive and rename it as "RelicCoH.exe".</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Step 5:</strong> Copy this renamed "RelicCoH.exe" file and paste it into the game installation directory which should replace the existing original "RelicCoh.exe" file.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Step 6:</strong> Apply the official patch version 2.100.0_to_2.101.0 (for Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts)
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">or</span>&nbsp;patch version 2.500.0_to_2.501.0 (for Company of Heroes: Tales of Valor) to the game and it should patch the game with no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">NOTE: You can download this official patch version 2.100.0_to_2.101.0 (for CoH: OF) from here.</span></p>

https://www.sendspace.com/file/pqgmmb</a>)</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Step 7:</strong> Now you can sequentially upgrade the game with rest of the official patches available.
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">(Patch version 2.700.0 is not available for manual patching and can be done automatically via Steam server for the owners who have purchased the game from Steam only)</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">NOTE: For Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts, you can sequentially patch it until 2.301.0 and then apply the no-CD/DVD exe image fix (if you have lost the original retail CD/DVD or backed-and-packed up your CD/DVD).
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">You can retrieve the no-CD/DVD exe image fix version 2.301.0 from here:</span>&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9El3RHzVu68VkpSY01pVTc0M2c/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9El3RHzVu68VkpSY01pVTc0M2c/view?usp=sharing</a>
 (Before applying this fix, MUST READ the instructions described in <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">

</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Issue 2:&nbsp;Cannot proceed beyond the display message "Could not verify media" when attempting to play the game.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Discussion</span>:</strong> This far we have already got to know about the stringent policies imposed by the publishers of this game series in terms of CD key verification incorporated
 with usable media verification system in order to successfully install and/or run the game. This means if you've initially successfully passed the CD key verification system you'll be put on another test where the usable media verification system will check
 whether you have loaded a legitimate retail copy of CD/DVD or not. If this verification system won't get satisfied with the CD/DVD quality or any other media loading source is detected being in use such as virtual drive emulators, you will immediately get
 a small menu-like dialog box popped up with a message "Could not verify media" along with few more options offered so that user may be able to rectify their mistake either taking you to the publishers' server if you opt for Retail Version or redirecting you
 to the Steam server for Direct2Drive option. In either case, it won't get sorted out no matter how many times you'll enter all the correct details because for Retail Version option the publishers' servers are down or simply spoken are completely "dead" since
 ages and for Steam server because of the conflict between previous retail-owned copies of CD/DVD and Direct2Drive options offered by Steam which in no way bridges the gap to the satisfaction of publisher.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Solution</span>:</strong> So, to get out of this labyrinth, one may want to follow the resolution divided into two segments of which the first specifies for those who own the retail
 copy of CD/DVD and for others who have lost/misplaced the retail CD/DVD and have only access to game image in formats like .ISO/.FLT, etc. Therefore, follow the appropriate segment that best suits to you in terms of what source you have available to install
 and run the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Segment-I:</strong> This segment focuses on the owners who own the retail copy of CD/DVD of game from this series and still encountering the issue of "Could not verify media".</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Step 1:</strong> Before loading the retail copy of CD/DVD on your optical drive tray, make sure you DO NOT have any virtual drive emulator (such as, Daemon Tools, Alcohol, etc.) installed and if you have any then you GOT
 TO UNINSTALL this emulator from your hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Step 2:</strong> If you're using more than one optical drives in any case then you got to disable one of those drives; let's say you have a CD drive separate than a DVD drive then you may want to disable the CD optical
 drive in the following manner leaving the DVD optical drive intact.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">1. Go to "My Computer" and Right-click on the said CD optical drive and select "Properties".</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">2. Click the "Hardware" tab on the opened dialog box and again highlight the appropriate name of optical drive (in this case, CD optical drive) and then click on "Properties" tab at the bottom of this dialog box.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">3. A relative dialog box for this optical drive will open and you got to click on "Change Settings" tab at the bottom of this very dialog box.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">4. A replicate of this dialog box will reappear but this time simply click the "Driver" tab and under this section seek for "Disable" (Disables the selected device..) and click on this and then hit "OK" at the bottom of this box
 and accept the changes.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">5. Now, while leaving one optical drive intact (in this case DVD optical drive), you can now load the retail copy of DVD in the respective tray and play the game without any frustrating message display of "Could not verify media".</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">NOTE: Using retail DVD copy for playing the game of this series, you ought to repeat all the steps mentioned above in order to play this game without any problem if you roll back to the settings
 for making the disabled optical drive active again</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Segment-II:</strong> This segment aids the owners of the legitimate retail copy of CD/DVD who might have lost or misplaced their copy and are left with game image in formats like .ISO/.FLT, etc. For these owners, there's
 no other way for them than relying on no-CD/DVD exe image fix in order to run the game smoothly and with no hassle.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>NOTE:&nbsp;</strong></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1); text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>NO-CD/DVD EXECUTABLE (exe.) IMAGE FIX IS INTENDED TO BE USED FOR ORIGINAL
 LEGITIMATE OWNED GAME CDs/DVDs AND NOT TO PROMOTING ANY IDEA OF PIRACY OR&nbsp;UNAUTHORIZED&nbsp;DUPLICATION OF GAMES.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Step 1:</strong> After having installed the game from this series on your hard drive, you need to upgrade the respective game with manual patching system until the point of no-CD/DVD exe image fix version you're available
 with. <em>(The section on how to upgrade the game with manual patching is discussed in this article earlier. Refer to that section above for any help in this regards.)</em></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">NOTE: This issue for "Could not verify media" will be encountered only beyond the patch upgrade version of 1.71.0 and even applicable to Company of Heroes: Original. Therefore, this solution
 applies in this case as well.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Step 2:</strong> After having upgrade the game with manual patching in alignment to the same version of no-CD/DVD exe image fix available to you, you simply need to follow the instructions for applying this fix.&nbsp;<em>(If
 you need help on official patch download for this game series as well as no-CD/DVD exe image fix you may refer to the earlier section of my discussion where relative download links are mentioned).</em></p>

</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Issue 3:&nbsp;</strong><strong>How to incorporate the original Company of Heroes game with standalone expansion pack?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Discussion:</span></strong> The next question arises regarding how to incorporate of original Company of Heroes with Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts expansion pack so that one
 can enjoy playing with all four factions having assimilated them from one game into another. The expansion packs released followed by the original CoH are all "standalone" that means one can simply install these expansion packs in the absence of base pack
 which is original CoH. But, the problem here is that unless you have original CoH neither you won't be able to play the missions of original CoH nor use the factions from the original game although you would be able to see the deactivated portion of Normandy
 mission of original CoH while playing CoH: OF. The basic intention of making these expansion packs standalone is to promote sales by not having the buyer rely on the base pack but can simply continue playing the forward missions in the absence of base pack.
 However, in Company of Heroes: Tales of Valor there is no such requirement for the base pack to be installed in order to play all the four factions in multiplayer mode but of course you still will be devoid of playing the original missions of base pack here
 too if you don't have original CoH. In any case, this problem can be avoided not with any hit-and-trial method but simply following the sequence of game installation of this series.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">NOTE: Only one expansion pack can be incorporated with the base pack (original CoH). This means you cannot install Company of Heroes: Tales of Valor with the base pack if you have already
 installed Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts. Similarly, vice-a-versa, Company of Heroes: Opposing Fronts cannot be installed with the base pack if Company of Heroes: Tales of Valor already exists on your hard drive.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">Let's jump to the solution to this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, install the Company of Heroes: Original on your hard drive without any need to upgrade it with manual patching if you intend to incorporate the original CoH with any of the available expansion packs
 since once expansion pack is installed it will upgrade the original CoH to the higher version what the expansion pack was released with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, install any of the expansion packs either CoH: OF or CoH: ToV. A warning message will display before installation that a previous version copy of Company of Heroes exists and it will delete in the
 process of installing the expansion pack; however, be ready with the CD key of original CoH if you want the missions of original version too. DO NOT be afraid and simply let go by clicking OK.&nbsp;However, in custom settings of game installation you can better
 remove the check mark for launching the game automatically after installation finishes.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><strong>Step 3:</strong> The expansion pack will be installed successfully.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">If you own a retail copy of CD/DVD of both original and expansion pack, you can simply let the DVD of expansion pack stay in the optical tray and run the game from the installation directory on your hard drive. It will prompt you
 to enter the DVD key for original Company of Heroes in order to incorporate it with the expansion pack you've just installed.&nbsp;<em>(To get help on avoiding "Could not verify media" issue, refer to the earlier section of this article.)</em>
</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">If you're installing the game using a legitimate game image (.ISO/.FLT, etc.) then follow all the steps until you upgrade the game with manual patching version that should coincide with the version of your no-CD/DVD exe image fix
 available with you. In this case, after having installed the expansion pack over base pack (original CoH), the game wizard won't show any prompt box to enter CD/DVD key of original CoH. Don't run/launch the game yet. You simply have to first follow the steps
 1 through 2 and then apply the appropriate no-CD/DVD exe image fix to the game installation directory. Now, you can launch the game via replaced image fix and it will show the message "Could not verify media" which you simply need to ignore and click "Continue"
 and the game should run smoothly with previous missions of original CoH active along with new missions of the expansion pack.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Yeah I like WWII games myself. Got into Company of Heroes bought the retail cd/dvd and ended up getting the Steam version when it was on sale to get ToV. Haven't added CoHOF as yet. Wish I had this tutorial earlier.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Any way to pick you brain on CoD? Gotta retail version that crashes after the Tirpitz mission and doesn't go on to the Russian front.</p>

            <p>Hello sammoss,</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: justify">I have never experienced such sort of issue with this game. However, with no exception, there could be such issues prevailing and maybe it's the time when you got caught in one. There could be many reasons why have you been experiencing
 this issue which you may take in account the OS what you have or the patch upgrades whether you did or not before playing this game. I had installed this game along with its expansion pack United Offensive; finished all the missions in one go without having
 noticed any problem like this. I have Windows 7 (x64) Home Premium and I upgraded the game with official patch to version 1.5 before getting my hands on it. However, I have noticed one thing that games that were published before 2005 always gave sort of problem
 in OS compatibility; therefore, as a fail-safe method I always set the OS compatibility for the game which was originally released for. For this game, I had set the OS compatibility as Win XP SP2 for each and every executable files in the game installation
 directory after having installed the game. Secondly, it's always better to install these previous-version-of-Windows-based games by directly exploring through the CD/DVD content and clicking on "setup.exe" file instead of simply using "Install the program"
 in "Autoplay" option. After that, I upgraded the game with the highest ever released patch which was version 1.5 for CoD 1. Then, in order to get rid of the problem of loading the CD/DVD in tray everytime I wished to play the game, I replaced the original
 patched exe image with no-CD/DVD exe image fix with the same version of 1.5. I played through each and every mission except a wee problem I had experienced where I had manually Saved a mission and then attempted to Load the game at some point gave me a crash
 with resultant effect of game being simply stopped responding and then got closed and when I tried to reload from the same point after relaunching the game, it worked. Here, this issue you might experience as well if you play this game on Windows 7 (x64) which
 I think is not a major one as it won't stop you from letting you play this game for long. This could be because of change in OS platform which this game has not been made for and it finds it difficult to fit in and causes this short crashes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, taking in account all of these possible assumptions what I can think up, I can advise you to follow these steps as I did for installing this game and it shouldn't be any harm if you use some "crack" even though you own a retail copy of CD/DVD of
 this game. I'm enclosing you with the official patch and same version of no-CD/DVD exe image fix in the undermentioned link from where you can download and then simply move your saved game Profile folder for fresh game installation directory and trying running
 the game after the point of mission where you experience this crash.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope it should solve your problem.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Thanks GRV-81 I'll give it a shot. I have the same OS as you do. Last time I ran CoD1 Deluxe Edition( published 2003-2004) didn't think to patch it up and knew nothing of no cd.exe's. I am a late starter on pcs got my first one in 2011 and it has been a
 learning curve ever since. &nbsp;Luckily I've met some old hands on TeamSpeak that started gaming from day one and have shown me the ropes, heck they still fly Crimson Skies! and game all the way to Assassin's Creed Black Flag with everything in between. Your WWII
 game tips are great keep up the good work!</p>

            I do remember an issue with having to download the atioglxx.dll and placing it in the game back when I first installed CoD1 Deluxe Edition something about compatibility with AMD gfx. Reinstalling the game now so we'll see if it is still and issue.

            Just installed it and found the retail version is 1.3SP &amp; 1.5MP but the no cd.exe doesn't work for some reason. Tried running the patch and it of course it said 'you already have the latest version.' Tried setting compatibility to XP SP2 but it crashed
 had to go back to XP SP3 to get it to launch. Any ideas on the no cd.exe? Checked other sites for another one and they're all the same. I did use the setup.exe in the cd. Resolution settings are either too low or too high grrr. Got a feeling it's going to
 do the same thing crash after Tirpitz as nothing has really changed from the first install. I have a Radion HD 6870 and tried putting the latest atioglxx.dll from the driver (v13.12) but that didn't work either I wonder if older .dll's will work any thoughts
 on that?

            <p>Hello sammoss,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all, I can tell you since you started discussing on this game I got initiated one more time and installed this game on my system as well. However, I have not yet reached to the point where you had experienced crash but I remember good when I played
 this game last time I finished it without any issues of crash as you have mentioned. I can't figure out why you're unable to use the no-CD exe fix. I own independent versions of CoD and its expansion pack rather Deluxe Edition. It's odd that even after having
 patched the final version patch of 1.5 (which of course would include all the features of previous versions including for SP) you're experiencing the crash. Since you have got the OS as of mine which is Win 7 (x64) Home Premium then all the settings what I
 have recommended to you should work fine <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
except slight random crashes you might experience only in case if you manually Save the game and then attempt to Load it.
</span>Also, I don't think that you may need to replace any *.dll files in the original game installation directory for whatsoever reason. The fact is that we are going to run a game that was released back in 2003 with all outdated resources containing in it
 and we just need to make it compatible on our OS instead of doubting on the drivers for GFX or whatsoever components needed to run this game.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, having considered your problem and the prior troubleshooting you already did, I can try to suggest you few things which you may want to work out in order to overcome this hurdle. Proceed in the way as I've numbered the solutions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. As I have already mentioned that while trying to run this game on Win 7 (x64) you will experience slight random crashes only due to the reason if you manually Save the point and attempt to Load it. This can be solved simply deleting that unfortunate Saved
 point through your Save/Load game menu and reload the prior Save or Autosave point that was working fine. Having borne this thing on your mind, try to Load the previous Autosave or Save point on your game prior to the mission where you experience crash (Tirpitz
 mission) and attempt reaching to this mission freshly. This trick works good on the rationale that you're going to simply eradicate the crash versions of Save points in game. This I often had to use whenever I experienced random crashes in manual Save points.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. If the above solution still doesn't work for you then it simply implies you're experiencing an in-built bug in the game that was shipped to you. Here, I can suggest you to get this game in independent versions with its expansion pack if you are really
 desperate to finish this game. For free help in this regards, you can give me your e-mail and I'll provide you with best and easy resources to get this game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. If you want to give a try by upgrading this game with patch 1.3 instead of 1.5 along with relevant no-CD exe image, you can find the download link here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sendspace.com/file/7wiv8q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sendspace.com/file/7wiv8q</a><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this should resolve your problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With all good regards,</p>

            <p>Hello sammoss,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This note is an addendum to the one I wrote you before. One more thing just struck in my my mind that when do you do the fresh install of your Deluxe Edition could you tell me what version it has? As you said when you attempted to patch it with 1.5 you got
 the display message that "You already have latest version." If you don't know how to check the version, do the following and you'll be able to retrieve the actual retail version of your game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Click <strong>Start</strong>&nbsp;(Windows Button) at the right bottom side; "Start Menu" will open displaying the preference of the few programs you have on your system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. At the bottom of the Start Menu, you'll see a "Search Box" with hint of "<em>Search program and files</em>".</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Type <strong>regedit</strong> in it and click OK in User Account Control for permitting it to open Registry Editor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Under the upside down tree of "Computer" follow this path:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Activision\Call of Duty.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. By clicking on this folder&nbsp;<strong>Call of Duty</strong> you'll see lot of details on the right hand side of pane about Publisher, CD key, etc. and lastly Version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. If you see some other version than 1.0 simply right click on the <strong>Version</strong> heading and then click
<strong>Modify...</strong> on the resultant pop-up dialog box.</p>
<p>
</p><p>7. Another pop-up box will appear with heading&nbsp;<strong>Edit String</strong> in which under the
<strong>Value data</strong> field change the value to 1.0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Confirm the changes and close the Registry Editor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>9. Now, you can first try to upgrade the game with patch version 1.3 if you want to test and think of later upgrading it to version 1.5 or simply patch it with version 1.5.
<strong>(Important is that you got to apply the patch preferably version 1.5 as what I think because never tested the game with version 1.3.)</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>10. Apply the corresponding version of no-CD exe image fix and trying playing the mission where you experience the crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this should really get you out of this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>With all good regards,</p>
<p>

            <p>My game flash screen shows version 1.3 on SP and version 1.5 on MP menus at the bottom right hand corner. Just checked the wow6432node as per your post and it is 1.5b so obviously it came patched up from Activision as I bought it in 2011. I looked for and
 found several no cd .exe 1.0 1.3 1.5 and none of 'em launch the game for some reason. Odd as the other games I have like CoD2 the no cds work as do other games that I have on CD/DVD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I read your post correctly I should change the 1.5b to 1.0 then use the patch you supplied if I am still correctly thinking will take it from 1.0 to 1.5 &nbsp;I'm thinking the patch that came with the game is some how different than the stand alone 1&gt;1.5 patch;
 just thinking out loud. Then the no cd may work I'll try it and get back to ya.</p>

            <p>Hello sammoss,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Exactly this is what you got to do. If it shows v1.5b then it's a beta version - an early untested version of patch than what is the latest and final one and no big deal if it could be buggy especially at the point of the specific mission where it crashes.
 Yes, in my opinion, simply change the value data back to v1.0 in registry editor and then apply the patch v1.5 what I have sent to you. This way even if your game is already patched with v1.5b with the roll back version to v1.0 in registry editor the game
 wizard will again let you run the manual patch v1.5. Then simply replace the updated original exe image with no-CD exe fix of v1.5.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a feeling this time this shot would be a bull's eye.</p>

                    <p>I am experiencing constant BSODs that started today. The issue seems to be a driver issue and his thread was quite helpful:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I am not sure what to do next. The computer will now only run in Safe Mode as the BSODs come fairly quickly following a restart.</p>

            <p>Thank you.&nbsp; I ran through the step by step on the verifier. It crashed the first time and this was displayed: IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR EQUAL and then restarted again only to crash right away (after entering password for login) again and display this message: SPECIAL_POOL_DETECTED_MEMORY_CORRUPTION.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I can tell I am getting no indication of which Driver may be causing the issue. It went to Automatic Repair, prompting a Restore. I did that, but to no avail.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I go ahead and try the memory test, or is there something I'm missing in terms of getting the info from the verifier regarding the messed up driver?</p>

            <p>Chances are good it is not the physical memory anyway.&nbsp; In most situations when it displays the message SPECIAL_POOL_DETECTED_MEMORY_CORRUPTION it will display a driver at the end of that message.</p>
<p>

            <p>Thank you again for all of your help. This morning Verifier tagged the issue as SRTSP64.SYS, which turned out to be Norton. I uninstalled it and the machine booted up and stayed OK for a few minutes.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I turned off Verifier and all seemed well. But, then it restarted again with the error MEMORY_MANAGEMENT.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before uninstalling Norton, there was a different error message each time, including the Special Pool one. I turned Verifier back on and went through multiple crashes and now every time it gives the same error, Memory Management.&nbsp; Do you believe that replacing
 the RAM at this time would be the best course of action? (I have not yet done the SFC, though I probably will just in case).

            I re-enabled verifier. I downloaded and ran a Norton removal tool. I did DISM, and it came back with no corruption reported. However, each time I have tried to run SFC the computer has crashed, including while in Safe Mode. It has also been giving additional
 error messages, some of teh ones I saw yesterday, like the IRQL ones and so on, but no further indication from Verifier yet about what else may be wrong.

            SFC went through and came back saying all was well. Then there was another crash! I ran the Windows Memory Diagnostic, which reported there was a hardware issue and suggested speaking with the manufacturer. After its next restart it gave error code 0x0000023.
 It seems the only fix may be to speak with HP and start from scratch, unless you have any additional suggestions. Once more, I really appreciate your help. It seems like a case of bad luck, and that the Norton driver succeeded in creating a bigger problem.<br />
