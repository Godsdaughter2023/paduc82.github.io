<h2>            Unable to find network printer drivers</h2>
                    <p>My Canon Pixma ip5200 has been printing fine on cable connection to a W7 laptop. Then I moved the printer to a Win-XP PC and it works fine there too. Now I want to print from the laptop via the networked PC. I removed the 'old ip5200'&nbsp; from the laptop and
 used 'Add printer' to reinstall as a network printer (not local). The ip5200 connected to the PC is listed and I can select it. But, it then goes off into Windows Update and in the end says it can't find the driver. I know the drivers are on both computers!&nbsp;
 Any ideas? </p>

            <p>Hi. I've tried method 1 several times. It always hunts for the driver but fails to find it. I tried right clicking the printer to use 'printer properties' and manually install but right clicking has no effect and no options menu appears. I've tried to download
 the driver from the Cannon website but it isn't availabale (only add ons). Windows 7 is fully up-to-date.</p>
<p>I'm lost! Could it be because the PC the printer is wired in to is running XP and the others are running W7?</p>
<p>I apologise for delays. I am a volunteer at the small charity where this problem is occurring so I'm not always in the office. I'm going away for a few days so there may be further delays but I still very much want your advice. Thank you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the delay in response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you still facing this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have got a link to download the drivers for PIXMA iP5200. Here is the link:</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to completely delete the printer software from the Windows 7 computer including the drivers. Once done, install the latest drivers and the required software from the link mentioned above and check if that makes any difference.</p>

<p>
</p><p>What you can see on this picture. This was taken by print screen then put into Paint. At the bottom you can see a color and it's RGB code, which is yellow by definition. And I see yellow, but not on this picture. I have color blindness, but luckily it is
 only partial or I would not have noticed, that the tool what I use on the right side also detects the wrong color. The detected RGB is different too. I assume that the tool somehow uses the print screen functionality and that is the reason. YOu can see on
 the color cycle the after taking the print screen the "Ye" is not yellow anymore.
</p>
<p>How could I fix this?</p>

<p>After posting my question I noticed something what is probably relevant:</p>
<p>I have two monitors, and I pulled the aseprite window to the another one, and on that screen the colors are wrong and I think exactly the same way. But according to the program RGB, it is still yellow.</p>
<p>(I have NVIDIA card.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>UPDATE: After fixing the color problems of the other monitor through NVIDIA settings and restarting the computer, the problem still exist.
</p>
<p>Note that I set the monitor to NVIDIA settings from system default, so the problem might be that way..?</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: I think I need some option to set the "digital vibrance" for windows 10..</p>

<h2>            Getting error 0x80070005 when reinstalling Mail, People and Calendar app after Win 8.1 upgrade</h2>
                    Hi my laptop got upgraded recently to Windows 8.1. Since then my mail, people and calendar apps stopped working. On the live tiles they just display something like Microsoft.Live.Mail with a black cross in white circle in the bottom right corner.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I share this laptop with my husband. His account is the admin account and his apps are working fine. I'm a normal user and I have tried the following:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1.) ran the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=268423" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
app troubleshooter</a></div>
<div>2.) uninstalled (at first didn't work, did a fresh reboot then uninstalled again, did another reboot and they were gone).</div>
<div>3.) tried to install it again, but keeps on failing with above error</div>
<div>4.) The tiles appeared again, and again with the small black X in the bottom right corner. Not sure if the uninstall never worked or if it got installed but cannot run. Maybe it cannot be uninstalled because another user on the laptop is using it?</div>
<div>5.) We made my login an administrator and tried to install, also with the same error result.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>When you try open it then there is just a flash and it goes back to the start screen, but if you move to the left upper corner the app shows that is is open there. If you try access it then it only opens up a dark gray screen and you can't close the app.</div>

            Hi, we resolved LiesbetF's apps by disconnecting her microsoft account from the local user account. Then we created a new account on the PC and then reconnected her microsoft account to the new login.
<div><br />
<div>It asked if it needed to import files and settings from the previous login but I rather opted for setting her new local account up as a brand new account. This resolved the issue, you'll just have to manually copy the files from the old user to the new
 before you delete the old user from the PC.</div>

<h2>            Anniversary update causing graphics issues</h2>
                    <p>Hi there, I'm a third party IT working for a company that recently, about a month ago, upgraded all of their Windows 7 Pro PCs (about 65 of them) to Windows 10. &nbsp;They are an Engineering firm and have many PCs using nVidia graphics cards. &nbsp;They are running
 on HP hardware, and so far the issues below are on HP Z420's with nVidia Quadro 4000 graphics cards with
<strong>no on board VGA adapter.</strong></p>

</p><p>The problem is that some of them just started downloading and installing the Anniversary update and after they do, their displays (with multiple monitors) have either one of two issues:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. They cannot see the main display. &nbsp;One monitor will show a desktop without the icons on the taskbar. &nbsp;The other displays either nothing or "Out of range" message. &nbsp;No ability to see any windows open on the display that is visible. &nbsp;I've seen this issue
 twice so far last week. &nbsp;</p>
<p>-OR-</p>
<p>2. They boot up to multiple monitors showing the "Out of range" or similar message on the them, a black screen with a mouse pointer and/or spinning dots, or both. &nbsp;I've only seen this once (also last week), but do not want to have to see it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the first, I can hit Windows+P for Projector, hit the down arrow twice, get to the main display, download and install the latest drivers from nVidia or HP and everything works without issue after a reboot. &nbsp;However, this is a gigantic pain in the butt
 and their users do not want to have to come in to this on random days when I am not available to be here. &nbsp;I'm scheduled to be here once a week. &nbsp;The other days I'm elsewhere.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The second is a bigger issue. &nbsp;As I said before, the only thing that shows is either&nbsp;multiple monitors showing the "Out of range" or similar message on the them, a black screen with a mouse pointer and/or spinning dots, or both.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The one I worked on first showed the "Out of range" message on both monitors. &nbsp;Not sure how that eventually cleared up, but eventually, after messing with just about all graphics hardware (pulling monitors out and plugging different ones back in, changing
 connection adapters, trying larger displays and smaller displays, different video cards that I could not install drivers for because I can't see anything), I somehow got to see the black screen with a mouse pointer. &nbsp;I could tell that the OS was running in
 the background while the spinning dots and/or mouse pointer showed as I was able to blindly: login by hitting CTRL+ALT+DEL, typing the password, then waiting a while. &nbsp;I would then hit the Windows Key, type "cmd", wait a few seconds, then hit Enter, type "shutdown
 /r /t 0" and it would reboot. &nbsp;When it booted back up, same issue. &nbsp;Black screen, spinning white dots, mental anguish. &nbsp;I found in some forum a suggestion to let the spinning dots finish doing whatever they were doing. &nbsp;Since it was at the end of the day,
 I let them sit and spin overnight. &nbsp;When I came in the next morning, no more spinning dots, but black screen and mouse pointer remain. &nbsp;Using the command prompt to blindly reboot the OS resulted in those same spinning dots, black screen and mouse pointer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now please note that I was <strong>unable </strong>to boot into safe mode <strong>
by any means</strong> that I found in a search on how to do so...F8, CTRL F8, hitting F8 as fast as I could, etc. &nbsp;Considering I am using UEFI and SSD drive, this wouldn't work anyway. &nbsp;And since I cannot see the OS, I cannot do msconfig, SHIFT+Restart, etc...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have any generic graphics cards available to me to just throw into them either. &nbsp;I suppose I could get one to do so, but that's not a path I want to have to take any time I come across this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I ended up engaging all parties involved in different online chat support sessions: MS, nVidia, and HP. &nbsp;MS had me call in. &nbsp;Before I did that though, asking nVidia and HP proved to be no help at all since there is no way to install drivers for the
 nVidia graphics card without booting into the OS. &nbsp;I asked specifically about that too.</p>
<p>When I called MS, they had me power off the PC by holding down the power button. &nbsp;Once it was powered off, they had me power on, wait until the Windows 10 logo popped up and immediately power the PC off. &nbsp;They had me repeat this 3 times. &nbsp;On the fourth time,
 they had me let it boot fully. &nbsp;Same issue. &nbsp;After some waiting on hold, they had me try the same thing again. &nbsp;This time, on the fourth try, I get the lovely message stating, "Non system disk or disk error." &nbsp;So basically, MS told me to call them back when
 I had that fixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked through the BIOS, reset back to defaults, same issue. &nbsp;I opened it up, unplugged everything and plugged it back in, same issue. &nbsp;I called HP to get some hardware support. &nbsp;As I got on the phone with them, it booted up to the black screen with spinning
 dots and mouse pointer. &nbsp;Yay! &nbsp;Kinda.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was done. &nbsp;I found another PC, set it up for the user that had been without a PC for a day and a half, and he's okay. &nbsp;I then booted to a WIN10 installation USB key and reloaded everything from scratch. All works now. &nbsp;But have not yet installed the Anniversary
 date on this thing yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are other things I had tried within this whole process that I forgot to mention...booting to a recovery drive to try and install drivers, but that requires the OS as well.</p>
<p>I did try booting to the WIN10 USB Install disk, but when I tried to it would tell me...crap, I can't remember and I'm taking this from somewhere else, but it might have been:</p>
<p>"<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The computer started using the windows installation media. Remove the installation media and restart your computer so that windows starts normally. Then, insert the installation media and restart the
 upgrade." &nbsp;It then said something like, "click No to exit and reboot or click Yes to install a fresh copy of Windows 10."</span><br />
</p>
<p>Like I said, the error message above is not correct, but was something like that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SO...</p>
<p>
</p><p>My questions are thus:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;I know I can defer updates, but that only puts off the issues until the Anniversary update finally installs. &nbsp;I've also searched for answers to this, but I need a real solution...can I stop the Anniversary update from installing indefinitely until MS
 provides a REAL solution to this issue?</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;There's got to be a way for users to be able to say, do not install this particular update BEFORE it gets installed. &nbsp;I don't want this as an answer: &nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help. &nbsp;This is a big BIG hassle.</p>

            <p>You will have to swap out graphics cards for another card to get into the machine initially. I'm sorry that's the only solution I could find. Just go buy a cheapo card with the proper interface for your monitor (it can even be VGA), preferably NOT an NVIDIA
 card. This will let you boot to the desktop so you can uninstall the offending NVIDIA software. Do so, and reboot again, download the latest k4000 drivers from nvidia.&nbsp; Then tell it to restart in "low rez" mode, which loads basic video drivers.&nbsp; Shut the machine
 down when it goes to reboot (don't let it start - turn it off when you get to the bios screen), then swap the video card for the 4000 again.&nbsp; When it restarts in Low Rez mode install the latest k4000 drivers from nvidia, and shut down again.&nbsp; You should then
 get a normal boot.&nbsp; The issue is that since the nvidia drivers are causing the blackout issue you cannot see the screens (even though the system is booting normally in the background).&nbsp; Putting the other video card in forces it to ignore the k4000 drivers
 and use different drivers which work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry I don't have a better option, but this is how I got mine working - your mileage may vary.&nbsp; Also thanks Microsoft and Nvidia for not testing something as basic as this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you CAN roll back, do so, and then go get the latest nvidia drivers and install them BEFORE doing the anniversary update. It MAY work.</p>

<h2>            problem with wifi it automatically disconnects</h2>
                    My MSI Wind U160 netbook had been with me for almost three years; the internet those times runs smoothly, with no problem. Just these past months, it automatically disconnects in our home connection and also in school. Now, I currently use a USB wifi adapter
 just to connect to the internet. I also uninstalled "Microsoft Virtual Wifi Miniport Adapter", is this okay to do it? I also have 802.11bgn 1T1R Mini Card Wireless Adapter, I don't know why I have the two. Please help me. Thanks in advance.

            I had already tried method 1, it helps but it doesn't really cure the problem per se. My wifi stills automatically disconnects. Method 3. on the other hand, did not solve the problem since the network adapters says it is up to date. in method 2, I can't
 seem to &nbsp;make default my connection because thera are no "set as default" icon or option.

            There is no difference with OS. It all depends on the users. I have many clients that use Linux for graphic design since Windows 10 was not working well for them. They love linux. But another client prefers ReactOS. Many others prefer Windows 7 but support
 will end in the near future.<br />

<p>Personally, I began Graphic work on XP Pro. All graphic software ran perfectly to include 3rd party filters and plugins and the Wacom. This includes Older Graphic programs such as Gimp, Fractal designer and Creature House Expression. Then came the dreaded
 Vista and Windows 7. Granted Vista required a steep increase in a PC's hardware including Graphic card, memory and a better processor however, Most graphic programs were still upgrading their code to XP. Adobe being one of the culprit's. NIK and its suite
 of plugins will not work on Vista without hogging all the PC's resources. I then bought a new PC with Windows 7. About that time, Adobe went to the cloud for memberships and most 3rd party plugins sold out to the likes of Google and other companies. My 3rd
 party plugins and filters did not work well.</p>
<p>&nbsp; Not to upset the moderators here at Microsoft, I'd personally suggest buying a Mac for graphic design. However Microsoft does look promising with the Surface Pro. Adobe products are native to Mac. Illustrator, Freehand and Photoshop run perfectly as does
 Paintshop Pro and Corel applications. Cheers!</p>

<h2>            Friends list stuck for 2 days, will not update. Have to see who online through my phone</h2>
                    Hella frustrating here. My friends list has been stuck with the same people online since Thursday and it will not change. Have done a hard reset and everything. It just will not update with who is online. Still stuck on the 7 people it was showing 2 days
 ago. I have to look to see who is online via the app on my phone. Extremely aggraviting here. Also without having to go into the app on my computer is there anyway you can see who is in a party on the new dashboard? For the life of me I can't figure that one
 out. One the old dashboard you could see who is in a party before you joined, on the new dashboard I can't figure out how to see unless I go to the computer. The update was cool at 1st but issues like this are starting to take its toll. The friends list thing
 is beyond frustrating. Thanks

<p>Hey there! To minimize confusion because troubleshooting may be different for preview updates than regular versions, you'll want to post this, and everything else preview related in the preview forums (<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_early_access/update_preview/update_preview_forums/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">forums.xbox.com/.../default.aspx</a>).
 This will also ensure that the proper team sees your post and can help you out. Also, make sure you look at the list of known issues to see if there is a workaround.</p>
<p>If you haven't already, be sure to report any issues via the preview app on your console, so that all relevant data gets reported to Microsoft.</p>
<p>As of now, you can't see who is in a party, and there are many known issues with chat. You'll want to check out the forum for full details.</p>

<p>If you've forgotten your Windows password, there are several ways to retrieve or reset it:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If your PC is on a domain, your system administrator must reset your password.</p>

<p>If you're using a local account, use your password hint as a reminder.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>If you've tried these suggestions and still can't sign in:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you have <span>Windows&nbsp;8.1</span>, you'll need to reinstall Windows. </p>

<h2>            Please Please Please Stop the automatically enabled Gaming Features</h2>
                    I respectfully ask Microsoft to PLEASE to STOP&nbsp; trying to provide gaming features for PC gamers! You are not helping us! You are causing our games to lag to the point that our games are unplayable. Stick with XBox! Do not install gaming features that are
 automatically enabled. Provide XBox features on XBox NOT Windows! If XBox players want to play games on the PC they should download PC games! I spend hours trying to chase down lag issues and it usually ends up being a gaming feature added from a Microsoft
 update. (Like yesterdays update!) I'm begging you to PLEASE STOP!

            Hi, 
<br />I am Ganesh Gandhi, an Independent Advisor, 18 years experienced windows guide. I am here to work with you on this problem. 
<br />
<br />User feedback hub and send your feedback of 
<br />"Do not install gaming features that are automatically enabled." to Mircosoft.
<br />Refer here: 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4021566/windows-10-send-feedback-to-microsoft-with-feedback-hub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/402156...</a>
<br />
<br />Kindly follow these steps to stop updates:
<br />
<br />- You can mark your WiFi connection as metered to disable Windows 10 forced updates.
<br />
<br />- Using Services: 
<br />1. In Control Panel &gt; Administrative Tools, open 'Services'.
<br />2. In Services window, scroll to Windows Update and turn off the process.
<br />3. To turn it off, right-click on the process, click on Properties and select Disabled.
<br />
<br />- Also try GP Edit to disable update:
<br />Windows logo key + R then type gpedit.msc and click OK.
<br />Go to Computer Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Windows Components &gt; Windows Update.
<br />Double-click Configure Automatic Updates.
<br />Select Disabled in Configured Automatic Updates on the left, and click Apply and OK to disable the Windows automatic update feature.
<br />
<br />If you need to update your Windows version later, you can repeat the steps above, then select Enabled to turn on this feature, so that you can continue to download the updates.
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>I want the Windows updates. I just don't want Microsoft's gaming features. Unfortunately, you can't can't get one without the other because you cannot pick and choose which update components you'd like to install.</p>

<p>I assume you are referring to a version update. It's good practice to go over all of your custom settings after the version updates</p>
<p>as they do change some settings that may be related to new features or changes made to existing features&nbsp; back to default.</p>
<p>I've never had a cumulative update re-enable any of the gaming features though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><em>"Stick with XBox! Do not install gaming features that are automatically enabled."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>+1 to that. I would be nice if MS got back to developing a highly customisable and stable OS, and stop trying to make Windows
</p>
<p>a one stop entertainment and shopping 'experience'.</p>
<p>Having said that, the game recording feature seems to be very popular, even if Game Mode is pretty pointless for anyone with</p>
<p>hardware powerful enough to do a games graphics justice.</p>

            It is happening with the updates and I think it started at the end of 2017.&nbsp; I was unable to get any of the updates until around January of this year.&nbsp; I started to get an error message that update 1709 cannot be installed.&nbsp; I am still unable to get all
 of the updates to install and I am getting the error message I referenced for a couple of months now.&nbsp; I have tried to do a system restore but that failed too and there were only 3 restore points&nbsp;with the earliest being&nbsp;5/6/18 -- I think that is very weird.&nbsp;
 My system was initially running Windows 7 but I upgraded a couple of years ago.&nbsp; Everything was fine until the updates started at the end of last year.&nbsp; I am not yet at version 1709 and I see the updates are at version 1803 according to a reply to my post.&nbsp;
 In looking at my update history the update for version 1709 has been failing since 2/22/18.

            Hi Kevin, 1709 is no longer the latest version of Windows 10, 1803 has been released, you should go straight to that version to bring your system up to date and make all previous updates obsolete . . .
<br />
<br />With these major upgrades, the most successful method is to upgrade from the Windows 10 ISO - you download the ISO and then perform an Offline Upgrade
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), then choose ISO
<br />
<br />When the ISO file completes downloading
<br />
<br />Disconnect from the Internet
<br />
<br />Disable any 3rd party Antivirus you may be running
<br />
<br />Then, double click it and then run Setup.exe to begin the upgrade . . .

            The message is coming from a feature update to version 1709 -- I have not been able to successfully install that version on my computer.&nbsp; I have tried to go to the Microsoft website and download the package for that version and it would not allow me to
 install it on my computer.&nbsp; I verified that the package matched the specs of my computer but it did not work.&nbsp; I have tried the repair tool that popped up when I clicked on the error message from the upgrade assistant but that did not work.&nbsp; I went to wiki-errors
 and it suggested a repair tool that wants you to buy a license for a repair tool that I do not know is not another scam called "tech utilities".&nbsp; Each time it runs it gives you different totals of items to be repaired but it always wants you to get a license
 to remove the items that it identifies exceeding 2,400 issues to be fixed each time it runs.

            Now manual upgrade to 1709 will not be possible as media creation tool has been upgraded for 1803. You should upgrade to 1803 not to 1709. Once you upgrade to 1803, the error regarding 1709 will go away.

<br />Follow the steps 2, 3 &amp; 4 as given in my reply.

<h2>            I have windows xp home edition-version 2002-service pack 2. Message ox80240036 when I try to install updates. What could be the problem&#63;</h2>
                    I did this about a year ago and everything worked fine. I tried the" fix it" and "ask microsoft" and a long address that ends in "x86-enu.exe" but that was "not available". Again, when I try to connect to "downloads" I get the message http://www.update.microsoft.com/windowserror0x80240036update/.&nbsp;

    <title>Skype Can&#39;t Detect Any Webcam - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> crod_60  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype Can&#39;t Detect Any Webcam</h2>
                    <p><span>Last week (5/13/18 -5/20/18), the latest Microsoft Update was installed and a Skype problem occurred, i.e. a phantom drive (~500 MB) was created where no files were listed but was 80%+ filled.
 I took my PC to a local computer repair/service company and the phantom drive was removed.
</span></p>
<p><span>Reconnecting the PC and accessories, I then verified that all accessories and applications were working correctly. Everything was functioning correctly except Skype. I made a video call where
 I was able to hear audio and see the video of the person I called. The person on the other end of the call could hear me (call audio) but they could not see my picture (video). I received the following Skype error message: “Skype Can't Detect Any Webcam.”
 I am fairly certain that my webcam is, and was working correctly when I disconnected the webcam to bring my computer to the repair shop.</span></p>

<h2>            How do I retrieve a reply to my question</h2>
                    Someone answered my question.&nbsp; How do I find their reply.&nbsp; Unfortunately, this question will probably be answered the same way and I will not know how to find answers.&nbsp; When I receive an email that says someone answered my question I don't know what to
 do next but it looks like the email wants me to select Microsoft Community, so I do.&nbsp; Once I'm in there I don't see anything about logging in with my password or retrieving replies or anything else that indicates how to proceed.&nbsp; It looks like this whole system
 could be improved.

 may be able to use your camera in Skype for Windows Desktop or the Skype for Windows 10 App.</span></span></span>

<p>Not me. Mind you, I just got my Xbox One set up about 2 hours ago. My drive has been running great as well. Maybe try shutting it down completely, unplug it, leave it for 5 minutes, plug it in, and try the disc again.</p>

<p>i had this issue many times. i called Microsoft and they told me to do a hard reset. If that didn't work i would have to send it in.
</p>
<p>if you put in the disc and you don't hear the drive spinning the disc, eject the disk and stick the disc half way in. It will try to grab the disc from you but hold it for a second or two. You should hear the drive spinning. Let the disc go into the drive
 and you should be able to play/watch the disc.</p>
<p>It's been working for me! hope it works for you!</p>

<p>Timmi, that works for me. &nbsp;If I put the disc in half way and wait for it to spin the disc plays. &nbsp;However you should not have to do this for a several hundred dollar console. &nbsp;Did they end up replacing your Xbox or are you continuing to work with this work
 around?</p>

<p>Fyi, contacted support and they are going to fix the drive. &nbsp;They were very helpful. &nbsp;Might want to do the same before your drive fails completely.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 says it&#39;s &#34;Working on updates&#34; every time I start up my computer</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>This problem has been going on for a while now, and I've tried quite a few things to try to fix it. It all started when windows 10 decided I needed to update to windows 10 (the same way it does when you're running an older version of windows) and downloaded
 an installer and everything for me automatically. I deleted the installer and all the files that came with it, and, temporarily, the problem was solved. The next day, however, it went back to "Working on updates 100% Do not turn of your computer" every single
 time I start up. It goes for about 1-2 minutes, but before (being on an ssd) it took less than 15 secs to start up. No fix seems to work permanently. I checked and the update checker says my windows version is completely up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Laptop PC Specs:</p>
<p>Storage: 1 TB Hard Drive and 512GB SSD (Windows is installed on both. I run it off the solid state)</p>
<p>CPU: Intel i7-6700HQ CPU @ 2.6GHz</p>
<p>Ram: 16.0 GB</p>
<p>Graphics: Nvida GeForce GTX 950M</p>

<p>Hi Davis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps this is due to a corrupted or possibly missing system file that was deleted along with the installed and all the files that came with it. We suggest that you perform a repair upgrade using the Windows 10 ISO. Doing so will install a fresh copy of
 Windows 10 over the existing software on your PC. You may refer to this <strong>
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085">Wiki Article</a></strong> by
<strong>Andre Da Costa</strong> for the steps on how to do so.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should you encounter any further issues, please do let us know.</p>

<p>Ok so here's the update:</p>
<p>I started by following the wiki article you referred to and used the Windows 10 ISO to install a fresh copy of windows 10. It didnt work, and I got the error message shown in the picture I attached.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked on the "troubleshooting" link and did all of the 10+ items on the list, retrying the refresh each time. At this point I've deleted every single program that I can that didn't come with the computer out of the box of my ssd. I am fine with any solution
 that fixes this. I don't care if it wipes my ssd.&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc1c3181-fa3c-4ee6-a158-8d3745a66c63" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/bc1c3181-fa3c-4ee6-a158-8d3745a66c63" /></a><br />

<p>Hi Davis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To further help you, let us know which boot system you are using (UEFI or Legacy BIOS). Please note that Master Boot Record (MBR) disks use the standard BIOS partition table. GUID partition table (GPT) disks use unified extensible firmware interface (UEFI).
 One advantage of GPT disks is that you can have more than four partitions on each disk. GPT is also required for disks larger than 2 TB. We suggest that you change the type of your disk depending on which boot system are you using. Please see this
<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc725671%28v=ws.11%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
guide</a> on how you can convert your disk type.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you need further assistance.</p>

<p>Thank you so very much for all your help so far!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have UEFI on my solid state at least. Does that mean I should convert it to the other?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I do have windows on my hard drive that should be completely fine. Do you think it would be possible to just wipe my ssd and then make something to reinstall it on there using my hard drive?</p>
<p>

            Hey there, Mark
Welcome to the Microsoft Community forums. I am Nathan, one of the experts within this community!

In regards to refunds, I would recommend contacting Microsoft Support directly as Microsoft needs to look into your account. Here is a link to support: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/ 

I am also going to reroute this back to the Microsoft Community, so if you have any problems, an official support agent can assist further. 

Thanks, 
Regards,
