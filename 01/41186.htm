    <title>Bizarre problem. Internet working, but streaming video, audio, and - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cypherwulf  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bizarre problem. Internet working, but streaming video, audio, and email don&#39;t always work</h2>
                    <p>So my internet works, it's loading pages just fine. My connection is about 30mbps so it's not slow either. I run a VPN but it only knocks that down a tiny bit. Internet has been working fine for over a year.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of the last few days, streaming video and audio will sometimes enter an infinite loading cycle (by this i mean the page loads but the video or audio player never starts the media). The internet is on and functioning, but sites and apps that stream video
 and audio don't consistently work. Sometimes I'll refresh it multiple times and it still won't work. Specifically I'm using the app for 8tracks.com and through Firefox I'm browsing youtube. BOTH of these will sometimes stop working for no apparent reason.
 Just an infinite load, even with refreshes. Other websites load just fine during these issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Strangely, this is even affecting email sync. Email will sometimes have an error and wont sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried disabling the VPN, updating the firmware on my router, and making sure everything is up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought it might be the latest Flash update that's giving me trouble, but email seems to be affected too... or maybe it's something else that coincidentally started at the same time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Honestly have no idea how to even begin to troubleshoot this from here. My internet works just fine, except for streaming video, audio, and email, where service is hit or miss.</p>

    <title>MS Outlook Icon &#47; Shortcut icon problems - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> regalis18  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Outlook Icon &#47; Shortcut icon problems</h2>
                    I'm trying to figure out what I did to corrupt my MS Outlook icon.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I know I caused the problem myself by dragging MS Outlook from the MS office folder in the start/programs menu to my desktop to create a shortcut. I tried dragging the icon back into the programs/start menu folder, but that did nothing.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Currently, the icon for Outlook is the generic program icon. Also, Outlook no longer is present in the program/start menu folder. The program itself runs fine and it's icon is currently on the desktop (I found this by doing a windows search and creating
 a shortcut from there. That icon in windows search is also messed up).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I do not know how to reverse this problem. Reformatting is not an option nor is system restore (because there are no restore points).&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks! </div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
I'd suggest you to <strong>rebuild icon cache.<br />
</strong>&nbsp;<br />
a. Click<span style="font-weight: bold"> Start</span>, then <span style="font-weight: bold">
Control Panel</span> and in the <span style="font-weight: bold">Search box </span>
write<span style="font-weight: bold"> Folder options.</span>
<p>b. Now click <span style="font-weight: bold">Folder Options</span> to open and select (dot)
c. Open a <span style="font-weight: bold">Windows Explorer </span>window.<br />
d. Go to <span style="font-weight: bold">C:\Users\(User Name)\AppData\Local</span><br />
e. Right click on<span style="font-weight: bold"> IconCache.db </span>and click on
f. Click on <span style="font-weight: bold">Yes</span> to confirm the deletion.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>This deletes the file to the Recycle Bin. It is safe to empty the Recycle Bin when finished.</p>
<p>g. Close the window.<br />
h. Empty the Recycle Bin.<br />
i. Restart the computer.<br />
j. When you go back, you will notice the Size of the <span style="font-weight: bold">
IconCache.db</span> file is smaller, and the Date Modified is now the current date.</p>
<p><strong>NOTE: </strong>If for some reason IconCache.db is not there or the size has not changed much then you may just restart the computer again. You may need to restart a couple of times in some cases.</p>
<p>k. The icon cache will get rebuilt.</p>

<h2>            Feature update to Windows 10, version 1809 amd64 2019-03 Won&#39;t Install</h2>
                    I'm stuck in an "install loop" where Windows Update goes through the initialization, then downloads and installs and says it installed pending restart but nothing happens when I restart. I get a black screen that just shows the loading dot circle thing
 at the bottom center of the screen but not the typical blue install screen where a percentage is shown. My laptop then boots normally and then Windows Update starts the same process all over again once it boots to the desktop. If I view the updates screen
 in settings, it says the install failed and to try to restart. I've done this several times but nothing has changed. I'm trapped in the install loop and it's very resource heavy and slows down my laptop considerably every time it attempts to update so any
 help with this would be greatly appreciated!

            Hello Iskelly,
<br />
<br />My name is Patricia and I am an Independent Advisor. I am here to help you today.
<br />
<br />Try this procedure.
<br />Shutdown/restart three times via power button.
<br />Then Windows recovery environment will open.
<br />
<br />And you will be able to repair, reset or restore in this environment.

            I tried this and ended up getting blue-screened twice. Luckily I had an old repair file saved on a thumb drive and had to restore windows completely. After restoring and re-installing all the programs I had (luckily all my files were saved), it's returned
 to the update loop. Are there known issues with Microsoft Visual C++? I had to re-install Microsoft Visual C++ to use a downloaded video capture tool.&nbsp;

</p><p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have about the same problem, only that I don't try to copy data from one location to another but I try to create or rename folders in a directory that is on my hard drive. Could the problem have to do with an excel file contained in those folders that
 has data links to another excel file which lies in a network location? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for any help I can get.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Vicky,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In regards to the issue, I require additional information to make sure that helps us to resolve the issue easily:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1) Did you get any error message/code when you’re trying to rename/change the folder?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue may occur due to administrator privileges /virus effect .I suggest you to try the following steps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s try few methods and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> Make sure that you are logged in as an administrator.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2</span></strong><span>: Try to take ownership of the files and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Taking ownership of a folder from explorer</span></p>
<p>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Locate the file or folder on which you want to take ownership in windows explorer.</p>
<p>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Right click on file or folder and select “<strong>Properties</strong>” from
<strong>Context Menu</strong>.</p>
<p>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Click on "<strong>Security"</strong> tab.</p>
<p>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Click on “<strong>Advanced</strong>” button.</p>
<p>5)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now click on "<strong>Owner</strong>" tab in <strong>Advanced Security Settings</strong> for User windows.</p>
<p>6)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Click on <strong>Edit Button</strong> and select user from given Change Owner to list if user or group is not in given list.</p>
<p>7)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Click on other users or groups. Enter name of <strong>user/group</strong> and click
<strong>ok.</strong></p>
<p>8)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now select <strong>User/group</strong> and click <strong>
apply </strong>and <strong>ok</strong>. Check “Replace owner on <strong>subcontainers</strong> and
<strong>objects”</strong> if you have files and folder within selected folder.</p>
<p>9)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Click ok when <strong>Windows Security</strong> Prompt is displayed.</p>
<p>10)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now Owner name must have changed.</p>
<p>11)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now click <strong>Ok </strong>to exist from <strong>Properties windows</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Once you have taken the ownership of file or folder next part comes is granting permissions to that file/folder or object.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the above method doesn’t work, you could try taking ownership from the command line.</span></p>
<p><span>Or Taking ownership of a file or folder from command line</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Open an elevated Command Prompt window.</span></p>
<p><span>To do so:</span></p>
<p><span>1)<span>&nbsp; </span><strong>Go to &gt; Start &gt; All Programs &gt; Accessories</strong></span></p>
<p><span>2)<span>&nbsp; </span><strong>Right-click on Command Prompt</strong>, and then click
<strong>Run as Administrator</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>3)<span>&nbsp; </span>Type the following command and press ENTER:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>takeown /f &lt;foldername&gt; /r /d y</span></strong></p>
<p><span>4) To assign the Administrators group Full Control Permissions for the folder, use this syntax:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>icacls &lt;foldername&gt; /grant administrators:F /T</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The <strong>/T parameter</strong> is added so that the operation is carried out through all the sub-directories and files within that folder.</span></p>
<p><span>e. To know more information about the above commands, run these commands from a Command Prompt window.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>takeown /?</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>icacls /?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Once you take ownership, you can grant permissions on those files or folders.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong><span>I suggest you to
<strong>run the virus scan</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>You can refer to the Microsoft article and check if it helps:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/how-remove-computer-virus#how-remove-computer-virus=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/how-remove-computer-virus#how-remove-computer-virus=windows-7</a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>For antivirus scan:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>When you disable Antivirus:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Important Note: Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install
 other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>

<p>I have been working with Windows7 on a new PC for a few weeks now and&nbsp;have suddenly been denied the right to save my own files!</p>
<p>My documents are saved to a partitioned D: drive (I have never used the XP/W7 My Documents folder for this) and there has absolutely no problem at all. But trying to save an existing file I am now getting the&nbsp;message "Unable to create..." and then gives
 the path for the file. If I try to save using a different name I get the message: "You do not have permission to save in this location. Contact the Administrator to gain permission." I am the Administrator!</p>
<p>I have tried adjusting the permissions in the Control Panel/Users but to no avail - and I'm afraid of messing things us up further.</p>
<p>How can I regain control again? (Windows installed a critical update this morning - could that be the cause of the problem?)</p>

<div>
<strong><span>Your Recovery D partition is set up by your computer manufacturer in case of serious problems in your system.<br />
You use that to restore your sytem.<br />
<br />
You are NOT supposed to touch it.... not to add or remove anything to or from it.<br />
<br />
</span></strong><span>&nbsp;Call you computer manufacturer, tell them the situation.......<br />
<br />
1. Ask them for a set of recovery DVDs to re-install Vista from it, if you don't have a set made yourself.<br />
2. Ask them how to remove the backup files or any items that are NOT supposed to be there... the D: drive.<br />
They created the recovery partition, they know perfectly how to take care of it.<br />
Let them teach you how to.<br />

Contact **&nbsp;Dell **about buying Recovery DVDs and/or fixing your Recovery Partition.<br />
They know exactly which files should be there, and which ones for you to<br />
delete!<br />
<br />
In future, buy an external Drive, and back up to that!<br />

<p><span><span><strong>as you are NOT getting error messages saying that d: drive is full read the first 1/2 of&nbsp;this and supply the information required</strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>it is very important that we know that</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>if the d: partition is above 20gbs would you inform as to its exact size and what name the manufacturer gives it</strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span>but if you read the below information you will see that if it is between 5gbs and 19gbs it is normally a recovery partition to put your machine back to factory standards how you bought it</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>follow&nbsp;the below information</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>System or Data backups should be saved to an external Hard Drive or DVDs.</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;</span>If the information below applies to you, you will have to contact the Computer Manufacturer for advice.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Read this info:</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Your D: Drive normally is the Recovery Partition<span>and is about 5Gbs-19GBs in size</span>, that the Manufacturer put there,&nbsp;for your computer to put it back
 to factory settings in case of System Crash.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Contact your Computer Manufacturer on how to remove anything you have saved to the Recovery Drive, as it is their Recovery Partition, not Microsoft’s.<br />
<br />
It is not for you to save anything to; and it is not to compress and/or Index, Disk Cleanup, use for Backup, Defrag or have System Restore turned on for it.<br />
<br />
<span>Also ask them if it is possible to make Recovery Disk/s from the Recovery Partition in case of Hard Drive failure or System Crash.</span><br />
<br />
Ask the Manufacturer if you can make them, and how to delete/fix what has been done there.</span></p>

<p>Please ask in the correct forum, a Windows 7 one. Not only is your<br />
message off-topic here in a Vista forum, but if you ask in the right<br />
place, you will have a much better chance of getting the answer you<br />
need, since that's where the experts in your technology hang out.</p>

</p><p>1.) My Lenovo Ideapad Y500 was originally a Windows 8.1 laptop that was recently updated to Windows 10. I've had no connectivity issues when I was in 8.1. However, in 10, I have to set my Power Plan to "balanced", as well as change the "On battery" and "Plugged
 in" within Power Saving Mode to "Maximum Performance" in order to connect to the Internet. If I change the power plan to power saver, or if I change the "on battery" and "plugged in" to any other settings, then I get a yellow exclamation on the wifi icon in
 the bottom right corner.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.) Also, ever since my Windows 10 upgrade, one of my USB flash drives is not being recognized and it also crashes Windows explorer. All my other USB drives do work on my Windows 10 laptop, just not that one. However, that problematic USB drive works on
 all my other machines just fine.</p>
<p>

            <p>Your computer has a large collection of Windows 10 drivers at Lenovo and a recommended BIOS update. For best Windows 10 compatibility those should be the preferred drivers used in your computer, in case you haven't installed them already.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Additionally, Lenovo has a list of their pre-installed software that should be removed prior to upgrading&nbsp;and mentions some post-upgrade issues you might expect. Ideally the software&nbsp;should be uninstalled before doing the Windows upgrade but better late
 than never.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Although it doesn't&nbsp;pertain directly to your computer, there is a WiFi connectivity issue that can crop up even in desktops which is somehow related to battery management software. In this case the battery is installed in a UPS rather than the computer but
 the two issues could be related.</p>

"Hi,</p>
<p>I am using same model mouse with windows 7 too, you will find the bluetooth connect button which is beside the on/off button, when you click this button once, and open the "Add the Device" in the Devices and Printers, wait a moment, the PC will find the
 mouse and click Next to connect.<br />
BTW, you make sure the Bluetooth in your PC is functional and driver install correctly.</p>
<p>No need install any software which is related the mouse in your PC.</p>

<p>i thought initial previews of Venetica were gonna be like Soul Reaver. It ended up being like Fable instead. I loved Soul Reaver 1. One of my favorite games ever. I got stuck in the second level in the second one. Maybe this is a sign I need to go back and
 finish that up. I hope they make a new one. God, that would be epic. A new Darksiders AND a new Soul Reaver!</p>

<p>Oh haha, I thought you was being pessimistic because even Ninja Gaiden got tacked on MP modes.&nbsp; It could happen but Ihope Crystal D makes this game and I trust them still to do the series right.</p>

<p>@dark half - here's to hoping that works out.&nbsp; I would love to see both games come out this year, I honestly love 3rd person adventure games perhaps the most of all.</p>

<p>I hope if it was to have co-op it would have Offline Co-Op as well. It seems games that are made today are straying away from local co-op, which is a shame. Me and my brother used to play Legacy of Kain all the time, switching over when we get killed. He
 does not have an Xbox 360, so offline co-op would be a welcomed addition. Have it Fable 3 style and it would be great.</p>

<p>Blood Omen is for a very good game. Bought it back on gamecube, but it didn't have the 60hz option like the xbox version. Glad I bought the xbox versions since it fully supports pal version @ 60hz option. HAIL XBOX! Eat yr hrt out GAMECUBE!, LOL!!!!!</p>
<p>Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver Dreamcast version was much better than the PSX version. On DC it was trully 3d! LOVE LOVE LOVE

    <title>How to change monitor&#47;projector identifier - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david chester  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to change monitor&#47;projector identifier</h2>
                    <p><br />
This problem has existed for years but having just installed my projector on a Windows 8 PC for the first time I am dismayed to see that this problem still exists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When just a monitor is connected to my PC, using Windows key P shows the monitor as "computer" correctly. As soon as I connect and power up my amplifier/projector though, this changes and the monitor becomes "projector" and the projector becomes "computer".
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is incredibly irritating and has existed for many years. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I go into screen settings, I can set the monitor as primary and I can swap the display positions left, right etc. with no problems. BUT, the monitor always displays as identity 2!&nbsp; There appears to be no way to force the monitor to be device number one,
 so when the PC boots, Windows in it's stupidity asks for the login data on the projector which is not turned on! The only way to make it appear on the monitor is to turn off the amplifier before rebooting and then turn it on again after.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can see that a lot of people are having this issue but the only Microsoft response I can see is someone telling someone to post a new thread about it.
</p>
<p><br />
So here I am posting a new thread about it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Listen Microsoft.... This has been a problem for YEARS. How can we get it to work correctly, or when will you actually fix it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I look forward to your response.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><br />
a. Press Windows Key + P<br />
b. You can also go to the Control Panel<br />

            <p>The problem is: PC display <span>is identified as secondary display, and external display as the pc display. So if one choose "only secondary display" with win+P keys, the external display switch off and stuffs are on pc display. That is the
 opposite of what it should be.</span></p>
<p><span>So it is not matter of resolution or primary display or extend/duplicate/etc... but how to swap display identified as primary (pc display, the number "1" ) with the number "2".</span></p>

            <p>This was the &nbsp;response I made to the first question that I found that was similar to mine which was regarding windows 7 in '09. &nbsp;I still can't believe how easy it is for people to nonchalantly suggest that the numbers don't matter. &nbsp;Maybe they don't (though,
 in my case they most certainly do matter) but the fact that they are wrong matters to me and those words shouldn't be a part of any explanation to anyone about anything on any level.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a similar problem with windows 8.1. &nbsp;When I plug my tv into my pc it usurps the number one spot. &nbsp;At some point after that the native resolution (reported) of the old plasma monitor with which I'm working mysteriously changes and I'm left looking
 at duplo blocks with no options of changing this while my tv is connected to my pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is a little problem that I easily work around but I thought I'd come here to see if there is something more of a solution available. &nbsp;I only made it to the second "the identity numbers don't matter."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Who are you people that say this? &nbsp;Even without the resolution issues I have, those numbers matter to me because they are wrong. &nbsp;There is nothing right or acceptable about an issue that misidentifies anything, regardless of how seemingly arbitrary. &nbsp;If
 the identity and behavior of something that lives in my system changes when a special guest shows, that is wrong. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently, in the five+ years since the original post, Microsoft has seen fit to do nothing to remedy the situation. &nbsp;Just the option to reassign the identities, is that so hard to do? &nbsp;According to the replies to OP, this company has conditioned its customer
 base to simply accept a problem if nothing is "on fire." &nbsp;The problem is the fire! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone within the company has read the original post so, basically, I have to think that for the past 5+ years microsoft has been knowingly and deliberately putting out a product that some users have issue with. &nbsp;I'm sure that I am probably not the only
 that has the resolution of their primary monitor changed but even without that, why can't I expect precision from one of the largest tech companies in the world. &nbsp;Why can't I expect a resolution after 5+ years? &nbsp;With one minor, inconsequential issue, Microsoft
 has made it clear that they neither care about the quality of their flagship product or for the concerns of their customers.</p>

            <p>I have the same problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Changing my primary display is easy but changing its identity is all but impossible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 2 displays - one a 27" 2560x1440 screen connected via DVI (my primary screen) and the other a 1920X1080 TV connected via HDMI. However, they are identified as display 2 and display 1 respectively.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This to all intents renders my Spyder4 screen calibrator effectively useless as it will only calibrate display 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Surely, there must be a simple way of switching which is display 1 and which is display 2 in much the same way as&nbsp;the tick box that presently says which is the main display.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone got a solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A registry hack?</p>

 for it to be fixed.&nbsp;If in response I'm told,</p>

            <p>Hi Jenith James,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did both those methods. &nbsp;In method 1, it shows Windows installer active and manual. &nbsp;In method 2 this is the error message I received. &nbsp;Windows cannot find "msiexec/unreg". Make sure you typed the name correclty, and then try again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a laptop it is a lenovo.</p>
<p>The program I really need to have downloaded is called blackboard collaborate. &nbsp;It is a program that lets my child enter into an online class. &nbsp;I am trying to install the blackboard collaborate launcher. &nbsp;I am using chrome but it does not matter what web
 browser I use even internect explorer will not download the program. &nbsp;what does happen is that when I click onto the download the wizard comes up but if you watch it, it almost seems as though two of them are open but when I go to the task manager is only
 shows one has been opened. &nbsp; &nbsp;I then click next to start the download program wizard, then install and this is the error message I receive " Another installation is in progress. &nbsp;You must complete that installation before continuing this one." &nbsp;again I open
 Task Manager to see what else is downloading and there is not other program, it is a glitch on my childs computer that is stopping it from downloading correctly. &nbsp;I have another Lenovo and it downloaded just find. &nbsp;I want it on my childs computer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had other programs do the samething. &nbsp;the error message comes up saying another progam is downloading. &nbsp;what is wrong?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you help me please.&nbsp;</p>
        </p>

            <p>Hi Mikki,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you checked if restarting the computer helps in any way?</p>
<p>Did you try installing a different program? Does that give you same message?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may&nbsp;check for the issue by ending the <strong>msiexec.exe </strong>process</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press CTRL+SHIFT+ESC on the keyboard.</li><li>Click More Details and then go to the Process tab.</li><li>Find the msiexec.exe process, right click and click End Task.</li><li>Restart the computer and check for the issue.</li></ol>
<p>Do reply if this does not help.</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you encounter issues connecting an Xbox One Wireless Controller on your Windows 10 PC via Bluetooth, it may be because of an incorrect device configuration. Another factor that we have to take into consideration is an outdated Bluetooth driver. We suggest
 running the Bluetooth troubleshooter on your Windows 10 PC. Here are the steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the <strong>Start</strong> button, then select <strong>Settings</strong> &gt;
<strong>Update &amp; security</strong> &gt; <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Find and fix other problems</strong>, select <strong>Bluetooth</strong> &gt;
<strong>Run the troubleshooter</strong>.</li><li>Restart your device so that the changes will take effect.</li><li>Disconnect then reconnect the controller and check if the same issue occurs.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We also recommend verifying if the Bluetooth device shows on the <strong>Device Manager</strong>. To do so, kindly perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><span>In the search box on the taskbar, type <strong>Device Manager</strong>, and select it from the list of results.</span></li><li><span>In Device Manager, select <strong>View</strong> &gt; <strong>Show hidden devices</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In Device Manager, select <strong>View</strong> &gt; <strong>Devices by connection</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Find your Bluetooth hardware.</span></li></ol>

            Hi huklbery,<br />
<br />
Thanks for posting in Microsoft answers!<br />
<br />
a. Is this the only time they get this error when running the BookCAT database?<br />
b. What is the hardware specification of the two Windows 7 computers? <br />
c. What is the RAM on both the machines? <br />
<br />
You may open event viewer and check if there are any other significant error messages.
<br />
<br />
Event Viewer is a tool that displays detailed information about significant events (for example, programs that don't start as expected or updates that are downloaded automatically) on your computer. Event Viewer can be helpful when troubleshooting problems
 and errors with Windows and other programs.<br />
<br />
Open Event Viewer by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking System and Security, clicking Administrative Tools, and then double-clicking Event Viewer. If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or
 provide confirmation.<br />
<br />
Refer the link below for more details: <br />
<strong><br />
What information appears in event logs (Event Viewer)?<br />

            Hi Igor 
<br />
<br />I am sorry, there is no way to move an old game form a previous installation of Windows 10 to another installation
<br />
<br />This is the problem with Store games, they must be downloaded and installed again. Unlike Steam games, which cam be moved from drive to drive and even PC to PC, this is not the case with Store games . .

<p>When I last logged on I had the little speaker icon on the bottom right of my screen&nbsp;which I could adjust accordingly to whatever was playing on the built in laptop speakers. However last night a friend says he turned the sound right down and now there is
 a little red cross beside the speaker icon and when I hover over it, it says "No Audio Output Device Is Installed" and I can't click open it at all. I don't need an output device and never have had one, only the built in speakers. I have searched though control
 panel etc to the best of my knowlwedge but have no idea how to get my sound back. Please help. By the way the speakers do still work as they still make sound when Windows opens etc.</p>

            <p>Download drivers from the HP web site (your printer is supported)&nbsp;:-</p>
<p>When you right click on Computer below the window will show which Windows 8 you have, 32 or 64 bit, so you can detirmine the driver you need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Change device installation settings :-</p>
<p>This stops Windows going to automatic updates to find a driver as soom as the USB cable is plugged in.</p>
<p>Start(if you have a menu) or open the Folder icon on the Taskber(Windows Explorer)&nbsp;/right click Computer/Advanced System Settings(on left panel) /Hardware/Device Installation Settings - set to No let me choose and never install from win update/Save Changes.</p>
<p>See the link below for a walk through :-</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turn printer on but don't connect USB cable until prompted (connection stage).</p>
<p>You will need to be at the desktop to install.</p>

            <p>First thing you need to do is uninstall the printer and any software that was installed with it.<br />
*Unplug the printer from the PC. If it's connected wirelessly, turn the printer off.<br />
*From the Charm bar, go to Settings &gt; Control Panel &gt; Programs and Features and uninstall anything that is listed as "HP OfficeJet J4680" or similar.<br />
*Reboot</p>

<p>After you're back up and running, download<br />
A) The "HP Printer Install Wizard for Windows" &lt;<a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?softwareitem=mp-115766-2&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=&amp;lc=en&amp;os=4132&amp;product=3692888&amp;sw_lang=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?softwareitem=mp-115766-2&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=&amp;lc=en&amp;os=4132&amp;product=3692888&amp;sw_lang=</a>&gt;
 and run it, following its instructions; or,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>B) The Full Feature Driver from here &lt;<a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?softwareitem=mp-109973-1&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=&amp;lc=en&amp;os=4132&amp;product=3692888&amp;sw_lang=" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareDownloadIndex?softwareitem=mp-109973-1&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=&amp;lc=en&amp;os=4132&amp;product=3692888&amp;sw_lang=</a>&gt;<br />
Run the installation. Somewhere during the install, you will be prompted to either plug the printer in and turn it on, or just turn it on for a wireless discovery. Do NOT plug it in or turn it on until prompted or the installation may not complete correctly.<br />
Once it's done, reboot whether it says to or not (just for good measure). Now you should be able to print to your heart's content :-)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would try A) first, since it'll give you step-by-step instruction on what to do.</p>
<p><br />
If you have any problems, post back.</p>
