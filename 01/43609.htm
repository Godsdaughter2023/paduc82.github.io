<h2>            How to &#34;fix&#34; Start up &#34;Could Not Be Found&#34; Error Messages - Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Please be kind, I'm 59 yrs old and this is like Greek to me. I'm running Windows 8.1 on a Dell Inspiron. For a month I've been getting a message at start up that reads:&nbsp;
<strong>Run DLL:&nbsp; </strong><strong>C:\\USERS\kaasan12047\AppData\Local\Conduit\BackgroundContainer\BackgroundContainer.dll&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Module could not be found.&nbsp;&nbsp; Problem starting the parameter is incorrect.&nbsp;
</strong>As an inexpeienced user I didn't have any idea how to fix this, so I went to Control Panel and tried Find and Fix Problems (I miss the Mr Fixit program which doesn't work with 8.1), but Conduit is not a listed program, and the folder does not end with
 exe so can't be found. I asked my son (who has a Computer Science Degree) and was told to "Google how to open hidden files and folders", which I did. I can now find the "Conduit\BackgroundContainer" part. I tried Uninstalling them and restarting, but the error
 message still comes up.&nbsp; Google shows Conduit is a "Browser Hijacker" so I guess it's from my Firefox Internet Browser.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't noticed any problems with my internet usage, but this error box coming up on my start up is making me crazy. How do I get rid of it? and Is there a way to resolve these start up pop up error messages without needing a Computer Science Degree?&nbsp;
 I'm already afraid to delete anything and not cause problems?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be Gentle and Clear!</p>

</p><p><span>This is a well known issue, and we’ve known precisely which “startup item” is causing the&nbsp;problem for more than a year now – it’s a scheduled task named “BackgroundContainer startup”. Simply deleting

<p><strong>Recently i loaded the widcomm bluetooth driver. I also loaded blackberry desktop software. A few days since my toshiba laptop started to experience the BSOD. In fact it started to do all sorts of weird crashing. I used system restore to take me to
 a point before those programs were installed and since then everything seems to be operating ok (for a day at least). Before i used system restore for about two days the laptop would last at bst a minute or two before crashing. Anyone else experience anything
 similar? Is this a known issue with bluetooth?</strong></p>

            You need to use the Toshiba Bluetooth stack. This model is supported on Win7 by Toshiba, so they provide a driver. Here's a link to their support page.<br />

Please uninstall the Widcomm driver and try the Toshiba driver.<br />

                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used 'open with -- Photos' to trim a video recorded at 60/59.92 FPS.&nbsp;<br />
The trimmed product is reduced to 30 FPS.</p>
<p>Is there any way to retain the original FPS but use Photos to trim it?</p>
<p>

            Hi CalvaryZender,
<br />
<br />I wish I can help you do this in Photos, but it seems very unlikely. The app is quite limited in functionality, so to do what you want to do, you have to use a different program. For instance, you can use DaVinci Resolve from Blackmagic Design, that is not for the faint of heart though, and maybe overkill with what you're doing? But if you're an avid video editor, it's a thought.
<br />
<br />Here's a significantly more straightforward approach, you can use Handbrake to define the amount of seconds from beginning to end: <a href="https://handbrake.fr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://handbrake.fr</a>
<br />
<br />And here is how to trim video with it: <a href="https://superuser.com/questions/999022/how-do-i-trim-a-video-using-handbrake" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://superuser.com/questions/999022/how-do-i...</a>
<br />
<br />You should then be good to go. Feel free to come back with any additional concerns or questions, good luck in what you're doing.

    <title>Update to Windows 10 has wiped out personal options - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Update to Windows 10 has wiped out personal options</h2>
                    <p>My laptop has Windows 10 and last night upon shutdown it did an automatic update. &nbsp;The update took forever so I left my laptop at work. &nbsp;When I arrived at work this morning, I noticed my background picture is gone, Cortana has been turned back on, any link
 I click on is asking what program I want to use to open it, and much more.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's looks like this update reset all my personal options. &nbsp;First off why? &nbsp;Secondly, can I just undo the update and have it all go back to the way it was?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our IT person is on holidays and I need some advice. &nbsp;Is it best to leave the computer as is and slowly re-add my personal options? &nbsp;If so, at least tell me how to turn that darn Cortana off - I do not like it at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks everyone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

            <p>The best solution is not to uninstall the update as that merely leaves&nbsp;the problem to occur again and you lose the benefits included in the latest update.. I would simple set up&nbsp;again the features you have personalised.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Notwithstanding it is extremely annoying that an update resets to defaults as it is not always readily apparent what has happened. Also&nbsp;one tends to forget how something was done to get you where you were.</p>

<p>Okay, I purchased four pieces of DLC for Saints Row: The Third.</p>
<p>"Unlockable Pack"<br />
"The Trouble With Clones"<br />
"Gangstas In Space"<br />
"Genkibowl VII"<br />
<br />
The purchases went through when I go to them in the marketplace theres a checkmark where the cost usually is confirming that this is purchased and not to mention it took my points so that's a pretty good indicator the purchases went through. &nbsp;Whenever I try
 to download either of the four it starts at 1% and then within a second jumps to 100% and says the download is complete. Which is impossible given the size of the DLC and when I go to storage devices to see if the add-on's are there - nothing.</p>
<p>However, Saints Row: The Third also four FREE pieces of DLC and I was able to download those fine and they're showing up on my hard drive.</p>

<p><strong>Short Version:</strong> Not able to download what I paid for. Got plenty of storage space.</p>

<p>Hey there Trick! Do these add-ons show up on the Hard Drive with a yellow "!" icon, indicating it is corrupt? Does it show up at all? If so, please delete the add-ons completely, clear the system cache, restart the console, and then try downloading again
 from your History. Let us know if that helps, thanks! </p>

<p>The best steps if a download fails is to get into the games and apps folder, find the content and delete it. Back out of games and apps, move to the bottom and select System Items. In here, if you have marketplace system data, delete it. After that, clear
 cache as Mister Gwyther said, then download again.</p>
<p>~</p>
<p>It sounds like the files are corrupted and just need to be cleared up before redownloading.

<h3> starlord dread  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to send or receive messages&#47;game invites</h2>
                    
<p>Hey guys, I've been unable to receive messages and game invites for ages now. When I send a message or game invite my friends can't see them despite me getting a message saying they are sent. I've done several hard reboots, my privacy settings are all open
 etc.....can't see an answer anywhere, I can't be the only one with this issue. It's extremely frustrating especially as all of my friends now play the ps4 so sending messages to others is vital for my on-line gaming.</p>

<p>Any help would be great.</p>

            <p>Hey there starlord dread.</p>
<p>Thanks for your patience with this. To start things out, let's have you try removing your profile from your Xbox One, power cycle (hold down power button for 8-10 seconds), and then add your profile back to your Xbox One. This can often clear up this issue.</p>
<p>Can you also check what your NAT type is displaying as under Network Settings? Thanks!</p>

<p>@chichiz123 - It sounds like you are experiencing an Xbox Live Enforcement action. You should have received an email from them advising you of the duration of your suspension.

            <p>Hey&nbsp;starlord dread -&nbsp;</p>
<p>Okay. I did not receive anything from you so let's try some more troubleshooting. I know you said you've checked your privacy settings already but let's have you toggle them. So starting from your Xbox One console dashboard:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open the Guide menu</li>
<li>Scroll down to settings</li>
<li>Open All Settings</li>
<li>Account</li>
<li>Privacy &amp; Online Safety</li>
<li>Xbox Live Privacy</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have custom settings, please select 'Adult Defaults' and then exit the screen. (If you have adult default currently selected, please customize your preferences and change a couple of them.) Next, <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">power cycle</a> your Xbox One. If you reset everything to default, try sending some messages again. If you toggled things, go back and reset it to default and then send some messages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Give that a shot and if that still doesn't work, we'll try something else. Let us know! :)</p>

    <title>Power failure during during Windows 10 reset function - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> qplah  say:</h3>
<h2>            Power failure during during Windows 10 reset function</h2>
                    <p>Greetings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I upgraded my win7 to win10 on my laptop. It ran along smoothly for a few hours, no reason to assume that there were any hiccups along the way. Then I decided to do a reset there, just to get rid of all my old data and settings, something akin to a "factory
 reset" of sorts. During the aforementioned reset, due to a blown fuse in the house and the consequent power failure (and a faulty battery), my computer powered off (naturally). Upon restarting, I am getting the message "No operating system found. Press Ctrl+Alt+Del
 to reboot." Safe to say that it looks pretty messed up now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd appreciate any help on how to go on from here. I also have a few more questions: Do I format my disk? Do I go to win7 first and do the regular win10 update, or can I install win10 from here? Is there anything else I should do? (Besides getting a new
 battery - I know, my bad!)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            <p>Hello. Thank you for replying at a short notice. My apologies for being unable to get back to you with an update earlier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, thank you. I am back with Windows 7. Fully updated, with all my drivers loaded. It took a while to do it by myself. Unfortunately, now I am unable to get the "Get Windows 10" notification for me to run the upgrade again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could you or someone guide me on how to get the upgrade notification on my computer? Yes, I understand that I could use the media creation tool to get a copy and do it the other way. But I wanted to understand WHY am I not getting that notification to upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I referred to the FAQ online as well, including the one directing the user to check through command prompt whether certain updates are installed or not, which they are. They returned a string of characters which the article says that are "package identities".
 Still, why am I not getting that "Get Windows 10" notification?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be quite grateful if someone would shed some light on the matter. Thanks.</p>

    <title>Xbox 360 Premium 20Gb Repair - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ziggy uk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360 Premium 20Gb Repair</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I'm looking for some advice, both from a practical and financial sense, about my 'day one' Xbox 360. &nbsp;It has given up the ghost and, thanks to the repair being being £140, I really can't justify a repair that will only be under warranty for 90 days.</p>
<p>Now, putting this into context, I have been with Xbox since launch.....original Xbox Live beta tester (Yes, I have the Orange memory unit, controller and 'I've got great hands!'....as well as a Dead or Alive pin-up calendar that the wife banned among other
 freebies... :o) and I even bought the HD-DVD drive (and a pile of HD-DVD's) and the Kinect. &nbsp;It's has died on me twice and I've had it repaired twice, both times by Microsoft. &nbsp;It's now over 9 years old and, in the run up to Christmas it threw the 3 Red Rings
 at me. &nbsp;There was no way I could afford a repair then but I thought I'd just put it to one side and get it repaired in the new year, once the Christmas bills are cleared....which broke my 8 year old daughter's Lego Star Wars loving heart.</p>
<p>Now, given the cost, that's not a runner but I'm also flummoxed as to how I'll afford a new one (some places are quoting over £200?!?!?) and how I'll get my saved games off the old 20GB hard drive as my Xbox is dead. &nbsp;Do I have to pay another £30 for a transfer
 cable? &nbsp;I also use the component cable (I have only 2 HDMI on my Pioneer 436XDE and the Sky+ HD and BluRay player use them) so I'd be looking at more cost for some kind of HDMI splitter...but the much quieter and more efficient power use may offset some cost......this
 is getting too complicated and my head hurts...</p>
<p>I was saving for the Xbox One, which I had tacit agreement would be this year's birthday/Christmas/Father's Day/everything else rolled into one, but I really don't want to give up my Lego games, Red Dead Redemption, Halo 25th Anniversary, as dropping £350
 on the Xbox One console and Kinect (I have kids....I need it!) will mean I don't have much spare to repopulate the games library. &nbsp;But the thought of 'losing' my Xbox 360 games is a bigger wrench....I don't want to say goodbye to Noble Team or the Rookie,
 or my Mass Effect saves....I hadn't even played ME3....it's still in the cellophane....for the last 2 years! &nbsp;I also don't want to fail to renew my Xbox Live (up in May) as I'm proud of being an Original (can't be many of us left now), and I don't want to
 go from being Ziggy UK (I added UK as I thought it would be easier during beta) to being Noob198476.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry for the rambling......I know I've 'neglected' my hobby in the last 4-5 years especially, due to having 2 daughters but I had just reached the point where they were old enough to play (my eldest is nearly 9) and has gravitated past Disneyland Adventures
 and Kinectimals and into Lego Star Wars so we could play together....and I like my chrome tray fronted original 360......now it's looking bleak. &nbsp;I think I just need some level-headed advice on how I would go about getting back to gaming....I love the idea
 of the 500gb hard drive, loaded with all my games but I hate the idea of losing nearly a decade's worth of &nbsp;saved games and my component cable (I've got the VGA cable too for plugging it into an old LCD telly I got over a decade ago that had neither component
 or hdmi).</p>
<p>Should I save up and spend the money on a new 360? &nbsp;I don't want to hand my 360 over to a 'repair shop', despite it being out of warranty, as I've had one too many bad experiences with those kind of repairs, including having a 'repaired' phone short and
 nearly explode in my hand and a shoddily repaired, permanently plugged in piece of electrical equipment is not sitting in my living room, metres away from my sleeping family, thank you!</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
<p>Chris</p>

<p>You can transfer your saves and it will require the transfer cable - avoid third party ones like the plague and make sure it is compatible with the original 360 drives. If you can manage to find an S model, it will use the same video outputs as the original
 and will still have optical output for sound. If you go with the newer E model, you won't have the option to use your component cables as they use a different video port and have no component or VGA cables available that I know of (they also do not have an
 optical sound out). The cheapest option is to have your original repaired by&nbsp;Microsoft.

<p>That's said my short answer would be save and get a new 360. Then when you can, repair the day one box and put away for prosperity. Being short on cash is never easy so can understand the worry of such a purchase hope this is of help :)

</p><p>Hi Micheal,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We understand your concern and will certainly assist you to solve it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer the below questions for better diagnosis:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the build number of Windows 10 in your PC?<br />
2. Do you have the November updated installed in your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret the inconvenience caused to you. This issue may occur, if&nbsp; you have external devices connected to the PC, try starting the PC with those devices disconnected. Device connection and driver issues can contribute to hangs. If the PC starts successfully
 without external devices connected, try repeating with more devices connected to identify the specific device or combination of devices that are contributing to the hang.&nbsp;
</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to follow the below methods and check if that helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooting startup problems can be difficult because every PC is set up differently. Drivers, conflicts with other programs, malware, and memory can all cause startup problems.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>You can refer to the section "My computer hangs or freezes at the Starting Windows screen" from the following Microsoft article and check if it helps. Windows 8.1, Windows 8 or Windows 7 hangs or freezes

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Note</strong>: Chkdsk can take a very long time to run. On large hard drives, it can even take a day or more.</div>
<div>&nbsp;If Chkdsk finds and fixes a problem, this may be a sign that the drive is failing. If so, you may continue to experience problems in the future. If problems are repeatedly found or can't be fixed, consider replacing the hard drive. Contact your PC manufacturer
 for assistance, if needed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Method 2:&nbsp; </strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you to check if you are able to login to Safe Mode using the following commands.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers. Startup programs don't run in safe mode, and only the basic drivers needed to start Windows are installed.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Follow these steps to start the computer in safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>a. Boot from the Windows 10DVD.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>b. Click on Repair your computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>c. Click on Troubleshoot and then select Advanced Options.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>d. Select the option Command prompt.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>e. Once you open Command prompt, enter the following command and press enter.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Bcdedit /set {bootmgr} displaybootmenu yes</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Once completed, please restart your computer, then press F8 to enter setup screen upon startup, then press F4 or 4 to enter Safe Mode.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Check if the issue persists, in safe mode. If the issue does not persist in Safe Mode, then perform a clean boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts.

<h2>            What do you want me to do with Windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So trying to understand tile mode, I'm asking myself, what does Microsoft want me to do with this? I started when I was a child with DOS, and then got in to Windows 3.1 and have had every Windows operating system since then, and felt that each step was mostly
 an improvement over the previous with a some exceptions when features were left out. I have an iPad 3 and an iPhone 5, so I understand and appreciate the tile functions, but again I ask what does Microsoft want me to do with tiles on Windows 8?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand how things work with the iPad 3. You plug it in, and have a&nbsp;smaller&nbsp;hard drive than the PC, so you&nbsp;transfer some of your key photos or whatever from your PC in iTunes that you really want to take with you, and then now when you are out and about
 you can show some people your photos, with no file directory, or boot time, or anything complex, just here it is take a look, close it down and move on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tablets, by design are loaded and synced up with what&nbsp;the user needs on an average&nbsp;day to&nbsp;day&nbsp;basis due to file system navigation restraints, and hard drive size restraints.&nbsp;They only have the music you want to hear, the photos you want to see, etc. On a
 laptop or desktop computer however, I have a lifetime of photos taken on digital cameras that I don't want to loo at right now. I have&nbsp;a lifetime of spreadsheets from previous tax years and so on that I don't need to deal with right now. I have ten years worth
 of school essays and reports, and hundreds of PDF user manuals&nbsp;books.... All of which I don't want to&nbsp;deal with right now..... Maybe in five or ten years I will want to look&nbsp;at this stuff, but I don't want an&nbsp;thumbnail of&nbsp;all this clutter in front of&nbsp;me
<em>today</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me to program my whole digital life in to a tile architecture would be very challenging, and then being able to navigate to find what I'm looking for would be an even bigger challenge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Microsoft wants me to give up Desktop&nbsp;Mode and live in their new tile world. Understood. Okay, so the tiles are there, so I will click on one; Photos, let's say. It doesn't know what to do for me because I have to program the app. How do I program it from
 tile mode? I can't, but I thought I was supposed to live in this tile utopia? Go to Microsoft's website, and start watching tutorials on how to use each app. They all start the same, telling me to go to desktop mode. Okay, now&nbsp;take the pictures drop them in
 to the photo library, return back to tile mode, click on the tile. Okay, now I can use it. Now, when am I ever going to click on the Photo app and just use it to look at my pictures? As a desktop user, I'm not going to fire up my laptop, wait for a boot up
 and&nbsp;just for the sake of look at a few pictures in tile mode unless all I want to do is a slideshow. This Photo app is looking really cluttered now; I don't want to have thousands of pictures in my Photo app that I have taken over the last 15 years on my digital
 cameras, so I agree with myself&nbsp;that it would be much simpler to just stick with desktop mode and find the directories of what photos I want to see, when I want to see them while doing other things with the operating system.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is reminding me a lot like how it was with DOS twenty years ago, when I had a blue screen DOS GUI, and had to program each selection on my menu to launch a program. Now, just think, I only have about another twenty apps that I may have to program from
 Desktop Mode to be able to use them in Tile Mode. Guess I will have to clear my weekend plans to do this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Moving on, I'm trying to understand further about why the tiles&nbsp;don't feel like how&nbsp;they do on the iPad, and I realize&nbsp;that&nbsp;it has a lot to do with animated apps, advertising, and mixing&nbsp;native OS&nbsp;apps with traditional programs. On the iPad, the default
 apps are all the same&nbsp;size as your added on ones, they are all&nbsp;stationary and not animated. With Windows 8, I can now see that it is hard to find my Photo app, because it is animated with my personal pictures, and the word "photo" is now hard to read on the
 tile. Looking at the Tile screen is now starting to look&nbsp;like a web page that is full of pop up adds nagging me for my attention and distracting me. When disconnected from the internet the Stock Market and News app animated tiles are looking pretty silly showing
 off old stock prices and news since they have been cut off from their feed&nbsp;for a few days now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now with the advertising. Click on the Music app which launches Windows Media Player, and click on a song that I know I own, and it wants me to buy it again. What is this? Oh, it is advertising to buy a song I already own. There is so much advertising clutter
 in Windows Media Player, and the searching ability for my hard drive is so difficult, that I can't find anything that I already have, so&nbsp;I stay with Desktop Mode, yet again, thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, looking at tile mode, where are the programs that I installed that are meant for other versions of Windows? I have to try and search them out using the App search in tile mode, but the old programs are not Apps, so it becomes hard to find them. Even
 if they are there on the tile screen, they all just launch right in to Desktop Mode anyway. So, I will just use them in Desktop Mode, but they aren't there because there is no Start Menu any more, and they didn't install to the Desktop background. So now,
 being crafty I have to go to Windows Explorer, or the Tile mode search to find my programs and learn how to pin them to the Tile screen and&nbsp;the Task Bar or Desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, why is the Tile search feature so crippled? It doesn't find partial file names. Have to go to Desktop mode and launch Windows Explorer and do a file search there, okay now the files are found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Email? Internet Explorer? Why are these Tile apps not in sync with my Desktop versions of the same app with my accounts, contacts, bookmarks, home pages, etc? I am now officially done with using Tile mode. I couldn't be bothered to&nbsp;manage&nbsp;the exact same
 program in two different worlds and hope they match each others settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything I have&nbsp;written&nbsp;is nothing more than an inconvenience&nbsp;to me, since I know what I am&nbsp;doing, but if I&nbsp;were an average user, I would&nbsp;not have a clue of what to do, where to start, or how to make it work the way I need it to work. Even to me the whole
 system is quite intimidating.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How am I supposed to find control panel settings? Some basic features are hidden amongst branching trees of settings in tile mode, and more advanced are in Desktop Mode. Here we go again. Back and forth, back and forth, back and forth between Tile and Desktop
 mode. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Who is standing in the way of technological progress? I&nbsp;bought a new&nbsp;HP 64 bit&nbsp;laptop&nbsp;that came pre-installed with Windows 8 64 bit software. I turn it on, and realize that HP has&nbsp;made&nbsp;their programs all in 32 bit. &nbsp;Microsoft has&nbsp;done the same thing. Windows
 Media Player says it is 32 bit. Windows Media Player is the most resource intensive feature built in to Windows, and the one feature that I use the most and it&nbsp;should be built in 64 bit. Having it in 32 bit is outrageous.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why are we running 64 bit hardware in 2013,&nbsp;and making 64 bit operating systems in 2013, but our software tailors are stuck back in the&nbsp;1990s&nbsp;to&nbsp;give us&nbsp;32 bit only?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My recommendations for&nbsp;a future update&nbsp;are:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Build everything in 64 bit from here on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let the Desktop PC and Laptop users have an option to hide Tile Mode altogether, and use Desktop mode&nbsp;only.&nbsp;Old programs require a Program Files menu system from the old Start Button, so I guess you really need to at least make a right click menu in the
 bottom left corner to bring a Program Files Menu back,&nbsp;or&nbsp;bring back the Start Button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, bring back the Gadget Bar! They were the one feature in Windows Vista and Windows 7 that were very useful that I used all the time! Sticky notes, clocks, calculators, calendars, currency, stocks, whatever, right at the side ready to use, and not distracting.
 Please fix the security loop holes that were dangerous in the Gadget code, and bring them back as a standard feature.</p>

            You should write a novel and publish it with that wall of text . I wanted to read your comment but lost interest fast. I started in DOS too and I love the tiles. It is true, sometime you have to adapt if you want the newest thing. There are many things
 in life like this. Smartphones being one example.&nbsp;

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I keep having a problem with the party chat when speaking to a friend. At random intervals the chat will just completely cut out and neither of us can hear each other. The only way to fix it is to leave the party and start a new one.</p>
<p>We both have good connections and an open NAT so I don't know what could be causing this problem. I'm using Turtle Beach XO4's and they are using the stock headset. Any Ideas?</p>

<h2>            Windows 8&#58; Mouse deselects active window&#40;s&#41;, deselects windows itself,  wont respond until ctrl alt del is pressed.</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I'm having an annoying issue with my Windows 8 on my laptop.</p>
<p>I have been seacrhing the net over this issue, and have found it also has occured in Vista and Win7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When starting up my laptop, and logging in, it goes to the win8 appscreen, from there i click on Desktop, and then my mouse quits working.</p>
<p>I can move the mouse around, i can do rightclick and get a menu, but going over files or programs wont make it light up.</p>
<p>Going over the taskbar on bottom screen same thing, &nbsp;cant start up anything.</p>
<p>Only with ctlr alt del, taskmanager this is (temporary) solved. after this i can click and open any file game whatever on my desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also whn im busy with browsing the net, or trying to play some online poker, my mouse deselects the active window, and again nothing works.</p>
<p>For some active windows the ctrl alt del trick doesnt even work.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have already bought a brandnew logitech mouse, i have reinstalled windows 8 perfectly, all up to date.</p>
<p>I have no virus or such, and no illegal software on my laptop.</p>
<p>I tried almost anything described in all Microsoft q&amp;a section, still active windows are being deselected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This deselecting happens many times per day, all on different times, and after different actions.</p>
<p>sometimes after closing a program, or after starting up the Laptop, and strangly sometimes not at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help please.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankyou.</p>

<h2>            Cannot Log Into My Computer For First Attempt After Fall Creators Update</h2>
                    I'm having a problem where my login for my computer will fail the first time I try logging in, but it does not give me an error. When I hit enter to get through the look screensaver and enter my password for the first time, I see please wait for about
 a minute then it just takes me back to the screensaver and tells me nothing. When I try logging in again, it works fine. This happens&nbsp;every time I boot up my computer since I updated to the Fall Creators Update.&nbsp;

<br />
<br />What I would do is manually install Creator Version 1709 when it is released Oct 17 by installing Media Creation Tool to Upgrade Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that should solve any other problems you have.  If any problems persist then you'll also know these are caused by a program and setting which are retained while the operating system is new.  
<br />
<br />If problems persist go over this Checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had the exact issue after the update to the Fall Creator's edition 1709.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't gone through the steps pointed in the post above but I may have found a way to fix it. I just hope it is not temporary. It was suggested to me by someone who had other issues with the Fall creator's update (something related to our printer/scanner
 not being recognized).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The thing I did was to perform a full shutdown, followed by a reboot. In short, inputting this command in command line:</p>
<p>
</p><p>shutdown /r</p>
<p>
</p><p>When it rebooted after inputting the command, I was able to log in from my first attempt. When writing this post I will have attempted it only once.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue reappears, I will edit my post with further details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: The issue reappeared...</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
It is possible that it is some sort of temporary glitch between you (and your ISP) and Google. If it continues<br />
check with your ISP to see if there is an issue.<br />
<br />
If you need to check with Google Chrome's Support and their forums use these links :<br />
<br />
Google Chrome Support<br />

<br />
----------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Start - in search box type -&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CMD<br />
<br />
at top of list find CMD - RIGHT CLICK on it - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
Type the following commands (or copy and paste one at a time), each followed by pressing enter.
</p>
<p>ipconfig /flushdns</p>
<p>nbtstat -R</p>
<p>nbtstat -RR</p>
<p>netsh int reset all</p>
<p>netsh int ip reset</p>
<p>netsh winsock reset<br />
<br />
REBOOT<br />
<br />
That resets your TCP/IP stack<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

<strong>1.</strong> Update the Atheros driver at Dell and then check&nbsp;Atheros. You can download the driver on another computer
<br />
and transfer to that one on removable media such as CD, DVD, or USB drives. If there are no newer versions
<br />
then re-install the same one.<br />

<br />
--------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Think Video drivers mainly though it can be others. See the driver section in my generic
<br />
bluescreen troubleshooting methods below. BIOS, low level chipset drivers and <br />
antivirus/antispyway/security programs can also cause this. Check the troubleshooter and
<br />
when you get to the driver and memory testing sections refer to the generic methods in next<br />
message and then return to the troubleshooter if needed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong></p>
<p>A driver tried to access an address that is pageable (or that is completely invalid) while the IRQL was too high.</p>
<p>This bug check is usually caused by drivers that have used improper addresses.</p>
<p>If the first parameter has the same value as the fourth parameter, and the third parameter indicates an execute operation, this bug check was likely caused by a driver that was trying to execute code when the code itself was paged out. Possible causes for
 the page fault include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The function was marked as pageable and was running at an elevated IRQL (which includes obtaining a lock).
</li><li>The function call was made to a function in another driver, and that driver was unloaded.
</li><li>The function was called by using a function pointer that was an invalid pointer.</li></ul>

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />

The log might give you the answer if there was a corrupted driver. (Does not tell all the possible<br />
driver issues).<br />
<br />
Also run CheckDisk so we can rule out corruption as much as possible.<br />

Often updating drivers will help, usually Video, Sound, Network Card&nbsp; (NIC), WiFi, 3rd party<br />
keyboard and mouse, as well as other major device drivers.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<h2>            Skype group chats appearing as untitled conversation</h2>
                    I always use skype on a daily basis, but one day almost all of my group chats have turned into "untitled conversations" and i can only see what people say in those chats but i cant post anything because it says messaging is unavailable. Is there any way
 to fix this?

            I have noticed this happening in newer versions of Skype when your friends delete you from their contacts. Have you tried using the web browser version of Skype or the ios app? These work for me when I come across this error.

 process, until i get to the start screen and countinue on as normal but once i get to the desktop i realize my computer was running unbearably slow, which i believe is because my ram was running at 99% full i tried deleting stuff but it didn't work and i tried
 restarting my computer and thats where the big problem began. Ive turned my pc off and on many times at this point because each time i do it the "No bootable disk" error will come up or windows will automatically try to solve it fail and give me some proceeding
 options Windows diagnostics failed, turn off pc failed restart pc failed, advanced options has many option i tried resetting my pc to original state but it got to 53% and said there was an error and no changes were made, i am right now having my pc restore
 to when my dad installed our printer onto my computer a week ago and its been "Restoring" for way to long almost 24 hours straight.</p>

            <p>Uhg neither of these worked for me... Do you think that the cause of this is because of a virus or malware?</p>
<p>I have had this computer for a wee bit over six years not sure why or if that would have to do with these issues but whatever. Would changing the order of how my PC boots up help me maybe, like putting the Ram as top priority or something? Is their someway
 i can manually reset my PC or something???</p>

    <title>Alternate MAC address - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cherylniles  say:</h3>
<h2>            Alternate MAC address</h2>
                    <p>I have been on an infinite loop with Xbox non-support trying to figure this out.&nbsp; The online support tells me that I can connect to a live person with my question only to route me back to the beginning with the virtual agent over and over.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my question: Each time my son uses the Xbox one, it uses a new MAC address.&nbsp; This circumvents the parent control system that I use, the Disney Circle, because the Circle identifies the device by the MAC address and any new device joining my network
 is automatically assigned to the "home profile" which does not have a "bedtime".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found info on how to create an alternate MAC address on the Xbox One, and I've been to the advanced settings to check into that.&nbsp; But, the Xbox seems to be doing this automatically each time he turns it on.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm looking for information on how to make it stop creating alternate MAC addresses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>It may be the case that the IP address is changing in the background as well but when I open up the Disney Circle app multiple Xbox One's are listed as devices (we only have the one physical Xbox One console), and when I open the details page for each device,
 the Circle app shows me the name, MAC address, manufacturer, and which profile the device is assigned to.&nbsp; The MAC address is different for each of the Xbox one device entries listed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to try the static IP address and port forwarding and I'll post again if this gets the job done.</p>
<p>

<p>Hey there Cheryl thanks for keeping us updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We would also suggest perhaps looking into our <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/help/4026796/microsoft-account-change-childs-xbox-privacy-online-safety-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Change your child’s Xbox privacy and online safety settings</a> page to set up restrictions directly on the child account. This will set the same type of parental controls but on the account not through the MAC address. Give it a shot and let us know if we
 can further assist in this or any other issues or inquiries.</p>

<p>I haven't had good success with the Xbox parental controls.&nbsp; I have the screen time set up such that he should not be able to use the Xbox at all after 10 pm on weeknights.&nbsp; Sometimes that works and he gets signed out but other times it seems that he can
 log on and watch Netflix.&nbsp; Also, they take a bit of time to refresh, so if he has friends over and I want to extend his time that doesn't happen instantaneously.&nbsp; And finally, the thing I like about the Circle is that it attempts to integrate his use across
 multiple platforms so I can just have one overall time limit and I don't have to micromanage his time on several different devices.</p>

<p>I reserved the IP address on my router as suggested but new "Xbox One"s appeared on my router and Circle again over the weekend.&nbsp; I just discovered that I had neglected to log out of the Xbox, so perhaps he generated an alternate mac address using my profile.&nbsp;
 I've tried reserving the IP address again and this time logged myself out.&nbsp; So, we'll see.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I read up a bit on the Port forwarding but I don't understand whether I need to do that.&nbsp; Is that something that I need to do if I've reserved the IP address?&nbsp; Or does it fix unrelated connectivity problems?</p>

<p>Hi Cheryl,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out and responding. Regarding the reserved IP address, normally we have customers set up the static IP if they are going to port forward. That allows the router to provide the console with information much faster. It is supposed to help
 with the network connection basically. </p>

<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps.</p>

            Hi there Cheryl depending on how your router and internet access was set up on the router there will be an option to give the devices new IP addresses to ensure that IP doesn't change you will need to turn this off and ensure its fixed to one IP address
 via your router settings.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The MAC address can never change due to it being fixed to the wireless card inside the system its a physical address that is not available to be changed at user level, this is set by the manufacture.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I hope this helps&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Kind Regards<br />
Alec<br />

<p>I'm sorry to hear that you have trouble with your sneaky kid getting around the Circle parental controls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know about your network setup, but you could try a combination of using MAC black-/whitelisting, which will take a bit of work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What you need to do is: Create a list of MAC addresses used in your home (e.g. the Xbox One, the PC, the smartphones etc). You can find the MAC of the Xbox in the network settings, and the PC should show it's "physical" address (i.e. the MAC address) when
 running the "ipconfig /all" command on a Windows command prompt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for your smartphones and tablets, you need to check the network settings of those devices for the MAC address.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some routers allow you to only allow devices to connect to the internet, if they are on a known whitelist, all other devices are blocked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So if you add the MAC address from the Xbox to the whitelist, it will work with the Circle service, and as soon as your son changes the MAC address to bypass Circle, the router blocks the device completely.</p>
<p>But not all routers have that MAC blocking function. So please check your router's manual, if your router has such a blocking setting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>That way you can force your kid to leave the MAC addresses as they are, otherwise they wouldn't be able to connect at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, your kids MUST NOT have access to the router settings as well.</p>
