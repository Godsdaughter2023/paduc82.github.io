<h2>            Windows randomly muting audio and changing volume</h2>
                    <p>Sometimes while using my laptop, the audio on my headphones will randomly mute and change volume to 63, meaning when I'm listening to music at 16, and it mutes, I unmute it and hurt my ears with blaring music at volume 63.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also had problems where the speakers are muted and the headphones aren't (intentionally), I plug in my headphones, and they mute themselves and change whatever volume was set to 63, then when I unplug the headphones the speakers unmute themselves,
 and change volume to 63. I don't know why it likes 63 so much, I had a similar problem before with it changing to 31.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is a Gateway NV44, Pentium T4500, 4GB DDR2. Shipped with Vista Home Premium, then a free upgrade to Windows 7 HP, now running 8.1 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My audio is Conexant HD Audio, but I'm using the generic High Definition Audio Device driver from Windows because the manufacturer driver lacks important features like differentiating between the internal speakers and headphones, and having separate volume
 settings for them; as well as outputting to both at the same time.</p>

<p>
</p><p>It seems the NetSupport background processes like to screw with my audio settings, removed NetSupport because the trial was almost over anyway.</p>

<h2>            Virus protection in virtual XP</h2>
                    When you install virtual windows to run XP on a Windows 7 machine, do you need to install a seperate version of virus protection? The machine is protected with Norton Internet Security, but the XP window has the red shield indicating no virus protection.

<p>Yes, you need to install a Antivirus utility, its just like running another PC, but its virtual, so you need to protect it. I use Microsoft Security Essentials in my Windows XP Mode VM http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials</p>
<p>Works great and its free.</p>

            Yes.&nbsp; Treat a virtual computer exactly as you would a physical one.&nbsp; Nothing in the Host scans a running virtual machine.&nbsp; Norton scans the .vhd file on your host file system but it only sees a data file.&nbsp; You need an AV program that runs in the virtual
 machine when XP is running.&nbsp; A virtual machine is like Las Vegas; what happens there stays there.

<br />The "unknown accounts" that you mention is called a "SID" (Security Identifier). Each account has a SID. In the access permission list it becomes visible after you delete the account it is tied to.
<br />
<br />You need to seize ownership of your folders then give yourself full access rights - see here:

<br />
<br />Also run the Microsoft Safety Scanner.
<br />The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.
<br />
<br />Please refer the below link to download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner.

<h2>            Keyboard not responding after sleep or hibernate</h2>
                    <p>
Hi,</p>
<p>
This is with respect to an issue that occurred after recent windows update. The keyboard becomes unresponsive after waking from sleep or hibernate. Fn+Ins (Sleep button) works fine for going to sleep and USB external keyboard also works fine. Sometimes the
 computer shuts down during sleep and boots freshly after waking up. &nbsp;This happened to me after updating windows to April update. I have tried almost every fix in vain.</p>
<ol>
<li>Deleted keyboard driver in device manager and restarted</li><li>Rolled back to previous BIOS</li><li>Reset the OS</li><li>Factory recovery</li><li>Clean install OS</li></ol>
<p>Please clarify me on how to tackle this issue. My system is DELL XPS 9550a</p>
<p>
Thanks for your time and patience</p>

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Yes, not the best news you want to hear. These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Now, get ready to go back to your previous version. I recommend Windows 10 1703 because its the most stable and efficient release to date. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 4: how to recover your files from Windows.old:

Yes, not the best news you want to hear. These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version
 of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, get ready to go back to your previous version. I recommend Windows 10 1703 because its the most stable and efficient release to date.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br />
<a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />
Choose the following: <br />
<br />
- Windows Final <br />
- Windows 10, version 1703 <br />
- Windows 10 Pro + Home <br />
- English <br />
- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit) <br />
<br />
Step 2: create a bootable copy <br />
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />
Step 3: perform a custom install <br />

    <title>Enable Protected Mode turns off, svchost.exe &#42;32 &#47; winrscmde - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> funkster64  say:</h3>
<h2>            Enable Protected Mode turns off, svchost.exe &#42;32 &#47; winrscmde grows</h2>
                    <p>I seem to have a virus, but it is not being found by MS Security Essentials.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It manifests in multiple ways:<br />
</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; svchost.exe *32 (under processes in Windows Task Manager) starts to grow (using more and more memory) - until there are 'out of memory' errors that pop up in the system.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even though IE is not running, files in Temporary Ineternet Files keep getting added</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; When I start IE 8, there's a bar along the top that says - Your current security settings are at risk ... Enable Protected Mode is turned off.&nbsp; I can go in and re-enable that, then close then re-open IE 8 and all is well - for a bit.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically it all seems to start when a&nbsp;small CMD-type window will pop up, very briefly - too short to see what's being run - then svchost.exe *32 will start to grow, as well as the other symptoms.&nbsp; I can go into processes and End Process (or Tree), restart
 IE and everything seems fine - but again after a few minutes it starts over.&nbsp;&nbsp; And when that does happen - Protected Mode is turned off.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have deleted all Temporary Internet files, multiple times - both through the browser and manually.&nbsp; I've run complete virus scans.&nbsp; It just keeps persisting!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any thoughts??</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Svchost.exe is a process on your computer that hosts, or contains, other individual services that Windows
 uses to perform various functions. For example, Windows Defender uses a service that is hosted by a svchost.exe process. Refer the link below:</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-is-svchost-exe" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-is-svchost-exe</a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may try the following methods and check the status of the issue.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Set the computer to clean boot state to check for software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> When the troubleshooting is over do not forget to reset the computer to normal startup. Follow step
 7 in the above article.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>R</span><span>un a System File Checker scan.</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As per Internet Explorer you may try the following methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>

</span>Click on Accessories.</span></p>
<p><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click on System Tools.</span></p>
<p><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click on Internet Explorer (No Add-ons).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If this resolves the issue, follow these steps to isolate the browser add-on that is causing the issue:</span></p>
<p><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click Tools, and then click Internet Options. </span></p>
<p><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click the Programs tab, and then click Manage add-ons.</span></p>
<p><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Click an add-on in the Name list, and then click Disable.</span></p>
<p><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Repeat step c until you identify the add-on that is causing the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>If this resolves the issue, this could be caused by an adware installed as Add-on, refer:

    <title>Blue screen of death - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevemcclean  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue screen of death</h2>
                    <p>Ok, I have three problems. My blue screen was caused by a driver verifier query from my cammand prompt. (I'm sorry, I'm running Windows 10 on a Toshiba satellite l775d. I can be forgetful)</p>
<p>Anyway...</p>
<p>My blue screen tells me to contact MS SUPPORT for the "Driver Verifier Violation Stop Code with a great big :( on the screen. The tech at MS said she didn't know anything about it and that I need a new install.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to YouTube I now understand it's just a simple driver fix n done...that's issue #1.</p>
<p>#2: To fix issue 1 I need to use my &nbsp;w10 installation media to boot from. Well I don't have it. After "Cortania's" persistent badgering that I erase the creation tool for disk space I caved in.</p>
<p>#3: Even if 1 and 2 are fixed, the crash destroyed &nbsp;my bootmngr and made my hard drive invisible. And now I get a start-up error code 0x0000089.</p>
<p>I understand that's an easy fix also.</p>
<p>Here is my question: where can I get the creation tool for free and how do I apply it once I've got it?</p>

<p>Hey listen, i dont want to waste your time and its probably my fault for being unclear but your way off. The pc does not boot. There isn't an OS installed or even a HDD. MY BIOS ARE FROZEN, i can open bios i can look at the settings on each screen but can
 not select or change any of them exept the time and user password so forget Norton, he's long gone. Two hard drives and one OS ago. I need to change the boot order so that I can insert a new HDD and reinstall my windows 10 from THE CREATION TOOL, ONLINE. No,
 its real, really.</p>

    <title>Fujitsu notebook user problem. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yixuanbai  say:</h3>
<h2>            Fujitsu notebook user problem.</h2>
                    <p>Here is a problem with many Fujitsu laptop users:<strong> NVIDIA has stopped updating graphic drivers for all Fujitsu laptops</strong>. This means all GeForce Drivers after a certain version will cause system malfunction. For me (GeForce 640M LE), driver
 version after 347.88 will cause black screen during booting or updating to a newer version.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4eeeff22-e63b-4d59-8683-43611db0559b" /></p>
<p>This problem will occur <strong>no matter which version of Windows you are running</strong>. This may also mean that CUDA Toolkit after 6.5 will not be supported on Fujitsu laptops any more (not sure).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason why this was seldom reported before is because if you are not a CUDA programmer, you would not bother to upgrade you graphic drivers. However,
<strong>the auto-update mechanism of Windows 10 will force unmatched (namely the newest) driver to be installed.</strong>, which will cause disastrous problem during upgrading from older versions of Windows to Windows 10 because you can not enter safe mode
 to disable or uninstall the graphic driver since the operating system installation fails.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For fellows run into this problem after installation (when Windows 10 install the newest NVIDIA driver during system updating), you can enter the safe mode (by repeatedly hot-rebooting your machine to force a booting manual to show up ) and disable GPU using
 the device manager. After that, you can use an older version of GPU driver to override the newer driver. This will solve the problem temporarily, but due to the auto-update, long-term solution is not guaranteed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, this question may come to help: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/fujitsu-lifebook-freezes-on-initial-setup/50477bc3-c46a-4172-bff1-ef9763ed4840">

<p>
</p><p>For Microsoft guys, <strong>stop asking Fujitsu laptop users to solve this problem by upgrading the newest driver</strong>. Instead, you should provide alternative options so that people can choose whatever upgrade they need,
<strong>especially </strong>when it comes to hardware drivers which Microsoft can't not guarantee a thing.</p>

            Are you redownloading from your account or going directly to the games’ pages on the store?
<br />Have you tried signing out of the store then signing in again?
<br />If signing out then in again doesn’t work then I recommend an in-place upgrade repair.
<br />To repair Windows without losing any data then follow the instruction here:
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repair-install-windows-10-place-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repai...</a>
<br />This will also upgrade you to the latest version of Windows - currently 1903.
<br />In a nutshell you just download the media creation tool &amp; choose to upgrade now.

<p>Hi DF&gt; I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.
<br />
<br />
What was the tool you ran? DId it properly uninstall the apps? Check in Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; Features.
<br />
<br />
See if you can System Restore to a point before you ran the tool and properly uninstall them in Settings. System Restore:
<a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If that's not successful then go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:
<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">
http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> <br />
<br />
Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account. Then continue
 with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. <br />
<br />
If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now. This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing
 it up to the latest version 1903 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.

I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hello Wektur, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, there is currently no way for you to pay for Game Pass using Microsoft Wallet funds.
</p>
<p>You can only purchase it with either Paypal or with an added credit/debit payment instrument. So, basically, &nbsp;the Microsoft points would not work. It's kind of a read, but it is outlined in our
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/servicesagreement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Microsoft Services Agreement</a>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I would say it's best in this situation to <a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
contact</a>&nbsp;Xbox Support (as previously posted)&nbsp;so that we can help you set up the subscription the way however is possible and satisfactory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information was helpful.</p>

 If the GPU is unable to recover and reset the graphics hardware in the time permitted (2 seconds), your system may become unresponsive, and display the error “Display driver stopped responding and has recovered.”

The Xbox cannot, however, connect to Xbox LIVE.</p><p>Some time after 12:00 GMT today, my Xbox 360 was kicked from Xbox LIVE and has since been completely unable to reconnect to the service, despite having a stable and (usually) good connection.</p><p>I usually play using an ethernet Powerline connection. I have used this system for two years in different houses with no issues before.

</blockquote>
<p>I have power cycled nearly everything in the house. I've exhausted the entire troubleshooting suggestion list for this issue.<br />
</p>
<p>I cannot connect the console directly into the modem, as the two inhabit different rooms.</p>
<p>My old laptop had previously worked without issue on the powerline; I suspect the ethernet driver on this laptop has somehow failed (before I acquired it). The Xbox has functioned with the powerline on this network at different times over the past two years; and also the network at a different house for one year.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I'm not 100% on "make and model", but it is a Virgin Media SuperHub 2 (combined modem/router). The powerline adapters are Netgear Powerline AV500s.</p>
<p>I attempted using my smartphone as a hotspot, but the connection was very poor and failed to connect at all&nbsp;in Test Network.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Two things I have not attempted:&nbsp;I have an external wireless adapter from an older model of Xbox 360 (this device is a Slim with an internal system). There is also a Netgear router, which I could attempt connecting through by setting the modem to modem-only mode. This router is not used since the modem is its own router, and has a much higher speed than the Netgear. Previously, both were operating in conjunction and causing significant interference before I disconnected it (~2 weeks ago).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I contacted Xbox Support via live chat this afternoon, and they were unable to identify the problem. They suggested turning the machine in for repair. For only a little more than the cost of that, I could buy a whole new X360 slim second-hand, so frankly no.</p>
<p>I'm led to believe the problem must lie in the wireless adapter, but can't think why that would be affected the wired powerline connection as well; or why the Xbox is still able to connect to the internet, but not Xbox LIVE.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I have a partial traceroute that I took on the Xbox last night. Xbox Support wasn't interested, would it be of use to you?</p>

    <title>USB midi instruments not working on win7 64 anymore - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            USB midi instruments not working on win7 64 anymore</h2>
                    Hi !<br />
<br />
I have a new laptop (Asus) since 3 months, and since 3 or 4 weeks, my usb instruments (akai mpk mini keyboard &amp; hercules dj 4 set) don't work anymore (they worked perfectly well before)... The drivers are correctly installed, and I can use the keyboard on linux
 on the same computer. The problem only comes with win7. When I try to use it on fl studio 10, it recognize both of the instruments (as "MPKmini" and "4-Hercules DJ4Set MIDI"), but when I try to enable one of them, it says "Undefined external error", and it
 doesn't detect midi signal (tried also with miditest, doesn't work either, expect with linux, so again, the problem must be in win7)
<br />
<br />
There, I hope I clearly explained my problem (English isn't my native language so forgive me for my not-that-good English)
<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help !<br />

            The SAME problem happen with my computer.. It seems like a windows update caused this problem.. and my usb-midi keyboard is not recognized by my usual midi programs.<br />
<br />
It's recognized by windows, but If I try to use it with any midi software I got the same unknown error.<br />
<br />
And of course I will not reinstall windows in my computer and lost all the programs I have =S<br />
<br />
I tried to restore windows to&nbsp; previous date but still doesn't work.<br />
<br />
I'm going crazy!! I can't play my midi-keyboard anymore! =(<br />

    <title>Frozen keyboard after installing Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mandy0944  say:</h3>
<h2>            Frozen keyboard after installing Windows 10</h2>
                    After installing Windows 10, it allowed me to enter my password, but after that the keyboard froze.&nbsp; Also I noticed during installation that the Numbers Locks kept flashing off and on and my laptop was running hot, generating a lot of heat.&nbsp; I ended up
 uninstalling Windows 10 and reverting to Windows 8.1.&nbsp; Until these problems are fixed, I'm not about to install Windows 10 again.&nbsp; I don't feel that I should spend precious time fixing the problems.

    <title>Windows 10 not activated after reinstalling. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 not activated after reinstalling.</h2>
                    I have a HP-Envy K-112TX laptop which came with windows 8.1 as default operating systems.I upgraded to windows 10 when the free upgrade was announced.I had no problems then.My pc showed that it has been activated after upgrading to windows 10.I needed
 linux for academic purposes.After doing some research on how windows 10 activates I found that it should activate in a PC even if we clean install another OS and then revert back to windows.But now when i reinstalled windows 10,it doesn't activate.In activation
 settings all i see is windows 10 is not able to find a valid product key or digital entailment on this PC.As windows came with my laptop pre-installed i don't even have a windows 8.1 in my pc so can't even install windows 8.1.How do i activate windows,and
 why doesn't it activate?

            <p>I am so sorry to hear that one. Try to disconnect your Microsoft account from your Surface account and switch it to just a local account. Once it is switch to a local account, open your Mail app. This should ask you to&nbsp;log-in with your Microsoft account
 (your main account) and in the process it will&nbsp;be automatically switching your local account back to a connected Microsoft account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can disconnect from your Microsoft account by going to PC settings and under Accounts, you should see there "Disconnect" below your e-mail address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope it works.</p>

                    <p>original title: upset.exe and ang40.lan</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm installing a third-party application on a brand-new Windows 7 64-bit system, and get "misisng ang40.lan" and "??? upset.exe?" errors. When I checked the Windows/System32 directory, I discovered that neither file was present, even with "show hidden and
 system files" selected.</p>
<p>Is this something normal for Windows 7? If so, is there a (relatively) easy solution?</p>

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Which program are you trying to install?</div>
<div>2. Which anti-virus software is installed on the computer?</div>
<div>3. Were there any changes made to the computer prior the issue?</div>
<div>4. What is the exact error that you get?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Refer the following steps and check:</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div>Virus are known to cause these issues. Scan your computer from Microsoft Safety Scanner, which helps to get rid of virus, spyware, and malicious software.</div>
<div><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a><br />
<strong>Note: </strong>The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires after 10 days from the date of installation.
<div><br />
<strong>Note:</strong> Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.<br />
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>I would recommend you to place the computer in clean boot and try to install the software.</div>
<div><br />
<strong>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
<strong>Note: </strong>Put the computer to normal as mentioned in Step 7 from the KB article.</div>
<div><br />
If the issue doesn’t occur when the Computer is in clean boot, then the issue is confirmed to be caused by a non-Microsoft application.<br />
<div>Hope this information helps.</div>

            <p>1. Instant Immersion Spanish Pro (I tried using compatibility mode for Win98/ME, but got the same error)</p>
<p>2. None - clean install of Windows 7 64-bit.</p>
<p>3. None - see answer to #2</p>
<p>4. "Cannot find C:\Windows\System32\ENG40.LAN"</p>
<p>From what my research could find (I'm a former IT pro of 20+ years) the files are *supposed* to be components of Windows, but Upset.exe is also apparently a frequent target for malware.</p>
<p>If they're components of Windows, why weren't they installed?</p>
<p>And how would a clean boot make a difference if it's a clean install with no anti-virus installed?</p>

            <p>Hi J. Spyder Isaacson,</p>
<p>The first thing I would suggest is running the Microsoft Safety Scanner as Ravinath gave you earlier:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>Also, if you don't have any anti-virus software installed I would highly recommend installing it, you can also use Microsoft Security Essentials, it's free:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/security-essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/security-essentials</a></p>
<p>Please let us know how it goes.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

I am a former IT professional (20+ years), and I find your canned answers to be anything EXCEPT helpful. In fact, I find them quite insulting. 


THIS IS A CLEAN INSTALL!!!!! THE HARD DRIVE WAS FORMATTED AND PARTITIONED, THE OPERATING SYSTEM INSTALLED, AND THE SOFTWARE WAS BEING INSTALLED WITHOUT ANY NETWORK CONNECTIONS WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING NO CONNECTION TO THE INTERNET!!! 


HOW IN **** COULD A VIRUS OR OTHER SECURITY BREACH HAVE OCCURRED UNDER THESE CONDITIONS???? 


I have now installed everything else on the system, INCLUDING an anti-virus, and this was done PRIOR to any network connections.

<p>Unfortunately I have the same problem as you have. I am trying to install Instant Immersion German Pro, and I get the error messag about ANG40.LAN and then the ??? upset.exe??</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is interesting that both of us are having a problem with the same kind of procuct trying to install it in Windows 7 64 bits. I tried different compatibility versions without good results. Were you able to finally have this fixed?</p>

            <p>No, and apparently no one on this site is able to help as well (see my previous posts).</p>
<p>Maybe we can help each other instead.</p>
<p>Were you trying to install Instant Immersion on a clean install (no antivirus or other utility programs in the background) of Windows 7?</p>
<p>One option I am considering is using the Virtual PC option for Windows 7 and trying to install it in a virtual PC. No guarantees, though ... it's not quite exactly like installing on a true install of XP or Vista or 98, but it might be a viable workaround
 ... </p>

<p>No, I have only tried in a Windows 7 64 bit computer that has antivirus and other utility programs installed. I an not so keen into uninstalling all of that though. I don't know yet how to use the virtual PC option. Were you successful with that? If so,
 then I would investigate how to have use it in mine.</p>

            <p>Virtual PC is a free download from the Microsoft site. Depending on your version of Windows 7 (Home, Professional, Ultimate), Microsoft also offers the option of XP Mode (for Professional and Ultimate, but not Home). I found it really simple to download,
 install and use.</p>
<p>This is how I managed to get the Instant Immersion software to load and run properly - I installed it on the Virtual PC with Windows XP. Since the computer in question only had Windows 7 Home, I had to actually use a Windows XP installation CD after installing
 Virtual PC, but it works fine and there seem to be no problems at all.</p>
<p>(As a side note entirely, I'd still like to find out what caused the errors to begin with, but that's something that can wait until later.)</p>

            <p>Hello J. Spyder Isaacson, <br />
<br />
I was looking over this thread and looked up information about the Instant Immersion language products.
<br />
The issues you are experiencing are because the Instant Immersion products were not created for Windows 7. It was created for:
Windows 98,XP,Vista. You can try to install in Compatibility mode for Windows XP or Windows Vista to see if you can get it installed successfully.<br />
</p>
<p><span>If the program is not compatible, then you may try to install and run the program in compatibility mode.
</span></p>
<p><span>Use the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right click on the Program</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on Properties</span></p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on Compatibility tab
</span></p>
<p><span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Select Run this program in compatibility mode and select Windows Vista or whatever operating system the program was running successfully.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the link here: Make older programs run in this version of Windows</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</a></span></p>
<p><br />
<span>If the compatibility is not successful, then try and run
</span><span>the</span><span> Program Compatibility troubleshooter:<br />
</span><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open the Program Compatibility troubleshooter by clicking the
<span>Start</span> button.</span></p>
<p><span>Then click
<span>Control Panel</span>. In the search box, type <span>troubleshooter</span>, and then click
<span>Troubleshooting</span>. Under <span>Programs</span>, click
<span>Run programs made for previous versions of Windows</span>.
</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the instructions in the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><span>If you cannot install a program, insert the installation disc for the program and, using the troubleshooter, browse to the
 program's setup file, usually called Setup.exe, Install.exe, or something similar. The troubleshooter is not designed to work on programs that have an .msi file name extension.</span></p>
<p><br />
Look at the link below from the manufacturer of Instant Immersion for common errors..

<h2>            Microsoft Account Set to Expire</h2>
                    <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">So here's the deal - I purchased this computer with Windows 8 and used my school email as the primary account to sign in, for OneDrive, etc. However, since this is a student account, it is set to be
 deleted in about a month when I graduate college. I'm not sure how this will affect everything. Will I still be able to sign in and access my files? Is there a way I can change the sign-in information but keep everything the same?</span>

<h2>            Help with Action Center</h2>
                    <p>I've been searching for several days and haven't found a fix yet. I get a notification and usually it goes away and I can open center to clear my notification. I can't. &nbsp;This started a week or so ago. &nbsp;I end up clicking on the icon to get the notices to
 go away and it pops back out. I've noticed a few problems with other programs and haven't found a fix for them either. I'm guessing it all has to do with Windows 10 and whatever happened with it. Other programs problems are Google Chrome profile doesn't load
 half of the time anymore and Lightroom slideshow will not load either (everything else works in Lightroom). &nbsp;My biggest issue is Action Center right now.</p>

<p><span><span>We recommend that you run<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><strong><span><span>System File Checker</span></span></strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>and</strong><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><strong><span><span>Deployment Image &amp; Servicing Management</span></span></strong><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>tool
 to check the system for any corruptions.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><span><span>Here's how:</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

</p><ol>
<li>
<p><span><span>Press<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><strong>Windows + X</strong></span></span><span><span>, and then select<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><strong>Command Prompt (Admin)</strong></span></span><span><span>.</span></span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
</li><li>
<p><span><span>Type<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><strong>SFC /Scannow</strong></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>on the prompt, and then press<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><strong><span><span>Enter</span></span></strong><span><span>. This scan

            No I just happened to get that one and used that screen shot. All of my notifications come through. I just can't clear them. Action Center will not open, so they keep popping out until I restart my computer.

            <p>I've read through the thread you referred me to from above. </p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span><em>Step 1:</em></span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Open the Start menu, type Turn system icons on or off in the search bar and click on Turn system icons on or off from the search bar results.</span></em></p>

</p>
</li></ol>
<p>I ended up having to go in through settings to look at the above suggestion.&nbsp; When I typed it in the Start menu it took me to the internet. After that this popped up on me with notification. BUT, Action Center is on.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a57c0336-4c1f-4471-9be5-c75258c3f683" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a57c0336-4c1f-4471-9be5-c75258c3f683" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>No clue on that at all. I think that's something else from me being sent to the internet while checking to see if Action Center is On or not.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I looked at the second suggestion and I've already ran two of these scans. Or I'm I reading the suggestion wrong.&nbsp; Do I type all of that in at once and not hit enter? Or are all of these separate scans?</p>

            <p>Ok it might be working again. The above notification about my Microsoft account was because I had changed my password to join the forum. I couldn't remember the old one. LOL &nbsp;I went into the settings and I had to verify my account on my laptop. After doing
 that I had 3 different notifications pop out and pop back in like they it should. I clicked on the action center icon in the right bottom corner and it opened every time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to be clear I was having problems with action center for weeks before changing my password and joining the forum. Fingers are crossed that it continues to work. I'll give it a few days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

            <p>That was truly wishful thinking on my part. Tonight I went to eject my SDHC card and the notification popped out to tell me it's safe to remove the device. It stayed out and I had to click on the icon in the bottom right corner to get it to close. It's popped
 back out again, so I'll end up rebooting to clear the notice. &nbsp;And no Action Center won't open.

</p><p>UPDATE: I'm going to give it a few days. It's working, but it must have been slow because I was working in Lightroom tonight. &nbsp;That's the only thing I can think of.</p>
