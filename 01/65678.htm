<h2>            Green light on the front of the power button keeps blinking rapidly</h2>
                    
<p>I was just wondering if anyone else has had this problem with their 360?</p>
<p>After I turn on my console the center light of the power button will start flashing rapidly.<br />
I am not inserting a disk or even have one in the tray. If I am in the middle of playing a downloaded game<br />
or in the middle of netflix it will just stop everything it is doing and just take me back to the home screen of
<br />
xbox 360.</p>
<p>I can temporarily resolve the light blinking by opening and closing the tray and it will stop blinking and stay steady until i restart the system again.</p>
<p>If anyone else has run into this problem it would be great to know I am not alone in this, and also what you have<br />
possibly done to resolve this seems to be software glitch.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
EthanMatrix</p>

<p>Your button is broken, you need to make sure that it isn't jammed--if it's a phat console, then remove the faceplate. If it's a slim or super slim, you're out of luck as the sensor is broken and your console will need to be serviced.</p>

<h2>            Pyramid solitaire - unwinnable game</h2>
                    <p>I have played two straight games where the game is unwinnable below is a screen shot . In the game you must get a combination of cards adding to 13. Queens are 12 points and aces are worth 1 point. Notice all the queens&nbsp;4)&nbsp;are behind the aces and not available
 to clear the aces from the board. The game is lost for the beginning. See second screen shot below.&nbsp; The first screen has the same problem this time all the aces are in lower rows than the queen at the top of the pyramid.&nbsp; This is another unwinnable game from
 the outset.&nbsp; I have uninstalled the app and reinstalled prior&nbsp; to these games.</p>

            <p>Hello kp7779,</p>
<p>Here's a trick that might work for you, first, open the registry editor by writing regedit in the search box down to the left and pressing Enter, click on Yes, the registry editor appears, on the left side of the window&nbsp;collapse the&nbsp;directories in the following
 order : <span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows Media Foundation\Platform,</span> right-click on Platform and choose New &gt; DWORD (32-bit) Value, on the right side of the window&nbsp;right-click on&nbsp;that new value and rename it&nbsp;EnableFrameServerMode,
 if you had any issue to apply this procedure let me know, I hope it helps.</p>
<p>Best regards.</p>
        </p>

            Yes, since your problem is caused by the antivirus blocking the webcam, you may want to delete that registry entry, follow the same instructions above until you find that value EnableFrameServerMode, right-click on it and choose delete, after that try
 rebooting your PC and check if the camera works again

            Yes you may delete it without any problem, you get these warning messages because unappropriate change to the registry can harm your system, but since the value "EnableFrameServerMode" is created by you, and it is not a necessary entry for the system to
 operate correctly, you can delete it without harm, when you get that warning message, simply click yes to delete the entry

    <title>The Cortana app wizard on Windows 10 will not log me into my windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jack lamb  say:</h3>
<h2>            The Cortana app wizard on Windows 10 will not log me into my windows account</h2>
                    <p>Trying to start Cortana on my 3 hour old installation of Windows 10 Pro, I am asked to login to my Microsoft account.&nbsp; But when I type in my account name and password (the same one that allowed me successfully to get into Microsoft.com to post this message).&nbsp;
 I am told my password does not match.&nbsp; Now it accepts the password the first time I time it in, but then asks me to type it in a second time, which is where it fails.&nbsp; Cutting and pasting into the first screen works but also fails on the second.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that this Cortana wizard has taken over my search box so that the wizard pops up every time I try to type in a question. And if I stop the wizard to type in another question the Cortana wizard auto starts and takes me back to the last place
 I stopped the login to my Microsoft account screen which rejected my valid password.&nbsp; I might also add that once while doing this, the screen locked up and went black requiring a crtl/alt/del trick to free the system.&nbsp;&nbsp; The login wizard mentions changing my
 Microsoft account password to a pin number, but without context sensitive or an actual help system, I cannot discover what this PIN system is, or how I get a PIN from Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should add that the point of all this was to discover where to get context sensitive help for the new windows 10 apps. For truth be told, going to Bing for an answer is worthless because the responses have nothing to do with my questions.&nbsp; Search on any
 Windows 10 related query responds with a result set on Bing mostly about Windows 8 links.&nbsp; And while I have always used Bing instead of Google in Windows 7, the poor research sets I receive regarding my Windows 10 queries about how to do anything make we want
 to select google as my search engine -- but wait, I cannot access help to tell me how I can do this!&nbsp; I finally discovered how to turn off Internet access on the search window; but amazingly not one search I have performed on the Windows 10 files installed
 on my computer (even searching on "Windows 10 help") returns a query result set.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A simple question like "How do I&nbsp;set the favorites bar icons under the URL box on Microsoft Edge to display horizontally as they do on IE 11" or "Why does Microsoft Edge always default to MSN.com even though I set the browser options in the control panel
 to a different URL?"&nbsp; cannot be answered without a help system.&nbsp; And I cannot search a help system to discover&nbsp;how to re-sort the hundreds of files and directories in my Favorites, which imported in a jumbled order making them unusable.&nbsp; Also,&nbsp;on an internet
 where every web page can have fonts of any size,&nbsp;hiding the browser magnification&nbsp;&nbsp;in a side panel requires too many actions to make it usable.&nbsp; But how do I move the magnification icons to the main window where it is usable?</p>
<p>
</p><p>And while I have already decided that Microsoft Edge is an unusable browser, I cannot access a help system to learn how to make IE 11 my default browser.&nbsp; So far, the only way that I have found to launch IE 11 is from a side panel menu selection to open
 an existing URL already displayed in Microsoft Edge.&nbsp; I would put it on my start bar if I knew how to perform this action, but without a help system even this process is beyond me.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how I can access a Windows 10 help system, context sensitive or otherwise? Then I will not have to post frustrated questions like this because I will be able to learn on my own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h2>            BSOD PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA HP Envy 17</h2>
                    <p>I have been getting "PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA" BSODs lately (it's been a couple of months now). I don't know what causes it. I do, however, tend to be watching YouTube videos when it happens, but it seems random.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've used BlueScreenView to analyse the dumps, and it says that it's caused by ntoskrnl.sys, which seems surprising - I have seen elsewhere that BSV is not to be trusted, so I'll still upload the dumps to OneDrive:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=245843B2122C0CFE!6594&amp;authkey=!ACfwshNPd7qJPWo&amp;ithint=folder%2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=245843B2122C0CFE!6594&amp;authkey=!ACfwshNPd7qJPWo&amp;ithint=folder%2c</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried searching (*cough* Googling *cough*) and the tips on other threads haven't helped me much, so I'm making my own thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After my PC was not wanting to upgrade to the November update, (it also didn't seem to be deleting my Win8.1 install either) I managed to do so with the same tool that you'd use to upgrade from 7/8.1 to 10, and it worked. the blue screens came back after
 a few weeks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes, I'll also get a "DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION" bluescreen, usually during rebooting from a "PAGE_FAULT...." one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I've attempted:</p>
<ul>
<li>Holding down power button with no AC cable &amp; no battery for 30 seconds (advice from HP's website)</li><li>CHKDSK on C:\</li><li>SFC /scannow</li><li>(Re)installing drivers from HP Website</li><li>Running system test (built-in to BIOS)</li><li>Getting the November Update</li><li>Not getting updates for my NVidia GPU via GeForce Experience</li></ul>
<p>Computer Specs:</p>
<ul>
<li>HP Envy 17</li><li>Originally Windows 8.1, now Windows 10 Home (November Update)</li><li>CPU/Integrated Graphics: Intel Core i7-4710MQ @ 2.50GHz (4 Core+Hyper Threading)</li><li>12GB RAM (8GB + 4GB)</li><li>64-bit OS, x64 Processor</li><li>Graphics: Integrated Graphics (normally used) / NVidia GeForce 840M (used only for graphics-intensive apps e.g. Blender &amp; my video editing software)</li></ul>
<p>Full MSINFO32 details in the dump folder linked above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only BIOS setting changes from defaults is enabling Intel Virtualization (I can't run 64-bit VMs in VirtualBox without it)</p>

    <title>Failure to install Windows 10 version 1709 &#40;every day for almost 2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frank etzler  say:</h3>
<h2>            Failure to install Windows 10 version 1709 &#40;every day for almost 2 months&#41; error code 0x80070032</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 10 Home version 1607 OS build 14393.2155.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have over 400GB of free space on my computer (this is important for an "interesting" error message that pops up here and there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As subject header states, my computer will not update to version&nbsp;1709. This seems like it will be an issue come April, as I get a lovely message that my version won't be supported soon. I have been keeping my computer up to date, and other updates for 1607
 install without issue (as recently as last night).</p>
<p>
</p><p>To address this, I have contacted Microsoft support to discuss a common error code I get every time, 0x80070032. While the worker was nice, they were not helpful, as they never even discussed the error code with me. I have tried a manual install, too (what
 Microsoft support suggested). I think the three times I have done this&nbsp;the update assistant checks my computer, states it has plenty of&nbsp;free space,&nbsp;but when&nbsp;it is installing, it stops&nbsp;with an error message that&nbsp;it can't tell if there is enough free space on
 the computer to install, which is clearly false. This is displayed in the media assistant that I have downloaded twice. With Microsoft update assistant, or with the updater in the settings tab, it downloads the update, but stops during install at 32% (similar
 to the 33% I have read in other forums).</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled 3rd party antivirus software. I have run the trouble shooter multiple times. I have deleted my update folder to remove any potential corrupted files. I really don't want to do a clean install, as I think it won't solve my issues based
 on the other threads I have read, and I don't want to repay for my Office software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here are my questions: </p>
<p>What is error code 0x80070032 in this context? </p>
<p>Why isn't the free space on my laptop recognized as being available?</p>
<p>Do I need to update to another version of Windows 10 (i.e. 1703) before moving to 1709?</p>
<p>Why is Microsoft's FAQ section useless?</p>
<p>Why have an AI assistant when it can't answer any questions?</p>
<p>Why did Microsoft drop the ball on this update based on all of the complaints I have read in forums since I have been trying to deal with this annoying update that requires me to practically rebuild my computer from scratch, which is a huge pain in the butt?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously the last three questions are less serious.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any help you can provide</p>
<p />

<h2>            Windows 10 drivers for my DVD player HL-DT-ST DVDRAM GT20N</h2>
                    <p>I have a Toshiba Satellite L500, Model Number: PSLS0A-016002 which came with Windows 7 OS. &nbsp;I updated to Windows 10 for free when it popped up on my PC. &nbsp;Everything works well except my DVD player and so I am wondering how I can get it to work again as it
 isn't being recognised by Windows 10.</p>

            Hello RHF2,<br />
<br />
<br />
Take a look at this from Microsoft here in this&nbsp;Link: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/812003" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/812003</a><br />
<br />
<br />
To manually customize the folder picture that the Thumbnails view uses, put a Graphics Interchange Format (.gif) image file in the folder with a file name of Folder.gif. You can use any graphic editing program to create the .gif image. To use the Microsoft
 Paint program, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong>, point to <strong>
All Programs</strong> (or <strong>Programs</strong>), point to <strong>
Accessories</strong>, and then click <strong>Paint</strong>. </li><li>To open an existing image, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>On the <strong>File</strong> menu, click <strong>
Open</strong>. </li><li>Locate the folder that contains the image that you want to use. Paint can open images files with a .bmp, .gif, .gif, .jpg, .jpeg, .jpe, .jfif, .tif, .tiff, .png, or .ico file name extension.
</li><li>Select the image that you want to use, and then click <strong>
Open</strong>. </li></ol>
</li><li>Use the tools in Paint to modify the image (if you want to modify it). </li><li>Save the image after you modify the image. To do so, on the <strong>
File</strong> menu, click <strong>Save as</strong>. </li><li>In the <strong>Save as type</strong> box, select <strong>
GIF (*.GIF)</strong>. </li><li>For the file name, type:
<div><span>Folder.gif</span>.</div>
</li><li>Locate the folder that you want to customize, and then click <strong>
Save</strong>. </li></ol>
When you view the folder in Thumbnails view in Windows Explorer, the folder now has the custom image that you created, unless you use the
<strong>Customize</strong> tab of the folder's <strong>
Properties</strong> dialog box to select a folder picture. The folder picture that is specified on the
<strong>Customize</strong> tab overrides the manual Folder.gif customization.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Hope this helps you. Let us know either way. Make it a great day</strong>!<br />
<br />

    <title>Windows 8.1 Location Provider &#43; Location Sensors - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeffzaremba  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 8.1 Location Provider &#43; Location Sensors</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell Latitude 7240 running W8.1 Update 1 that has a Sierra Wireless MC7354 LTE Broadband device also installed. &nbsp; While the modem capabilities of the MC7354 work fine, GPS does not. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Device Manager/Sensors - I see two devices - the Windows Location Provider and a Sierra Wireless Location Sensor. &nbsp; Both devices are shown as working properly, but in the Maps app or Here Maps, location will not update. &nbsp; The apps will update when I turn
 off the LTE modem and use WiFi. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I also found interesting is that I opened a putty session to monitor the NMEA port (COM3) on the MC7354 that provides GPS information and it was streaming out GPS Fix locations fine. &nbsp; &nbsp; So the GPS functions of the MC7354 are working correctly and it
 is feeding that data out the NMEA port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I am trying to understand is the relationship between the Sierra Wireless Sensor and the Windows Location Provider. &nbsp; My assumption is that the Location Provider should be aware of the sensor and consume the data the sensor provides then provide that
 data to apps that can consume location information. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This same configuration worked great under Windows 7 on the same computer - so trying to understand if there are any registry specifics, that may be preventing the sensor to provider communication. &nbsp; &nbsp; I have also opened up this same subject on the Sierra
 Wireless Developer Forum and was told that the driver version 14.5.1030.8 dated 5/12014 was fully Windows 8.1 compatible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A final twist in this config is that this machine is a domain member and has GPOs applied. &nbsp; Using gpresult to review at the resultant set of policies at both a computer and user level - I am not seeing any specific constraints on Location Services, COM
 ports, etc that should prevent GPS fix information from being consumed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any guidance you can provide me as next steps in the troubleshooting process and/or known issues would be great... &nbsp; thanks...</p>

<h2>            Xbox One keeps auto scrolling down after turned on</h2>
                    My son's xbox keeps scrolling down as soon as it is turned on. &nbsp;I have tried a hard reset, removed the batteries from all of the controllers before turning it back on. &nbsp;I know that it is not a controller issue as I have tried 4 different ones. &nbsp;I can't
 get to any of the settings because it goes straight to the bottom of everything and you are hard pressed to even get it to register when you hit the buttons.

<p>Hi Max!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for posting, the steps already performed are good troubleshooting options and since the issue has persisted what I recommend trying is a soft factory reset following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>
Power off your console, and then unplug the power cord to ensure that the console is completely powered off.
</li><li>
Wait 30 seconds, and then plug the power cord back in.</li><li>
Press and hold the <strong>BIND</strong> button (located below the Xbox button on the console) and the
<strong>EJECT</strong> button (located on the front of the console), and then press the
<strong>Xbox</strong> button on the console. </li><li>
Continue holding the <strong>BIND</strong> and <strong>EJECT</strong> buttons for 10-15 seconds.
</li><li>
Listen for two “power-up” tones a couple of seconds apart. You can release the <strong>
BIND</strong> and <strong>EJECT</strong> buttons after the second power-up tone.</li><li>
Select <strong>Reset this Xbox</strong></li><li>
Choose to reset console and<strong> keep my</strong> <strong>games &amp; apps</strong></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>The menu will only take directional input from the D-Pad so this should prevent the constant scrolling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this info helps! Thanks again.</p>

<h2>            Windows Update keeps failing to install  &#40;error 80070002&#41;</h2>
                    <p>original title: Windows Update keeps failing to install the same 2 updates when rebooting</p>
<p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Im using an Asus Laptop with Windows 7 SP1 and tried to install 2 important updates to .NET framework as advised. The error Im getting now is that when it asks for reboot it keeps failing to install these updates (gets to 35%) and ends up reverting them.
 I do eventually get into Windows and all seems fine in there but continual get this loop when I reboot.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In Windows Update Im getting the following errors against these updates:<br />
</p>
<br />
<p>Security Update for .NET Framework 3.5.1 on Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 for x64-based Systems (KB2478662)<br />
</p>
<p>Installation status: Failed</p>
<p>Error details: Code 80070002 </p>
&nbsp;
<p>Security Update for .NET Framework 3.5.1 on Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 for x64-based Systems (KB2446710)</p>
<p>Installation status: Failed</p>
Error details: Code 80070002 <br />
<br />
Unfortunately I dont have a restore point that goes far enough back to reverse these updates and Ive tried to install them manually which seems to go through, but unsure if it has installed them as its still is stuck on this loop.<br />
<br />
Thanks for any help<br />
<br />

            <p>Try one at a time.<br />
<span>Here are some notes that may help resolve problems encountered when installing Windows Updates.</span></p>
<p><span>The process of installing updates comprises downloading, installing and configuring the operating system to use the new updates.
 Some updates require the computer to be restarted and when this occurs configuring occurs as the system is shut down and is completed when the computer is restarted. It is important not to interrupt the configuration process as configuration involves making
 changes to the registry. If interrupted, the result can be a computer that will not boot.</span></p>
<p><span>A lot of problems arise from setting Windows Update to automatically update. You may prefer to change this setting. Select Start,
 All Programs, Windows Update, Change Settings. Under Important Updates is a box showing the current setting. Click on the Arrow down to the right and change the selection to “Check for Updates but let me choose whether to download and install them” and click
 on OK.</span></p>
<p><span>If you encounter problems updating or you are not using the Automatic Update you should manually update by selecting
 Start, All Programs, Windows Update, Check for Updates. Check the boxes before the updates you want to install, click on Install and click again on Install in the next window and the process of installing starts. You should let the process proceed without
 interruption. Multi-tasking at the time updating is in progress is unwise. The progress window will tell you what is going on. You need to be patient.
</span></p>
<p><span>If you have a number of updates to install break the task of updating into two or more tasks. If you have been
 having problems with Windows Update run Disk CleanUp (or better still cCleaner) and Disk Defragmenter ( or better still Defraggler) before installing any large download.</span></p>
<p><span>If the measures above fail to resolve your problem select Start, All Programs, View Update History and post the Failure Code and
 Update reference number to the Windows Update Forum at Microsoft Answers.</span></p>
<p><span>You can also try the Windows Update Troubleshooter:<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Already tried to install it seperately via Windows Update and now it doesnt get past downloading the update without failing with error 80070002 or it just gets stuck downloading at 0%.<br />
<br />
The mad thing is after searching the KB articles Ive downloaded the x64 manual installs:<br />
<br />
Windows6.1-KB2478662-x64.msu<br />
Windows6.1-KB2446710-x64.msu<br />
<br />
and when Ive attempted to install them I get an error message that they 'This computer is not compatible with this update'<br />
<br />
So whats going on and why is Windows Update selecting updates that apparently arent needed for my laptop.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Sanjay<br />

<p>I suggest you start your own thread as piggy backing a ride on someone else thread only get those trying to help confused! You can do this by checking the box before Ask a Question at the top of this page. I suggest you look for errors in Event Voewer and
 post copies. </p>
<p>Event Viewer Reports</p>
<p>1. Normally when an error occurs on your computer looking in Event Viewer should be your starting point for finding a solution. Most system related errors are logged and getting an exact copy of the relevant report is important. Unfortunately understanding
 the reports is not easy and most computer users need help with their interpretation. I have more to say later on interpretation.</p>
<p>2. Event Viewer comprises three main Windows logs. These are Application, Security and System. For troubleshooting purposes System is by far the most important.</p>
<p>3. To access the System log select Start, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer, from the list in the left side of the window select Windows Logs and System. Place the cursor on System, right click and select Filter Current Log. Check the box
 before Error and click on OK and you see only Error reports. Click on the Date and Time Column Header to sort. You may need to click a second time to see the latest Report at the top.
</p>
<p>4. A tip for posting copies of Error Reports! Run Event Viewer and double click on the error you want to copy. Select the Details tab and check the box before XML View. Click on the Copy button to place a copy on your Clipboard and close Event Viewer. Now
 start your message and paste into the body of the message. Make sure this is the first paste after exiting from Event Viewer.</p>
<p>5. There are three types of Report, being Information, Warning and Error reports. In most situations it is Error Reports that offer the best information but occasionally Warning Reports provide useful clues.
</p>
<p>6. All reports have date and time stamps and when troubleshooting it is important to concentrate on more recent reports. Study reports since the point when the computer was last booted and then check whether a similar report appeared in the previous session.
 If errors do not repeat investigation as to why they occurred is wasted effort.</p>
<p>7. Within individual reports the more important information is Event ID and Source as these help when looking for help on the internet. The description is equally important and copying the exact text for use as the search criteria greatly helps getting better
 results when using Google. Do not paraphrase descriptions when asking others for help.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
I am having the same problem as Sanjay was,</p>
<p><br />
I also lready tried to install these two updates&nbsp;via Windows Update and now it doesnt get past downloading the update without failing with error Error code: 80070Bc9 on Window Server 2008 R2.</p>
<p>I&nbsp;also&nbsp;downloaded the x64 manual installs:</p>
<p>Windows6.1-KB2478662-x64.msu and Windows6.1-KB2446710-x64.msu</p>
<p>and when Ive attempted to install them I get an error message that they 'This computer is not compatible with this update'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did the manual removal</p>
<p>ttp://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_update/kb2446710-and-kb2464594/4d3e52e0-f669-e011-8dfc-68b599b31bf5</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and ran the System Update Readiness Tool for Windows Server 2008 R2 x64 Edition (KB947821) h<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">ttp://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821</a><br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of these resolved the problem.</p>

</p><p>I've worked through this problem before. &nbsp;The touch screen is unresponsive, but the rest of the Surface works just fine. &nbsp;I checked the drivers and they said to be installed and up to date. &nbsp;I've had this issue happen two or three times before and doing
 the hold "power button and volume up" normally works. &nbsp;This time, and I have tried it 3-4 times, it has not worked. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello Alex,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The challenge that you're experiencing when you're updating your Windows 10 device might be caused by a corrupted update file. Please answer these questions so we can isolate the cause of your concern:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the exact error message you received after you updated the device?&nbsp;It would be helpful if you can attach&nbsp;a screenshot.
</li><li>What is the current OS Build of your Windows 10 device? Click the <strong>Start</strong> button, then type
<strong>winver</strong>, and then press <strong>Enter</strong> to verify this information.
</li></ul>
<p>For the meantime, you&nbsp;also try using our <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4027322/windows-update-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</p><p>Hope this helps and we're&nbsp;looking forward to your response.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                    Bare with me. I'm a college student taking a "Implementing Microsoft-based Network Directory Services"&nbsp; Server 2012R2 class and I'm needing someone to double check a cmdlet for me. My lab I'm currently working on I'm suppose to uninstall the Print &amp; Document
 Service, Application Server. Features: Group Policy Management, Internet Printing Client, and Windows Server Backup. After this I'll be returning to a full GUI interface from core. Is the correct cmdlet? Also if I just remove Print &amp; Document Service and Application
 server will the features be removed at the same time ? Thanks for the help !<br />

Not sure how to repair Money Data file.<br />
<br />
I have tried a few suggestions in your link. I again uninstalled Money on re start<br />
Windows updated (not sure what, at this point). Once it re started I installed Money, from a suggestion in your link, I tried to open the sample file, it wouldn't open (with a blue bar flashing).<br />
<br />
Since then I opened my created account and it now seems to be working. It needs further investigation.<br />
<br />
Sadly since the update my taskbar won't auto hide so I can't get at the Money menu (behind the taskbar)</p>

            <p>Only Money Sunset will open your data file. With Sunset there is a&nbsp;long standing problem with importing downloaded data from institutions: the solution to that is in the first post in the Money forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Repair option is in Money's File menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Money's window could be resized. Programs do not have to be run full screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>From what you are saying&nbsp;I think your Windows 10 installation is damaged. Your best options&nbsp;are, after backing up your data and settings,&nbsp;either&nbsp;to Reset the installation or make a clean install with media created with the
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows 10 media creation tool</a>&nbsp;. You could try running sfc /scannow at an elevated command prompt but I doubt that would resolve the issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updating a long running Windows installation can bring forward accumulated problems in ways which make the updated installation effectively unusable.</p>

<div>I don't download anything, I only use money for my own personnel tracking.</div>
<div>Previosly one of the methods I tried was repair in the menu, it didn't help.</div>
<div>I only upgraded to 10 Monday 12/10/15 any damage surely came with it, as the problems with Money have been since<br />
the upgrade.</div>
<div>I can't do a clean install I would lose the rollback, also on trying a re install (on another PC) you are met with Activation problems (mentioned on here)<br />
The only thing to do was start from Windows 8.1 and upgrade again to 10, losing all the laptop (factory settings).</div>
<div>
<p>I don't fancy going there again, maybe it's best to scrap Microsoft Money or go back to Windows 7</p>

            <p>I have reinstalled four systems clean, one on a different SSD, and all have activated automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your original problem was stated as after upgrading from Windows 7, but now you say you would need to revert to Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your laptop is not supported by its manufacturer for&nbsp;Windows 10 (if it came with Windows 7 that is almost certain) you need to make sure you have found and installed any required&nbsp;drivers and may need to update&nbsp;its BIOS. Incompatible (with Windows 10)
 manufacturer supplied software and settings may be the cause of the problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean installs often resolve problems with Windows installations, assuming the issues are not caused by failing hardware.</p>

            Thanks Dominic<br />
<br />
As regards Win 8.1 I was talking about another PC (as stated above) not this one.<br />
<br />
You have a month to try Windows 10 or rollback, maybe activation will work after the month.
<br />
<br />
The PC in question is a Lenovo Desktop and is supported for Windows 10 all drivers<br />
were updated on the upgrade to 10 from 7. Any programs (Mc Affee) not supported were removed during the upgrade.<br />
<br />
The only problem I am having (and have ever had) is this with Money, I will seek an alternative for Windows 10.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your suggestions.

<h2>            No login prompt after sleep...</h2>
                    <p><span>Hello. This has been irritating me for over 2 weeks now, searching for solutions.</span></p>
<p><span>I have analyzed the problem: After my laptop is sent to sleep and waken up, the first lock screen with the time is there. I slide it up, the background
 dims, but no login prompt is shown. I've tried what other people have done (ctrl+alt+del, Win+L, sending it to sleep again and rewaking it, changing registry keys (refcount, state), etc.), but to no avail. This does not happen when booted up, and can only
 be fixed by restarting. This happens every day, and I have to restart countless times, wasting my battery, time, and unsaved progress in open apps.<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>I've scanned for malware using Malwarebytes too.</span></p>
<p><span>This all started when my PIN started locking itself if I got it mistaken even once. I've tried to remove the PIN and reapply it, but then it would
 not let me. This is when it all started (Now I use a picture password, but it would be nice if I could find a solution to this as well). At that time I did not install any updates or any programs right before the event. Below you will find a picture of the
 login prompt not being shown.</span></p>

<p>Thank you! I haven't tried it yet as I actually fixed it by fixing my inability to re-add a PIN. My problem must have been related to WIndows trying to display a PIN box that doesn't actually exist, but I'm not sure how it would work as a restart correctly
 prompted me to either my picture passcode or account password. After I fixed it, waking it up from sleep now correctly prompts me a PIN input.</p>
<p>If a similar problem happens again I sure will try your directions.</p>

            Sorry, Something that I forgot tp further clarify was that the outdated email I mentioned earlier was an incorrect email that was accidentally put in the account, but was quickly changed years ago, so I do not have access to the outdated email nor could
 I find or remember its password, Any methods on how to change the email without having to access it,&nbsp; would be very helpful thanks,<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55c8a50b-edc3-45b5-ad8b-677ca87b1d23?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/55c8a50b-edc3-45b5-ad8b-677ca87b1d23?upload=true" /></a>

    <title>TIP&#58; What On Earth Is Soul Sand Good For&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wildattorney  say:</h3>
<h2>            TIP&#58; What On Earth Is Soul Sand Good For&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I almost never see a world where someone incorporates soul sand in anything but the occasional dock.&nbsp; In light of that, I thought it might be helpful to post a little information about the various uses of soul sand in the game.&nbsp; For starters, the basics:&nbsp;
 Soul sand is found in the Nether as a layer of what looks like a darker shade of dirt (with facial images on it) that sits atop Netherrack.&nbsp; It's primary characteristic is that it slow you down considerably when you walk on it.&nbsp; This is obviously not a functionality
 that most people look for in their maps (they'd prefer to go faster, not slower), so it rarely gets used.&nbsp; There are a number of practical uses for it, however.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, as I referenced above, it is great for boat docks.&nbsp; Place the soul sand at water level, so that the top of the soul sand (and only the top of it) is exposed to air (with the rest of block being submerged).&nbsp; If you then land a boat on it, the boat
 will stop atop the soul sand and when you leave the boat, the boat will remain in one place.&nbsp; Without soul sand, you are likely to either crash your boat into pieces or see it drifting off into the ocean.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Second, it's great for one-way doors.&nbsp; Soul sand is a slightly smaller block that other blocks.&nbsp; If you make a top block high doorway and place a block of soul sand in the ground in front of the doorway (note, do NOT place it in the floor of&nbsp;the doorway
 itself, but in the floor in front or in back of the doorway, depending on your perspective), you will not be able to enter the doorway, although someone coming from the other side will be able to enter.&nbsp; In other words, if you have to step on soul sand to
 enter the doorway, you will not be able to, but if you step on soul sand in the doorway or as you exit the doorway, you will be able to pass. One caveat to this.&nbsp; Someone will still be able to get through the doorway if they come at it at an angle.&nbsp; You can
 prevent this by making the doorway at least 2 blocks deep.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Third, you can make MOB traps out of it.&nbsp; Place a piece of soul sand in the ground. Then on the third block up from that soul sand, place four blocks of soul sand in a donut or halo formation, such that the hole is three blocks directly above the soul sand
 that is in the ground.&nbsp; If you do this, any MOB that stands 2 blocks high (creeper, zombie, and skeleton) will get stuck once they step on the soul sand and will be unable to move from that point.&nbsp; You can do the same with MOBs that are one block high (pigs,
 sheep, etc) by simply making the donut forumation 2 blocks up from the ground (as you see, the key is that the gap between the floor and the donut have to be equal to the size of the MOB you want to trap.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fourth, while you can use soul sand to make things go slower, you can greatly increase this effect if you put the soul sand on ice.&nbsp; Now, this has a limited application in this version of the game, since we can't place ice.&nbsp; So you would have to use pre-existing
 iced areas of the map.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are some of the uses of soul sand in the game.&nbsp; If someone has found other uses, please opine. Of course, I should mention that soul sand can also be used as decoration (including in pixel art if you need something with that exact color).</p>

<p>excellent thread idea.</p>
<p>You could make a walkway from your door to a "safe" point, and then cover the surrounding lawn with soul sand. &nbsp;In this way, a Creeper couldn't rush you from the side as you stepped out of your house (very annoying if you have a blind spot at your door).</p>
<p>I've heard of using a stack of soul sand as some kind of downward elevator (allegedly you sink in soul sand). &nbsp;I don't have any soul sand, haven't seen it yet to confirm.</p>

<p>i use soulsand to make traps like if a mob is chasing me could go through the soulsand but soulsand makes you slower so i use pistons to escape from the slowness.</p>

<p>The only reason I've ever used it was for the graves in my graveyard. I got this idea from Sjin of the Yogscast, but basically you put down a cobblestone step, and in front of the full-block side of the steps (the back) you dig out two grass blocks and fill
 it with soul sand. I think it looks a lot better than brown wool, and you can't use dirt because it will just turn back into grass if it is touching another grass block. Also, if you look closely at soul sand, you will see a lot of tiny faces in it, which
 matches the creepiness of a graveyard.</p>
