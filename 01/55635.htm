<p>
</p><p>So if the accounts are linked, then why are the "skype credits" that microsoft has been deducting from my bank account and the "skype to go" fees are not accessible through this so called link?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am being told I cannot gain access to my other, original skype account where those credits are reflected that I have had for 10 years. How is that possible if they are linked?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also told I can only access that account by answering dozens of questions about how and when I opened that skype account 10 years ago. Ridiculous.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since every month MICROSOFT is taking money from my bank account for those charges, How about I simply identify the account information about where those funds are being taken from. WOULD THAT NOT PROVE I OWN THE ACCOUNT?????</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is way past time to resolve this!&nbsp;&nbsp; Microsoft has destroyed my Skype experience after ten years of being THRILLED with it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe I will have to contact the District Attorney Consumer Fraud Division and report that Microsoft is taking money from my bank account when I have no way to access the services I am paying for, nor do I have the option of altering or stopping those payments,
 (Which I do not want to do unless Microsoft decides they no longer want my business.)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Microsoft created this problem by forcing and sneakily creating these bizarre parallel accounts that has caused this issue. Why were we not told this would be coming and how to avoid problems??</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I got an meail saying the problem was being taken out of the community and would be dealt with privately. Then today, I get another letter from "the community" so this is the "community" response.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even more bizarre and annoying is this ridiculous "help" process that is an unholy mix of "community" which provides the same endless loop of ineffective hoops for the customer to jump through, "chat" which is another layer, and "escalation which also leads
 nowhere. There is nothing linear or rational about the process. I have heard from a dozen or more people and even though I have provided tracking numbers from previous conversations, there is absolutely no continuity.&nbsp; To make matters worse, the advice often
 uses acronyms and terms that I and any other person who dies not use MICROSPEAK couldnt possibly understand or execute.&nbsp;&nbsp; Have you ever thought of running these instructions past a panel of OUTSIDERS to see if they can follow them?? It is like trying to follow
 the assembly instructions .for some Chinese widget. They always leave ot a imortant bit that they assume YOU KNOW because THEY KNOW</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did I mention Microsoft screwed up skype and made it so I cannot log in the the account that has the skype to go number and my skype credit?&nbsp; Microsoft is taking my money every month through Paypal and denying me access at the same time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I HATE MICROSOFT FOR SCREWING UP MY 10 YEAR OLD SKYPE EXPERIENCE AND&nbsp; THE RIDICULOUS RESPONSE ONLY MAKES IT WORSE!!!!!</p>

<p>
</p><p>I honestly do not know how they merged the accounts. They said it could not be done and the next day it WAS done.&nbsp; To chat with a live person, follow the instructions above: Using the "Payments and Billing" option. Once you get connected you can tell them
 the issiue. They will try to get you to search for duplicate accounts. I had done that and there were two, but for some reason I was locked out of the old one that had my skype to go number and credits. I failed at answering the questions to regain access
 but somehow they figured it out.&nbsp; One important detail is, I deleted the new version of skype and re downloaded "the Classic" version. That seemed to be key to the success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get the feeling a lot of the people in this forum are from Microsoft, but I am just a formerly VERY FRUSTRATED customer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How you get it resolved.&nbsp; I think it is immoral that Microsoft highjacked Skype and made it unusable for so many. I wasted probably ten hours working on the issue before it was resolved. I am still not sure what will happen when Microsoft again bullies me
 or manipulates me into re "upgrading" to the new version. I may lose it all again.

<p>I have already checked, there are no other accounts connected.&nbsp; When I sign into the original account as howard.horner, it will not allow me to sign in. It asks for an alternate sign in and tries to send the code to an account that does not exist. I have
 already explained multiple times that my wife tried to access my howard.horner from her work computer and made a mistake in typing in her email. She entered&nbsp;********** instead of ***********. Microsoft created an account that is linked to howard.horner and
 an email that does not exist. When codes are sent there we do not get them. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have asked multiple times, when we try to fill out the questions on the alternate sign in, are we talking bout the new bogus account or the old original one??</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have provided a copy of my bank records showing the charge from microsoft against my pay pal account. How can it be any more clear that I own that account. I need it linked to&nbsp;************* or **********.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am VERY close to giving up and never using skype again. It makes me sad and mad. I have had it for TEN years and microsoft has destroyed it for me. I cant believe you are still taking my money for services I cant access.</p>

<h2>            Xbox Pause No Longer Works</h2>
                    
<p>Using the voice command "Xbox Pause" stopped working recently. It used to pause live TV, Netflix, Streaming Video, etc. and now it pauses nothing. I even tried pausing while watching a video on Xbox Movies and TV or whatever the app is called and that didn't
 work either. It says "Cannot Pause Right Now" or something to that effect whenever I try.</p>

The microphone is not detected by Skype for Business and people cannot hear me, however I can hear them well. As a workaround I have to go to sound-&gt;recording settings and disable/re-enable the
<span>default recording device (surface's own microphone array/Realtek SST)</span>. This is extremely frustrating and impacts my productivity.

<span>Business </span>people need to wait for me to do all the tricks to get the microphone working and disabling the microphone suspends the call, so many times the other end simply drop the call thinking that I dropped it in the first place.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One keeps disconnecting from wifi, and then reconnecting.</h2>
                    
<p>I've noticed ever since I got my new dual band router that my Xbox One decides to stay connected to the network for a few minutes and then disconnect. Afterwards reconnecting again. Rinse and repeat after that. I've tried everything! Port forwarding, hard
 and soft reboot, adjusting the network settings of my Xbox, etc. I just found out that I'm getting updates from the preview program but I'm not registered as a preview customer.</p>

            <p>Hey, F3arM0d3! I do see that you are part of the Preview Program for sure, however your issue is likely related to that gateway. Arris/Technicolor TG models are notorious for causing these kinds of issues with customers on Xbox One and 360 consoles.</p>
<p>My suggestion is to call up your ISP and have them put that device in bridge mode (so that the routing capabilities are turned off) and then purchasing a separate router. Best case is to get a standalone modem, however I understand how hard it is to get one of those from ISPs at this time.</p>
<p>Give that a shot and let me know how it goes! Happy to help out further once you get that set up if you're still having issues. :)</p>

<p>Another Achivement (Kill 5 mechanical Enemys with grenades) won't work too. </p>
<p>I've startet a new game and killed again 5 of the flying drones in front of the hospital (Level 2 or 3). Nothing happend (again).</p>

                    Purchased a new HP Envy laptop 2 years ago. It came with Intel (R) Dual Band Wireless-AC 3165 network adapter. From day one the wireless dropped out on numerous routers. The machine has been replaced twice by Computer World but I've had the same problem
 with each machine. Any suggestions?

            Tried most if not all of these solutions over the last 2 years. I have now solved the problem using a solution posted on another thread, which involved modifying the power-saving settings. It's a shame none of the KnowHow engineers could have come up with
 this solution 2 years ago!

<h2>            Windows 7 student version installation from scratch&#63;</h2>
                    I am a student, and therefore have access to the windows 7 $30 offer.&nbsp; However, I will either be upgrading from XP, or installing it in on a new hard drive. Yet, the student download one is labeled "upgrade".&nbsp; Will this be a problem, or will I still be
 able to do a fresh install?&nbsp; <br />
<br />
If I do infact need to use vista as a base, could I use someone else disc just to install it as a base, but then before activating it just install 7?&nbsp; There has to be a way to do this without buying vista....<br />

            In order to install the upgrade version of Windows 7, you must have a qualifying Windows operating system installed and activated.&nbsp; You cannot install an upgrade version of Windows 7 on a blank hard drive.&nbsp; The installation procedure does not ask you to
 insert a Windows disc in the drive for verification, the actual qualifying operating system must be installed.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you do not have a qualifying Windows operating system installed with a genuine license activated, then you cannot use the upgrade version of Windows 7 - you would need a "full version" Windows 7 license.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In summary:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. A qualifying Windows operating system must be installed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. The qualifying Windows operating system must have a genuine license (product key) and it must be activated.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. To upgrade, boot to the qualifying Windows desktop, insert the Windows 7 Upgrade disc in the DVD drive.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. When the setup menu appears, select Custom (advanced) to initiate a clean install procedure.<br />
<br />
<em>If I do infact need to use vista as a base, could I use someone else disc just to install it as a base, but then before activating it just install 7?</em>
<br />
<br />
<strong>If you have a qualifying operating system such Windows 2000 Professional or Windows XP, that you personally own a license for, then you can do that without borrowing one.

<p>When I pull up ControlPanel/System/Hardware/Device Manager there are _no_ modems listed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I deleted all except one (the first, with no number) of the Agere Systems modems, and also left the Motorola USB modem in the list.&nbsp; No change.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I downloaded a modem driver from Compaq.&nbsp; The download went dine, but the installation returned "Failed" wiht no further infomration.&nbsp; (How helpful ....)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>

<p><span>If your system is old, then this could be hardware related issue. However, you should get in touch with AOL before anything else. This looks
 like a fairly common issue, or at least it was a few years ago when everyone was using dial-up. But the consensus seems to be that this is an AOL issue and that’s why the modem is being blocked.</span></p>

    <title>Manually delete printer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pzkpfwiv  say:</h3>
<h2>            Manually delete printer</h2>
                    <p>My Canon LBP 5000 worked fine in Windows 7 (64 bit), but after upgrade to Windows 8 it's causing hangs.</p>
<p>e.g. Word and Excel (2010) hang when trying to enumerate printers. Sometimes, stopping the spooler service brings back the app, not always.</p>
<p>I've managed to print once, fine, but have no idea why it worked then and no longer.</p>
<p>(Yes, I've tried the printer troubleshooter - no help. No, Canon does not supply Windows 8 specific drivers).</p>
<p>I've read that reinstalling with the setup set to Windows 7 compatibility mode can help, but before I can try that I need to uninstall the printer.</p>
<p>However, Windows can't do it. (e.g. through Control Panel, Devices and Printers, use the delete command - it fails after 20 seconds of trying something.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So - what regedit hacking do I need to do to remove a local printer?</p>
<p>---- Edit ----</p>
<p>In case it's useful to anyone with a similar issue:</p>
<p>I decided to just use regedit to find every occurrence of the name of my printer and delete it.&nbsp;Hack and slash. I then re-ran the setup.exe for the printer, with compatibility mode set to Win 7, and as administrator. So far, it seems to work. But I'll report
 back in a day or two if it's - still - working.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try uninstalling it in Device Manager first, then try REMOVING it in Devices and Printers...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You may not actually HAVE to Remove it to uninstall the drivers and software, but my experience is that things go more smoothly if you do.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Thanks, but no. Nothing normal (through any window) was working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eventually just did the regedit thing, and deleted anything I saw with the name of the printer in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That seemed to work, and allowed the new driver to install, so that's good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sadly (coincidence?) the printer is now (that is, after printing&nbsp;1 page after installation of the new driver!)complaining about calibration, which from googling around seems common with this model, so it looks like I'll next have to take to the printer with
 a screwdriver and give it a good cleaning out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sigh.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would need to right click on the highlighted text, select copy, then right click somewhere on your Desktop or personal folder and select "New" then "Rich Text Document"... Open the new document, right click and select paste...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or you can create the New Document first if you prefer..</p>
<p>If you have a program like Word, WordPerfect, or similar, you can open a new document with one of those as well...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically you need to save the text as some type of a document before you can print it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on exactly what you are trying to do, you could print the entire page or pages of the text by right clicking on the screen, selecting Print, and then Print to PDF or XPS Document Writer...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You could then highlight, copy, paste, and print partial sections of the pages from there...</p>

    <title>File History does not back-up files held in the OneDrive folder even - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wallace99  say:</h3>
<h2>            File History does not back-up files held in the OneDrive folder even though physically held on hard drive</h2>
                    <p>On the PC I keep Documents, Pictures and Videos on the OneDrive folder so that any change i make on the PC is automatically added to OneDrive and thus fully available on my phone, Ipad and laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But this gives me a problem with the File History backup as none of the One Drive folders are backed up (other than showing the folder names). I don't know whether the program is assuming that, because it's a One Drive folder, the files won't be physically
 present on the hard drive. But they <strong>are</strong> there on the hard drive although ignored by File History. So I am having to back up Documents, Pictures and Videos by other means&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas how i can get File History to make the necessary back-ups</p>
<p>
</p><p>File History works fine for all my other folders</p>

 PowerShell commands, enabling developer mode, updating my PC, making new admin accounts and multiple hour long remote computer assistance from both Microsoft and Adobe support. Nothing has worked... So as a last try I am posting here to see if anyone more
 knowledgable about Windows has any ideas?</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestions but none of them worked for me. If it helps the powershell AppX command thing spit out the error,&nbsp; "Cannot find path 'C:\AppXManifest.xml' because it does not exist".&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had exactly the same problem with installing Adobe XD and tried every solution i could find. The one thing no one has written about was the following.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open "Microsoft Store"</p>
<p>2. Open then menu on the top right hand corner and select "Downloads and Updates"</p>
<p>3. Run the updates. I updated every app but i think "App Installer" or "Microsoft Store" should be the crutial ones.<br />
4. Restart your PC</p>
<p>5. Install Adobe XD</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope, this solution works for you as well. Good luck!</p>

<h2>            Surface Pro 2 with Windows 10 Continuum not working</h2>
                    Does anyone else have an issue with Continuum not switching when you remove the keyboard? When I first installed Windows 10, it was working with no problems, then it all of a sudden it stopped. The settings are set to switch without notifying me, but nothing
 happens. Has anyone else experienced this?

<p>I am experiencing similar issues on my Surface Pro 1 with Win10. Regardless of whether I am in desktop or tablet mode, Continuum never gets activated when adding/removing my keyboard. I have toggled the tablet settings between Don't ask me &amp;&nbsp;don't switch/Always
 ask me before switching/Don't ask me and always switch and the feature never activates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know how I can restore this functionality without having to reset my device.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same issue with my Surface Pro 2. I use it with the Type Cover for the Surface 3, and I simply just CANNOT GET Continuum to work... Win10 is freshly (re)installed,&nbsp;all the drivers are up to date, I even downloaded the Surface 3 driver pack to
 install the Type Cover's drivers from there, but it didn't work. It's strange that I also have 2 keyboards with identical Hardware IDs when the Type Cover is attached to the tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see several posts regarding Continuum not working, and in my opinion the one brand it should be working with is YOUR OWN Surface...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to get to the bottom of this?&nbsp;Is there any way to check what should trigger the Tablet mode and why it's not triggered? It's really a shame as I had it working before on my Asus Transformer Book T100. Asus actually had a solution with a detailed
 guide on what and how to update to get it working and it did work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So please advise if we users can help anyhow in solving this mystery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many Thanks,</p>
<p>Daniel</p>

            Thank you for the information. I am still having trouble downloading the Gears of War game. I tried the steps you mentioned earlier, but it did not work on windows 8 drop down choice. I got the same error as before. Now I am trying it with windows 7 drop
 down choice, and it is going very slow so far. Am I wasting time trying. I started it yesterday, and it is still in the process!? What to do?

<p>Same issue here - posted a thread similar (if not identical to this today) after doing a quick search where I had not seen this post. Anyway, am trying the installation this time with no compatibility modification and it runs as slow as if it were in Windows
 7 compatibility mode. The Windows 8 compatibility mode did not operate correctly for me either. My installation has been running in the background for about the last 24 hours and has just reached the 25% completion mark.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had just installed Batman, Arkham Asylum GoTY Edition yesterday before starting the Gears of War installation and Batman operates correctly as does GFWL. I had noticed that there are "Vista Drivers" installed by the game installer (Gears of War)&nbsp;and am
 considering hunting these down and messing&nbsp; with compatibility settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish you best of luck and if I get anything going I'll post my results here as well as in my thread --wish me luck. Got a few more achievements to get before I retire the game in favor of the Ultimate Edition which I aim to get soon.</p>

<h2>            Skype Search does not find me - How to fix&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I use Skype at work and home\personal.</p>
<p>In my profile, I have both my personal email and work email.</p>
<p>When I do a search on me by email, Skype does not find me with my work email, but I can find me by my personal email.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I get Skype to list me in searches with my work email?</p>
<p>I've listed my work email in my Skype profile four months ago and it still does not show up.</p>
<p>Yes, I've tried the https://secure.skype.com -&gt; Edit Profile and checked the Checkbox 'Include me in People Search and Suggestions', but nothing changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone have any suggestions on how this can be fixed?</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to internet thru Guest account</h2>
                    We cannot connect to the internet thru the Guest account. I suspect a security update or my playful teenage son changed a setting. This just recentlty happened(last 48 hours) &nbsp;HELP...I have spent over 2 hours trying to get it back online. The Adm. log
 in works fine and I was able to create another account just to see and it also connects just fine. What is wrong and how do&nbsp;I correct it?&nbsp; Thanks, Biggator

            Actually you don't want to be connecting to the Internet using the Guest account as that is insecure. In fact, you don't want to be using the Guest account at all. The Guest account is a special system account, not one meant for when you are feeling hospitable.
 It is disabled by default in Windows XP, Vista, Windows 7, Linux, Unix, and OS X for a reason.<br />
<br />
From TechNet:<br />
<br />
"The Guest account is intended for users who require temporary access to the system. However, if this account is enabled, a security risk may exist because an unauthorized user could gain anonymous access to the system through this account."<br />
<br />
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb418978(TechNet.10).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb418978(TechNet.10).aspx</a>
<br />
<br />
So if you enabled Guest, disable it now and create a Standard/Limited (Vista, Windows 7,&nbsp; XP Pro/XP Home) for your visitors. Call the new user account something like "Visitor".<br />
<br />
And since you mentioned a teenaged son:<br />
<br />
Be sure the computer is clean:<br />
