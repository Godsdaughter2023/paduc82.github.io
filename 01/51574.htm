<h2>            Permanently disable windows update medic service &#38; turn off updates</h2>
                    <p>Hi~</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; I need a way to disable the windows updates. I hate updates &amp; I'm really sick of having updates forced on me with all this technology. I had the update feature shut off for years. I only turned it on if I needed something vital then shut it back off.
 Last September, my computer shut itself off in the middle of a timed exam &amp; spent 3 hrs updating. Since then, it forces updates on me regularly &amp; always when I'm in the middle of something. Idc about having windows up to date. I've spent hours googling how
 to do it, but there's nothing I can find that doesn't require downloading various programs or rewriting portions of the inner workings. I need the updates to stop. Permanently. Will deleting the "update for windows 10 for x64-based systems" prevent them or
 will that mess up the whole computer? Please help. I've called microsoft many times &amp; all I get is "Sorry, that happened. We'll pass along your feedback."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello, <br />
<br />
I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To disable Update Medic service, check this video:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q-nQQrTKUM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q-nQQrTKUM</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/1Q-nQQrTKUM?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/1Q-nQQrTKUM?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use Group Policy to block automatic updates. This ensures updates are downloaded/installed only when you want them:
<br />
<br />
1. Open GPO snap-in by running gpedit.msc command. <br />
<br />
2. Go to Computer Configuration -&gt; Administrative Templates -&gt; Windows Components -&gt; Windows Update.
<br />
<br />
3. Double click Configure Automatic Updates policy setting, select Enabled. Then under 'Configure automatic updating' section, choose 2 - Notify for download and notify for install.
<br />
<br />
4. Click Apply, followed by OK. <br />
<br />
Multiple reboots will finally disable auto updates. <br />

<h3> ian and kathleen occleshaw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype audio issue</h2>
                    <p>I have a brand new HP laptop with Windows 10 and Skype version 12.13.274.0. With my 2011 Sony laptop I never had an issue using Skype. Now, whenever I receive a call, the person at the other end can see me and hear me and I can see them but I cannot hear
 them. I have tried all the solutions offered in on-line help. My speaker is at 100% and I can hear audio from websites. I have tried the Echo/Sound test service and there is no sound there either.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there anything else I can check?</p>
<p>Has anyone else had a similar problem?</p>

<h2>            BF4 issue....need to delete entire BF4 file from disc, how&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Ok, thought the console was the issue, but Forza 5 works great.</p>
<p>BF4 installed the single player, but not the multiplayer.&nbsp; It also did not give the pop-up screen for transferring Battlelog details.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After talking to Microsoft on the phone, and trying multiple things, including reinstalling the game.&nbsp;&nbsp; After that didnt work, exchanged the disc, thinking maybe it was the issue (still think it could be), but when we went to reinstall it, the BF4 logo was
 already at the bottom of the main screen, even though it had been uninstalled, and the disc was not yet inserted.</p>
<p>When we selected it, it began to install, still with no disc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I believe I need to do is delete this saved file somehow.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to do that without resetting to factory defaults?<br />
If I have to reset to remove it, is there a way to save the Forza 5 saved game info?&nbsp;
</p>

<p>I'm having the same problem with Killer Instinct. I got the game for free on gold it only had one player so I went to my local Walmart and bought the game played for a day the nx day went to play and some how went back to one player. I did the uninstall,and
 power cycle and it won't clear the downloaded game so it keeps overwritten the disk game cause it sits ready to install. There has to be a way to get rid of it. Called Xbox support and all I got from them was take Xbox one back to factory settings and clear
 all the games. That means any game you have that you had to use codes for special items or downloaded games will be lost. The code has been already used so can't be used again. So you lose out. If someone knows another way let us know cause I don't like losing
 money I paid for games</p>

<p>Hey there THOMAS5280,</p>
<p>I'm sorry to hear about the issue. Due to the age of this thread and the game that is described by the OP is different than what you're experiencing an issue with, I would suggest creating a new thread detailing what you're experiencing. This way we can
 cater our support specifically to you. Thanks!</p>

            Hi George.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Are you trying to mirror your screen like is shown in this tutorial?  <a href="https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/turn-windows-10-pc-into-wirelss-display" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/turn-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />There is more here about doing this:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/mirror-windows-10-screen-to-another-device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/mirror-windows-10...</a>
<br />
<br />Between those two tutorials I've always been able to get it working if the TV is capable.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi George, I am Rob, a volunteer and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. 
<br /> 
<br />The problem is that Dell can get away with that because we can say for sure it is the laptop. Do you have another TV to try it on or another computer to try with this laptop?
<br />
<br />You may need to call Dell back and ask to speak to a manager or supervisor. As OEM Dell is responsible for the proper operation of both the hardware and Windows. So regardless of the cause, it is theirs to resolve. And the unit is under full warranty and may be in need of repairs or replacement. Added that even if you are able to resolve the issue you would want it fully documented just in case there are related problems down the road. Remember the more you do the more they will say it is something you have done.

<br />
<br />=====
<br />
<br />Check the firmware for the TV to be sure it is up to date.
<br />
<br />Be sure to check Dell and the actual device makers' sites. Update the BIOS, chipset drivers, and all major drivers. Especially the video, sound, and network drivers (WiFi and NIC) which all can affect Miracast.
<br />
<br />Project to a wireless display with Miracast 
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15053/windows-8-project-wireless-screen-miracast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15053/...</a>
<br />
<br />How to set up &amp; use Miracast on Windows 10 
<br /><a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/set-up-use-miracast-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/set-up-use-miraca...</a> 
<br />
<br />This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : 
<br />
<br />Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names (and update BIOS and chipset drivers).
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />  
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Right Click the Start Button - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

            Uninstall MWDA driver, and let Windows install it
<br />
<br />In some cases, just uninstalling the Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter driver, and letting Windows 10 install it again automatically will solve the problem. In case you’re not sure how to do that, follow these steps:
<br />
<br />Go to Search, type devicemanager and open Device Manager.
<br />
<br />Find Marvell AVASTAR Wireless-AC Network Controller, right-click on it and go to Uninstall.
<br />
<br />After the uninstallation is finished, reboot your computer.
<br />Go to Settings&gt;Updates, and check for updates.
<br />Microsoft will likely install Wireless Display Adapter driver again, and everything should work.
<br />
<br />Now you can turn on your TV and check if everything is okay. If the issue is still present, you can try some of the solutions listed before.
<br />Solution 2 – Reset the adapter
<br />
<br />If reinstalling drivers didn’t get the job done, you can try with resetting the adapter. Here’s what you need to do:
<br />
<br />On the adapter, press and hold the reset button for 10 seconds.
<br />When the message “Ready to connect” appears, open Action Center from the Taskbar.
<br />Select Connect, and in the list of displays, select Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter.
<br />
<br />This will bring your Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter to its default settings, so if something were set wrong, it will now be changed.
<br />
<br />If your Microsoft Wireless Display adapter is not working, you might be able to fix the problem by connecting it properly. According to users, you can fix this problem by doing the following:
<br />
<br />Connect the adapter to the USB port.
<br />Now connect it to HDMI port.
<br />After doing that, switch to the HDMI input. This step is crucial and your device won’t work until you switch to the correct input.
<br />Now you just have to choose the device and add a wireless display.
<br />
<br />This is a basic solution, but several users reported that it worked for them, so be sure to try it out.
<br />
<br />Change your refresh rate
<br />
<br />According to users, this issue can be caused by your refresh rate. Several users reported that they fixed the issue simply by opening their graphics adapter software and changing the refresh rate from 30Hz to 25Hz.
<br />
<br />Users reported this problem with Intel Graphics, but the issue might appear with other graphics adapters as well
<br />
<br />Uninstall problematic software
<br />
<br />Sometimes third-party applications can interfere with your Internet connection and cause various problems. If your Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter is not working, the cause might be your VPN client.
<br />
<br />Many users reported that Cyber Ghost VPN caused this issue to occur, and after removing the application, the problem was resolved. If you plan to continue using Cyber Ghost, we advise you to download and install the latest version and check if that solves your issue.
<br />
<br />VPN applications aren’t the only apps that can cause this problem, so you might have to do a bit of research before you find the problematic application.
<br />
<br />Disable your antivirus software
<br />
<br />If Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter is not working, the problem might be your antivirus software. According to users, antivirus software such as AVG antivirus can sometimes interfere with your Internet connection and prevent Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter from working.
<br />
<br />To fix the issue, users are recommending to disable your antivirus temporarily and check if that solves the problem. Even if you disable your antivirus, your PC will remain protected by Windows Defender, so there’s no reason to worry.
<br />
<br />If disabling the antivirus doesn’t help, you might have to remove your antivirus. It’s worth mentioning that antivirus tools can leave certain files and registry entries behind, so it’s recommended to use a dedicated removal tool.
<br />
<br />Once you remove all files associated with your antivirus, the issue should be resolved. Now you can reinstall the latest version of your antivirus or switch to a different antivirus solution and check if that solves the problem.

                    <p>In the beginning, skydive had overlays, it kept them and has them today. little icons to tell you what is going on with your files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hated these and found a way to turn them off, by editing the key in the registry.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>go to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\ShellIconOverlayIdentifiers and delete the keys</p>
<p>
</p><p>but; </p>
<p>
</p><p>for some reason they have come back, and I went to turn them off and the registry says "NO!!!" to me.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the correct permissions, yes, i do, stop asking. I also tried booting into safe mode and it still would not let me do it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>so Microsoft, is there a new way to do this? or should I use sysinternals-autoruns? because I can't find the overlays in sysinternals...

<h2>            Silverlight Problems Viewing Help Videos</h2>
                    I am attempting to play a help video file (Change which programs Windows uses by default.&nbsp; (1:35)) on Microsoft Windows website.&nbsp; I am asked to install Silverlight (To view this content, please install Silverlight).&nbsp; I already had Silverlight installed.&nbsp;
 Since I could not find a 'Play' button, I attempted to install Silverlight.&nbsp; The download was successful but the installer said I already had Silverlight installed and terminated the installation.&nbsp; I attempted several other help videos but continued to run
 into the Silverlight problem.&nbsp; I uninstalled Silverlight hoping a fresh install might correct the problem.&nbsp; I downloaded and installed Silverlight successfully.&nbsp; When I tried to view a help video, I ran into the same Silverlight problem.&nbsp; To me, it appears
 that the websites can't find Silverlight installed on my computer.&nbsp; I am running Windows 7 SP1 Home Premium, IE9 on a Dell Dimension E510.&nbsp; Thank you.

<h3> sharpeijake  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Delete File</h2>
                    I have a file I am trying to delete and keep getting the error message&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; " Cannot Delete File: Cannot read from the source file or disk. "&nbsp; I have tried to delete the file from the safe mode but it won't let me delete it from there either.&nbsp; I recieved
 it as an email attatchment and it said it was 555kb.&nbsp; When I saved it it saved two files one of 735kb and one with 0kb.&nbsp; The both saved with the same name.&nbsp; I was able to delete on no problem but got the error message with the other.&nbsp; I restored both to the
 folder then deleted both and they both moved to the trash bin, however when I closed the Power Point folder one of the files moved back to the Power Point folder from the trash bin and cannot be deleted.&nbsp; Thanks in advance for any help.&nbsp; In "properties it
 is not checked off as a read only file.

<p>I got it the name of the file I was trying to delete from my desktop folder was "FW_Gotts watch this..." I tried everthing mentioned here but none worked until I used the command window but I still couldn't get it to delete using the command, del FW_Gotts
 watch this... I guess windows has a problem with the ... part of this file name so I ended up using the command del FW* and it worked. just be sure and replace&nbsp;the FW here with the first few letters of the file you are trying to delete. Also make sure there
 are no other files that with the same letters you are using because it will delete them all you will have to use enough letters to make it unique to the file you are trying to delete.</p>

<p>i did this and it worked but the important thing to do is know where your file is located - if you are a novice like me i had t figure out that the file was in my downloads folder so i had to type del c:\downloads - then the prompt said are you sure and
 i typed "y" and it worked</p>

    <title>How about a Personal History DLC&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            How about a Personal History DLC&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>One of the things I liked about the first Mass Effect was that your personal history affected quests.<br />
<br />
A Colonist from Mindoir would encounter Talitha, a Earthborn would meet a member of their old gang and a Spacer would help a person who worked with Shepard's Mom.<br />
<br />
If you picked the Sole Survivor military history you knew Toombs. Were a War Hero and diffusing the bomb on Agebinium becomes more personal because it was you who saved Elysium from the guy who set the trap. If you were Ruthless then Major Kyle was your commanding
 officer.<br />
<br />
Anyway back to the point. Your personal history was pushed to the background in 2 and 3, being reduced to emails and a line or two of dialogue. For me this was a disappointment.<br />
<br />
So how about a DLC that brings a little of that back. As someone who played as a Colonist I was sad to see that Shepard never mentioned Mindoir outside of a line of dialogue in From Ashes, why show so much concern for Earth but almost nothing for her own homeworld.<br />
<br />
What about a DLC where you have to go 'home' to defend an evacuation or help secure the planet from Reaper forces or even worse Slavers looking to take advantage of the chaos for some new stock.<br />
<br />
An Earthborn could get a side-quest on Earth where Shepard could get the help of their old gang if they help bust them out of a Reaper holding camp.<br />
<br />
What about a trip to recover the survivors of a crashed ship which was commanded by Hannah Shepard. Change a line of dialogue from Hackett and we get to meet Shepard's mother.<br />
<br />
In short personal history didn't really matter in ME2 and ME3. I'd love new content that brought it attention again.</p>

<p>I would totally buy that. I don't know how realistic it is though, just because it would have to accommodate for so many different possible backgrounds but if it could be done it would be really cool. I always liked things that were based on the decisions
 you made or the past you selected. Made the game feel more personal to your Shepard instead of a generic overlying story that everyone experiences. Something like this would be very cool.</p>

<p>How so too many? Three backgrounds and three military histories. Six missions in all if they included stuff for the latter.</p>

^^^That's kind of how I feel about it as well. I mean, in ME2 every single squad member had some personal loose end they needed to tie up and Shepard needed to do it in order to earn their loyalty... and the game placed a big emphasis on those missions. In
 fact, not doing a loyalty mission risked losing that squad member in the final fight. Although I suppose some might point out that visiting the crash site of the SR1 had a very personal feeling and was all about Shepard, but it was nothing more than a fetch
 quest.</p>

<p>Yes, this is something that BioWare should do for future DLC's. The only problem would be with the Earth background since Earth is the main Reaper stronghold and once you go to earth you'r already making the final push. However I always Thought that there
 should have been way more earth missions, They spent so much time hyping up earth and from the beginning &nbsp;of ME3 earth was the primary target of the Reapers, and you only get one mission (I know technically it was 2 but you get my piont). So basically if they
 did this you would not get to play the earth back ground till the last missions. I also wanted to see Talitha again, but reading the memorial wall on the Normandy Talitha's dead even from the very first time you get on the Normandy, also reading that Kal'Reegar
 died in a private message was a bummer, I was hoping to do some kind of mission and get him as a squad member. &nbsp;I would also love to see a future DLC to have two or three more missions on each of the main worlds, or least Thessia and Rannoch.

<p>I always wondered why they still have email in ME2 and 3.&nbsp; It's a bit out of date when they have technology like omnitools which can automatically store data just from scanning something&nbsp;and have phaser guns and biotic implants that give you Jedi-style powers.<br />
<br />
But yeah, I'd buy this.</p>

    <title>Windows Explorer Crashes When Transfering iPhone Photos - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Explorer Crashes When Transfering iPhone Photos</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm having an issue with windows explorer. I can access my photos from my iphone, and I can even copy several of them to my computer; however, when I try to copy the entire 3.5gb folder, the transfer will hang. Upon canceling the transfer, it just says "cancelling"
 and won't close until i exit the explorer window with the iphone drive open; this too stops responding, and must be forced to close. The screen flashes and windows explorer restarts. I tried transfering the folder to a portable drive; however, it crashed after
 transfering about 70% of the files. If I leave it alone after it hangs, it eventually says that a device connected to the computer is not functioning. It's the same on an iphone 5 and 5s.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tested copying a large singular file, and also a folder containing several hundred smaller files with no issue. I've also tested several usb ports, including ones that have different drivers, and different usb cables.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that evidence suggests it's an apple related issue, but I'm still curious, and would like to hit this from all angles.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to read this.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for choosing Microsoft forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue may be with iPhone photos folder as you are able to copy other files on the computer and it’s not crashing the explorer and to verify try to copy the iPhone photos folder to other computer and then check for the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1</strong> If you are able to copy the photos to other computer try the following steps.</p>
<p>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7,
 or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to clean boot the system:</p>

<p>
</p><p>For virus scan:</p>
<p>Note: Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</p>
<p>For clean boot:</p>
<p>Note: Refer "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</p>
<p><span>For system restore:</span></p>
<p><span>System Restore disclaimer:<strong> </strong></span>When you use System Restore to restore the computer to a previous state, programs and updates that you installed are removed.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I highly recommend <strong><em>backing up all of your important files and folders onto an external storage device</em></strong> before attempting any type of OS repair or upgrade.</p>

            Windows normally hangs whenever you try to move a file that is larger than the amount of RAM you have available on the machine at the time you do the file transfer.&nbsp; There is no workaround that you can use on a Windows machine to prevent this from happening.&nbsp;
 The only solution is to move your photos in smaller batches.&nbsp; IF you have a Windows 7 machine with 4 gigs of RAM, and with Apple software installed then you probably have so many processes running in the background that you only have about 600 MB of RAM available,
 so you should move the files in 600 MB chunks.

</p><p>I have also been struggling with the 'Import Photos..' setting and have managed to overcome the problem using what you describe above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i had to transfer 2500 photos totalling 6GB from my wife's iPad and both the Photos app and with Import wizard would crash after a few minutes, and so I cautiously split the import into 10 250 photo chunks. Which although time consuming worked.</p>

    <title>Minecraft Xbox One Edition Language Setting Removed - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Minecraft Xbox One Edition Language Setting Removed</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I was wondering if there are any plans on bringing the language option back on Minecraft Xbox One Edition? For some odd reason, it no longer appears in the menu. The only roundabout way to change the game language is to set your xbox console location
 to the country that has the one you want. But there is a catch, since you have to revert it back anyway because the MS store won't work if the locations don't match up with the country you are currently in. According to YouTube vids I have seen on this topic,
 it has been this way since 2017 or some time after.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked the ps4 edition as well to see if something similar had happened, but surprisingly it has kept the option intact. I know the focus is on the bedrock edition nowadays, but it would be nice if this feature could return.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading. :)&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi there, i think this is something you would have to take up with Mojang themselves. I don't honestly know to my knowledge, if Microsoft have anything to do with it. There is a link for Mojang support below, hopefully this helps and you can find out from
 there :) other than that, i would say keep up to date with their social media to see for updates.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Post Windows 10 &#34;November&#34; Update Automatic Color Accent - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> btanis20  say:</h3>
<h2>            Post Windows 10 &#34;November&#34; Update Automatic Color Accent Issues</h2>
                    <p>Greetings everyone! I recently updated my Surface Pro 1 to the latest "Windows 10 November Update," in hopes to address the minor issues that I've been&nbsp;experiencing with Windows 10.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Prior to this major update, I had an issue with the Personalization option, "Automatically pick an accent to match the background," not working correctly to the corresponding wallpaper within the theme. I had to manually toggle that option to make the color
 accents match the background. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Despite updating my computer to this "November" update, I'm&nbsp;STILL having same issues with the colors not automatically changing from different wallpapers. When I click on the Personalization option, within the Settings, it&nbsp;changes the color accents to match
 the background -- but I don't want to keep doing that to make this feature work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to properly address this issue? Is anyone else experiencing the same issue, even after updating to the latest "November" patch? I know this may seem minor, but it's a nice change of pace to see the color of the taskbar, start menu, metro tiles,
 title bars&nbsp;etc. change periodically after using my computer for lengthy sessions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance~</p>

            <p>Hey Ruth, here are the answers to the questions that you have provided:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. My Surface Pro&nbsp;1 is the i5/4 GB/128 GB configuration. The&nbsp;OS edition&nbsp;that's currently on&nbsp;my computing device is Windows 10 Pro; likewise, the OS&nbsp;version is 1511, along with&nbsp;the OS&nbsp;build&nbsp;being at&nbsp;10586.3.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. I don't have any additional antivirus&nbsp;software on my computer, aside from the default "Windows Defender" that&nbsp;gets updated on a daily basis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. The previous OS that I had prior to upgrading to Windows 10 Pro was Windows 8.1 Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully, these responses will aid your research for a solution toward this ongoing "automatic color accent" issue.</p>

            <p>I have the exact same issue on a Asus Transformer Book T100TA.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had this problem after upgrading from 8.1 to 10 via Windows Update, so I wiped everything and tried performing a clean installation (using the new .ISO image post-november update, already including it), but it didn't solve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed this problem afflicts only 32 bit editions of Windows 10. Everything is fine on my 64 bit installation on the other laptop.<br />
<br />
Which edition do you have on your Surface Pro 1?</p>

            Yes I've already read of this workaround somewhere else, I just prefere to give up accent colors automatic adjustment rather than the animations.<br />
<br />
I also noticed that the settings "don't run presentation while in battery mode" is always disabled, and when enabled it just doesn't stay that way the next time you open it.

            <p>That's interesting to hear that your 32-bit ASUS Transformer Book has&nbsp;the issue, whereas, the 64-bit laptop is automatically changing the accent color, hassle-free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Surface Pro 1 is 64-bit, and unfortunately, I'm having the same issue with color accents like your 32-bit Transformer Book.</p>

            <p>So it's not an architecture related problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Could it be that, when syncing the theme across different computers with the same Microsoft account, the problem doesn't happen in the "master computer" (the one where the theme settings have been created) but only in the "slave computers" (where the settings
 get synced via MS account)?<br />
<br />
I'm gonna try creating a new local account on the ASUS Transformer and see if it has the problem.</p>

            The battery mode checkbox does not reflect the current state, true.&nbsp; That's a bug.&nbsp; It will set it the right way, but when you view the page it will tend to default to Off even if the setting is not off.&nbsp; The right people are aware.

<h2>            Background Downloads Broken&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Recently, for about 2 months or so, background downloads has not been working for me. When I turn my xbox off there is no blinking green light or humming of my xbox and my downloads do not download. I've double and triple checked, and my background downloads
 option <em>is </em>enabled. Does anyone else have this problem?</p>

<p>I have this problem with the slim console, since using the built in wifi. For background downloads to work i need to connect the ethernet cable. It won't work with wifi. Once console turned off it just turns off, Doesn't even try back dl. Was thinking of

<p>It could be something with your wi-fi connection / router and nothing with the actual background download. I haven't had any issues with background downloading and I've been using the 360 Slim for over a year now and I only use the wi-fi connection, not
 ethernet cable.</p>

<p>I have so many wifi devices in my house it probably confuses the poor router. I do need to check that the firmware of the thing is updated. I don't have many other issues with any other devices, except for the Ipad, but that's a whole other soapbox. Go the

<h2>            Can&#39;t find advanced Vista file search from Start Button</h2>
                    I want to search for a phrase in a .doc file that I know I have updated in the past two months.&nbsp; Vista File Folder advanced search does not let me give this much detail (used to do it in XP.)<br />
<br />
I have read there is supposed to be an advanced Search option on the sidebar (not the bottom) of the Start button but I don't have that option.<br />
<br />
I'd appreciate your help in finding this "big search" as "Windows Vista for Dummies" calls it.<br />
<br />
I'm running Vista Home Premium 64-bit.

    <title>Replaced Surface Pro Was Returned Without Keyboard Attachment - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Replaced Surface Pro Was Returned Without Keyboard Attachment</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>A few weeks back I sent my Surface Pro 3 in for service. I had to get a replacement because the Surface was irreparable. I realize now I sent it in with the keyboard attachment still attached. I received my replacement Surface Pro, but the old keyboard attachment
 was nowhere to be found, and neither is a new one. There is no information regarding what may have happened to it. I've tried contacting Microsoft, but it's almost impossible to talk to a real person unless I want to pay $29 for a phone call (which is ridiculous
 considering they are the ones who are not returning the keyboard). Is there anything I can do or any way to contact a real representative?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I keep getting the message "Album artwork can't be changed when a song from the album is in use. Please try again later." within Windows Media Player on Windows 8.1. This only happens on one particular album. I've edited the album artwork on this album before
 and never had a problem. I recently added three songs to the album that I purchased from Amazon and now this message keeps popping up every time I attempt to change the album artwork even though the player is idle. Any ideas anyone?</p>

            <p>Hi - I usually only get this message when I am adding art to files in wav. format (but then when I navigate away the artwork 'takes' anyway - also I'm on W7 ).<br />
If it is only the one album that is affected and you have&nbsp;obtained tracks from different sources, I'd be inclined to think that it is a file or properties issue. Do you have any CD-RWs available - or a spare CD-R you are not concerned about using up? - R.</p>

            Fortunately I do. I may just have to burn that album and re-rip it into my library again. Just wanted to see if there are any work arounds before I do that though.

            <p>You spotted where I was heading there!</p>
<p>It may still be possible to do something by putting all the tracks together away from WMP (a folder in 'my documents' would be OK) - make sure all the correct properties are in place and then add those back to the album folder. Are all the files mp3 format?</p>

            <p>When you are happy copy the 'new' tracks one at a time into the existing folder and it should give you the 'there is already a file with this name' dialogue box...select 'copy and replace' - that way the WMP library won't need sorting out afterwards...and
 when all the tracks are in try adding the artwork again.</p>
<p>Otherwise its probably a choice of rebuilding the library database or just going for the CD rip option!</p>
<p>Hope you get there - R.</p>

            Step 7 would be especially tricky.<br />
<br />
I have never replaced a hal.dll file in my life to solve this problem and often see here in the forums folks say to copy (or expand) the hal.dl_ from the Windows installation CD is their answer.&nbsp;
<i>Extremely </i>unlikely.<br />
<br />
Here's why that is going to be a challenge:<br />
<br />
You probably don't want the hal.dl_ file from the XP installation CD and here's why:<br />
<br />
When XP gets installed, it selects and expands the proper hal.dll from seven possibilities of compressed hal.dll files on the installation CD:<br />
<br />
You can check the size of the file using the Recovery Console for clues if you are intent on replacing it first.<br />
<br />
Possibilities of hal.dlls to expand from the XP installation CD:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Size on XP CD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expanded<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;53,248 HAL.DL_&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 105,344&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;47,091 HALAACPI.DL_&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 131,840&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;40,194 HALACPI.DL_&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 81,152<br />
&nbsp;51,368 HALAPIC.DL_&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 150,528<br />
&nbsp;48,531 HALMACPI.DL_&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 134,400 <br />
&nbsp;52,563 HALMPS.DL_&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 152.576 <br />
&nbsp;37,780 HALSP.DL_&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 77,696<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299340/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299340/</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
<br />
Size On XP Disk&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Expanded<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;53,248 HAL.DL_&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 105,344&nbsp; (generic for things like VMWare)&nbsp; 5.1.2600.5512 (xpsp.080413-2111)<br />
&nbsp;47,091 HALAACPI.DL_&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 131,840&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (likely for some systems and laptops)<br />
&nbsp;40,194 HALACPI.DL_&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 81,152<br />
&nbsp;51,368 HALAPIC.DL_&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 150,528<br />
&nbsp;48,531 HALMACPI.DL_&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 134,400&nbsp; (likely for more robust systems)<br />
&nbsp;52,563 HALMPS.DL_&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 152.576&nbsp; (multiprocessor - more than 1 CPU)<br />
&nbsp;37,780 HALSP.DL_&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 77,696<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Each one of those can expand into a hal.dll file, so if it is your intent to replace your hal.dll, you would have to either figure out or know in advance which one is the right one for your hardware, motherboard and CPU.&nbsp; If you just picked one at random, you
 would have a one in seven chance (14%) of getting the correct one.&nbsp; Maybe you will get lucky.<br />
<br />
If you just expand the hal.dl_ from the XP installation CD, that is the simplest, most generic of all the choices (probably not the right one).<br />
<br />
The hal.dl_ file on the CD is the most boring of them all:<br />
<br />
HAL.DL_<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Standard PC<br />
<br />
<br />
That is a good choice for some virtual machines where there is no real "hardware" (like VMWare), but it is a very poor choice for most other environments, but people keep suggesting it.<br />
<br />
You system may in fact boot with it, but you will be missing a lot of functionality that is built in to the other hal.dll files.<br />
<br />
For example, if I wanted to replace the hal.dll file on one system here, I would need to expand this file to become hal.dll:<br />
<br />
HALMACPI.DL_<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Standard PC<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) PC<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * ACPI Multiprocessor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * MPS Multiprocessor<br />
<br />
<br />
If I wanted to replace the hal.dll file on another system here, I would need to expand this file to become hal.dll:<br />
<br />
HALAACPI.DL_<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Standard PC<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * Advanced Configuration and Power Interface (ACPI) PC<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * ACPI Uniprocessor<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * ACPI Multiprocessor<br />
<br />
<br />
One of those two are what you will probably find on most modern systems desktops/laptops.<br />
<br />
If you check the Properties, Internal Name of the hal.dll on your working system, you can see which kind of hal.dll file you have and it is probably<br />
not going to be just "hal.dll" (check yours and see).&nbsp; So if you expanded your hal.dl_, you would have a big problem...<br />
<br />
If the thought is that you need to replace your hal.dll because your system was complaining that the hal.dll file was missing or corrupt, the message is usually misleading and the real problem is usually the boot.ini file and has nothing to do with the hal.dll
 file. <br />
<br />
Sometimes XP just can't find the file because the file system is corrupted and you just need to run chkdsk /r from the XP Recovery Console so XP can find the file again.&nbsp; Always start with that first, since even trying to rebuild the boot.ini doesn't make sense
 if the file system is corrupted.<br />
<br />
I would always start with a chkdsk /r first (it will not hurt to run chkdsk /r even if it finds nothing to do), then take a look at the boot.ini file.<br />
<br />
This is also why when folks trying to help give you instructions to put in your XP CD and expand the hal.dl_ file to replace yours, it is generally weak advice from a well meaning novice.&nbsp; It is a noble effort and a good thoought but unlikely to work.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The hal.dl_ file on the XP installation CD is the least likely to be the right choice of the possible hal.dll files on the CD.<br />
<br />
The second problem with that advice is most people do not have an XP installation CD to begin with, so you need to come up with some other plan if you<br />
are compelled to replace the hal.dll file (floppy, USB device, etc.)<br />
<br />
That kind of help is usually going to be very wrong - although it sort of makes sense at first and is "logical", but it will never work out favorably and that is generally not the problem anyway.&nbsp; You can learn about all the different hal.dll files on the XP
 installation CD and then figure out which one is the right one for your system, but the fact is that the hal.ddl is probably not really missing or corrupt - and you can check in Recovery Console first<br />
instead of just trying to replace it and hope you get the right one.<br />
<br />
I have never needed to replace a hal.dll file to resolve this issue - that is never really the problem.<br />
