<h2>            How to move Redeemed Games onto another account&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I Want to sell my xbox one and when i bought the console it came with two redeem codes for Quantum Break and Alan wake. both games are installed on my xbox one on my account. now, obviously i want to wipe my account off of the xbox one before i send it to
 the person who has bought it but how can i give them the games when they're on my account? is there any way to transfer the games from my account onto another account? or can i be given another code seeing as i have bought the games once already? or will the
 same two codes still work after being used once?</p>

<p>With digital content, there is no way to give it to another person once it's been redeemed to your account and there would be no way to get a new code once they are redeemed. Nothing can be transferred between accounts and the codes are one time use only.</p>

            <p>Hi John,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please find answers to your questions below.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1: Yes you can delete Windows 8.1 System image backup because it will not work in Windows 10.</p>
<p>2: Yes it does overwrite the older copies just like Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Refer the steps below to set up system image backup in Windows 10.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>A <strong>system image</strong> is an exact copy of all system disks which can be used to restore your PC to the state it was in at the time the image was made. By default, a system image only includes the drives that Windows requires to run, including Windows

<p>Thank you for quick reply, but how do I "Choose Disks &amp; Partitions"? When I go into Control panel I select "System Image Backup" &amp; get the box "Back up now" which I click onto. I get no message to select Disks/Partitions.</p>

<p>It took maximum of 2 seconds!</p>

<p>
</p><p>I apologize for the delay in response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description provided, I understand that the Windows scheduled Backup is not working properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To be able to assist you better, provide us a few more details on the below questions.</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Does the same issue occur if you try to save the backup on to an external storage device (USB/HDD) ?</li><li>Are you connected to a Domain Network?</li><li>Did you check if the issue if the location you chose to save back up in network is available during the time the back up is scheduled to work?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial recommendation, I suggest you to follow the below steps to check the status of
<strong>Volume Shadow Copy service and SPP services</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Note: You must be logged on as an administrator to perform these steps.</span></span><span>
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span><span>Press the windows key + R to open the Run Command Utility. Type in
<strong>services.msc </strong>and press Enter to open the Windows Services console.</span></span></li><li><span><span>If the <span><strong>SPP</strong></span> service is disabled, double-click it to open the service properties.</span></span></li><li><span><span>If <strong>Volume Shadow Copy</strong> service is disabled, double-click it to open the service properties
</span></span></li><li><span><span>Click the <span><strong>Startup type</strong></span> list, click <span>
<strong>Automatic (Delayed Start)</strong></span>, and then click <span><strong>Apply</strong></span>.</span></span></li><li><span><span>Under <span><strong>Service status</strong></span>, click <span><strong>Start</strong></span>.</span></span></li></ul>

    <title>No Preview Thumbnails for AVI Files - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rudy rucker  say:</h3>
<h2>            No Preview Thumbnails for AVI Files</h2>
                    
<p>I'm using 64 bit Windows 7.&nbsp; I'm creating some AVI animations with the Ultra Fractal fractal exploration software.&nbsp; These AVI files don't show thumbnail preview images in Windows Explorer, they just show a default image of a piece of film.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems that if I edit my AVI file into a WMV movie file using Windows Live Movie Maker, then I do see thumbnail images for the source AVI files in Windows Explorer from then on.&nbsp; But I'd like to see the previews by default.</p>
<p>Note that I DO see preview thumbnails for most (but not all) files that are in the Quicktime MOV format.&nbsp; And I DO see preview thumnails for all files in the MPG format.&nbsp; But not for the AVI files.</p>

            Hi Sandy.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I will give you steps to both manage smaller drive storage and perform version Updates on them manually by the most stable method that requires much less space than Windows Update.  
<br />
<br />First here are tips here for managing smaller drives: 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows/more-space-how-windows-10s-storage-analysis-helps-you-free-up-your-hard-drive.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3040404/windows...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-storage-Space-low-capacity-windows-10-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/maximize-stora...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2017/jan/05/what-is-the-best-way-to-deal-with-windows-10-updates-on-a-32gb-netbook" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/...</a>
<br />
<br />As more space becomes needed, you can offload User folders (Documents, Music, Pictures, etc) to another drive as shown in this tutorial, which will not affect speed if C is on an SSD and the other drive is not:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-users-folder-location-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/1964-move-u...</a>.  I would not move program files or speed will be affected.
<br />
<br />This should make enough space to install Windows Updates.  But for now I'd focus on the latest Version 1803 since successfully installing it will bring along all Windows Updates and also resolves almost all other problems since it reinstalls Windows keeping your files and programs in place. 
<br />
<br />Install the Media Creation Tool on another PC to create bootable media or download the ISO to stick or disk, transfer it back to the target PC to open the media or click to mount the ISO, right click Setup file to Run as Administrator.  This avoids needing the space to download the Upgrade and it's staging files.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />If the  Upgrade Assistant  has already been installed by WIndows Update then I'd remove it and it's staging files first to recover that space:
<br />
<br />First turn off Windows Update service to regain control:
<br />
<br />Type services.msc in Start Search,  Open Services applet.
<br />
<br />Scroll Down to Windows Update Service and click on it, Stop service and set to Disabled.  Now it should clear the queue of Version and other Updates until you turn it back on and Check again.
<br />
<br />Uninstall Upgrade Assistant In Settings &gt; Apps &amp; Features.  
<br />
<br />Clear out any Upgrade folders in C: drive root including C:\$Windows.~BT.  Restart PC, try Upgrade again.
<br />
<br />Another option is to do the the best possible Clean Install in this link which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.  
<br /> 
<br />This will give you back all but 15gb of the drive so you can slowly reinstall programs to see how they affect performance, move your files to another drive if possible or offline into OneDrive in the cloud with On-demand access to them only:  <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows/onedrive-files-on-demand-how-to-enable-it-in-windows-10-fall-creators-update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pcworld.com/article/3233488/windows...</a>.
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also turn off or block Updates if they are bothering you.  
<br />
<br />There are ways to block Updates here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninstall-and-block-updates-and-drivers-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/223864/how-to-uninsta...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want you can set a Metered Connection per the above tutorial, then when ready turn it off to install Updates.  You can even wait until the twice-yearly Version Updates to run manually from Media Creation Tool which is a more stable method than Windows Update and includes all previous updates rolled into it.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>

<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved

            Hi Sandy, does your device have 32GB (28GB usable) of internal storage (hard drive space)
<br />
<br />If so, you would be amazed how many users with 32GB of internal storage ask the exact same question here every day . . . 
<br />
<br />Honestly, there is only one answer,  backup your data and perform a clean install of the 32Bit version of Windows 10 a- that will give you more internal storage space - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. You will then have enough space for the next year of Windows 10 updates and your system will be faster . .. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything, however you will not have enough space to create the bootable Windows 10 media, you will need to do that on another working PC
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

                    <span>Hi Karthik TP, I am having the same problem, however I believe it is a virus. Probably&nbsp;root kit. I have a Toshiba 32bit with windows 7. My hard drive c/ is full, and constantly notifies me with a red x icon at the top left corner of the notification
 pop up. I am pretty sure that I don't really have it overloaded, because the notification just popped up one day.&nbsp;Avg doesn't notice it.&nbsp;When I ran windows defender, and did an update scan it gave me an error 0x80070070. It states it cannot download the update
 because there is not enough space on the disk. I tried to download Norton to see if it can remove it and provide another virus protection. The virus would not let it download. My desk top blacks out with no picture, and my external hard drive acts funny too.
 It will not play many of the movies I have saved on to it. This has been going on for a while and I really could use some help. I am willing to remove the virus myself although I have never done that. If you can give me specific&nbsp;instructions&nbsp;I will follow
 them to a T.</span>

            <p>Windows Defender is disabled (to avoid potential conflicts)&nbsp;by AVG, MSE, McAfee, Norton and several other antimalware programs.</p>
<p>You don't need to install another AV product.&nbsp; </p>
<p><span>You should never have more than one security product installed on the PC providing active protection/scanning. This can cause performance issues, system instability and conflicts between programs, and can hinder the effectiveness all installed antivirus
 products. Even if you attempt to have more than one product installed, with one active and another disabled, the disabled product will likely still have active components and/or drivers installed that will conflict with the other installed AV program.
</span></p>
<p><span>If you're using AVG as your antimalware provider and are infected, suggest you seek assistance from AVG Support:

</span></span>The prompt<span>&nbsp; </span>asks if you want to <em><span>Start&nbsp;trial</span></em> or
<em><span>Decline</span></em>.&nbsp; To get the free version (without real-time scanning or web site blocking features) you need to choose
<em><span>Decline.<span>&nbsp; </span></span></em><span>You may need to rename the installation file to 123.exe or something similar to prevent the malware from disabling/blocking the installation.</span></span></p>

    <title>Action Center Maintenance does not offer option to View Problems to - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bea-j  say:</h3>
<h2>            Action Center Maintenance does not offer option to View Problems to Report</h2>
                    <p>Running 8.1 and have a query regarding how to set Action Center to give the option to view problem reports and choose which ones to send.&nbsp; I've had a search through previous posted queries, but didn't find anything that seemed to fit.&nbsp; Apologies if this
 has been discussed previously.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>In Action Center, under 'Maintenance' and 'Check for Solutions to Problem Reports', prior to a complete reinstall of Windows (restore to factory settings), I used to be notified if an error occurred and given the option to choose which reports to send to
 Microsoft.&nbsp; Currently I have the setting 'Each time a problem occurs, ask me before checking for solutions'.&nbsp; This was the option I had as well before the restore to factory settings.&nbsp; As noted, at this point, I used to be notified if there was a problem.&nbsp;
 However now although through 'View Reliability History' and then 'View All Problem Reports' that there are some problem reports, Action Center now always&nbsp;only reports 'No Issues Detected'.&nbsp; Even if a new&nbsp;problem report has been generated it doesn't flag anything
 up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought perhaps this may be related to whether Windows Error Reporting Service was running or not and, following the instructions on another post about error reporting problems,&nbsp;checked this service.&nbsp; It was stopped and was set to Manual.&nbsp; Have started
 Windows Error Reporting Service and set it&nbsp;to start Automatically.&nbsp; This doesn't seem to have solved the issue - no issues notified under 'Maintenance' (i.e. no option to view problem reports)&nbsp;or on the Action Center flag in the Notification area.&nbsp; This still
 says 'No Issues Detected'.&nbsp; I also tested it by manually starting and stopping a Windows Defender scan - clicking cancel on a Defender scan generates an error report.&nbsp; But still there is the same message 'No issues detected'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did wonder whether the reason that Action Center is not offering me the option to view errors to report is because the ones generated thus far since the reinstall are not critical enough to be sent to Microsoft.&nbsp; Of course I can try sending all the errors
 via 'check for solutions', but whilst I don't understand all of them, one is related to the computer installing a default driver for a peripheral, and it doesn't really need to be sent.&nbsp; Neither where I have stopped a Defender scan (I wouldn't normally do
 this and&nbsp;carry out regular scans, this was just for test&nbsp;purposes)&nbsp;.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Overall, it doesn't seem&nbsp;a critical error to me and I can change the settings to send reports automatically, but just trying to get the computer working as I think it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>

<p style="text-align: justify"><span>I can certainly understand your concern. I would like to inform you that the links provided are applicable even to windows
 7/8/8.1 as the procedure remains the same. However, you can click Open Action Center to view more detail and recent messages about your computer’s status but it doesn’t tell you exactly what’s doing behind the scene.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>Open Action Center, under Maintenance tab, expand the tab you will see a section about “Automatic Maintenance”. All you see

<p style="text-align: justify"><span>While maintenance is running, you can go to the newly enhanced Task Manager to take a peek at which processor on your machine

            <p>Namratha,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your advice.&nbsp; I followed your suggestions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: I ran the System Maintenance and it was reported that 'No changes or updates were necessary'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: I reset the Action Centre Maintenance Settings - Clicked on 'Change Action Centre Settings', removed the ticks from all the Action Centre Settings under 'Security Messages' and 'Maintenance Messages'.&nbsp; Restarted the computer.&nbsp; Repeated the step
 and put ticks back in all the boxes.&nbsp; Restarted the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 3: Changed the Problem Reporting settings to 'Never check for solutions', restarted the computer and then changed them back to 'Each time a problem occurs, ask me before checking for solutions'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also ran the Maintenance programme (took approx. 2.5 hrs).&nbsp; Automatic Maintenance runs quite regularly.&nbsp; If I leave the computer turned on for any length of time during the day and the computer is idle,&nbsp;it runs automatically&nbsp;every couple of hours and seems
 to take&nbsp;just takes a few minutes.&nbsp; I hope this is normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately this action has not solved the problem.&nbsp;In Action Centre, under Maintenance, 'Check for Solutions to Problem Reports' is 'On'.&nbsp; However even when I can see unreported problems, which I reach via 'View Reliability History' -&gt; 'View all problem
 reports', Action Centre does not notify me that there are unreported problems.&nbsp; Under 'Check for Solutions to Problem Reports' I do&nbsp;have the option to 'Check for Solutions' and by clicking on 'Check for solutions' I can submit the problem reports to Microsoft.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am still not seeing though a&nbsp;message highlighted in orange (I think), titled
<strong>Check for Solutions to Unreported Problems</strong>, when there are unreported problems on the list of Problem Reports.&nbsp; This message then gave me the option to 'Check for Solution' (I think a grey button), 'View Problems to report' (blue text) or 'Ignore
 this message' (blue text).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the problem is that I am not being given this option and I am trying to work out why I no longer receive it after the factory reset.&nbsp; If I have set Action Center problem reporting settings to ask me before checking for solutions I believed it should&nbsp;give&nbsp;me&nbsp;the

<p>I&nbsp;have been getting&nbsp;a warning in orange to send security report to Microsoft for three days now but each time it fails to send it completely. I do the troubleshooting and it says it has fixed a security reporting issue, but then when I try to respond to
 the warning again it still fails again. To be sure it wasn't a virus blocking the report I used the virus &amp; malware removal tool and ran usual scans but they came back clear with no issues. Yet using trouble shooting in Action centre continues to warn me of
 problems and fixes them in trouble shooting. I feel like I am going round and round in circles and very nervous about using my laptop.</p>

    <title>No screen saver at Windows 7 welcome&#47;log in screen. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> akumasi  say:</h3>
<h2>            No screen saver at Windows 7 welcome&#47;log in screen.</h2>
                    Hello all, I just installed Windows 7 Professional 64-bit and I noticed that once the computer is turned on and sitting at the welcome screen (There are 3 users on this computer), it will continue to show that screen and never go to a screen saver. I used
 to have Vista and I remember that it would eventually engage the screen saver even while at the welcome screen, but so far on 7 I have not seen this happen. Does anyone know if this is by design or if there are some settings that can be changed in order to
 set this up? I found an old article about adjusting these settings in XP and Vista, however the registry string it references does not appear to be in the 7 registry. Any help would be appreciated.

            <p>Hello,<br />
<br />
You can enable the logon screensaver by adding a couple of registry values.<br />
<br />
One of the problems that you have is that Direct3D support is not enabled on the login screen which means you can't use any of the Windows 7 stock screensavers.&nbsp; With this in mind you can either download one of your choosing from the web or grab the LOGON.SCR
 file from a Vista machine.&nbsp; The file will be in C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32 - copy it to the same location on your Windows 7 machine.<br />
<br />
Now, open the registry editor and go to HKEY_USERS \ .Default \ Control Panel \ Desktop<br />
<br />
Below this key create the following REG_SZ values...</p>
<p>SCRNSAVE.EXE = C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\LOGON.SCR (or whatever your file is called).<br />
ScreenSaveActive = 1<br />
ScreenSaveIsSecure = 0<br />
ScreenSaveTimeOut = 60 (or whatever timeout you want in seconds)</p>
<p>That's it - you'll have your screensaver at the logon screen then.&nbsp; If you need any help let me know in the comments section below.<br />
<br />
I know that I'm talking about editing the registry here and i'm assuming you know how to do this.&nbsp; If you don't, let me know and I can send you a .REG file for example which will do this for you.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps!<br />
Jon<br />

            <p>15. UPGRADES. To use upgrade software, you must first be licensed for the software that is eligible for the upgrade. Upon upgrade, this agreement takes the place of the agreement for the software you upgraded from. After you upgrade, you may no longer use
 the software you upgraded from</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Full version (Retail):</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upgrade version (Retail):</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>OEM :</p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>This will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous based qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail Windows 10 license.</p>

            <p>&nbsp;It appears I need to add to my earlier post that it's best to start&nbsp;removing startup programs&nbsp;a few at a time, and try to do it with programs you know what they are.&nbsp; Some of the things I look for to remove&nbsp;are Quicken, MS Office, programs that play music
 (e.g. Winamp &amp; Real player), anything from Adobe.&nbsp; Things I usually leave in (in addition to my antivirus software of course)&nbsp;are hardware related like my touchpad, video, and audio, and my DVD/CD related stuff which needs to be there when I want to burn discs.&nbsp;
 This is not an all inclusive list, but hopefully you get the idea.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;In general when making changes, change a little at a time to make sure you haven't messed something up.&nbsp;&nbsp;Run for a while,&nbsp;then if everything looks OK, make a few more changes if needed.&nbsp; That way if something goes wrong, it's a lot easier to find the problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I hope that clarifies anything I might've neglected to mention in my earlier post.</p>

<h2>            Cant change windows live id.</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My current email address isn't a windows live account, i used my old high school email when i first signed up with xbox live, and when i try to change it i get this message: "The email address or password you entered isn't valid. Please try again". This
 happens at the final stage, after I already had signed in to my new windows live account. I tried to call my region (norway) they said I had to register a new windows live account. This I have tried like 10 times now, but nothing works.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>At this moment I think the best thing to do is call Xbox Support again and explain what you have already tried and&nbsp;let them tell you the steps on what to do and execute them with them still on the phone, so they can advise you along the way.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Good day and welcome to Skype Community!</p>
<p>
</p><p>By default, all Skype subscriptions have recurring payments. You may cancel it anytime by following the steps below:
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1881/how-do-i-cancel-or-change-my-skype-subscription?q=cancel+subscription" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Click here</a>. When you cancel your subscription, it will continue to be active until the expiration date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Based on your account, it looks like what you have is Skype Credits which became inactive. Skype Credit will go inactive after 180 days of no use. Make sure you place a call (outside your subscription, if you have one) or send a text every 180 days.
</p>
<p>But don't you worry, you have an option to reactivate these inactive Skype Credits, please refer to this link for the steps on how you can reactivate it:
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA10378/how-do-i-reactivate-skype-credit?q=reactivate+credits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Click here</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For you to delete your account, we have a support page with the steps on how you can do it:
<a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA142/how-do-i-close-my-account-for-skype?q=delete+account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Click here</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Note: </strong>Your account will be closed after 60 days but you can change your mind any time during the 60 days. All you have to do is sign into your account again to cancel the closure.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this answers your query.</p>

<p>Thank you for your efficient comeback.</p>
<p>Its a pleasure to not be ignored on-line these days. XXXX</p>
<p>If you consult the account records you may note no Skype use for some 4 years, but my Credit Card continues to be drawn on for monthly subs. XXXXX Why? XXXXX</p>
<p>Disappointment #2:&nbsp;The action guide to delete Skype is welcome but how to I get to the delete page? The menu offered at sign in does not seem to include the Cancel Subscription choice?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Skype did not answer directly but just kept forwarding the same generic message as above.</p>
<p>I phoned my Credit Card Co., who confirmed its cancelation of payment in Jun'17.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other problem is that I am unable to remove the programme from my laptop as Skype continue to advise that the software has been superseded and cannot be deleted. To delete the Skype I am told that I have to download a more up&nbsp;to date software. What kind
 of ... is this?</p>

<h2>            How to close a back door &#47; open port</h2>
                    For PCI compliance, I'm told I need to fix an "open port" something about SNMP?&nbsp; We use 2 home computers, both new HPs with a Homegroup setup and a wireless router also, both running Windows 7.&nbsp; Any guidance to talk me through fixing this would be appreciated.<br />

<h2>            &#34;Setup could not read the CD you inserted, or the CD is not a valid Windows CD&#34;</h2>
                    Well I was going to install a Windows XP operating system. It's an upgrade disk. However, when I tried,I get an error message saying:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>"Setup could not read the CD you inserted, or the CD is not a valid Windows CD", and it gives me a list of other operating systems.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>It's a new computer so it doesn't have any previous operating system.&nbsp;</div>
<div>The manual said I can do a new installation but it's not allowing me to, as I get that error message. Any ideas?</div>
                </div>

            <p><span>Hi Branden,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It is quite possible that the CD you are trying to use is damaged. Wipe the disc using a clean cloth.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Also, it may be due to the fact that you are using an upgrade CD and you are trying to do a clean installation.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you have any earlier version Windows CD?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If so, you may have to first install the previous version and then upgrade to Windows XP.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
