<h2>            My Desktop thinks it&#39;s a notebook...</h2>
                    I have an Acer AX1700-U3793A desktop pc with Vista Home Premium 64bit installed.<br />
<br />
This pc was purchased on May 6, 2009 and from day one there is a battery icon in the tray. Also in Power Options &gt; Change plan settings, there are two colums labled "ON battery" and "Plugged in" each having 2 drop-down boxes "Turn off the display" and "Put
 the computer to sleep". This is a desktop pc, why should the battery options be displayed? My wife has an identical pc which was purchased at the same time and it does not have this battery options displayed.
<br />
On another forum, I asked this question and was told that if I have the pc plugged into a UPS this battery icon and power option display is normal. I don't know what they were smoking, but this is not causing it as we both have seperate UPS's and her pc does
 not have this problem. <br />
I called Acer and they will not give me any help. <br />
I think it may be some registry key issue or something. Any ideas?<br />
<br />
BTW, I tried to install SP2 and it would not let me continue. It said I was on battery power, duh!!! this is a desktop...<br />

<p>N7AS,<br />
There are features in Vista for desktop PC's that are connected to a UPS that closely resemble mobile PC's.&nbsp; However, in your case, it does sound like maybe your desktop came with a version of Vista that was meant for a laptop.&nbsp; If you can not convince Acer
 to&nbsp;send you a new version of Vista for your desktop, you can turn off the power management features so that it does not interfere with your normal activities.&nbsp; Below are some links to some articles that will help you setup and / or change the power scheme
 on your computer to fit your needs.<br />

    <title>SCREWED Samsung all in one, useless after windows 10 update - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            SCREWED Samsung all in one, useless after windows 10 update</h2>
                    <p>My wife's computer (which of course makes this 100x worse) recently updated, then restarted, but remained at the Black Screen of death for hours, then a pointer began showing...so I figured eventually things would come around. The Num lock and mouse both
 worked. So I wait and restarted a few times since nothing changed for a day or so. Eventually the entire start up screen showed up and I was able to log in. Next came the normal desktop with all icons (so I thought, Cool, it's coming back to life, wrong)</p>
<p>Now no matter what I click on, eventually (after hours of a spinning indicator) I get a "Windows unresponsive, continue to wait or cancel"</p>
<p>or something close to that. </p>
<p>I have gotten into the bio setup screen and enabled extended boot, so I could try getting into safe mode, it has never happened. So, I have a computer loaded with all my wife's data, pics, programs etc, which is useless.</p>
<p>One more thing, I once got task manager to run :) &nbsp;Looked for an app that was not responding, nothing in there ????</p>
<p>All I really want to do is restore to an earlier time, but this seems impossible. Please offer a solution ?
</p>
<p>I tried MS paid tech Support, the guy there eventually said "We offer new computers for sale here" I said a few obscenities,(privately) and disconnected the live chat (chatting from my good computer)
</p>
<p>BTW This computer is about one year old, has a large touchscreen and was upgraded from windows 8.1 to 10.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>System Restore copies being Deleted by Microsoft Windows 7 64 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aeneas32  say:</h3>
<h2>            System Restore copies being Deleted by Microsoft Windows 7 64 developers intentionally</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>The following error message is displayed in &nbsp;//Computer_Management//Event_Viewer//Windows_Logs//System// :</p>
<p>"The shadow copies of volume C: were deleted because the shadow copy storage could not grow in time.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Consider reducing the IO load on the system or choose a shadow copy storage volume that is not being shadow copied." .</p>
<p>This error seems to be related to the destruction of vital System Restore backups.</p>
<p>On my system there has been at least 200 GBytes of storage available Free at all times.</p>
<p>When will Microsoft kernel developers stop intentionally destroying System Restore copies,</p>
<p>thus exposing Windows users to unrecoverable virus danger ?</p>
<p>Windows Restore copies should Never be destroyed intentionally.</p>
<p>Any Microsoft developers&nbsp;involved in this intentional Windows sabotage &nbsp;should be Fired.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There needs to be a US Congressional investigation into the intentional harm of Windows users by Microsoft Windows engineers who are intentionally deleting System Restore Points in order to endanger the users' systems as well as the Internet in general,</p>
<p>by preventing the user from using the Restore feature to restore their Windows system back to a healthy context before a virus or other Windows Bug failure beset their system.</p>
<p>After at least 4 years that this 'Bug' has existed, going back to Windows Vista, it is clear that Microsoft wants this situation to continue regardless of how much danger it generates to users and the Internet at large.</p>

Microsoft needs to Fire all of their technical support workers who pervade</p>
<p>this forum and peddle useless tips which have nothing to do with addressing this serious BUG&nbsp;in Windows recovery operations (and other bugs), then post false claims that these questions are "Answered" .</p>
<p>These people are responsible for Bugs like this one persisting for at least 4 years</p>
<p>(i.e. going back to Windows Vista) .</p>
<p>This is one of the most serious Bugs in Windows, and since it deals with security from viruses and other Windows OS failures, it should hold the absolute highest priority to be reported to the appropriate Microsoft Windows&nbsp;engineering manager and Fixed.</p>
<p>Fixed, or that engineering manager is Fired and replaced.</p>
<p>1 month is too long for an engineering manager to fail to fix this Bug and yet
</p>
<p>remain in his job.</p>

<p>Another related error message which again reports that a Microsoft Windows software engineer is deleting Windows Restore copies intentionally:</p>

<p>Users do not seek to "reclaim" storage. The Windows OS may do this but this has nothing</p>
<p>to do with the User. Regardless of what the OS is attempting to accomplish here,</p>
<p>for the OS to whimsically Delete critical files representing the Restore Points</p>

<p>I have provided detailed information documenting a pattern of behavior of the Windows kernel</p>
<p>which deletes System Restore points for no good reason.</p>
<p>===============================================</p>
<p>There is also a possible corruption aspect to this issue, because there are outside 3rd party</p>
<p>software Windows Restore utility developers which are making money precisely because
</p>
<p>System Restore for many Windows users, does not work.</p>
<p>Could these 3rd party companies be taking Micrososft Windows developers to dinner</p>
<p>and persuading them to whimsically delete these System Restore points</p>
<p>in return for the old John Gotti manila envelope ?&nbsp;&nbsp; (i.e. cash bribes).</p>
<p>================================================</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another related Bug:</p>
<p>it is possible on these forums for the Microsoft paid technical support workers</p>
<p>to mark a question as being "Answered", when the question is absolutely</p>
<p>nowhere near being answered.</p>
<p>I would request that the software controlling this forum restrict the ability</p>
<p>to mark a question as "Answered"&nbsp; to only the person who posted the question</p>
<p>in the first place.</p>
<p>If necessary, send the question poster an email periodically, requesting he return to the forum</p>
<p>and mark the question "Answered", if he believes the question has been answered.</p>

    <title>Paying too much for Skype to landline calls - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> edhassall  say:</h3>
<h2>            Paying too much for Skype to landline calls</h2>
                    I've just bought some Skype credit (4.99 UK pounds) and for the first time have tried to call some landlines for a few seconds to see how much I'm being charged. I was very surprised to see that I'm being charged about 40 cents a minute (i.e. 30+ pence),
 instead of 2.&nbsp; I set up my skype account in Singapore about 3 years ago and now live in Brunei.&nbsp; The first 2 calls I made were to my own landline in Brunei and the third was to a landline number in the UK.&nbsp; After making those short calls (total duration no
 more than 2 mins)&nbsp; having started on a credit of 4.99 UK pounds, I'm now down to 4.25 pounds.&nbsp; Does anybody know what the problem might be??&nbsp; Thank you.

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/a5e4c08a-6508-4c19-b961-fc2f828a8297" title="EdHassall">
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for reaching out to Skype Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason why you are charged higher than the per minute rate is because whenever you make calls using Skype credits a connection fee is included on top of your per minute rate. See this link for additional details.&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1050/how-much-is-the-connection-fee?q=connection+fee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How
 much is the connection fee?</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, calls are rounded of per minute since Skype doesn't charge by seconds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To usual the call charges you may go to your call usage by signing in&nbsp;to your Skype account online:

    <title>After update to 1803 I can&#39;t log in to 2nd administrator account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> arkay999  say:</h3>
<h2>            After update to 1803 I can&#39;t log in to 2nd administrator account</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I just recently added a second SSD to my computer and installed Windows 10 64 bit to that and set the computer up for dual boot. That all went fine, except for the nightmare of having to provide an email account with Microsoft, which I had, but kept
 getting told it was already taken...So sfter giving up on that I created yet another email account that I don't want just so I could finish the install. I also gave it a PIN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon logging in for the first time I got to the login screen with my new email address as the user name. So, I logged in with my new PIN and got to the home screen. I then went into lusr.msc and created a local account named xxxx (my email account without
 the trailing numbers I use in it) and added it to the Administrators group, it was already in the Users group, so I left that in there and created a password for it. I then exited lusrmgr and shut off UAC control for that account and restarted the computer.
 It came up with just my first Microsoft account and other. When I chose other and typed in the name (correctly) and then the password it said user name and/or password was incorrect...after a few more tries, I decided to see if I did something wrong and went
 in with my Microsoft account, back into lusrmgr and the account was there, and properties confirmed it was in the proper groups. I reset the password in case I mistyped it, and restarted with the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then went into lusrmsc and found the built in Administrator account was disabled, so I enabled that and gave it a name, ArKay99, exited lusrmgr and restarted (I wanted to see if I had to enter new users with that account. When the login screen came up
 it had both accounts showing, my Microsoft email account and ArKay99. I selected ArKay99 and hit enter and got in (no password), I changed a few policies to enable it to run Edge, as I couldn't get it to do what I needed, and started surfing in an effort to
 find out what was wrong. while this was going on I was booting back to my Win 7 install and noticing chkdsk wanted to run on the Win10 install drive. I didn't let it because I know what chkdsk can do. After a few iterations of this I used my Win 7 install
 to discover that Win 10 never shuts off by default, and only goes into deep hibernation and on dual boot machines that causes the chkdsk issue. So I went into the power app made the changes, but had to let chkdsk run. It made a 468 meg partition on my Win
 10 drive, but stopped trying to run after going back to Win 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I started back in Win 10 with the ArKay99 account and was notified that 1803 was available. I thought it might be a good thing to get the upgrade with the possibility it might fix my problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the upgrade I came up to the login screen and when I went to go in with my ArKay99 (Administrator account with no password) it wasn't on the screen, so I went in with my Microsoft account and found that the Administrator account was disabled, so I
 then enabled it and restarted. It was back on the login screen but wouldn't let me in saying the password was incorrect. So, I went in with my Microsoft account and created a password for that in lusrmgr and restarted and was able to get in that way. However,
 what I did was to create a second local Administrator account so I didn't have use the builtin account, but that account and my other rkeay account don't work, as in they don't show on the login screen and when entering the info using other, I get the same
 message that the password or account name is incorrect and to try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, now I have a Microsoft.com account, that I don't want to use, and an ArKay99 account that is the built in Administrator account that I don't want to use (because of the restrictions on that account), and for some reason, any account I create in lusrmgr
 is not addressable by the login app...it either doesn't see it, or can't find it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One last thing, I noticed. If I change the ArKay99 name (it's the Full name component of the account) to ArKay9-9, the changes don't show up on the login screen. If I disable the ArKay99 account in lusrmgr it still shows up on the login screen and works
 fine. If I go into the User directory I can see a separate profile folder for Administrator and ArKay99 and my xxxx account with the numbers, but no ArKay999, I assume it's because it was never really created, because I could never log in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So....what do I have to do to get the ArKay999 account to work so I can login and work with my computer and put the Administrator (with Full name ArKay99) back where it belongs and disabled, only to use in some 'emergency'?</p>

            Hi ArKay.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If you were getting an error that the name was already taken, then you weren't signing into the account but trying to create it.  You  needed to look for Sign In and not Create Account.  You will never get that error while signing in, only creating an account that already exists.
<br />
<br />In this situation the solution is easiest to create a new Local Admin Account using the built-in Administrator if necessary:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable-disable-elevated-administrator-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable...</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br />
<br />Sign into the account, move your files over, test all programs run from it.  Then when ready delete the old account in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and Other Users or by running netplwiz to tick the box for password, highlight unwanted account to Remove.  
<br />
<br />You can then change the new Local Account to the desired MS Account at the link here:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5375-switch-microsoft-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/5375-switch...</a>

<p>I had the same issue. This process is fairly complex so I'll be specific. I encountered this issue after upgrading from 8.1 to 10, by the way, so I have the Windows.old file hanging around. This will probably still work, but I'm just putting it out there
 our scenarios aren't necessarily identical.</p>
<p>1. Go to "File Explorer"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; a. If you do not have hidden files revealed, do the following steps, otherwise continue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; b. Go to "View"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; c. Check "Hidden Items"</p>
<p>2. Go to C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Crypto\RSA\</p>
<p>3. Rename the "MachineKeys" folder to "MachineKeys-old"</p>
<p>4. Create new folder "MachineKeys"</p>
<p>5. Right click "MachineKeys", select "Properties", then select the "Security" tab.</p>
<p>6. Select "Everyone" and give them the permission "Full Control"</p>
<p>7. Go to Control Panel, Administrative Tools, then Services</p>
<p>8. Start any of the following if they aren't active: "Peer Networking Identity Manager", "Peer Name Resolution Protocol", "Peer Networking Grouping", and "PNRP Machine Name Publication Service"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plan B:</p>
<p>If any of those now give you a different error- 1079, I believe- here is the process to fix it.</p>
<p>1. Select Properties for the Service in question</p>
<p>2. Hit the LogOn tab, where you will edit its permissions</p>
<p>3.Select the "This account" button.</p>
<p>4. Enter "Local Service" as the account name.</p>
<p>5. Erase the password fields.</p>
<p>6. Apply, you will get a dialogue box saying an account has been given permission.</p>
<p>7. Start the service.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10&#58; After microphone setup and Voice Recognition training HOW do you use Speech Recognition with an application without the microphone icon&#63;</h2>
                    Using Windows 10 on PC (laptop) - microphone is set up and works correctly. Voice recognition training is complete so it all works. However there is no microphone button to turn on the microphone in Windows 10 to use speech recognition in NOTEPAD or any
 other application. I installed a second language&nbsp;and see the Language toolbar but it is missing the microphone icon which was visible in previous versions of Windows.

</p><blockquote>I do not have any WSR icon, greyed or otherwise in w10, new Asus laptop. My search for assistance loops me through an old video which is not helpful. I set up the mic, was told everything is good. There is no way to access this.
 Under settings/accessibility, there is no reference to speech recognition. I&nbsp; need to dictate into Microsoft word, the new one I just bought. There is no mic displayed. A search finds nothing.
</blockquote>
<p>Go to&nbsp;Control Panel - Speech Recognition - Start Speech Recognition. In the Speech Recognition Window you can click Advanced speech options and then Run Speech Recognition at startup. You must start WSR before Word or any other application you wish to dictate
 into.</p>

            <p>If this display does not have a sensor to detect pens or touch,&nbsp;you need to go buy a new touch-capable monitor.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But if it was working before, then you probably need a driver installed.&nbsp; Go to the website of the company that built your display, and look for downloads.</p>

    <title>Connecting Windows Vista to wireless internet connection - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lexiie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Connecting Windows Vista to wireless internet connection</h2>
                    My step grandfather just bought a new Laptop with Windows Vista on it. <br />
Since we already have two other compters in the house, he setup a wireless internet connection a couple of months ago.<br />
Yesterday, he was trying to connect it to the wireless network and we kept getting this message that said<br />
"Additional log on information is required to connect to this netork.<br />
You may need to select&nbsp;certificate or enter a user name and password to connect to this netork<br />
&gt;Enter/select additional log on information<br />
&gt;Connect to&nbsp;different network"<br />
<br />
When I click on "Enter/select additional log on information" It tells me to enter a user name, password, and Login Domain.<br />
Now, after messing with the computer for a while It tells me to enter the "Security code" In which I have
<br />
So I entered it and the computer was connect to the wireless internet.<br />
<br />
But today, the laptop lost the connection to the wireless internet and I can't get the "Security Code" message to come up again.<br />
<br />
The wireless connection does not have&nbsp;a user name or password that I know of to enter.<br />
When I connected my small Windows XP computer to the wireless internet I didn't get these messages, I just had to enter the Security Key.<br />
<br />
Why is the "Additional Log On Information" message coming up and how do I&nbsp;connect the Windows Vista Laptop to the Wireless Internet Connection?

            Old networks can be a hassle also.<br />
<br />
Start - in search box type - Network&nbsp;&nbsp; at the top of list is Network and Sharing Center - double click on it<br />
<br />
On RIGHT SIDE - CUSTOMIZE - double click - next page SET NETWORK LOCATION - bottom left<br />
Manage or Delete Network Locations<br />
Delete all of old copies of this network (assuming you are not on the network now its all of them)<br />
<br />
Close and Reboot.<br />
<br />
Use Connect To <br />
<br />
Simple Directions just in case something is set wrong.<br />

            Generally speaking win 10.&nbsp; It uses less resources and has more gestures.&nbsp; The caveat is if the particular touch screen does not have win 10 drivers.

<h2>            How can I make a file truly undeletable&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Dear Community,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want to make my database backend file truely undeletable.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, I tried this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"1. go to <span>command prompt</span><br />
2. go to the drive or <span>folder</span> where you have folders or files which you want to make undetectable , undeletable , etc.<br />
3. now in command prompt type:<br />
<b>attrib</b><br />
add the following code to it. You can use these codes together or just with single.<br />
<b>+s : </b>This variable makes the “Attribute” of a file into a system file<br />
<b>+h :</b> This variable makes the “Attribute” of a file hidden<br />
<b>+a :</b> This variable makes the “Attribute” of a file archived"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is just set your file into a system file. When I push the delete key, a window will pop up and say "This is a system file ..... Do you want to permanently delete the file?" If I click "Yes". The file will be deleted permanantly, you cannot even find it
 in your recycle bin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My question is........</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I make my database backend file truely undeletable without my permission? Thanks.</p>

<h2>            LaserJet 6MP will queue print jobs but it won&#39;t complete the printing</h2>
                    I recently installed a new Kodak printer (USB connected) plus I had already installed HP LaserJet 6MP (USB connected via adapter). Both printers were working but now the MP6 will queue print jobs but it won't complete the printing of the document. It seems
 as though the printer is waiting a signal from the computer to start printing. I have an HP p6653w&nbsp;computer with Windows 7. The computer recognizes the printers and installs the proper drivers. The problem occurs when I send a print job to the MP6. It will
 queue but not print. Any suggestions?

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span>
 Try to connect your HP LaserJet 6MP directly using USB without an adapter and see if that helps.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<strong><span>Method 1: </span></strong>Please follow the article mentioned below:<br />
Open the Printer troubleshooter:</span></p>
<p><span><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Printer-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Printer-troubleshooter</a>
</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In order to get the printing services back up and running, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Go to
<b>Start,</b> <b>Control Panel</b> and<b> Administrative Tools</b>. Double click on
<b>Services icon</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Scroll down to the
<b>Print Spooler service</b> and right click on it and select <b>
Stop</b>. In order to do this, you need to be logged in as <b>Administrator</b>. At this point, no one will be able to print anything on any of the printers that are being hosted.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Next you need to go to the following directory:
<b>C:\WINDOWS\System32\spool\PRINTERS</b>. Delete all the files in this folder. This will clear all print queues (it’s a good idea to first make sure there are no other print jobs being processed on any of the other printers on the server because doing
 this step will delete those jobs also)</span></p>
<p><span>d. Now you can go back to the
<b>Services console</b> and right-click and choose <b>Start</b> for the
<b>Print Spooler service.</b></span></p>

 "attempting to recover installation" and "restoring to previous version..."&nbsp; Also in top left corner a message pops up for about 2 seconds "CD-ROM boot priority"&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Michael.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />The first thing I notice is that it's flagging your DVD drive is set first to boot.  Go into BIOS setup to change that to hard drive in a Legacy Windows install, or Windows Boot Manager if it is present to choose because you have a UEFI BIOS.  This is one reason why these should always remain set first to boot, because in a UEFI in particular nothing else can be preceding it like the old-fashioned way of booting a DVD by putting its drive first in BIOS.  This now must be done with the BIOS Interrupt key only.  <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br /><a href="http://www.mydigitallife.info/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.mydigitallife.info/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />If this doesn't roll it back then go over these steps to recover from failed Upgrade: 
<br />
<br />1) Try whichever method works here to get into Advanced Startup Options to  Go Back to Old Version:   <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanced-startup-options-boot-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2294-advanc...</a>
<br />
<br />If you are able to access Go Back and it fails, skip to step 3.
<br />
<br />2) If necessary create bootable installation media to access the repair options if  not accessible by any other method:   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Boot media by powering up the PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />You may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup to turn off Fast Boot if it won't allow the Boot Menu key to interrupt starting Windows:  <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose UEFI version of media if offered, browse to second screen to Repair Your Computer link, then Advanced Troubleshoot options - to Go Back.  
<br /> 
<br />3) If this fails try a Startup Repair, or go back to Troubleshoot Options on the previous screen to Reset your PC which will save your files while reinstalling Windows. 
<br />
<br />4) If that fails you can use the booted media to do the Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is a step to rescue files from the booted media if they are not scrambled:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>.
<br />
<br />Then be sure to wipe all partitions off the drive to get it cleanest.
<br />
<br />Once you've recovered you can hide the Version Update:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />Another thing you can do do if you haven't yet is manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by installing Media Creation Tool and choosing to Upgrade Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  
<br />
<br />This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have.    
<br />
<br />You can use the same tool to download the ISO or create bootable media so you only need to do it once, and have the bootable media for repairs or possible Clean Install.   
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during the Upgrade see these steps to optimize the install as this is evidence it's corrupted: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.

    <title>How do I delete extra copies of a photo&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> holy smoke  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I delete extra copies of a photo&#63;</h2>
                    <b>Question Summary</b><br />
I have general questions about Windows Live Photo Gallery

<div><b>Which version of Windows Live Photo Gallery are you using ? </b></div>
<div>Version 2011 (15.4.3538.513)</div>
<div><b>Choose your Operating System version : </b></div>
<div>Windows 7</div>
<p><b>Additional Details</b><br />
I am trying to reorganize my photos for the third time. Problems with the hard drive. Each time I download&nbsp; them the captions and organization are a shambles. I end up with multiple copies of a single photo. I try to get rid of the extras and they all disappear.
 How can I overcome this problem and get rid of all the extra copies?<br />
<br />
Your help would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
