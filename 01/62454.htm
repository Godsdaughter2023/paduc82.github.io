            <p>This is actually an issue with the MS Xbox App for Windows 10 that is available for download through the Windows 10 Windows Store.&nbsp; It is almost certainly not an issue with the XBL system and therefore your (Harshavardhan Rathod) suggestion to post to the
 Xbox forums is kind of misleading (at best) and highly evasive at worst.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be crystal clear, this error (0x3fb) is seen <strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">only</span></strong> when signing into the Windows 10 Xbox App.&nbsp; It is possible to sign into the Xbox One and the Xbox.com web site at exactly the same time as
 this issue is seen within the Windows 10 Xbox App.&nbsp; Therefore through a process of elimination, this is not an issue with the Microsoft XBL network, it can
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">only</span></strong> be an issue with the Windows 10 Xbox App itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore I'd greatly appreciate, as I'm sure as sound every other person who has the same issue, something better than a fobbing off excuse.&nbsp; This is a level of response, or rather a level of avoidance, that Microsoft was quite rightly lambasted for in
 the past.&nbsp; A reputation that Microsoft has worked extremely hard to correct.&nbsp; Your evasive response, Harshavardhan Rathod, is exactly the type of off hand, passing the buck evasive response that I thought was long gone from Microsoft Support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide an actual answer, if you cannot, please ask someone else who can.&nbsp; If such a person does not exist, please state this clearly - both yourself and Microsoft would be viewed with far greater consideration and given more latitude if your are
 actually honest...</p>

My eMachines E627 has an integrated webcam. Like many others, I am unable to find any file containing a Video Web Camera application. I have downloaded several different drivers that have been said to work, but none do. How do I get my Webcam to work?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<p><span>First let’s check if the webcam gets detected in Device Manager:</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>a. Click <strong>Start, </strong>type <strong>device manager
</strong>in the<strong> Start </strong>search box and hit Enter.</span> </p>
<p><span>b. Locate and expand <strong>Imaging devices</strong>.</span></p>
<p>Does the webcam appear here? </p>
<p><span>If yes, let’s check for the status of the same.</span> </p>
<p><span>c. Right-click the webcam and select <strong>Properties.</strong></span>
</p>
<p><span>d. Under <strong>General </strong>tab, check for the status of the webcam under
<strong>Device status. </strong></span></p>
<p><span>Does it show any error message/code associated with the webcam? If yes, let us know the exact error message.</span>
</p>
<p>The issue concerning could be as a result of missing webcam drivers. You may have to download and install the latest Windows 7 compatible drivers from the manufacturer’s website corresponding to your laptop model.
</p>
<p><br />
<span><span>Refer the following Microsoft articles for more details on updating drivers:</span></span>

<h3> mbretth  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stop error 0x0000007E ACPI.sys during Windows 7 Installation</h2>
                    <p>I was experiencing errors which made it impossible to operate my computer, so I finally gave up and reformatted the drive and reinstalled Win 7.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>During installation, I received the above ACPI-associated stop error, which occurs after the Windows logo appears over the words "Starting Windows." &nbsp;Sometimes the routine freezes there, and sometimes it advances to the BSOD. &nbsp;Since the installation is not
 complete, I cannot boot into safe mode. I tried to boot to an XP boot CD in order to use the command prompt, and that won't boot, either. Same stop error code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought that driver controlled the sleep/hibernate power-saving feature, and can't understand why Windows won't spool up without it. &nbsp;Please help!</p>

</p><p>Andre,<br />
</p>
<p>‎<span>Thank you for responding.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Media files corruption isn't an issue. I have I two sets of Windows 7 disks with no surface defects; one an HP factory set which worked fine the last time I used them, and the other is a set that I burned myself in Windows Backup
 and Recovery. I tried both sets, and the installation failed at the same point with the same error both times.</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>The full error report:</span><br />
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp;Stop: 0x7E (0xC0000005, 0xF7529D66, 0xF78BDEA4, 0xF78BDBA0)</span><br />
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp;ACPI.sys - Address&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 115, 188, 1); font-weight: bold">F7529D66</span><span>&nbsp;Base at&nbsp;</span>F751E000<span>,
 DateStamp&nbsp;</span>480252B1<span>‎</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I looked over the checklists you show. One thing that pertains to me is BIOS settings, but being that I am on a laptop, my BIOS is HP-customized. The only thing I can really change is the boot order. The only other variable I
 think relevant is hardware deconfliction. With no attached peripherals, I also opened the case and removed the secondary drive and WiFi card. As this made no difference after multiple attempts with identical results as before, and the BIOS being factory customized
 to the way the laptop shipped, I replaced these components.</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>I also ran MemTest for 7 passes on two RAM cards with no errors. Just to be sure, I tried booting with one card only in each of two slots, with no change. Re-installed both cards.&nbsp;</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>I have known for a long time that I had issues in Windows; for example, Windows System Restore was not saving restore points, even though it appeared to work, and even gave a "restore point saved" message. Windows Backup would
 not run properly, and I got persistent errors when running Windows Update. Checkdisk always ran without showing errors, though, and system file scans didn't tell me anything (at least not that I saw--perhaps if I knew how to use admin tools?).</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>I always assumed that my Windows errors were due to the cruddy hard drive, since I knew that I did have HD errors, anyway, because of certain programs that were very slow to start. After chkdsk or defrag operations, sometimes
 this would improve--or start affecting a different program after data was moved around, thus my assumption of the HD errors.</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>This all came to a head when the slow response began affecting Norton. Norton would indicate that it was working after Windows booted, but if I tried to open the GUI, the whole system crashed. Thus, I could not verify to my liking
 that Norton actually&nbsp;</span><strong>was</strong><span>&nbsp;working. ‎</span><br />
</p>
<p><span>I planned to reinstall Norton, but then the errors became too much, and I couldn't even boot into Safe Mode any more. Errors that I received before the end were:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;• "Failed to connect to System Event Notification Service. Prevents standard users from logging on. You can review event logs to determine why service didn't respond."<br />
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp;• HP Recovery Manager 19Nov16:</span><br />
<span>File Backup Failure:&nbsp;</span>FFFFFF11<span>‎</span><br />
<span>&nbsp; &nbsp;• "Superfetch not running. Start system maintenance service." [But then, read next item.]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;• The options in Windows Recovery Environment didn't show any OS in the box where you are supposed to choose which OS to run sys repair on.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;• Windows RE also wouldn't recognize my Image file on my backup USB hard drive, even though it did recognize the drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;• As to the last item, the one time that Windows Backup did recognize the ISO file on my LaCie, after clicking "Restore," I got error 0x80070002.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>[I have since read about the limitations of the ‎System Reserve ‎partition, and how to expand it. That may well have been affecting the backup and restore point errors. Because I have since partitioned the bad drive during attempted factory reset, I don't
 think I will be ever know.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last time I was able to boot, I managed to manually back up personal stuff. [As an aside, my supposed USB3 port was only running @ 13-14 MB/sec, and my LaCie has 7200 rpm drives (native PC drives are both 5400). I cannot attribute that speed to the damaged
 drive, since I transferred some data from the damaged drive to the other native drive, and that ran at up to 36 MB/sec.] Maybe the USB3 driver doesn't load in Safe Mode?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The HP utility showed a Start-Up Test failure of the short DST:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;U4HUXA-5SL8A7-MFH15F-60W103</p>
<p>
</p><p>The BIOS test results list showed:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Short DST Test Failure - Quick (303) [repeatedly]</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Long DST Test Failure - Full (305)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [the one time it got that far]<br />
<br />
<span>The one time when I got a result from Startup Repair:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;"Root cause: unspecified changes to sys config might have caused the problem. System files integrity check and repair failed. 0x3712</p>
<p><br />
<span>When I was still able to boot, I enabled boot logs NTBTLog.txt.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The first run indicated that the last loaded driver was BootDefragDriver.sys. The first not loaded was Microsoft 6to4 Adapter. Same result in regular and in Safe Mode. Why would a windows system that reads 6-field IP addresses need to run a 6to4 converter??</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Intermittently, the run logs indicated that the first driver NOT loaded was ACPI x64-Based PC, which corresponds to the consistent Stop Error message that I get now. When the startup was allowed to continue to retry, the list of "not loaded" drivers repeated
 lots of times (maybe 100?), while the specific drivers listed changed somewhat, from 20 to 39 lines, always starting with either 6to4 or ACPI.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Some of the drivers not loaded (if it matters what came after the first "not loaded" driver) in that looping list were printer, Intel, BlackBerry, WAN, AC adapter, battery, Radeon, and Norton drivers. After maybe 100 loops, various different drivers would
 load one or two at a time between loops of the "not loaded" with new "nots" including null, beep, VGA, MSFS, NPFS, FastFAT, etc. It appeared that some of the few loading drivers were USB drivers, which makes sense I guess if ClassPNP was the "last loaded before
 the looping began.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;‎At one point, I turned off my Boot Defrag schedule to remove that driver from the process. After that, the last driver loaded now always indicates ClassPNP.sys. &nbsp;As indicated in my Stop Error, I suppose the first not loaded is usually ACPI.sys. While
 I have turned on boot logging since attempting factory reset, I cannot access that log since Windows won't finish setting up, keeping me from using Safe Mode or even an XP environment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>‎After research, I wanted to run BootRec.exe in Windows Recovery Environment, but whenever I boot my System Repair disk, the instructions say to troubleshoot startup I have to remove that and put in the recovery media and choose my language, but I never
 get that option. All I see when I insert the recovery media is the window for starting the system recovery, with no troubleshooting options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Again running chkdsk (from Safe Mode?), I wound up in another weird loop. When HP restarted after chkdsk, it opened to a DOS-like environment, but a plain black desktop, no window, with the message "Checking file system... NTFS. Volume label is system.
 The volume is clean."</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;What? I have never seen a report of any kind after a chkdsk. The computer was apparently frozen on this screen, and I had to force shutdown. The computer restarted into chkdsk again, and I left it running. When I came back to it, it was powered down.
 When I started it, it booted right into chkdsk AGAIN. I watched it run this time so I could see the results, and it revealed no problems. Upon restart, I got the same locked screen saying "Volume is clean."</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I have definitely lost faith in chkdsk as a useful tool, knowing the whole time that my drive DID have errors. I forget what I did to stop the loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I must have gone back into HP tools. My notes indicate at this point Startup Repair results: "The partition table does not have a valid System Partition." This is probably the point where I finally resigned myself to purchasing a new HD.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Booting Safe Mode without auto-restart now gave me a new Stop Error: 0xED "<span style="color: rgba(16, 16, 16, 1)">UNMOUNTABLE_BOOT_VOLUME"&nbsp;</span>(0xFFFFFA80082AEA50,
 0xFFFFFFFFC0000006, 0x0, 0x0)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Then, again trying to boot to recovery DVD, the computer still locked up, but instead of BSOD, a cmd window opened with this message:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;X:\Windows\SYS32&gt;REM================</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;[Info] SRC_Driver = None</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;[Info] SDV_Driver = None</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;[Error] The boot disc can't be found.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>As a reminder, during installation, the machine freezes not at the first instance of "Starting Windows," but during the first time the logo builds over the words "Starting Windows" in the modern colors and font (remember the first few times you see this
 during installation, it is in more of a XP or Vista theme).</p>
<p><br />
<span>Questions:‎</span></p>
<p>• Isn't chkdsk supposed to isolate bad areas on the HD to keep them from being used?</p>
<p>• After so many times attempting to create backups with ISO image, my LaCie external has gotten pretty full. Will my original disk image from 3 years ago still be intact? I never actively deleted it; but do subsequent image operations create whole new files
 or do they build on the old one?</p>
<p>• &nbsp;In the HP testing environment, the Battery Test always says "Secondary Not Installed (60). Is there actually a laptop configuration that uses 2 batteries? That would get pretty heavy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Man, I was pretty stoked when I saw that you were from&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(115, 115, 115, 1)">groovypost.com &nbsp;</span><span>I bet you felt the exact opposite after seeing the length of this post. LOL
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;I actually just discovered that site in the last few days while researching this email problem, and I looks like a great resource. There are not too many tech sites that returned matches for my search terms, so I take that
 as a sign that not many people tackle the REALLY tough stuff, and GPost is one of them. Will be joining soon.</span></p>

            <p>If you brought your computer to me to fix, the first thing I would tell you is that I would not even look at it unless you first agreed to my removal of Norton software.&nbsp; I have found over many years that Norton makes diagnosis almost impossible.&nbsp; I do not
 meant to pick on Norton because all "Security" or all-in-one suites are the same.&nbsp; My clients have antivirus only software and none other.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also tell you that you need a need hard drive and would then re-install Windows from scratch so make sure you have your DATA backed up and the codes to re-install your programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you would like, I can provide you with a step by step to install a new hard drive.?????</p>

            <p>Hey, thanks, Canada.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already replaced the hard drive.&nbsp; I installed a new Samsung SSD, and I still receive the identical error code during the installation procedure.&nbsp; I did manage to make a manual backup one of the last times that I was able to log into Safe Mode.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I heartily agree with you on the Norton suite.&nbsp; It can cause headaches.&nbsp; I have had my problems with them.&nbsp; The main reason I stick with them, is 1) my subscription to Comcast is paying for Norton whether I use it or not, 2) I got a sweet deal a couple of
 years ago, and bought a handful of licenses that are now paid for and waiting for the day when I can get off of the Comcast--and I will use them since they are paid for.&nbsp; It's a being&nbsp;poor thing.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; 3) I have so much control with the Norton suite with settings
 that are not available in MS Essentials, and nice log records--besides the fact that I wouldn't trust MS with my security now that they are using the Google business model of spy, steal, and sell information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best advice that I have, from experience, is to not utilize any automatic Norton uninstall/install routines--DO NOT use Norton removal tool.&nbsp; It amazes me that people who write the software cannot figure out how to remove the software that THEY WROTE
 without often&nbsp;causing horrendous corruptions.&nbsp; I only uninstall Norton with Revo, and I will not install Norton without tracing the install with Revo.&nbsp; REVO.&nbsp; I GLADLY push their product--free or pro version--after it has proved so reliable to me.&nbsp; Revo Uninstaller
 Pro, the salve for that Norton infection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyhow, I am at the library so I can get online, trying to download some bootable tools to peruse my system with.&nbsp; Wish me luck.&nbsp; My HP Pavilion dv7 was built in 2011, and was a factory Win7 installation, so a new SSD should not have any strange problems,
 as far as I know.&nbsp; Enlighten me if I am wrong.&nbsp; The error I am getting was the same on the old HD, and on the new SSD--and it was the same exact error at the same place in the boot process as I received trying to boot to an XP bootable disk, so the problem,
 I believe, is either hardware or BIOS.&nbsp; The recovery media that I have worked great all 4 times that I have used it, my machine has not changed (other than the SSD), and bad recovery media would have no effect when booting from a utilities disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My next step is to download the Intel processor diagnostic and see what that tells me.&nbsp; The SSD tested fine in SpinRite, and I let MemTest86 run 7 passes and my RAM seems fine.</p>
<p>

<p>I see two things in your image.&nbsp; You have the option to use Expand.&nbsp; There is no Clear all Notifications button.&nbsp; But you also don't have any Notifications so maybe that last detail is explained by that?&nbsp; I would have to use that button on mine to find out.
 &nbsp; It would also be useful to know how to generate a Notification at will.&nbsp; Perhaps just send yourself an E-mail?&nbsp; That works.</p>

<p>Quick update guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just recently reinstalled windows 10 pro 1809 with the option of "keep nothing" after backing up my data. After the install, the action center was working showing notifications and even pop up banners on when I received notifications. There is a line saying
 "no notifications to view" when you have viewed and done them all. My search bar was also working from the get go and certain keys on my keyboard like the volume down key, the 9, 0 keys on the numpad were easily registered on press.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, as soon as I restarted my laptop to finish reinstalling programs, the problems came back again. No notification in action center even if the icon shows I have a couple (blank action center with no line), I have to type in run C:\Windows\System32\ctfmon.exe
 to get my search bar to work again and to register the keys I mentioned before, I have to press really hard or long for it to do that. I ran sfc checker and dism restorehealth no problems shown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>These problems didn't exist on first install but when you restart, some services or processes internally don't start up causing these issues. I don't know how many issues are there as these are just what is visible. I installed a fresh clean copy so I think
 the version itself is bugged the hell out. Microsoft should release a fix ASAP!</p>

<p>I am constantly getting the subject error, MS techs have been in my PC (4 times now)&nbsp;, I've reinstalled, Updated the Samsung driver and MS techs have done all sorts of other things whilst in my computer. The printer actually works so I'm not bothered about
 the driver . SO I told MS to just hide the error for me so it doesn't constantly keep reminding me. 2 hours yesterday does just that only to find I have the same error again today.</p>
<p>Looks like MS cant fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really liked 8.1and assisted with win 10 developer, I was totally shocked when it eventually cam out.&nbsp;Tto me its just a downgrade from win 8.1 and a jumped up win7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing but issues with win 10,&nbsp;with both my home PC and the surface 3 I use for business I am seriously thinking of downgrading to win8.1, just curious to know if anyone else is thinking the same thing?</p>

<p>Maybe - it depends on your SMTP server. I recommend you do a little homework yourself by downloading and testing blat.exe to send a mail message from a command prompt and also as a scheduled task. Please report here when successful with both items. I shall
 then suggest a method to do the rest.</p>

            Unfortunately i am unable to download blat.exe due to access restriction in my machine. Will be helpful if i could do it in batch scripting to troubleshoot issues in future because i have couple of other batch scripting programs in the machine. and that
 is why i preferred to go with batch scripting for this mail alert.

    <title>Windows 7 not allowing me to connect to my wireless router... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thewhiteknight007  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 not allowing me to connect to my wireless router...</h2>
                    Okay so I got Windows 7 Professional for $30 for the main computer at my apartment. This computer was previously running Vista 32 Bit I believe. So I looked it up and found the thread to overcome THAT issue.<br />
<br />
Created the ISO, burned it, installed Win7, and I thought that everything had gone smoothly.<br />
<br />
HOWEVER after the initial setup I went to the bottom right to connect wirelessly to my Linksys router (WRT610N) and I chose to connect. It asked for the password of course and I put in what I thought was the right password. It said that it wasn't correct.<br />
<br />
So I went into my file folders and looked it up to be doubly sure I was typing in the right words. And I was. Yet it still kept saying that it was "incorrect". I then plugged in an ethernet cable from the router to the back of the computer and of course the
 internet was flowing again.<br />
<br />
However I don't want to use that cable. The wireless was working just fine with Vista and now it's not. There are 2 other laptops here (mine and my brothers right now) and both of them were able to disconnect and reconnect using the password we had created.<br />
<br />
Just to make sure that it wasn't something to do with the router I logged into the router's homepage went into wireless security tab and changed the password. I then saved it.
<br />
<br />
Tried reconnecting with all 3 machines. The laptops had no issues but the Windows 7 machine is the one that refuses to connect wirelessly.<br />
<br />
Am I doing something wrong? Or could something have gone wrong with the installation? I haven't entered a product key in yet and I have NOT activated Windows 7 yet? Could that be the issue?<br />
<br />
Sorry for the long wall of text....I'm just really concerned and want to make sure I've given all the necessary info.<br />
<br />
I saw this in another thread and this is exactly what I'm going thru...and it's really starting to ____ me off. I've got a lot of stuff to do today. I just want to get this fixed asap and move on....<br />
<br />
"Hi folks, I am running Win 7 on my desktop and Vista Home Premium on my laptop, and am unable to connect to the wireless network at all on my Win 7 desktop. I can see the wireless network, but when I attempt to connect I am told that my security key is invalid
 instantly (it doesn't attempt to connect at all, just instantly says invalid security key). I have no trouble connecting on my Vista laptop, and when I was running Vista on this same desktop previously I had no trouble connecting.<br />
<br />
Network security setting is WPA Personal, TKIP.<br />
<br />
The only thing I can think of is that maybe Windows 7 wants a security key and I am entering a passphrase. Is there a difference between these two things? Any help is much appreciated!"<br />
<br />
I'm glad this isn't only me. This has to be something wrong with Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Before anyone asks I have tried:<br />
<br />
1) Downloading the latest drivers from HP (problem is that HP says I don't have the right hardware/software to do so)<br />
2) I've done all the Windows Updates<br />
3) I've RESET the router FOUR times...no change.<br />

                    I was shutting down my desktop and while shutting down it showed "closing 2 apps and shutting down." One of the name shown was "G". Any idea what that is?

<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Check ASUStek Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums<br />
about any known issues. Update the <strong>BIOS, chipset drivers, and the other major on-board<br />
and separate device drivers</strong>. Also update iaStorV.sys.<br />
<br />
BiosVersion = 203&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
BiosReleaseDate = 05/27/2009 <strong>&lt;- check for updates to the BIOS, low level chipset drivers,

iastorv.sys = Intel Matrix Storage Manager driver - See ASUStek&nbsp;and the chipset maker. This
<br />
driver could&nbsp;have been driven to fault by other programs such as&nbsp;Kaspersky.<br />
<br />
This driver is extremely difficult to install so you need ASUStek's help though you might also
<br />
ask in the&nbsp;ASUStek forums.<br />

<strong>2. </strong>If the methods in <strong>1. </strong>above do not resolve the issues use those in the troubleshooters<br />
below. AFTER updating the BIOS, chipset, and other drivers IF the issue continues then<br />
run Driver Verifier to see if it indicates a CAUSE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<br />
Note&nbsp;using <strong>Win Key + X</strong> and <strong>Win Key + W</strong> (to get to Control Panel, Run, and Settings

<br />
==========================================================<br />
<br />
This "could" be a power supply problem though it is not the most common cause.</p>
<p>9f is&nbsp;likely a driver issue.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispyware/security programs can also cause these issues.<br />
Have you added devices lately or updated drivers - be sure to check in Windows Updates to<br />
see if a driver was updated prior to this occurring. This could also be caused by a loose card
<br />
or cable and even a weak power supply.<br />
<br />
That error means a driver is not handling the power state properly. Check in Control Panel -
<br />
Device Manager to be sure major drivers are not shut off during sleep - double click Display
<br />
Adapter - NIC and WIFI - Sound and others - Power Management tab - uncheck Allow <br />
computer to turn off power. Maybe only one has an issue.<br />
<br />
<strong>(Use RUN&nbsp;instead of Start - Search as used on Vista or Windows 7)<br />
<br />
WINKEY + X - RUN - type in MSCONFIG.exe<br />
<br />
General Tab - check Diagnostic Start&nbsp; - APPLY / OK&nbsp; -&nbsp; REBOOT<br />
<br />
Try it now. If it still blue screens think Video Driver. If not think NIC, Wifi, Sound, or......<br />
(and it still could be video interacting with something else). See&nbsp;troubleshooter link<br />
above for my generic driver update methods.<br />

You can disable Driver Verifier<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font color="#0072c6">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617</font></span></a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
WINKEY + X - RUN - type in -&gt; verifier /reset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit enter to disable<br />
<br />
Use BlueScreenView to see if there is a driver specified in the error message. Also check with<br />
MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen.<br />
<br />
If DriverVerifier creates a minidump upload it and post the link here so we can analyze it.<br />

<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update your major drivers and BIOS)<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : (Set VIEW to&nbsp;Hide Microsoft&nbsp;drivers<br />
- update&nbsp;those without Dump in their names.)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font color="#0072c6">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</font></span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click
<br />
UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right
<br />
Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<h2>            Why can&#39;t I log into ANY e-mail accounts&#63;</h2>
                    I have a Toshiba laptop with factory installed Vista. Every time I go to log into an e-mail account,&nbsp;the only thing i get is the sign in page. Once in a while, I will get a second or two of my mail but then it goes back to the sign in page. I have cleared
 cookies &amp; tried resetting&nbsp;everything back to default settings. I have also run a full scan through McaFee. The computer is about 2 years old &amp; hasn't been used much.&nbsp;It's kinda just been sitting here. I hope this ISN'T one of these stupid security issues!
 PLEASE tell me it's something simple. THANX! (My main computer is an Acer with <strong>
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">XP</span></strong> &amp; I've NEVER had a problem)!

<p>there're 3 options now: application, system, system (enhanced)<br />
which options is the equivalent of the old "disable scaling on high DPI" setting?</p>
<p>and could you explain what does each options do?</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
There are lots of improvements and upgrade made in the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, this includes the new DPI options with enhanced feature. To give you an overview of the settings under
<strong>Override high DPI scaling behavior</strong>, you can check the following settings and its effects:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/44583a78-1b7f-4553-a25f-cb21eaf73be8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/44583a78-1b7f-4553-a25f-cb21eaf73be8" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The <strong>Application </strong>setting was previously referred to as "<strong>Disable display scaling on high-DPI settings"</strong>. It also forces the process to run in per-monitor DPI awareness mode. Windows will be prompted not to bitmap stretch UI
 (User Interface) from the exe in question when the DPI changes.</li><li>The <strong>System</strong> setting will bitmap stretch the UI when the DPI changes.</li><li>The<strong> System (Enhanced)</strong> setting is for applications that are GDI-based Windows or Graphics Device Interface (GDI) scaling. It will DPI scale the application on a per-monitor basis. This means that application will definitely become per-monitor
 DPI aware.<br />
</li></ul>
<p><br />
Feel free to respond if you need more help.&nbsp; </p>

            What is the make and model of your computer?
<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Select the Playback
<br />Right click your Speakers
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already
<br />
<br />Select your speakers
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Levels tab
<br />Use the slider to adjust level

            Hi Joanne.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can Check for Updates at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update to see if it provides a Sound driver when it scans to notice it's missing.
<br />
<br />You can also right click Start button to open Device manager, choose Sound device, then Driver tab, then Update driver automatically.   See if it receives the driver from Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />If not listed in Device Manager, from Action tab choose Scan for hardware to see if it detects sound device to install driver.  
<br />
<br />You can also run the Audio Playback troubleshooter at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Troubleshoot.  
<br />
<br />If not go to the Support Downloads web page for the PC model to download and install the Sound driver.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>How can I change the Win10 installation date and time&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ebob.com  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I change the Win10 installation date and time&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have specified tonight at midnight for Win10 to begin its installation. &nbsp;Now I would like to change that but am not able to. &nbsp;What happens is ... 1) I click on the "Get Windows 10" icon in the lower right corner. &nbsp;2) The "Get Windows 10" dialog opens.
 &nbsp;It indicates "Upgrade - Available" &nbsp;3) I click "OK - Let's continue". &nbsp;4)The dialog shows "Working on it". &nbsp;5) THE DIALOG CLOSES! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can I do to change the install date and time?</p>
<p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply Harsha.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually I only wanted to advance the time by a few hours. &nbsp;At this point I have a much more serious problem. &nbsp;The first install started at at 12am this morning. &nbsp;When I got up this (Thursday) morning I found that the machine was still running Win7 and there
 was a message saying that the install had failed and inviting me to "Try Again". &nbsp;So I did and that attempt failed too. &nbsp;In researching the problem I learned about the media approach and tried it. &nbsp;The result was:&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/640bb601-5daf-4b66-b1ea-c00e207f8361" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I've researched this a bit but find that many people have had this problem and have tried various things and there doesn't seem to be a one size fits all solution. &nbsp;What do &nbsp;you recommend?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks, &nbsp;Bob</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have the latest (not insider) updates on the SP4. Sometimes the toolbar at the bottom of the screen disappears and the only way to get it back is to restart. I can hit the windows key and see the start screen, but the toolbar won't display. Anyone else
 have this problem or find a workaround?</p>

<div>
<p>that is a fix for when the start menu and taskbar disappear completely. not sure if it applies in your case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(what happens if you rotate and switch between portrait and landscape mode when</p>
<div>you get into this condition?) what are your taskbar settings? autohide? </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&gt;&gt;If you don't mind, can you explain what this does?</div>

            Rotate doesn't help nor does disconnecting the keyboard. It doesn't always happen, I'm trying to pin down when it does happen, hibernate or sleep, or, something else.

<p>Sorry for the late reply. The command re-registers/reinstalls default apps and settings. It reconfirms the configuration on how the Start app and taskbar reacts to default app information.&nbsp;Did you try running it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also try disconnecting your Microsoft account from the Surface and use a local account momentarily and then simply reconnect your Microsoft account again (in Settings &gt; Accounts). In rare cases the configuration of an account can affect settings
 in Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the command does not resolve the issue, you can also try reinstalling the latest driver pack from our
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=49498" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Download center</a>. Download the file <strong>SurfacePro4_Win10_160401_1.msi</strong> and double click it to automatically update. If all else fails, a Refresh should fix this since it reinstalls all the built in apps and components.</p>

<h2>            Audio</h2>
                    I am using a Dell XPS 8900 with a RealTek ALC 3861 sound card and I currently do not have any audio. I ran in safe mode and same problem occurs. In device manager under system devices, I have High Definition Audio Controller listed twice with a code 39
 error message. I have downloaded the correct drivers multiple times via realtek's website and Dell's website and same problem occurs. I have removed both of them multiple times but to no avail. Under Sound, Video and game controllers, it only has my BeatsSolo
 Wireless Stereo and Mono listed and not the RealTek driver. I have removed both multiple times as well and tried installing the drivers for the sound card multiple times but is still not working. Any other ideas?

 a sound card and the hd audio controller has the same error code as before. I do not always have the sound on so i cannot pinpoint an exact time of when the problem occured. I tried system restore to the previous time I used the audio and other various times
 but the system restore is not working for any of the restore points. It gets a bit into it and just stops the restore process but that is a different issue to address later.&nbsp;

<p>Since you already tried multiple steps in order to resolve the issue and still has no sound, it seems that the issue is with the sound card. We suggest that you contact the manufacturer of the device and have it checked.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 &#40;with Bing&#41; and new hard drive on Inspiron 3531</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The hard drive was bad. Purchased a blank hard drive installed in laptop, downloaded Windows 8.1 and installed with generic key. This computer isn't just 8.1, it is 8.1 with Bing which I am reading on forums has little support from Microsoft. I have spent
 hours daily for over a week trying to get my sons computer running again and at this point I am ready to just buy another key to activate.
</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Seems like it should be simple, computer is fine, 8.1 installed fine with everything working great. So to pay for a new key on the activation screen, when I hit "purchase key" it says that I can not purchase a key online...wonderful? It says to purchase
 from a retailer. I would like to know in advance if I go and buy license for Windows, when I get home and enter that key will it activate? Is there something about Windows 8.1 with Bing and that key being embedded in the bios ( or where ever and whatever the
 terminology) that is going to prevent me from activating the legally downloaded, legally purchased Windows 8.1 (without Bing) on the new hard drive?</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Is there anything else I should/should have done to get my laptop usable?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance for any attempts to help.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can't fix it&nbsp;using the methods you are using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft does not supply a download for 8.1 with Bing and you can&nbsp;not use that 8.1 download from Microsoft to replace that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is what 8.1 with Bing is all about:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/195934/what-exactly-is-windows-8.1-with-bing-do-i-have-to-use-bing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/195934/what-exactly-is-windows-8.1-with-bing-do-i-have-to-use-bing/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Windows 8.1 with Bing costs $0 for computer manufacturers to include on their laptops and tablets. That’s right — there’s no licensing fee at all. It’s designed so computer manufacturers can offer cheap laptops like HP’s forthcoming $200 Windows laptop.
 The manufacturer can keep all the money from the device without paying Microsoft a cent.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>For Recovery Media&nbsp;to reinstall&nbsp;Windows 8.1 with Bing, contact the Laptop manufacturer, Dell.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>An update for others looking for solution. Very much appreciate the help. I was able to fix the issue. I found a download for 8.1 with Bing. I tried to avoid doing that because I just don't trust downloading things from any place other than reputable sites.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I downloaded on another laptop, saved to flash drive and did a clean install it worked and activated Windows. Then I did the upgrade to Windows 10 and had no issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For any others that are looking for answers I just wanted to add...</p>
<p>The 8.1 with Bing that I found was for a 32 bit system and I have a 64 bit. It still worked fine. Upgrade to Windows 10 automatically goes to 32 bit since that is what I was upgrading from. Then once upgrade to Windows 10 is done you can download Windows
 10 installation media for your choice of 32 or 64 bit, as you can download to install on another computer. I downloaded the 64 bit and then did a clean install of the Windows 10 64 bit. I didn't have any problems. And on a side note, I like the Windows 10
 much better than the 8.1</p>
<p>I am grateful for people taking the time to answer.</p>
<p>thank you again.</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community. Your interest in Windows 10 is much appreciated.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>What is the exact error message you get?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Try the below methods and check if that helps:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to update the drivers for your hardware devices from the manufacturer’s website and check if it helps. Try the below steps:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1.Click <strong>Start
</strong>and select <strong>Device Manager</strong> .<br />
2.Expand the <strong>Batteries </strong>category.<br />
3.Under the Batteries category, right-click the <strong>Microsoft ACPI Compliant Control Method Battery</strong> listing, and select
<strong>Uninstall </strong>. <br />
<strong>Warning</strong> : Do not remove the Microsoft AC Adapter driver or any other ACPI compliant driver.<br />
4.On the Device Manager taskbar, click <strong>Scan for hardware changes</strong> .
<br />
Alternately, select <strong>Action &gt; Scan for hardware changes</strong> .</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2:</strong></span></span></p>
The <strong>Battery Checker (ISB Utility) </strong>is a utility that checks to make sure the user is using a authentic Sony Battery.
<p><span>To disable the ISB utility, follow the steps below: <br />
<br />
1. Click on Start, type ‘msconfig’ and then select the ‘Startup Tab’,</span></p>
<p><span>2. Deselect the "ISB Utility" from the startup.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Restart the computer.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Check for the issue.</span></p>
