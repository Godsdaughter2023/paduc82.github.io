<h2>            why can&#39;t i print from pages i open in my searches using microsoft edge</h2>
                    I opened a page in food.com and when I went to print a recipe nothing worked.&nbsp; I tried the print in the tool bar. Also tried the print on the web page. Neither would print.

                    <p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Now</span> I'm unable to print to my HP Officejet Pro 8600 from Windows 10.&nbsp; Seems to have started within the last few weeks.&nbsp; I can print from my phone and a Mac laptop. All of these devices were printing through
 my WIFI router.&nbsp; I tried all the basic ways to resolve - restarting PV, Printer, Router; deleting and downloading new print drivers; checked compatibility of printer to Window 10,...</p>
<p>The printer indicates that there is a WIFI connection, gives me an IP address, but the PC doesn't see the printer.&nbsp; When I tried to download the new printer driver, system could not find device. I gave it the IP address, but still could not find device.</p>
<p>HP software is up to date. It looks like Windows 10 is up to date.&nbsp; What going on????</p>

            Hi Bill 
<br />
<br />Please try the steps recommended below to uninstall printer software 
<br />
<br />Option 1: Run the Printer Troubleshooter - <a href="http://aka.ms/diag_printer10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://aka.ms/diag_printer10</a>
<br />
<br />If you are using an HP Printer, use the HP Print and Scan Doctor:
<br />HP Print and Scan Doctor - HP Support
<br /><a href="https://support.hp.com/ph-en/document/c02073861" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.hp.com/ph-en/document/c02073861</a>
<br />
<br />Option 2: Uninstall and Reinstall the Printer
<br />A. Uninstall the Printer
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Apps and Features / Programs and Features
<br />Select your printer.
<br />Select Uninstall.
<br />
<br />Windows key+R, type control, hit Enter
<br />Open Devices and Printers.
<br />In the Devices and Printers window look for your Printer. If you see it listed, right-click on it and choose Delete or Remove Device
<br />
<br />Windows Key+R, type Cmd, hit Enter
<br />Type printui.exe /s &gt; OK.
<br />Click on Drivers tab.
<br />Look for Printer driver. If you see it click on it and click Remove at the bottom.
<br />Select OK.
<br />Select Apply and OK on the Print Server Properties windows.
<br />Close Devices and Printers.
<br />
<br />B. Install the Driver
<br />Go to the Printer manufacturer's website and search for the latest Windows 10 drivers
<br />Reinstall the Printer driver
<br />Reboot the computer 
<br />
<br />Some users have been reporting, specific make and models just stop working after either upgrading to Windows 10 1809/1809 or a specific cumulative update under either version. 
<br />
<br />Your best option is to do as you already did, rollback or try uninstalling the specific cumulative update that triggered the issue.
<br />
<br />ALso, make sure you file a bug report:
<br /><a href="https://windows10.help/blogs/entry/54-how-to-submit-a-suggestion-or-bug-report-in-windows-10-using-feedback-hub/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windows10.help/blogs/entry/54-how-to-su...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />        Open the Services window (Windows key + R, type services.msc, press enter).
<br />        Select Print Spooler and click the Stop icon, if it is not stopped already.
<br />        Navigate to C:\Windows\system32\spool\PRINTERS and open this file. You may need to show hidden files or enter an administrator's password.
<br />        Delete all contents inside the folder. Do not delete the PRINTERS folder itself. Note that this will remove all current print jobs, so make sure no one on your network is using the printer.
<br />        Return to the Services window, select Print Spooler, and click Start.

            I had already done what you suggested, but I redid it again.&nbsp; The problem seems to be that my PC/Windows 10 can not find my printer.&nbsp; Now when I try to download a new driver, it can't find the printer even by the IP address.&nbsp; Yet, I can still print to
 this printer from my phone or my Mac.

            Could you confirm if this also happens in the default Administrator account?
<br />
<br />Open Start
<br />Type: cmd
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the command prompt, type:
<br />net user administrator /active:yes
<br />
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />Close command prompt, restart, then try signing into the Administrator account.
<br />
<br />Try printing again. If that does not work, try performing a repair upgrade to see if it then works.

    <title>Black Splotch on External Monitor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pokeshadow  say:</h3>
<h2>            Black Splotch on External Monitor</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I recently noticed that my external monitor (I have a laptop) has a black and slightly white splotch on it. I have found that changing the resolution moves the splotch on the screen. Currently the External Monitor is set as my "main display" but when
 I changed the main display to my laptop monitor the splotch moved to that screen. On my ubuntu installation the splotch nowhere to be seen as well as during boot time. At the Windows Login Screen it's not there but when I login to my user account it appears.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated. Thanks!</p>

<p>Hi Pokeshadow,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Black patch on screens means that there are dead pixels or they are not receiving signal from the board. However, an image or screenshot would be helpful for us to take a closer look. Also, can you recall any recent changes made on the PC prior to the issue?
 Do you have the latest Windows Updates, including driver updates, installed on your PC?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We hope to hear from you soon. </p>

            Thank you for the update. You could enter the BIOS settings to determine whether it is a software-related or hardware-related issue.
<p>
</p><p>BIOS is not a part of the Windows operating system. If you still see horizontal on the screen, it indicates that it is software-related. If you don't see any lines, it is related to the hardware. You may need to view the documentation that is included with
 your computer for information about the BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it's software-related, I suggest that you reinstall the graphics card drivers.
<span>Open <strong>Device Manager</strong>, expand <strong>Display adapters</strong>, right-click the name of the device, and select
<strong>Uninstall</strong>. Restart your PC and Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us know how it goes.</span></p>

</p><p>I do have an issue with my skype account.Normally&nbsp;this was created with my Gmail account.However I have changed the password, I could not connect anymore.I have logged in with mail+password and the account seems to be ok.Also, I have the account logged into
 my work PC and looks totally different.I could not see my conversations and all the shared info between the two devices.Seems that are two separate accounts.One from the PC with all kind of info and the other it is simple.When I connect through the "enter
 in my account" it is a switch made.I really need to recover all the info shared on that skype as I need to move my accounts to a laptop.How can I recover my&nbsp;account from the PC?Can you please help me?I really need to do this switch asap.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance,</p>
<p>

    <title>Windows 7 freezes in Normal Mode. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jordanridehalgh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 freezes in Normal Mode.</h2>
                    Hello! I've been using my Dell Inspiron 17R for around 2 months ago and it's a fantastic laptop, I mainly use it for videogames, music and movies/TV shows and it has ran flawlessly thus far.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Starting yesterday however, problems began to occur. I could boot the laptop up as per usual and access the Internet, play games, watch movies etc. but after around 5 minutes everything would suddenly become unresponsive. Both my mouse and trackpad wouldn't
 allow me to click at all, I could however move the mouse around the screen completely fine. The keyboard would also not work - I tried opening the task manager via Ctrl+Alt+Del as well as closing windows with Alt+F4 or trying to shutdown via the Windows key
 and nothing would work. Instead the cursor would change to the "loading" symbol and it would pretty much just do nothing.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The first time this happened I was browsing the Internet and it just got stuck on "Waiting for Cache" or something to that likeliness, I then noticed the rotating circle that shows a page loading had also halted and was then forced to reboot manually as
 I couldn't even click the Windows button. Another test I tried was watching a downloaded video - it literally just stopped playing around 4 minutes in. The screen just halted on a single frame even though the pause button hadn't been pressed - trying to click
 anything didn't work (as usual).</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried rebooting it multiple times (I was sadly forced to use the power button) and it began to repeat every single time. It would work for a few minutes before completely freezing (minus the ability to pointlessly move the mouse around the screen). Occasionally
 a window would pop up above the task bar saying that the "Microsoft Windows application has become unresponsive". Sometimes the taskbar would then disappear and the laptop would shut itself down but the end result was always the same.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I found that the same problem did not occur when booting in Safe Mode with Networking, however there was some&nbsp;noticeable&nbsp;slowdown. I downloaded and used many anti-viruses/malware to scan my machine and I'm almost positive that there is nothing of the such
 on the computer (although in all fairness, the scans were running so slowly I could only make it to about 20% on each before giving up). Other&nbsp;solutions&nbsp;I've tried included:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1. Manually ending high memory usage tasks via the manager</div>
<div>2. Using CCleaner to fix my registry in Safe Mode</div>
<div>3. Left the laptop off overnight in a hope it would just fix itself</div>
<div>4. Unplugged everything from the ports of the laptop</div>
<div>5. Rebooted via the Restart, Shutdown and power buttons</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm pretty sure I've tried other stuff as well, but I'm pretty limited in the fact that I can only use the laptop for a few&nbsp;minutes&nbsp;before it decides to stop working. I really need the laptop for my University studies and I'd absolutely be in love if one
 of you guys could help me solve my problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks in advance!</div>

            <p>Hi
<span>JordanRidehalgh</span>,</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Community. It seems that you have an issue with Windows 7 freezing. This can be really frustrating for you and I appreciate
 the efforts that you have put in. Let us work together as a team try to get this issue fixed.
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Let us start with a few questions-</p>
<p>
<span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Do you get any error message or error code?</p>
<p>
<span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Have you installed any hardware or software on the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>I would like more information regarding the issue.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Method 1-</p>
<p>I would have you run the virus scan in Safe Mode with networking using different antivirus software.</p>
<p>Additionally, I would have you download (download and install in Normal Mode) and run (In Safe Mode) the online scanner-</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a></p>
<p>Note: The antivirus will try to repair bad sectors on the hard drive damaged by virus. Any data on these sectors might be lost.</p>
<p>Using Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee
 that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be solved. Using Third Party Software is at your own risk.</p>
<p>Make sure you get the computer back to Normal Mode after performing all the troubleshooting steps.</p>
<p>Method 2-</p>
<p>There is a possibility that a third party application is causing the issue since the computer worked fine in Safe Mode.</p>
<p><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>I would recommend you to perform
<span>Clean Boot.</span><br />
</strong><strong><br />
Placing the computer in a <span>Clean Boot</span> state helps in identifying if
<span>any third party applications</span> or <span>startup items</span> are causing the issue. You need to perform the steps from the article<span>-</span><br />
</strong><strong><br />
<span>How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span><br />
</strong><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><strong>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</strong></span></a></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span>: You need to follow
<span>Step</span> <span>3</span> from the article to get the computer back to
<span>Normal Startup</span> after performing all the troubleshooting steps.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Check if the issue persists.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Method 3-</p>
<p>I would have you refer the article-</p>
<p><span>Windows hangs or freezes</span></p>

    <title>Microsoft Jigsaw - Statistics Reset or Re-sync&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> txice  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Jigsaw - Statistics Reset or Re-sync&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Is there any way to reset and/or re-sync the puzzle statistics in Microsoft Jigsaw?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ask because mine are essentially incorrect.&nbsp; While it's not necessarily a big deal in the grand scheme of things, my OCD kicks in fairly high gear when I can tell that the statistics are not accurate.&nbsp; For the classic Jigsaw statistics, the game is telling
 me that I have "played" 148 puzzles, but that I have only "completed" 142.&nbsp; Well, bottom line is that is not correct.&nbsp; I have not yet started a puzzle that I have not fully finished.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect what is happening is related to the freezing issue(s) I constantly have with the game.&nbsp; It has become fairly common place for the gave to "freeze" after I've completed a puzzle.&nbsp; My computer doesn't freeze or lock up - just Jigsaw.&nbsp; And it only
 seems to be a graphical freeze.&nbsp; Task manager does not show the game as not responding or anything like that.&nbsp; The main game window just "locks up" - like when you complete a puzzle and the animation begins to play to add gold bars to your total, that animation
 will freeze and the game window itself becomes totally unresponsive.&nbsp; Sometimes, but not every time, I can sort of "force" the game to start responding again by trying things like minimizing and maximizing the game window, or putting the game into full screen
 mode and then back into windowed mode.&nbsp; This, however, does not work every time and on occasion I am simply forced to close the game out totally and re-start it.&nbsp; If I had any guess I would assume that the puzzle completion count being off is somehow related
 to those times when the game freezes and I am forced to restart it, but now I am curious to know if there is a way to somehow sync these or edit them in some way so that my completed count is accurate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just in case the question arises: my video drivers are up to date, Windows 10 is fully patched and current (with automatic updates enabled), I have tried to do a wsreset to clear the app store cache (which did nothing), and the main game menu window does
 not show any "recent" (i.e. uncompleted) puzzles that I can select and complete.</p>

            I can sympathize. I've tried the Xbox route, and they only handle Xbox issues. It's called "Passing the Buck". No one seems to have the answers. In my opinion it's hugely frustrating. Wish I could help.

                    <p>Original title: Prefetch open with progam change.</p>
<p>Okay, I found a virus that was the xp2012 virus, on my moms machine. I couldn't clean it off, but I did find the folder that the main .exe file was in and changed the name of it to .ex_ , but in the mean time I mistakenly changed the open with program of
 the prefetch or the .pf to open with a text editor. I went to change it back and it discovered that it wanted another program name to open with, it looks like it is a default program, but how do I restore the prefetch "open with" so it will properly run the
 prefetch programs. Thank you&nbsp;</p>

            Hi, Martin,
<br />
<br />Perform a System Restore to a date/time before you made the changes on the device.
<br />
<br />Press Winkey + R to open Run box
<br />Type rstrui.exe
<br />Press Enter or Ok
<br />Follow the prompts to restore the system.

            Hi Martin.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />It's concerning that a tab in Account Settings is missing?  Does it say why?  There's chronic problems with messages that Administrator has blocked functions. It usually means account corruption, requiring to create a new Admin account to sign in and compare.  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br />
<br />Another path to elevate an account to Admin is by opening a run box via Windows (flag) key + R,  type netplwiz, highlight account, then Properties, then Group Membership to choose Admin, apply and Save.
<br />
<br />If this won't work from an Admin account, or yours is missing, try enabling Built-in hidden Admin used in emergencies:  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable-disable-elevated-administrator-account-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2969-enable...</a> to try this or creating the new Admin account to set up, copy files over and then delete the old corrupted one.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Windows 10 Network Driver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nikolafilic  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Network Driver</h2>
                    <p>Hello, i'm using Windows 10 on my laptop so every now and then I experience network issue, there is a yellow triangle on my internet on task bar, and it says unidentified network there is internet on my phone and if i try to connect to other network it works
 for a while and then again do same thing. Fix is to go to Device Manager find your Network driver and manually install driver from your computer (i did tried updating online, it says Up to Date) but that's only&nbsp;temporary and it's not a long term fix. Is there
 any fix for this because i can't download anything if i leave my laptop at night or day to download.&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S: I did a fresh install of Windows 10 a few weeks ago so i don't believe that my laptop needs reinstallation, also i have problem with drivers&nbsp;in general, because sometimes when i plug my phone via USB cable it&nbsp;does not want to&nbsp;recognize it, so i again
 have to manually install driver from my computer (updating online doesen't help) Thank you.</p>

            More often than not when a device isn't working it is because the driver has become corrupted. Re-installing a fresh copy should help<br />
<br />
Completely remove the current driver and install the newest driver available.&nbsp; For instructions on how to do that Read all about updating drivers&nbsp; here http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-hardware/updating-a-driver/a5e6345e-af9b-4099-bef0-8d22254aa1c1?tm=1436753520149

<h2>            Bluetooth Keeps Getting Disabled</h2>
                    <p>
<strong>Hello</strong>,</p>
<p>
I am having a reoccuring issue on my Surface Pro 3 i7 256GB. Something is causing my bluetooth in device manager to get disabled on a regular basis. I am not sure if its related to updates, or possibly battery conservation. Has anyone experienced this?</p>
<p>
Thanks!</p>

<ul>
<li>When did this start happening?</li><li>Does wifi also get disabled when this happens?</li><li>Under what circumstances do you find Bluetooth becoming inoperative?</li><li>You mention Device Manager.&nbsp; What are you seeing there when you are experiencing this?</li><li>Can you manually confirm that all updates are installed?&nbsp; Restart Surface and check again.</li><li>Does cycling airplane mode reenable Bluetooth?</li></ul>

            <p>I think this could have been due to BitDefender Security Suite 2015. I believe it is part of its Power Save mode.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that the software does not work well with the Surface Pro 3. It had done a number of things like disabled toast notifications for several applications in the registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went ahead and performed a PC Refresh and did not install the Security Suite. I have found an increase in battery life and 20% increase in power saved when the Surface goes to sleep for 7 hours.

<p>

            <p>Hi Ming,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your interest in Windows 10!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue might arise due to corrupted boot files in Windows 10. As you have already tried to run Startup repair with the Windows 10 installation disc, I would suggest you to run bootrec utility to fix MBR and other boot files. Check if it helps.</p>
<p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>After you boot your computer using Windows DVD or System Repair Disc, a black screen appears with gray text "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD". Press any key.</span></span></p>

<h2>            AMD Radeon HD 7800 Series driver causing blank screen with cursor only</h2>
                    <p>hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a AMD computer I built myself. Its Windows 7 x64. I have a AMD video card HD 7800 Series. I use two monitors. When I use the HDMI port (on the video card) the computer has a black screen with a movable mouse cursor after booting. I can attach the
 monitor to the HDMI port after I boot and it works but not if I attached before. If I disable the video driver it works. If I start in safe mode it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a similar AMD build with a AMD 7700 card and does the same thing. I have tried reloading different drivers several times with no fix. Have you heard of such a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I forgot to mention that I have monitors in the DVI&nbsp; ports that have no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: both HDMI cables are connected to HDTV not monitors.If I disconnect the HDMI cable from the HDTV the video to the other monitors connected</p>
<p>via DVI or VGA will then perform normally.</p>

    <title>Cannot connect to internet after Windows 10 update - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brutalskills  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot connect to internet after Windows 10 update</h2>
                    after the Windows 10 updated forced itself into my computer last night, I cannot connect to the Internet. Using Ethernet, it just says "no internet". After plugging in a wireless USB adapter, the computer then allows me to connect to the Wifi, but as soon
 as I connect, "No internet, secured". I'm not very good when I comes to this sort of stuff &nbsp;but I tried troubleshooting the network adapter, it says " there might be a problem with the driver for the Local Area Connection adapter" , I press "Try these repairs
 as an administrator" and it just says&nbsp;&nbsp;" there might be a problem with the driver for the Local Area Connection adapter &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not fixed"

<h2>            Remote Web Workplace and remote printing</h2>
                    <p>At home, I have a Win7 laptop and a new HP Officejet Pro 8620 printer.&nbsp; I use Remote Web Workplace to connect to my Win7 desktop at the office (both are 64 bit).&nbsp; I installed the 8620 print drivers onto the Office PC.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I connected to the Office PC via RWW.&nbsp; The Office PC sees my 8620 printer at home&nbsp;and says 'redirect'.&nbsp; I print a test page and open the printer window to 'see what's printing', &nbsp;I see the printout spooling, then printing, then gone from the window as if
 it is done.&nbsp; But it never actually&nbsp;prints.&nbsp; My printer at home doesn't even look like it is receiving any data from RWW.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I previously had an HP Officejet model printer connected successfully.&nbsp; And, most recently, used a Lexmark Pro915.&nbsp; I need to replace the Lexmark.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After trying the 8620 without success, I reconnected the Lexmark and it works just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help!</p>

            <span>Hi,<br />
<br />
Thank you for being a part of Windows 10.<br />
<br />
The issue could be due to the Wireless card drivers not updated. Usually when you install Windows 10 all the drivers for the hardware gets installed with the operating system files. If you are facing any issues with the drivers installation, then I would suggest
 you to go to the device manager and right click on the device so that you will have the option to upgrade the drivers. If you are still facing the issue, then you can download the drivers for that particular hardware from the manufacturers website and install
 in compatibility mode. Also check with the computer manufacturer to see if there are any updated drivers for Windows 10.<br />

            My problem Isn't that Bluetooth won't turn on, it's that Bluetooth is toggled on in my Windows 10 Action Center Quick Settings and my computer isn't even equipped with Bluetooth. When I click to turn it off it takes me to my settings. Since my pc doesn't
 have Bluetooth, there's nothing in settings that will turn it off.

                    For some reason, when i open my folders, all my icons suddenly grow bigger and bigger. I try to make them smaller again, by right clicking and pressing view: small icons, but once i press that, they grow bigger again. I hope this isn't a virus and if it
 is, how do i get rid of it?&nbsp;

    <title>Windows 10 automatic updates and AMD Radeon software. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lostoutlaw57  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 automatic updates and AMD Radeon software.</h2>
                    <p>I'm not a computer professional, just an average user. But I'm experiencing an issue with the new style of windows automatic updates.<br />
<br />
For the past. I dunno year or so now it's been quite frustrating. At some point microsoft felt it would be a good idea to include AMD's video card drivers in their windows automatic update listings. so you can rest assured that your video card will have the
 newest drivers when they come out.<br />
<br />
great theory.. big problem..</p>
<p>
</p><p>AMD's own Radeon driver software already does this.. it has for years. It works fine. it also gives you the option of READING WHAT THE DRIVER IS</p>
<p>and if it even pertains to your video card or any games you currently own. you can read the driver details and see what the update is for.</p>
<p>A lot of times you can save yourself the bandwith/data and time and energy and just hold off updating for a month or so until one of them becomes actually relevant and includes some sort of update for your personal situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AMD describes their driver's in detail, something that microsoft with their still after nearly what 10 15 years horribly clunky and terrible to use update program. provides only the very basic driver information usually being a reference number.</p>
<p>Not only is it terrible at describing the updates. but its often far far behind AMD's platform. by months even.<br />
<br />
This is not even the most frustrating problem with this arrangement, I'll get to that. But returning to what I was just saying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I'm writing this I'm allowing AMD to Re-update itself. because windows decided it had found a new driver for the amd. and just went ahead and installed it.</p>
<p>This driver was 2 months old.. AMD has already released like 3 driver updates since then? and the windows update just rolled me back to an older driver.....&nbsp;<br />
<br />
so windows update does an update. and says hey you need to reboot.. i'm like cool. reboot. computer does its thing. voila im back at desktop now AMD radeon is pinging me saying hey.... there's a newer driver than the one you are currently using....... *facepalm*</p>
<p>
</p><p>This... this is not even the most frustrating part about this entire situation, as I stated above..</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have a RX580 graphics card. it's fairly common. has some hdmi outs display port. all the typical things. hdmi audio.</p>
<p>HDMI audio. lets talk about this for a second.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So AMD supplies their own driver for the HDMI audio codec.. I would imagine it's good?</p>
<p>Microsoft also has their own HDMI audio codec. I would imagine it's also just as good as the AMD and they both do their job's fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's the problem anytime the amd software updates. it installs it's own HDMI codec for the audio.</p>
<p>then microsoft on the reboot. is saying hey. we need to update your HDMI audio codec.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it's a double loop of updating nonsense... Microsoft update keeps trying to roll back my graphics driver cause its terrible.</p>
<p>And AMD is updating my hdmi audio codec. and microsoft update (again) just cannot understand that another hdmi codec could possibly exist and work just fine....<br />
<br />
<br />
Is there anything... I can do that can stop this from happening?</p>
<p>

<h2>            My sound went out while music was playing, loud grating sound for 2 seconds ...</h2>
                    magicmagic3______________________________<br />
My issue may overlap Godot's.<br />
<br />
My sound went out while music was playing, from a music site.&nbsp; I was out of the room but heard a loud vibrating, grating sound lasting a second or 2.&nbsp; I discovered I had no sound, tried to play from other sources, other sites, youtube, etc.&nbsp; NADA. I then realized
 my speaker light was off.&nbsp; I tried resetting, tried different usb ports, etc.&nbsp; NADA.&nbsp; I searched , ran microsoft checks which said my drivers are fine, hardware is fine, everything A-OK.&nbsp; but NADA.&nbsp; I did just about all the moves Godot made.prior to posting
 his problem here.. <br />
<br />
I purchased a driver reset that was recommended by PC Mag, and rest 15 drivers.&nbsp; I tried different output devece settings.&nbsp; NOTHING.&nbsp; I shopped around for new speakers, confused, but then thought it would make sense to try&nbsp; headphones.&nbsp; NADA.<br />
<br />
I think something had done an update just prior to the initial mess-up. Not sure whether it had been Firefox or Windows 10.&nbsp; That was over a month ago.<br />
<br />
TODAY!&nbsp; Oddly, a pop-up suddenly said Windows Media Player did not disconnect properly.&nbsp; - I think that was what it said, and when I followed it it said THIS APPLIES TO WINDOWS 7 !!!.&nbsp; I haven't been using Win7 for 3-4 years.&nbsp; Can an update from Windows&nbsp; have
 confused my sound system?&nbsp; Switched it back to Win 7?&nbsp; FORGIVE MY IGNORANCE!<br />
<br />
Where can I go from here?&nbsp; Dell Inspiron desktop 7 year old comp, in use 6 years, orig used Win 7.&nbsp; Lots of unused potential, because I don't download movies.&nbsp; Music on my computer involves my own music
<br />
only, essentially, plus use of music sites like youtube, etc.&nbsp; - without much downloading.<br />
<br />
Does this make any sense?&nbsp; Your help would be very, very much appreciated. -from&nbsp;&nbsp; magicmagic3<br />

<p>Vijay, thanks for your help.&nbsp; So far it's not solved.&nbsp; I'll give details.&nbsp; On #1 and #2 I followed all your directions (which looked more complex than they turned out to be!)&nbsp; You make everything very clear.&nbsp;&nbsp; I updated all the drivers and got the message
 that the best drivers were already installed, but simultaneously on some there's a message that the manufacrurer might have a better one.<br />
<br />
Finally I got a message that I followed and got a report with a red X saying that updates on 3/18/2019 had failed.&nbsp; Below it said Update for windows Defender Anti-virus KB2267602<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; 1.2091467.0&nbsp; Error Ox80248007<br />
<br />
Then I moved on to instruction #3.&nbsp; When I type 'sound' into the window, nothing happens.&nbsp; When I clicked several times on that a window&nbsp; opened for SOUND.COM ! - an ad vor music supplies.&nbsp; I don't have great luck with that search box!<br />
<br />
Incidentally, windows did an update late yesterday, so it's odd that the message I received, above, doesn't seem to take it into account.&nbsp; It says that the update on 3/18 failed.&nbsp; So many of the messages are contradictory.<br />
<br />
<br />
,I have to do #3 another way.&nbsp; So far no sound!&nbsp;&nbsp; I tested everthing: speakers, trying both settings, and speakers as well.&nbsp; Not a squeak, ever.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your help would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>P.S. I have to restart now because they pestered me about the need to restart in order to fully install the drivers that were changed.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thanks again,<br />
<br />

<p>The restart which&nbsp; installed the new drivers, (whatever they were!) has not fixed the problem.&nbsp; There's no sound. Not even the sound of windows starting, Nothing.</p>

            I tried Step 1. &nbsp;All that did was pause the screen blinking. It did not open the settings menu. I can't try Step 2 because with the screen blinking, I can't possibly type anything into the search bar to open the command prompt. Yes, I could Con-Alt-Del
 and Shift-Restart to get to the command prompt, but since the point of this little excercise is to reset the Admin password that is required before I can do anything on this screen, it's pretty pointless to use the Shift-Restart method. How about giving me
 a 'fix' that actually fixes a problem....ANY of the half dozen problems the update has created? What do you say?&nbsp;
