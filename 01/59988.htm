<p><strong>I am trying to recover my system via repair from the Windows Vista Ultimate 64-bit DVD. &nbsp;How many hours should it take for a 1 TB partition? &nbsp;The partition is on a RAID 1. &nbsp;I have a second volume of 1 TB and I'm wondering whether it's trying to recover
 that too, but the OS is only on the C: volume. &nbsp;Any answers are greatly appreciated</strong></p>

<p>It should only take a couple of hours - with that size disk and depending on how full it is it may take as much as 4 hours or so (perhaps even a little longer).&nbsp; If it''s been going on for 12 hours or longer, then it is almost certainly frozen and no longer
 working.&nbsp; The problem is that shutting down a system in the middle of a system repair can cause great harm to the operating system to the point that the only option is a clean install (so I hope you backed up you data before you started).&nbsp; Even if the system
 boots (and it may not), the chances of trying another repair are greatly diminished.&nbsp; But if the system has been going for that long and is still not done, then you can wait a little longer (say another day) just to be absolutely certain or you can bite the
 bullet, power off the system, and pray it still works or that you can repeat the system repair process.&nbsp; If you do regain any kind of access and don't have a backup, do one as soon as possible as the chances of the system crashing or refusing to boot are greatly
 increased after such an event so do the backup while you still can (if you still can).</p>
<p>Frankly, I'm not certain how it operates with RAID 1.&nbsp; I suspect it does the repair on C: drive and either concurrently makes the changes to the other drive or waits until it is done and then changes the other drive after the first has been repaired.&nbsp; I'm
 not sure if it will "release" the system before both drives are again identical or if it will do so once C: drive has been completed. If it needs to do both before completing the process, then double the times I listed above (which means waiting another day
 may be an even wiser choice).&nbsp; The worst you have to lose is another day without your computer if it is still working on the repair.&nbsp; I would be patient because the alternative if it comes to that is very often unpleasant to say the least.</p>
<p>If you have no backup and can't boot normally or to safe mode after this, you can try<span>Knoppix
</span><span><a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;with
 a good ISO copier like: </span><span><a href="http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/isorecorder.htm</span></span></a></span><span>&nbsp;along
 with a blank CD (made on a different computer).&nbsp; Boot to the disk.&nbsp; This&nbsp;might give you enough access to the system (if you can't get in any other way) to backup your important data.&nbsp; If that doesn't work, try slaving the hard drive to another computer and
 see if you can access it with the other computer.&nbsp; If so, you should be able to backup your important data.&nbsp; If not, then the only way to possibly recover the data would be to take the drive to a data recovery technician (who will charge a fortune and offer
 no guarantees).&nbsp; Or you can just write off the data and proceed with a clean install.</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps.</span></p>

            <p><strong>Normally you need yo use software that supports layers, think of it like this:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The original image is on the bottom, then you add a layer on top which has the second image</li><li>Then you can edit the top layer to take out the background to superimpose a person from the top layer onto the image on the second layer. When you are finished, you flatten the layers into one image</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Fresh Paint does not currently support layers, though this option is talked about as a future update . . .</p>

Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the Start Screen, you can right click a Tile for an app.</p>
<p>On the bottom Toolbar, select Open File Location.</p>
<p>Note: This only works for the traditional Windows apps. It will not work for the Store Apps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the Desktop.</p>
<p>Right click the shortcut, select Properties and click the Open File Location button.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t access incoming mail from Windows Mail</h2>
                    Incoming mail has suddenly stopped working on Windows Mail. I can send email messages but I keep getting 'no new messages' but they go into my Virgin Media mailbox, which I prefer not to use.&nbsp;

            <p>You're probably reading messages somewhere else as well, like on a smart phone. Virgin uses Google for its mail service, and Gmail only allows messages to be downloaded once to a mail client. You can change this by using what Google call

            I am not using a smart phone or any other devices, I am using Windows 7 on a desktop it's my only computer. I am not able to access Windows Mail at all now where all my contacts, calendar, etc. are. A dialogue box comes up and tells me I'm not connected.
 I can see Windows Mail in my programs but I can't access it. I'm worried about losing everything. I can access my emails not contacts through the virgin media program which usually &nbsp;I don't use. I just want to be able to open Windows Mail.

    <title>Disk Partition in Windows UPDATE&#33; UPDATE&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jersey-devil  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disk Partition in Windows  UPDATE&#33; UPDATE&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Original Title********350MB Partition************</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 350MB System Reserve partition is gone from my system drive containing Windows 8.1 Update 1 and its chickens.&nbsp; My computer runs fine for everything I currently do.&nbsp; However, I can't update a clone of my system drive to Windows 10 Build 10061 (or even
 10049) because the 350MB partition is gone, which probably means I can never update that software to the released version of Windows 10 in perhaps late July.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, do I have to install a fresh copy of Windows 8 from my original installation CD, then do all the updates of Windows 8, then update to Windows 8.1 and do all its updates including Update 1, and finally update to Windows 10 Build 10061?&nbsp; Or, is there someway
 I can restore the 350MB partition or somehow install Windows 10 Build 10061 from scratch on a clean drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ignoring the 350MB partition issue for the moment, I would really like a fresh copy of the released version of Windows 10 anyway rather than updating an installation that's been through a zillion changes since I first installed Windows 8 back when it was
 $40 a copy.&nbsp; In fact, I suspect a lot of people would like a brand spanking new copy of Windows 10 when it's released.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Back in the day, I recall trying to install Windows ME over a Windows 98SE installation and failing miserably.&nbsp; Then, I got an OEM version of Windows ME, and it installed easily, and I didn't have any problems with ME.&nbsp; I've always suspected the many complaints
 about ME were from users who installed ME over 98SE.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Since I wrote the above post, strange and wonderful things have happed.&nbsp; Let me explain.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Thinking I might use my terabyte hard drive to perhaps create a clean installation of Build 10061, I enabled that drive and my main drive, which is a 250MB SDD running Windows 8.1 Update 1.&nbsp; After booting, I was surprised to find the missing 350MB
 partition was there -- returned from the dead.&nbsp; Not sure whether that partition was on the SSD or hard drive, I rebooted using just the hard drive.&nbsp; Poof!&nbsp; The 350MB partition was gone.&nbsp; However, I found the hard drive contained software from my first installation
 of Build 10041,&nbsp; So I thought, what the hell, and initiated the downloading of Build 10061.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>After becoming spoiled with the speed of an SSD, I was first sad to have to work with a hard drive again.&nbsp; However, stuff began being&nbsp;installed.&nbsp; When the computer got to the downloading and installation of Build 10061, I expected the downloading
 would abort and present an error message saying it couldn't find a 350MB partition on my hard drive.&nbsp; However, the computer and the upgrade continued chugging, which took hours!&nbsp; Finally, the smoke cleared, and there on my computer was Build 10061 in all its
 glory.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I haven't had time to play with Build 10061, but it's about what I expected after reading many articles about it.&nbsp; However, the link to Office 365 is broken.&nbsp; So, I guess I'll have to install Office 365 on my hard drive containing Build 10061.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>But wait!&nbsp; Do I really need Office 365?&nbsp; I mean I have the in-progress apps for Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, OneNote 2013, Outlook 2013, and the web version of OneDrive.&nbsp; True, I would lose the one-terabyte of data that comes with Office 365, but
 I have many gigabytes of data that I've acquired for free since way back when I was an early adopter of SkyDrive (aka OneDrive).</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So, thanks to everyone who attempted to help me get Build 10061 installed.&nbsp; However, the mystery of the appearing and disappearing 350MB partition remains.&nbsp; I haven't yet installed my SSD containing my current Windows 8.1 Update 1 setup and all its
 chickens.&nbsp; Will the partition be on that drive again or not?&nbsp; Stay tuned.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I booted my SSD containing my Windows 8.1 Update 1 and all its chickens.&nbsp; Guess what?&nbsp; The 350MB partition is not to be found on the SSD.&nbsp; What's up with the appearing and disappearing of that partition?&nbsp; I assume that partition is on my hard drive
 containing Build 10061 or the build wouldn't have installed, but there's no visual indication of it being there.</strong></p>

<p>Thank you for responding.</p>

</p><p>I am not "trying" to clone anything.&nbsp; I've been successfully cloning for backup and other purposes for many, many years.&nbsp; Initially, I believe I used Ghost and then switched to Acronis, which I've used successfully for many years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tower of my desktop computer is equipped with several devices generally known as mobile racks.&nbsp; These racks allow me to install drives in trays, which can then be quickly installed and removed from the racks.&nbsp; Three of the racks are 5.25-inch devices,
 one of which is a parallel device and the other two are SATA devices.&nbsp; In addition, I have a 3.5-inch rack that supports two Samsung SSDs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, I'm only using the SSDs.&nbsp; One of those contains 64-bit Windows 8.1 Update 1 and all its chickens, which I use for my day-to-day computing.&nbsp; The other SSD contains 64-bit Windows 10 Build 10031 and its chickens, which I use for testing Windows
 10.&nbsp; However, this drive cannot be updated to Build 10049 or 10061 because it doesn't contain the 350MB partition.&nbsp; The Windows 10 installation was made by cloning my Windows 8.1 Update 1 installation, which also does not have a 350MB partition for unknown
 reasons.&nbsp; However, I know that partition was there in the past.&nbsp; Curiously, Build 1041 installed on a cloned drive without the 350MB partition.&nbsp; That installation is alive and well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try the procedure you suggest.&nbsp; However, I think I tried that or a similar procedure before, and it didn't work.&nbsp; I think the message said something like the software can't be repaired.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All that said, I say again&nbsp;I would really like something akin to an OEM version of the released version of Windows 10 so I'm left with a clean installation.&nbsp; I don't trust installing the released version of Windows 10 over a Windows 8.1 Update 1 that began
 with the 40-dollar download of Windows 8 many moons ago with zillions of updates and clonings&nbsp;since then -- even if the 350MB partition can be restored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, my Dell Venue 8 Pro tablet is running 32-bit Windows 8.1 Update 1, and it doesn't have a 350MB partition either.&nbsp; That Windows installation is a factory installation, which has been updated but never cloned.&nbsp; So, what happened to that 350MB partition,
 assuming it ever existed?&nbsp; Even if it had the partition, I'm not looking forward to updating that installation to the released Windows 10.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Here is one definition of disk cloning:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/disk-cloning</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>In my view, disk cloning is the process of making an exact copy of the contents of one storage medium (e.g., SSD) onto another storage medium (e.g., hard drive).&nbsp; Software such as offered by Acronis provides a means to clone software.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can't see system reserved partition it doesn't mean that partition is not there, it could be hidden.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be hidden so bad that even 3rd party software such as <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">

<p>
</p><p>https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh825686.aspx</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I will study that link, for I seem to recall some time ago I noticed the partition wasn't there, but then it came back.&nbsp; Now, the 350MB partition can't be seen on any 64-bit Windows 8.1 or 10 installation on my desktop computer nor on my 32-bit Windows
 8.1 installation on my tablet computer, which I find a bit strange.&nbsp; In addition to Acronis, Windows 10 Builds 10049 and 10061 report the partition isn't there on my desktop computer.&nbsp; So, I'm inclined to believe the partition is gone, but I have no idea how
 it could be gone from two computers.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to delay all this until Windows 10 Release come out and then try to use Upgrade assistant which is currently not available since Windows 10 release doesn't exist yes.</p>

<p>
</p><p>But for Windows 10 it's better to wait.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I'd somewhat decided to wait for the released version of Windows 10.&nbsp; However, I'm concerned it won't be possible to install released Windows 10 over a Windows 8.1 Update 1 installation if there is no 350MB partition.&nbsp; Because of that concern and
 because I'd like a completely fresh installation of released Windows 10, I'd like to be able to install Windows 10 from some sort of an OEM version of Windows 10 that allows a brand spanking new installation.&nbsp; As previously explained, an OEM installation disk
 was the solution to the Windows 98SE/ME upgrade way back when.&nbsp; This could be d</strong><strong>éjà vu all over again.</strong></p>

            <div>&gt;This has impacted customers after installing the Fall Creators Update. Does the pen fail to write as well when in this condition? others have found that going into device manager and disabling/enabling the "Intel(R) Precise Touch Device" in device manager made both the pen and the multi-touch work again. Less disruptive than restarting. And the problem will probably re-occur. </div>
<div>&gt;</div>
<div>&gt;Open device manager,&nbsp; Click on human interface devices to expand it and it should be near the bottom of the list. This is a temporary fix and the issue may return, but for now, it is the only work around. Engineering asked that anyone afflicted with this use the Feedback Hub App to send in a bug while in the bad state before disabling/re-enabling so that they can get the logs.</div>

<p>The pen, touch screen at one stage totally not responding,&nbsp; I am not so good in doing such trouble shooting so just rely of the keyboard while the above 2 were not functioning, one day when trying to switch on after start up screen hang too long I force
 close the PC and surprisingly the pen and touch came back after the force close and start again.</p>
<p>However there are some minor issue like a character on touch screen keyboard not working,&nbsp; not easy to re-size when trying to use multi screen.&nbsp; Not sure was it due to my trying to calibrating the touch ....</p>

            <p>When you attempt to upgrade to Windows 10, it will perform compatibility check and if the application is not compatible, it will notify you. In most cases, your application would work on Windows 10 if they have been working in Windows 7 and Windows 8. But
 if there was any compatibility issue, you may run it in compatibility mode.</p>
<p>So I suggest perform upgrade and if there is a issue, you will notify before upgrade and if there was any issue even after upgrade like it didn't work, you have 30 days, to revert back to previous version of Windows.</p>

<h2>            Mail in Windows 10 - Contacts</h2>
                    <p>Welcome to the "wonderful world of&nbsp; Windows 10".&nbsp; Has anything not gone down hill?&nbsp; I have tried for three hours to find anything anywhere that will tell me how to add a new contact to my contacts.&nbsp; I go from link to link to link and it takes me in a circle
 back to where I started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to add contacts in Windows Mail 10?&nbsp; I think it's like the inability to permanently&nbsp;change the default font in Mail.&nbsp; Seems it's not going to happen.</p>

<h2>            Windows stuck at logging off screen after trying to shutdown</h2>
                    I'm putting in this forum as the other post was in the wrong forum.<br />
Windows Vista Home on an HP desktop computer. I try to shutdown and the computer stays with the logging off screen with the little circle thingy going round and round. It never goes away until I hold down the power button for awhile then the computer turns
 off. It won't shutdown by itself. When I restart it after I get it to shutdown with the power button, It gives me a screen saying windows was not shutdown properly and gives me different choices on how to restart it. I choose start windows normally and windows
 starts up fine but won't shut down. It gets stuck at the logging off screen. What the heck is wrong?

            <span>Shutdown issues are generally caused by a program and/or process that is refusing to exit gracefully. The program and/or process can be from malware or can be legitimate (such as an invasive antivirus like Norton or McAfee).
 If you are using a Norton or McAfee product,&nbsp; uninstall it and replace with a better program such as NOD32, Kasperksy, or Avast (free). The Windows Firewall is adequate for most people. With Vista, shutdown issues can also be caused by old/poorly written drivers
 so make sure all drivers are updated. See Step B. below for general driver directions.<br />
<br />
A.The first step is always to make sure your computer is virus/malware free.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware</a>
<br />
<br />
B. Drivers - The First Law of Driver Updates is "if it ain't broke, don't fix it". Normally if everything is working you want to leave things as they are. The exception is that heavy-duty gamers will usually want to update their video and sound drivers to squeeze
 every last bit of performance out of the hardware to get the fastest frame rates. If you're not one of those people, you don't need to update your drivers if there are no problems you are trying to solve.<br />
<br />
Never get drivers from Windows Update. Get them from:<br />
<br />
1. The device mftr.'s website; OR<br />
2. The motherboard mftr.'s website if hardware is onboard; OR<br />
3. The OEM's website for your specific machine if you have an OEM computer (HP, Dell, Sony, etc.).<br />
<br />
Read the installation instructions on the website where you get the drivers.<br />
<br />
To find out what hardware is in your computer:<br />
<br />
1. Read any documentation you got when you bought the computer.<br />
2. If the computer is OEM, go to the OEM's website for your specific model machine and look at the specs (you'll be there to get the drivers anyway)<br />
3. Download, install and run a free system inventory program like Belarc Advisor or System Information for Windows.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html</a> - Belarc Advisor<br />
<a href="http://www.gtopala.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.gtopala.com/</a> - System Information for Windows<br />
<br />
C. If the computer is virus/malware-free, drivers are current, and no Norton or McAfee programs are installed, then do clean-boot troubleshooting to see which program/process is the culprit:<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Standard caveat: If troubleshooting the issue is too difficult - and there is absolutely no shame in admitting this isn't your cup of tea - take the machine to a computer repair shop. This will not be your local BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place. Get
 recommendations from family, friends, colleagues.</span>

            I did the clean boot but that didn't help either. I scanned with Adaware SE but it found nothing. The computer would quit responding to programs the longer it was used. I tried to install Vista updates which took forever because it would just quit installing
 the updates. Finally after&nbsp; numerous tries and a lot of cussing, I got all the updates installed along with some of the HP updates. I installed AVG and had it scan the computer. It didn't find anything. It appears the updates may have solved the problem.<br />

<h2>            How do I remove a RAID array on my Windows 7 Pro PC &#40;and will I live to regret it&#41;&#63;</h2>
                    I just got an older (Dell Dimension 9200) PC from work for my personal use. I upgraded it from VISTA to Windows 7 Pro, loaded on&nbsp;my software and thought I was all set.&nbsp; THEN I discovered that the computer had two hard drives (320 GB) in a RAID array!&nbsp;
 I THINK it's a 0 RAID because all that shows up in WIndows Explorer is a single 320GB hard drive.&nbsp; I had planned on&nbsp;adding a 1TB disk as my second drive.&nbsp; How do I get rid of the RAID? Will I have to install Windows and all my programs all over again? (groan)

Your point is well taken, but I wish you had answered the question.</p>
<p>What about the RAID?&nbsp; How do I get rid of&nbsp;it so I have two drives again? Will breaking it mess up my install so I have to do everything all over again? Will it even LET me? I bought the UPGRADE version of Win 7 Pro, and not the full install. If I zap the
 drives, will Win 7 even know that Vista was once on the machine?</p>

            <p>Seeing a single drive in explorer, or Disk Management could mean its either raid 0 or 1</p>
<p>If raid&nbsp;0 removeing the raid array will kill the system and require a complete reinstall, although I believe you have raid 1</p>
<p>If raid&nbsp;1 you simply disconnect one drive, and depending on how raid was implimented adjust the bios settings, once done reconnect the other drive and in Disk Management delete its partition, then recreate a partition &amp; format</p>
<p>And no if the system is 'zapped' the win7 upgrade requires the previous o/s to be installed first</p>

<p>As Columbo used to say... "Uh, there's just one more thing..."</p>
<p>How can I tell what type of RAID is set up?&nbsp; Check the BIOS?&nbsp; I've looked at Device Manager and Disk Management and all they tell me is I have one disk, "C:".&nbsp; The Dell system config told me the original computer came with (2) 250GB drives (which I see in
 the cabinet).&nbsp; I used the Dell scan tool to check the current&nbsp;configuration and that tells me there's only one 238.8GB drive in there.&nbsp; Sounds like a RAID 0 to ME, but I'm a dope.&nbsp;

                    <p><span>Hi, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>My wifi connection drops out at random intervals, and has been doing so for several months (manages between 10 minutes to several hours connectivity). When this happens, only a reboot is sufficient to restore the wifi connection.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Troubleshooting doesn't work - it hangs, eventually completes unsuccessfully (tells me a lan cable must be disconnected), and a reboot is required which invariably results in a blue screen with a DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE error message. The exact
 same thing happens if I manually switch the wifi adapter off and on in the device manager (needs reboot to restore wifi resulting in a blue screen). The adapter shows as working in the device manager the whole time.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>No other devices in my house have this issue and the PC is only a few months old. I have tried the following to no avail (not an exhaustive list, certainly tried other things that I don;t recall right now):</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 21pt"><span>-<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span>Manually installed the latest drivers for the wifi adapter (and my motherboard and BIOS) from the manufacturers website (many times)</span></p>

 one wifi network other than my own. The dropouts can occur when the PC is the only device connected to the network and no other nearby electrical devices are switched on.</span></p>

            <p>Hi RJD,<br />
<br />
You've actually performed the basic workarounds to address this kind of problem. However, we would like to know if this computer has properly connected to the network before. If it did, were there any changes or updates performed on your computer before the
 issue appeared?<br />
<br />
By the way, how far is your computer from the router? If it's very close, move your computer 6 to 10 feet away from the router and see if the connection improves. If not, try changing the channel of your wireless network to either channel 1, 6, or 11. Change
 also the channel width to 20 MHz only.</p>
<p><br />
Update us on how it goes so we can further assist you. You may check out <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4000432/windows-10-fix-wi-fi-problems" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

            <p>Hi Vanessa,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue has been around since I first bought the PC about 4 months ago. Hard to tell if its software related as I installed my antivirus and VPN, and let windows install updates, as soon as I got the machine (not sure what else could interfere but I'm
 not an expert). It connects to the network with no issues when the machine first boots up. Sometimes it will drop out within a few minutes, sometimes it remains connected for a few hours, and only a reboot resolves the issue. The wifi card shows as working
 the whole time. The PC sits around 8 - 10 foot away from the router at present.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll try your suggestions regards the router configuration and post again. Another thing that is perhaps relevant to note - when the wifi drops out, the wifi icon briefly disapears and is replaced with a LAN icon, before reappearing but showing no signal/detecting
 no networks. Might this imply that the wifi adapter is being switched off/reset/temporarily losing power?</p>
<p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Definitely check the router and be sure it is running the latest firmware.<br />
<br />
<strong>PC is only 4 months old so you really need to be working with the System Maker's Support as their could be a hardware issue with the WiFi device.</strong><br />
<br />
Since there was a BSOD event it would be a good idea to check out the issue from that angle.<br />

=====================================================<br />
<br />
This "could" be a power supply problem though it is not the most common cause.</span></p>
<p><span>9f is&nbsp;likely a driver issue.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispyware/security programs can also cause
<br />
these issues.<br />
<br />
Have you added devices lately or updated drivers - be sure to check in Windows <br />
Updates to see if a driver was updated prior to this occurring. This could also be
<br />
caused by a loose card or cable and even a weak power supply.<br />
<br />
That error means a driver is not handling the power state properly. Check in <br />
Control Panel - Device Manager to be sure major drivers are not shut off <br />
during sleep - double click Display Adapter - NIC and WIFI - Sound and <br />
others - Power Management tab - uncheck Allow computer to turn off power. <br />
Maybe only one has an issue.<br />
<br />
<strong>(Use RUN&nbsp;instead of Start - Search as used on Vista or Windows 7)<br />
<br />
WINKEY + X - RUN - type in MSCONFIG.exe<br />
<br />
General Tab - check Diagnostic Start&nbsp; - APPLY / OK&nbsp; -&nbsp; REBOOT<br />
<br />
Try it now. If it still blue screens think Video Driver. If not think NIC, Wifi, <br />
Sound, or.....(and it still could be video interacting with something else). <br />
See&nbsp;troubleshooter link above for my generic driver update methods.<br />

<span><br />
</span></p>
----------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
<strong>This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :</strong><br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<strong>&nbsp; Run DriverView</strong> -<br />
<strong>set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers </strong>- update those without Dump in their
<br />
names.&nbsp;(<strong>also update the BIOS and low level chipset drivers</strong>)<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your&nbsp;system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address&nbsp;of the driver, description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and&nbsp;more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 170, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down<br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click Update Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and <br />
Keyboard if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other <br />
major device drivers you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) <br />
and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get <br />
their latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System <br />
Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT <span>After each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER <br />
– </span><span>Check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p>&nbsp;_____________________________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
After doing ALL the updates you can, and if the issue continues, then run <br />
DriverVerifier.&nbsp;(Remember to use the Windows 8/8.1 methods posted at the <br />

<p><br />
WINKEY + X - RUN - type in -&gt; verifier /reset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit enter to disable</p>
<p><br />
Use BlueScreenView to see if there is a driver specified in the error message. <br />
Also check with&nbsp;MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen.<br />
<br />
If Driver Verifier creates a minidump upload it and post the link here so we <br />

                    Every new version of Skype released seems to not work properly.&nbsp; The only solution being provided is "go back to classic skype".&nbsp; Why every time you release an update in windows 10 does skype keep loading on my computer?&nbsp; Then when I attempt to use it
 and it does not work, I am told to go back to classic skype again.&nbsp; Why don't you eliminate skype for windows 10 and only release it once it actually works?

    <title>Svchost Memory Leak Issue on Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> aldis_whylita  say:</h3>
<h2>            Svchost Memory Leak Issue on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Heyo everyone. I'm running a new computer, running Windows 10 and with 16 GB of ram. I have noticed that after several hours of running, either through normal web browsing or playing some games, svchost would be eating up to around a gig of memory, with
 the amount it continues to use slowly rising. This svchost.exe is responsible for such things as User Manager, Themes, IP Helper and Delivery Optimization, among other processes. This has been annoying me immensely, and I have yet to find a solution after
 half a day of troubleshooting. Is there any way I could get it to not eat so much memory? It has yet to truly bog down my system, but I much rather be careful about it. Restarting temporary fixes the issue, and after a reboot it is within 20 MB of ram before
 it slowly climbs back up again. The full processes that this svchost is in control of are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Delivery Optimization<br />
Background Intelligent Transfer Service<br />
Windows Push Notifications System Service<br />
Windows Management Instrumentation<br />
User Manager<br />
Themes<br />
Shell Hardware Detection<br />
System Event Notification Service<br />
Task Scheduler<br />
User Profile Service<br />
Geolocation Service<br />
Server<br />
IP Helper<br />
IKE and AuthIP IPsec Keying Modules<br />
Application Information</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help with this would be greatly appreciated.<br />

            Alright, after using msconfig to stopping and starting these processes, I think I have an idea on what is going on now. It appears there is a conflict between Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) and IP Helper. If one is running and the other one is
 stopped, then no gradual memory leak appears to occur. &nbsp;When both of these two are active, then the memory leak appears once more. As WMI is used by various software and hardware, such as my 360 controller, they will no longer properly perform as intended
 when it is stopped. I'm currently doing things with IP Helper disabled, and the only downside I noticed was that it took about 5 seconds to connect to my wireless router upon a restart. I hope this helps people, should anyone read this.

<h2>            My battery says it has 85&#37; available, plugged in, not charging.</h2>
                    It started out at 87% a couple of days ago. I tried all the "fix"<br />
&nbsp;suggestions. Nothing worked. I bought a new A/C adapter and used it. Still says the same thing. How can I fix this?

            The BIOS will give a better view of condition.On a laptop,2 batteries exist,one is the MB battery 2032 type,the other is the removable storage battery.the 2032 requires removal of keyboard &amp; plastic trim pieces,a pc shop is a good idea for that,plus some
 2032 have sodder tabs done thru the factory..However,both batteries can be faulty &amp; pc still runs ok,this being the battery charger is connected 100% of the time...Try a volt meter on plug in to pc,the pc mfg has specific out-put levels or it will not charge
 pc to operate.Plus,once the right charger is connected,wait 20 minutes before pc start...

</p><p>Some laptop manufacturers -- and I know Lenovo is included in this -- include a utility program that can be set to limit the maximum charge level of the battery on the theory that doing this prolongs battery life.</p>

            Hello chowdhuryrasul21 - 
<br />
<br />I'd like to help you get this issue resolved. You say you cannot save to your C: drive. 
<br />
<br />Is this a personal computer or a work computer?
<br />Were you able to save directly to the C: drive previously?
<br />If you were able to save directly to the C: drive previously, did you install any software or Windows updates right before you were unable to save directly to the C: drive?       
        </p>

            Hello Chowdury.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />What is the antivirus? I'd uninstall it and use built-in Defender to troubleshoot this.
<br />
<br />If you type Defender Security Center in Start Search, open it, then choose Virus and Threat Protection Settings, is Controlled Folder Access turned On?
<br />
<br />Also in Security Center under App and Browser Control, is Check Apps and Files set to Block?  Change to Warn.  
<br />
<br />Is Device Guard enabled?  <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/68913-enable-disable-device-guard-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/68913-enabl...</a>
<br />
<br />This may have been caused by Windows Updates.  Check which Updates were installed right before the problem began, and if necessary uninstall them from Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History.
<br />
<br />You can also try to roll back using System Restore to a point before this began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />Then if the Update installs and causes the same problem again uninstall or roll it back again, then immediately hide it using the Hide Updates tool from Method Two here:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automatic-updates-install-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/fixing-windows-10-automat...</a>
<br />
<br />If necessary try taking ownership of any folders that won't allow access:  <a href="https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option-in-file-folder-context-menu-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/add-take-ownership-option...</a>
<br />
<br />Try this:  
<br />
<br />Right click Start button to open Run box, copy and paste in netplwiz, press Enter.
<br />
<br />Highlight your account, then click Properties, then Group Membership tab.  click on Administrator, then Apply, OK, restart PC.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't help then try this: <a href="https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-lost-administrative-rights-in-windows-10#comment-334148" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.kapilarya.com/fix-lost-administrati...</a>
<br />
<br />If nothing helps try creating a new Local Admin Account to sign into to see if it works:  <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a-new-local-user-account-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogeek.com/226540/how-to-create-a...</a>
<br />
<br />If you can't get the rights to do this then use whichever method works here to enable the hidden Built-in Administrator to be used only in emergencies:  <a href="http://www.top-password.com/blog/4-ways-to-enable-built-in-administrator-account-on-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.top-password.com/blog/4-ways-to-enab...</a>.  
<br />
<br />Sign into Hidden Admin account, set up new Local Admin Account, sign into it, move your files over, set it up, hide the Hidden Admin Account, when ready delete the old account in Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Family and Other Users.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps what I'd do at this point is wait a few days for Spring Creators Update to be released, install Media Creation Tool from this link and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />You can monitor the Windows 10 Blog here to get notified of the exact date for release of Spring Creators Version 1803 which is soon:   <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#utpDefLLBfmPO4gr.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#ut...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi chowdhuryrasul21,
<br />
<br />Windows 10 is different to all previous versions of Windows. It does not want you saving files to the root of your C drive - don;t ask me the logic behind it - maybe it is because the hidden system files reside there and Microsoft don't want users deleting them by accident
<br />
<br />Even if you right click in the root of your C Drive the only option is to create a new folder . . .
<br />
<br />So while you can save files on your C Drive, it is probably best to just create a new folder on your C Drive and put your files in there . . .

<h2>            Snapseed and windows 7.</h2>
                    <p>Hello there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone please advise me where I would be able to safely download to my PC which is running Windows 7 a copy of the app Snapseed the phot editing suite. I would really appreciate any help or suggestions.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried simply asking my pc to find sites but some of the stuff that comes up looks so dodgy I wouldn't even open the page.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers everyone.</p>
<p>

<p>Hello Andre.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for getting in touch, I haven't done anything yet except post this question on here today. I'm not what you would call a techy to be honest so I will try and find a way of contacting the snapseed people and seeing if they can help me in any way.
 If I get some joy I will let you know but in the meantime thank you very much for taking the time to post your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers, Steve......</p>
