<h2>            After 8 failed Windows 10 installations tried, how do I clear the red x and Try Again button in Windows Update&#63;</h2>
                    I have Windows 7 installed. I have tried to upgrade to Windows 10 8 times and failed each time. Each time the Download took 8 to 10 hours and installation in excess of 12 hours. Now when I try to check for updates Windows Update displays a start window
 with a Red side bar and a Red circle with a white x and a Try Again button. It will not check for updates when the command to do so is clicked. It goes to the page and does nothing. Short of a complete system reinstall how do I cure this?

            <p>My Windows 7 install was and is SP1 and has all updates installed up until those coming starting 3 days ago. The first installation was from the download started by&nbsp; the Microsoft upgrade app. My laptop meets all requirements for Windows 10. I have downloaded
 Three versions of the media creation tool each time specifying United Stated English which is installed on my laptop. All three were aborted (with no problem) when I was notified that the version was not the language installed on my computer and I would have
 to install an new language pack after I was finished installing Windows 10. These are not included in my original question. Counting these I have tried 11 times. What I have decided to do is not install Windows 10 so I need to clear out all attempts by Windows
 Upgrade to insist I install Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your post was not helpful to me as you suggested I do what I had already done and was asking how to get rid of the mess made by the Windows 10 failures.</p>

            <p>It is now Aug 25 and the problem still exists. It seems like Microsoft does not know how to cure the Windows 10 update problems and failures. I have had one item update properly, my Dell Venue 8 Pro Tablet works like Windows 10 should.</p>
<p>But as Windows 10 is a Desktop program it does not make for a good experience on an 8" tablet. Almost all of the tap and swipe functions are gone and the Start Menu is almost unusable as it the type size is way to small. For&nbsp;an&nbsp;8" tablet Windows 8.1 is far
 better to use and works better than Windows 10.&nbsp;The one good thing about Windows&nbsp;10 on an 8" tablet is the improved mail app. Put that app on Windows 8.1 and the Tablet would be MUCH, MUCH BETTER.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I still need to know how to get rid of the&nbsp;Windows Update problem but a repeat of all the same stuff that I have seen will not due. Windows 10 is not ready for a laptop. I see way to many&nbsp;post about failed laptop updates.</p>

<h2>            error message &#34;the properties for thisitem are not available&#34; when I use Windows 10 File Explorer</h2>
                    <p>My problem started back in Windows 7/32bit on a Dell Vostro. &nbsp;At first only some folders caused Windows Explorer to CRASH when I tried to find properties on the folders. &nbsp;Then some files started having the same problem. &nbsp;Since I upgraded to Windows 10 &nbsp;I
 get the error message &nbsp;"the properties for this item are not available" when I bring up File Explorer and click on properties. I have run the SCM scann and it says I do not have any problems. &nbsp;I am the administrator and own the folder and files causing the
 problem. &nbsp;I read the response to this problem in the Windows 7 meeting. &nbsp;I cannot find key in my system items.</p>

            <p>DM,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the start on Trouble shooting this problem. &nbsp;Here is what I found out.</p>
<p>The problem still exists in SAFE MODE. &nbsp; Here is a more detailed description of the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; When I try to do “right-click properties” on a flash drive that I just inserted or any folder under “Local Disk (C:)”. When I do this FILE EXPLORER(FE) hangs and will not even let me do anything, even bring up task manager unless I do ctrl-alt-del.
 &nbsp;When I do, I see that “Window Problem Report” is taking up 51% of the CPU.&nbsp;&nbsp; The process eventually ends, FE crashes and I get a red X error message “The properties for this item are not available” &nbsp;The strange thing is that I am able to see the properties
 using the icon on option bar at the top of the FE window.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This same problem happens if I try to create or rename a folder under the “Local Disk (C:)” section of the FE window.&nbsp; The new folder is created or renamed but FE crashed. &nbsp;It also crashes if&nbsp; I try to cut and paste into the new folder but it does allow
 me to drag and copy the files and then delete the files I copied from the flash drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The “right-click properties” problem still exists in SAFE MODE. Although there is another side effect after FE crashes.&nbsp; Most of my icons disappear from the task bar and when I try to bring up the start menu or the Windows key menu, it only flashes on the
 screen momentarily. The search bar is also inoperable. The RENAME function works if I do it on the entry under
<strong>This PC/Documents</strong> but if I try to do it under &nbsp;<strong>Local Disk (C:)/Users/Mel/Documents</strong> FE crashes and I don’t get and error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem report under Maintenance all the occurances of FE "Stopped Working" (can paste picture) but&nbsp;</p>
<p>if I click “check for Solution” it comes back with a message that it will show up here when one is available”.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Think there is something messed up in the permissions even though when I look at security is says I have full control.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry it took so long but we went on vacation right after I posted the question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Mel</p>

</p><p>The same problem occurs when selecting Yahoo, but not with the other options (advanced setup, exchange, iCloud, Outlook).&nbsp;Interestingly, I can also get to the screen where I have to enter the email address with my second local user.</p>
<p>Running the troubleshooter for apps did not solve the issue.</p>
<p>

            Hello Tanja,
<br />
<br />Sorry to learn of what's going on with your Mail app, but be rest assured that I can help. Click the Start button, you can try looking for Mail in the Start menu, right-click that, and go into App settings. In the new window, you should see the settings for Mail and Calendar. Click Reset.
<br />
<br />If this above process does not work, right-click the Start button and click Windows PowerShell (Admin). Copy and paste in the following:
<br />
<br />get-appxpackage *communicationsapps* | remove-appxpackage
<br />
<br />Now go to the Start menu and look for the Microsoft Store. You'll have to reinstall it from there.
<br />
<br />Good luck, Tanja. If you have any additional concerns or if this did not resolve your issue, I'm only a reply away.       
        </p>

<p>Thanks Ethan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, both suggestions had no effect. I think the root cause of this might be in email and app account management, not in the apps themselves.</p>

            Tanja,
<br />
<br />Thank you for letting me know. Truth be told I’ve been trying to add my Outlook account after resetting the Mail app and I was welcomed with the same issue, it was stuck on Creating account but no errors. It worked itself out the next day, so as with time, it might work then?
<br />
<br />Maybe you should try this on another computer (remove and readd the Google account again?) and see if it persists. Let me know.

<h2>            Can&#39;t open .exe files or play audio, please help.</h2>
                    <p>As the title says, I'm unable to play any audio through both my headphones and my speakers. I am also unable to start/open .exe files or access certain directories. I think the reason for this might be the loss of a few drivers, though I am unable to confirm
 this currently.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I received this issue after starting my computer and being greeted with Alienware Respawn. I have ignored the Alienware Respawn boot-up prompt in the past, but this time I decided that backing up my save files might be usefull, so I let it do it's thing
 for a couple of hours. Anyway, when I returned to my computer (and logged in) I first noticed a series of error messages - specifically the system being unable to load a set of .exe programs. I started investigating what the prompts meant on YouTube and noticed
 I was unable to play any form of audio.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried opening the 'Uppspelningsenheter' or 'Playback devices' (as my computer is set to Swedish), which gives me the prompt (translated):
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The sound enhancements for the following 'devices'/'units' are causing problems:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Speakers/Headset (Realtek High Definition Audio)</p>
<p>The sound enhancements have been disabeled for this 'device/unit.'</p>
<p>Do you want to activate 'it'/'them' again?"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pressing 'Yes' allows me to enter the sound controll thingy mabub, though I am unable to test any sound devices without getting the prompt: "Unable to play test-note".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know I should be posting this on the Dell forum (I have tried...), but as there's an issue with the Windows drivers, I deemed it appropriate to post this here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has a solution, please help.</p>

<p><span>Hi geoffbubbles,</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Windows Answers Community site.
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Windows Media Player is a digital media player and media library application used for playing audio, video and viewing images on personal computers.
 It offers great ways to store and enjoy your music, video, pictures, and recorded TV—all from one place. In addition to being a media player, Windows Media Player includes the ability to rip music from and copy music to compact discs, build Audio CDs in recordable
 discs and synchronize content with a digital audio player (MP3 player) or other mobile devices, and enables users to purchase or rent music from a number of online music stores.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Windows Media Player is not designed to join music of your choice.
<span>&nbsp;</span> </span></span></strong></p>
<strong><span><span>You can add / join music is easily in
<span>Windows</span> Movie Maker. Follow the steps below to join the music:</span>
</span></strong>
<p><span>1. Click
<strong>File</strong> , and then click <strong>Import Media Items</strong> .</span></p>
<p><span>2. Browse to the file that you want to add, and then click the file. You can import audio files with the following file name extensions into Windows
 Movie Maker: .aif, .aifc, .aiff .asf, .au, .mp2, .mp3, .mpa, .snd, .wav, and .wma.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Click
<strong>Import</strong> .</span></p>
<p><span>4. Drag the music file to the Audio/Music track of the timeline.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Tips:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>
</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>1.</span>
</span></span><span>A quick way to adjust the volume of an audio clip on the Audio/Music track is to right-click the clip, and then click
<span>Volume</span> . Adjust the volume with the slider</span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>2.
</span></span></span><span>You can add both music and narration to the Audio/Music track in
<span>Windows</span> Movie Maker. Both can play at the same time in your published movie. You can then adjust the audio levels to determine which audio will play louder than the other in your movie.</span> &nbsp;</span></p>

I've given WMM a try, it seems to work for me except for the fact that I cant find out how to export/publish as an mp3 file</blockquote>
=================================<br />
You cannot export an .mp3 file from Movie Maker.<br />
<br />
If you&nbsp;publish it as a movie...the result&nbsp;should be a .wma audio file.<br />

    <title>Automate Windows Login - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> emilyftw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Automate Windows Login</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We are having an issue at my organization, and I wanted to research some possible solutions before talking to our IT department.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>We often have software updates over the weekend which restart computers, and otherwise staff are encouraged by IT to restart or turn their computers off anyway. &nbsp;So Monday morning, most people are back at the login screen.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Once you log in, our slow computers (or probably more our slow network connections) take about 30 minutes to get settled, particularly when you start Outlook and they start syncing with the Google servers and such (Google Apps Sync spins for a long time).
 &nbsp;It's not that you can't do anything at all, but the computers are dreadfully slow during these syncs. &nbsp;While the whole process takes about 30 minutes, because it is just a slow down I think we could estimate that we lose 15 minutes of productive time from
 most staff members each Monday (and other days if there are software updates overnight). &nbsp;Kind of a huge loss over time.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I know how to automate tasks in Windows like starting applications on login or at particular times. &nbsp;However, what would be nice is to have Windows log in by itself every morning (if it is not already logged in) and open Outlook so that the syncs can take
 place before anyone arrives. &nbsp;This could all happen behind a locked desktop screen, so there wouldn't have to be any security lapses, but would need to happen before staff arrived.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I was curious if that kind of thing can be done, or if anyone has any other ideas? &nbsp;For instance, as an alternative, could this be done remotely before the user leaves their house? &nbsp;My computer isn't published for remote access, but if it were, would I
 be able to access my desktop if the computer wasn't logged in yet, and log in remotely?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If there is no current way to do this, I would strongly urge Windows to think about this. &nbsp;This is a pretty considerable waste of time that happens under our current set-up.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>BTW, we are currently using Vista, but upgrading to Win 7 pretty soon. &nbsp;So insights about either of those platforms are appreciated.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>
<div>Emily</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am sorry but we can not assist you.</p>
<p>You will have to speak to your I.T. Department.</p>
<p>Your System Administrator, through your I.T. Department, would have set it up the way that they wished it to be setup.</p>
<p>And we do not give advice to override their settings, which should not be accessible by yourself&nbsp;anyway.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<div>I'm preparing for a discussion with IT, but they are contractors and will definitely not be offering suggestions. &nbsp;If I don't do my research on what is possible first, this discussion will go no where.</div>

            <p>Hi Emily,</p>
<p>
</p><p>you probably have found an answer already.</p>
<p>If not:</p>
<p>There is a remote vewing software called "Teamviewer" (<a href="http://www.teamviewer.com/en/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.teamviewer.com</a>).</p>
<p>They have a new feature which allows you also to wake up your computers via Lan (needs to be enabled in the BIOS) even remotely.</p>
<p>They have different means to allow you to go past your firewall. As long one computer is running behind the firewall it seems really simple.</p>
<p>With this you could wake one computer at the time, lock them and then go on to the next.</p>
<p>Not really automated, but probably better than what you describe.</p>
<p>The software is free to use for private persons (all features!), but pretty pricey for companies.</p>
<p>But at least you cold try it out in the free mode, and by the sounds of it it might pay back pretty quickly if you need to go for the paid version.</p>

<ol>
<li>What is the model of the laptop?</li><li>Have you installed all the pending updates?</li><li>Are you facing any display issues with the laptop?</li><li>What is the current operating system installed in your laptop?</li></ol>
<p><span><span>Providing the latest driver is the responsibility of the hardware manufacturer and in this case Microsoft and Intel are working together to bring a compatible driver for Windows 10. Once the driver is ready you will get the notification on your
 computer through Windows Updates and you will also get the download link on the Intel website. You will get the updates for your hardware device probably you might have to wait for this update.</span></span></p>

            <p>It is an Asus K53S. On the Asus website there is no driver for windows 10, only for win 7 and 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed windows 10 with all updates possible but screen was going grey than black many times, and somethimes I had that message where it sayed: diver stop working but has recovered etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I got back to win 7 because there is a stable driver for it, but I want to use Win 10 for the win store app. I do not like Win 8 even there is win app on that one too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About the Intel drivers: as they say on the Intel official forums, they do not intend to develop it... because they say it is too OLD for them to support it (it is the last Intel product that I buy anyway).</p>

    <title>Folders not synced in File Explorer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> william sturgis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Folders not synced in File Explorer</h2>
                    <p>There is a group of folders in 2 locations on my PC.&nbsp; One location is "This PC\*.*"&nbsp; The other location is "This PC\C:\Users\Bill\*.*". &nbsp; Some items I save go to the first folder and some to the second folder, like Pictures and Documents etc.&nbsp; You would
 think that these groups of folders would sync somehow especially when I make backups since only 1 group gets backed up when running a backup program. I an running the Creators Update with all the latest updates on my PC. Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks</p>

<p>Your answer worked good for me to see the actual location is located. What I still don't understand why the 2 almost identical locations. When something is saver automatically, it goes to the C:/users/bill/***. But when I save something manually, I go to
 the this PC\*** because it conveniently located right on the File Explorer screen. I would have to go digging to get to the other location. Any Ideas?</p>
<p>

<br />
Do you mean your PC is on build 16299.175 or 16299.125? To make sure, you can follow these steps to get the correct build your PC is on.</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the<strong> Windows</strong> +<strong> R </strong>keys from the keyboard to launch the Run dialog window.<br />
</li><li>Type <strong>winver</strong>, then press the<strong> Enter </strong>key. You may then see the Windows 10 version and build you're in.<br />
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Can you also provide us a screenshot of the File Explorer's<strong> This PC</strong> and from the
<strong>C: </strong>drive? This will give us the chance to further look into the issue you're experiencing properly. Make sure that you block all the important or personal data that will be visible in the screenshot.<br />

<p>The Disk Cleanup ran OK but didn't have any effect.</p>
<p>I have a Toshiba Satellite laptop and press FN-Win-Prtsc together to get my screenshots.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what the problem really is. I would think the files in the one folder would be synced with other so when I make a backup, I get all the files backed-up.</p>

<h2>            DVD playback is choppy with DVD player but fine on a PC</h2>
                    
<p>A small group of people gathered to watch a video. The DVD we were using was a DVD Archival Back-Up. We were watching it on a DVD player and the playback was choppy. We moved to a computer (a PC) and it played fine (with VLC player). Whst do you think happened.
 The disc was not scratched. What could I have done to the DVD player for it to play smoothly. The DVD player was a newer Sony.</p>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Unfortunately this issue could occur if there is no particular codec responsible for playing the dvd is not present in the sony dvd player.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hence I would suggest you to contact your sony dvd player dealer/vendor to get is replaced with the upgraded one.</div>

            Hi,   PCPETE_Beach_Bum
<br />
<br />You could also check to see if there are some sectors of the hard drive damaged.
<br />After you correct the damaged sectors you can enter with Windows Virtual and backup your files and then reinstall Windows
<br />
<br />Take a look to the following link, there is a step by step guide 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/hirens-boot-cd-allinone-boot-cd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/hirens-boot-cd-al...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.hiren.info/pages/bootcd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.hiren.info/pages/bootcd</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.hirensbootcd.org/download/</a>
<br />
<br />Process: 
<br />1. Enter your USB drive or CD
<br />2. Enter Dos Programs 
<br />3. Enter Hard Disk tools 
<br />4. Enter HDAT2 4.53 (Test/Repair Bad Sector) 
<br />5. Then auto &amp; choose your keyboard United states (or wait it will do automatically here) 
<br />6. Press Enter &amp; Press Drive level tests menu 
<br />7. Enter Check and Repair bad sectors 
<br />8. And now it will start, it takes a lot of time, so wait until it finished.

                    <p>Hi Team,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to windows 10 1709 version , Task scheduler used to create task files in XML format in C:\Windows\Tasks\ directory.</p>
<p>But from windows 10 1709 and up i could not see any such files getting created in that path. Can you please let me know where can i find those scheduled task XML files. Also what are the security options that are enhanced in windows 10 1709 w.r.t task scheduler
 options?</p>

    <title>SSD and Windows 10 version 1709 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bankel  say:</h3>
<h2>            SSD and Windows 10 version 1709</h2>
                    <p>I am not the first to write about the problems using an SSD with the later versions of W10. But I may have a new perspective.</p>
<p>We have four computers, two laptops and two towers. One of the laptops and one of the towers have ordinary hard disks as system disks, the other two have SSDs. The tower has a brand new Samsung Evo 840, the laptop an Intel SSD. The towers are two identical
 Asus M51AC apart from one having 24 GB memory and an SSD (my main computer) the other 8 GB memory and an ordinary HDD (my backuo computer).</p>
<p>In passing I must mention that my main computer earlier had a Sandisk SSD which died on me. Or rather was killed by Microsoft, it simply could not stand the repeated attempts by Windows Update to install W10 1703 which always ended with a rollback.</p>
<p>To solve this crisis (Nov 2017) I downloaded the current W10 ISO (which was 1709) and created an installation DVD. Using my backup computer I did a clean install to its HDD. This was successful and this computer still runs the 1709 version.</p>
<p>I then cloned the system to the new Samsung SSD using Samsung's software and an USB dock. No problems there. Finally I installed the SSD in my main computer together with a data HDD without a Windows system.</p>
<p>It booted up fine.&nbsp; But after around 15 secs the cursor froze and the system stopped. Repeated attempts to boot the computer (about a hundred of them) gave identical results.</p>
<p>However, with some difficulty I managed to boot into Safe Mode and since I needed the computer I ran in Safe Mode for a couple of months.</p>
<p>Now I see this as proof of the problem being in software rather than in hardware. Additional proof is that the identical M51AC computer which is SSD-less runs the 1709 version without problems.</p>
<p>Both my laptops had been automatically updated to the 1703 version. So to get out of Safe Mode I wiped the Samsung SSD clean and cloned the system disk on one of them (the one with an Intel SSD) to the Samsung SSD using Intel's migration software. No problems
 there.</p>
<p>Finally I installed the Samsung SSD in my main computer and booted up. It worked brilliantly and I was then on the 1703 level. And it still works, only problem is the persistent attempts by Windows Update to install the 1709 version. Which of course always
 ends with a rollback.</p>
<p>Now to my question. It is obvious to me that the 1709 version has some serious fault that causes great problems when using a SSD as a system disk. When will it be fixed?</p>

<p>Correction: Intel's migration software was never used, that was an error in writing. I meant to write Samsung migration software.</p>
<p>Additional information: A week or two late I noticed that the laptop with the Intel SSD was totally dead. Probably as a consequence of an attempt by Windows Update to install the 1709 version. I managed to revive it using a repair disk and a system image
 I had created. Good foresight there!</p>

            It's hard to get a handle on storage failure causes. Not without more numbers to compare with. Even large storage server companies like BackBlaze who publish there own drive failures are not very helpful for individuals. Overall, I don't think the failures
 in SSD's are anymore a result of the memory itself, but the poor quality controllers some use. I also have seen this in HDD systems of recent which I too first contributed to possibly something with Windows 10 but then realized it was probably more just bad
 hard drives. Also of note is I see more firmware updates with SSD's so its possible this contributes to failure rates as many users are never informed of firmware updates. Or they are afraid to implement them. My first experience with a SSD in my Dell notebook
 has been OK, but it has received a couple firmware updates addressing stability issues. The Hynix SC308 appears to have more issues with controller then typical.&nbsp;

<p>jescott418, thanks for your input. I have heard a lot about SSD issues, including bad controllers. Perhaps I should emphasize that the Samsung SSD I have of course has the latest firmware and is monitored by the Samsung Magician.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is time to simplify the problem. I have always been an Occam's Razor fan and is always on the lookout for the simplest solution. So what is the major difference between an ordinary HDD and an SSD? Well, the SSD is faster, it can throw more data
 at the operating system in a shorter time.</p>
<p>So is it possible that W10 1709 finds it more difficult to handle this than previous versions?</p>
<p>Of course it is possible! Please note that my main computer booted OK from the SSD but froze after a very short time. This is typically caused by code being overwritten by data (or other code) in an uncontrolled manner.
</p>
<p>The reason could well be that W10 needs bigger or more buffers to handle an SSD and a coding error in 1709 (which does not exist in 1703) could cause a buffer expansion to overwrite critical code.</p>
<p>At the moment all my four computers work perfectly. I have tweaked the system in the two that use an SSD as system disk to not accept an update to 1709. This gives me 6 months before 1703 loses security update support. In that time Microsoft should be able
 to offer a better W10 1709 so I can update my SSD computers.</p>

            Sounds similar to the problems that people are having with Intel and other SSDs on recent Windows 10 updates...<br />
<br />
Surface Pro (2017) owners hitting Win10 1803 update blue screens. Now we know why.<br />
Microsoft and Intel now agree: If your machine has an Intel SSD 600p or SSD Pro 6000p, don’t force it to install the Windows 10 April 2018 Update, version 1803. Surface Pro 2017 owners with a compromised SSD have an extra hurdle: bad advice. Surely someone
 tests these things, don't they?<br />

<br />
Win10 version 1803 incompatible with Toshiba solid state drives, too<br />
Hot on the heels of the revelation that Win10 version 1803 doesn’t work with Intel SSD6 solid state drives -- thus, by implication, many Surface Pro (2017) machines -- comes official confirmation that it also doesn’t work with Toshiba SSDs.<br />

            Yep my thoughts too that this problem has now become a problem showing up with Intel and Toshiba SSD's. I beginning to question why this is happening in releases and why its not being addressed in Insider testing? Storage failures is a big deal and not
 sure why this would happen on a Windows 10 release update? So far all Microsoft has done is place a block on updating certain SSD models because of this problem. But nobody seems to understand the problem so far. Given the initial complaint in this thread
 of a Samsung SSD issue on Win 10 1709 one has to wonder if this goes back further then just Spring 1803 release?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a 2-3 month old SP which crashed repeatedly prior to upgrading to 1803. Re-built at the Microsoft store each time finally, back to 1709 sceptically once more. So far, whilst more stable than 1803 was, this build has crashed 3 times since last re-build.
 Luckily so far, it has recovered without my intervention, but if like the previous crashes, it eventually will not boot at all. So, the problem does appear to predate the Spring 1803 release. The question for me now, is when will this be fully resolved by
 Microsoft, who sold the PC.</p>

<p>Finally I can report success. That is, my main computer is now running W10 1803. But it was not a simple upgrade.</p>
<p>First I purchased a new SSD, an Adata SU900 512 GB. This came with a license for Acronis, however that program proved impossible to use for cloning my old Samsung SSD to the new one. So I used another (free) program for the job. But booting from the new
 SSD was not successful. Using my W10 DVD I succeded in recovering my system from a system copy I made in April. And then W10 update kicked in with another attempt to install W10 1803. And to my surprise - this time the install succeded!</p>
<p>So what was different? Firstly of course the change from a Samsung SSD to an Adata SSD as system disk. I also took out the wifi card (another almost identical computer with the same wifi card had no problem updating to W10 1803), and finally the computer
 was NOT connected to the Internet during the install.</p>
<p>So I believe the change of SSD caused the install of W10 1803 to succeed.</p>

<p>I am using a lot of devices via my router and all of them work fine.My ps3 connecting to internet without problems,my ipod touch use wireless internet from my router perfectly.3 laptops use internet without any problems.But only my xbox cannot connect to
 xbox live without my router restarted.And when i do,xbox live works for a few hours and then i turn it off and next time i use it i need a router restart again.As i said this is the only device in house that have problems with internet so i dont think that
 this is my ISP.I port forwarded ,i did DMZ thing for xbox, I use the "Restore factory settings" on xbox ,nothing helped.It is really annoying that i should restart my router just to play on xbox.When i do Test Connection to Xbox live it shows me error on xbox

<p>Hey Beat, sorry to hear about the connection issues! There are a few ways to tackle this issue, but let's start simple. I can see that you have your Xbox in a DMZ zone; rather than doing that, can you try enabling UPnP on your router? If you're not sure
 how, you can try a web search for your router brand and model number to see if a user manual comes up. :-) Let me know how it goes!

<p>Hey there Soldier! So it sounds like your Gmail account is already tied to a Gamertag and account here. I would recommend trying to log in to that account using common passwords you use and see if an account comes up. If it does, you'll need to change the
 MS Account to something else, freeing up your Gmail account to use on your account. Let us know if this helps!

<p>Hi, did you get this message the very first time you tried the code? </p>
<p>Could it be that you had entered the code using a different profile on your console or at Xbox.com perhaps?</p>
<p>Was the code purchased at a store or delivered by email?</p>
<p>Either way if you are sure you haven't already redeemed the code you need to contact whoever sold you the points code, although you may have a tough time proving it wasn't you who redeemed the points code.</p>
<p>Good luck and I hope you resolve the issue quickly and to your satisfaction.</p>
<p>!!! Something you could try is to doing a network test on your console just in case it's simply that your account information hasn't updated.</p>

    <title>Instability when more than 1 Xbox One Controller is connected - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mandark0  say:</h3>
<h2>            Instability when more than 1 Xbox One Controller is connected</h2>
                    
<p>i have 2 xbox one controllers connected to my PC with the wireless adapter. i upgraded to windows 10 from windows 7. after upgrading i'm experiencing problems with certain applications, when more than 1 xbox one controller is connected:</p>
<ul>
<li>the gamepad-to-keyboard mapping tool xpadder gets completely unstable and unusable.
</li><li>the game "obliteracers" hangs on launch. </li></ul>
<p>there may be other applications having similar problems.</p>
<p>the controllers are working fine with these applications , when only 1 controller is connected.</p>
<p>i also have 2 xbox 360 controllers. and the problem also happens, if 1 xbox one and 1-2 xbox 360 controllers are connected. if just the 2 xbox 360 controllers are connected, the apps work fine. so the problem seems to happen, if a xbox one controller is
 connected simultaneously with any other controller (either a second xbox one or a 360 controller).</p>
<p>any ideas what could cause this?</p>

<p>i was able to fix my issues doing the following:<br />
<br />
1. go to http://catalog.update.microsoft.com (using Internet Explorer)<br />
2. download this driver: "Microsoft - Generic Controller - XINPUT compatible HID device" / Date: 01.01.2015 / Version: 6.3.9600.16384<br />
3. extract the driver into a directory<br />
4. plug in all xbox one-controllers<br />
5. open the device manager<br />
6. navigate to "Human Interface Devices"<br />
7. perform these steps on every "XINPUT compatible HID device":<br />
7.1 right-click on the device and select "Update Driver Software...."<br />
7.2 select "Browse my computer for driver software."<br />
7.2 select "Let me pick from a list of device drivers on my computer"<br />
7.3 select "Have Disk..."<br />
7.4 select "xinputhid.inf" from the folder you extracted the downloaded driver to<br />
7.5 select "XINPUT compatible HID device" and click next<br />
<br />
i don't know, which other issues might arise by using outdated drivers, but at least the problems i encountered so far are gone.<br />
<br />
it's quite ridiculous, that microsoft cannot even get their own newest hardware to run without problems on their newest OS. ^^</p>

<h2>            Extend logical drive with unallocated space</h2>
                    Hi,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've windows 7 home premium edition on 320Gb hdd.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've Partitionas shown in image [<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/5l5a3amysw1pksg/disk.JPG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a>]</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now I can extend partition C: with 62 GB unallocated space, But I cannot increase my D: partition. Extend option is disable on property of D: drive.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've gained 62GB from C: drive by shrinking it. I can use it to increase C: drive (which is reverse of my process) but I cannot use it to D: drive.</div>
                </div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The extension of D drive is not possible for the unallocated space created towards left.<br />
But can be done for C drive which is at the left of unallocated space.<br />
<br />

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes on your computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does it happen with any particular picture or with all the pictures?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does it happen only while viewing pictures in Windows Live Photo gallery or with other applications as well?</span></p>
<p><span>Perform the following troubleshooting methods:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Set the computer to clean boot state and check how it works.</span></p>
<p><span>To set the computer in clean boot, follow the steps from the link:
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to perform a clean boot</a>
</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note: </span>
</b><span>After checking in clean boot, follow
<b>step: 7</b> from the article to reset the computer to normal boot.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Un-install and reinstall Windows Live Photo Gallery then check how it works.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the link “</span><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Uninstall
 or change a program in Windows 7</a>”</span><span> to know how to un-install program from Windows 7.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn’t work, I would suggest you to check with the Window Live Photo Gallery support for more information.</span></p>

            May be worth a try search the support sites of your computer<br />
manufacturer and/or video adapter manufacturer for an updated<br />
video driver...<br />
<br />
One way to verify that&nbsp;the video driver is problematic is to reduce <br />
the graphics hardware acceleration:<br />
<br />
Windows 7 - Reduce Graphics Acceleration<br />
(In the following article...scroll down to : <br />
'Adjust graphics hardware acceleration')<br />
<br />
(263039) Troubleshoot display issues <br />
with Microsoft games<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/263039" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/263039</a><br />
<br />
The following article may be worth a look:<br />
<br />
Update the graphics driver - Windows 7, Vista<br />
<a href="http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/409/kb409116.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/409/kb409116.html</a><br />
<br />
Sometimes...Windows Update will install a Video Driver that is not <br />
as compatible with your system as the one you already had. In this<br />
case...the solution would be to Roll Back to the previous driver:<br />
