<h2>            Downloading apps on the New Surface Pro</h2>
                    <p>Hello Team,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was trying to download Google News reader on my surface but it keeps on saying error, also the same thing for an app called perfect youtube.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, what would you reccomend an app to watch youtube, it seems that Youtube has no app at all, everything is third party.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you so much.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>User accounts in Windows Vista&#58; Do I need a standard user account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jonathan h.  say:</h3>
<h2>            User accounts in Windows Vista&#58; Do I need a standard user account too if I am the only user&#63;</h2>
                    Hi.&nbsp; I have Windows Vista with SP2.&nbsp;I have a few questions regarding User Accounts.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
1) When I purchased my computer in August 2008, I set up my account as an Administrator and when I start up the computer, I am prompted for my password.&nbsp; Now, when I go to "Manage Accounts" in the "User Accounts" window, I see that there is one called "Jonathan"
 (the Administrator account), one that is called ASP.NET Machine Account, and a Guest user account.<br />
<br />
2) Since I am the owner of this computer and the only user, do I need or need to use the standard account instead of the Administrator account for everyday computing?&nbsp; I know Windows recommends using a standard account unless you have to do real administrative
 stuff but wouldn't that be redundant since I am the only user?&nbsp; <br />
<br />
3)I know that sometimes when I try to do stuff that requires that I be an Administrator, I get the dialog or window that says I don't have Administrator access even though I am always logged into the Administrator account when I am on my PC.&nbsp; How can I change
 the permissions settings (or whatever they're called) in the Administrator account?<br />
<br />
Thanks for your help.<br />
<br />

            The "Recommended" thing to do is after you have logged on with the account that is the Administrator, create yourself a Standard Account and use the standard account as your login and "only" use the Admin account for Admin purposes.<br />
<br />
So to answer your question, yes, you should create a standard account.<br />
<br />
Even though the account you're logged on with has "Admin" rights, it's normal to still be prompted to allow programs to run, etc, it's the UAC kicking in, however, if you're logged on with the Admin account and are being prompted for the Admin Username and
 Password, then your logged on account doesn't really have Admin rights.<br />

            General Recommendations For Setting Up Users in Vista:<br />
<br />
You absolutely do not want to have only one user account. Like XP and all other modern operating systems, Vista is a multi-user operating system with built-in system accounts such as Administrator, Default, All Users, and Guest. These accounts should be left
 alone as they are part of the operating system structure.<br />
<br />
You particularly don't want only one user account with administrative privileges on Vista because the built-in Administrator account (normally only used in emergencies) is disabled by default. If you're running as Administrator for your daily work and that
 account gets corrupted, things will be Difficult. It isn't impossible to activate the built-in Administrator to rescue things, but it will require third-party tools and working outside the operating system.<br />
<br />
The user account that is for your daily work should be a Standard user, with the extra administrative user (call it something like "CompAdmin" or "Tech" or the like) only there for elevation purposes. After you create "CompAdmin", log into it and change your
 regular user account to Standard. Then log back into your regular account.<br />
<br />
If you want to go directly to the Desktop and skip the Welcome Screen with the icons of user accounts, you can do this:<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: netplwiz [enter]<br />
Click on Continue (or supply an administrator's password) when prompted by UAC<br />
<br />
Uncheck the option "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer". Select a user account to automatically log on by clicking on the desired account to highlight it and then hit OK. Enter the correct password for that user account (if there
 is one) when prompted. Leave it blank if there is no password (null).<br />
<br />
Changes to the Built-in Administrator account in Vista:<br />

<p>The error message says I have a bad print head. It doesn't make it through the startup tests. It worked fine before the windows update. My plan right now is to see if I can find some place that can perform better diagnostics and maybe fix it. Being without
 a printer is not acceptable...</p>

<p>Hi Bill, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Multiple reasons can result to this concern, like incorrectly configured driver or system incompatibility. For us to isolate the main issue, we suggest that you perform the steps below and see if it helps:</p>

<p>
</p><p>These are services that Windows Update needs to make sure it's working effectively.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 3: Hardware and Devices Troubleshooter.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows </strong>+ <strong>X</strong>, and click on <strong>

<h2>            Mic not working properly on Win 10</h2>
                    My mic is not working properly after I upgraded to windows 10. I already checked the mic on other PC, bought another mic, checked drivers and what not. The werid part is that if I am listening to music and I try to speak in a software like TeamSpeak, the
 mic captures the music and plays it with some weird eco. Any fix to this?

<p>For 32-Bit Windows 7 download: windows6.1-KB976932-X86.exe 537.8MB</p>
<p>For 64-Bit Windows 7 download: windows6.1-KB976932-X64.exe 903.2MB</p>
<p>Download, *save*, and install the Service Pack with no security software (antivirus/security suite) installed, disconnect from Internet, disable the fire-wall &amp;
<b>close all non-essential</b> process in the <span>task</span> manager. </p>
<p>Whichever method you choose, here are some tips for ensuring a smooth installation.</p>
<p>* Getting Windows Update errors with Windows 7 SP1? MS notes "inconsistencies," provides fix: http://is.gd/22brle</p>
<p>* 1. Click on Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories, and right-click on Command Prompt.</p>
<p>2. Choose Run As and select an Administrator account.</p>
<p>3. At the command prompt, type net stop cryptsvc and wait for the service to stop.</p>
<p>4. Type CD\ and press Enter.</p>
<p>5. Type CD windows\system32 and press Enter.</p>
<p>6. Type ren catroot2 catroot3 and press Enter.</p>
<p>Other solutions:</p>
<p>1. Make sure you install the latest updates for Windows 7, your applications and device drivers. This can ensure a smooth experience I noticed, although Windows 7 SP1 is minor, you don’t want to take any chances. If you are updating through Windows Update,
 it also guarantees a smaller update since only missing patches will be applied.</p>
<p>2. Backup – you can never go wrong with backing up; this is something you should do often even when you are not making major changes to your computer. Windows 7 has made it very easy tobackup your computer . The built in system imaging and backup and restore
 center makes it convenient to back up the operating system and all your critical data. In fact, I used this to test the beta and RC releases of SP1 on my production system. This method carried its risks, but at least I knew my RTM installation was safely backed
 up and tucked away from pre-release code.</p>
<p>http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/24/how-to-backup-your-installation-of-windows-7/</p>
<p>3. Don’t do it during a major project, if you have something you are working on at the moment on your computer or in the middle of an assignment or work related project which you might need your PC for, don’t install the Service Pack right away. Do it in
 your off time, such as on the weekend or when you know you can leave your PC while it installs itself automatically. My installation took over 2 hours.</p>
<p>4. This brings me to another point, which is, don’t install SP1 on a laptop on battery power, it’s a CPU intensive task and will use up most of your battery power. So make sure your laptop is connected to power. For desktop users, I strongly recommend you
 have a UPS connected, you just don’t know when the unexpected can occur. You might just be in the last lap of completing the 2 hour installation and lose power.</p>
<p>5. Disable your Antivirus, I remember installing the SP1 beta with Microsoft Security Essentials version 1 installed and received an error that my Antivirus is not compatible. Although this was resolved, your experience might vary. I haven’t experienced
 the issue in the RTM code although I am running Microsoft Security Essentials version 2. Someone reported receiving an error message about Forefront Client Security not allowing the Service Pack to install. The recommendation is to disable Forefront which
 is based on the same core scanning engine as MSE or make sure you at least have the latest version of Forefront client security installed.</p>
<p>6. Another thing you should do is a clean boot before installing the Service Pack, you can do this by:</p>
<p>* Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.</p>
<p>* Accept User Account Control permission</p>
<p>* If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Continue.</p>
<p>* On the General tab, click Selective Startup.</p>
<p>* Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</p>
<p>* Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.</p>
<p>* Click OK.</p>
<p>* When you are prompted, click Restart.</p>
<p>* After the computer starts, proceed with the installation.</p>
<p>7. Another task you should try is to check your hard disk for errors:</p>
<p>* Click Start</p>
<p>* Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD</p>
<p>* Click ‘Run as Administrator’</p>
<p>* At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f</p>
<p>When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.</p>

<p>Check your hard disk for errors, Another obscure thing you could try is disabling User Account Control temporarily.</p>
<p>Install the drivers for your LAN adapter (Wireless, Ethernet or Bluetooth.</p>
<p>Its possible you might need to do a BIOS update if one is available for your computer. Also, check for any updated chipset drivers.</p>
<p>Also, disconnect any non-essential devices you might have attached to the system.</p>
<p>Its possible the SP1 download might be corrupt, I would download another copy and try again.</p>

            Hi Stanley,
<br />
<br />Do you mean the Preview Pane?
<br />
<br />If so, on the View Ribbon at the top, toggle off Preview Pane at the left of that ribbon
<br />
<br />
<br />If you mean large file preview icons:
<br />
<br />On the View Ribbon, in the layout section, choose an option other than Extra Large, Large, medium or small icons

            On feedback hub Microsoft responded to this error. First run windows update to be sure you are on most current build for your system . Then reinstall the app from windows store. This worked for me this morning after I saw their response. All the rest of
 these answers were useless yesterday but may work today if you can not do it the way I described from Microsoft official response.

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Media Creation Tool Error code 0x80042405 - 0xA001A</h2>
                    So this is my second time trying to download Windows 10 to USB with 32GB of storage so there is a lot of space available.&nbsp;<br />
But when it gets to 100% with downloading it gives me this message:<br />
There was a problem running this tool. We're not sure what happened, but we're unable to run this tool on your PC. If you continue experiencing problems, reference the error when contacting customer support. Error code 0x80042405 - 0xA001A<br />
Can someone please help me with this? Should I rather download it as an ISO and then burn it to the USB using a different program? Or download it on a different PC?

    <title>How to clone a data-only HDD to SSD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marcolr  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to clone a data-only HDD to SSD</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>I hope you can help me. I've always used Data Migration software by Samsung to clone HDDs containing OS &amp; data to new SSDs in order to improve my PCs performance.</p>
<p>Now I have a different need. In my ASUS ROG notebook I have two disks: one SSD with Windows 8.1 only and one HDD with data only.</p>
<p>I've just bought a Samsung SSD 850 PRO 512GB since I now want to <strong>clone my D:\ drive (data only, no OS) to this new SSD</strong>, to further improve my PC responsiveness and performance.</p>
<p>However, Data Migration doesn't allow to do that, you can only clone a HDD containing the OS.</p>
<p>I've also tried with EaseUS TodoBackup, but my understanding is that before cloning a disk I first need to Create and format a hard disk partition.
</p>
<p>So I preferred to wait for your expert advice since I am afraid to mess up my new SSD... Namely, I know that SSDs often have a hidden partition and I'm afraid to delete it if I fist format it. Also, I need that the cloned SSD is called D:\ since the file
 paths must remain the same once I remove the current data-only HDD and replace it with the cloned SSD that will contain all my data.</p>
<p>I'd much appreciate any advice on the best way to proceed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks and regards,</p>
<p>Marco</p>
<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think you need to clone anything under your circumstances, since this is not going to be a boot drive.... I would just copy and paste if it were me...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may need to change the new SSD's drive letter to D:\ once it's installed, but that is easily done in Disk Management...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only possible problem might happen if there were some type of boot file on the data drive...</p>
<p>Windows does funny stuff like that sometimes...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you really want to do a clone, you might check out Partition Wizard 9 Free... It is available in a bootable image that can be burned to CD...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The&nbsp; image can also be put on a bootable Flash drive with a Linux tool called Y.U.M.I....</p>
<p>I use this, and it works great...</p>

    <title>when will I get my refund - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> strigoi1958  say:</h3>
<h2>            when will I get my refund</h2>
                    
<p>I was one of many many people who had their accounts compromised last year. Being one of the very lucky ones I was able to still access my account and immediately removed my debit card details. I have requested several times for safeguards to be put in place
 and my local MP is pursuing action through parliament to make all online companies responsible for financial losses where safeguards do not exist. (NO a password alone is NOT a safeguard.). Anyway after making a nuisance of myself, after 6 weeks I was informed
 my investigation had been concluded and that my refund will be coming within 2 cycles (can't remember the exact wording) but I assumed that meant 2 months which has been and gone. I have asked about the fact that as I have removed my card details and dare
 not risk putting them into such a vulnerable place again, how my refund would be paid, I was told it would still be paid back into my account regardless of having no existing card details on file.</p>
<p>So does 2 cycles mean 2 months or 2 quarter years or 2 years ?</p>
<p>and if the hold up means it hasn't been repaid because I have no card details in my account then what can I do? I cannot leave my card details in a place where they've been accessed already and no safeguards exists so what do I do?&nbsp;</p>

<p>1. will do.</p>
<p>2. please expand... what DO you do to make accounts safe ? suggesting stronger passwords doesn't count, neither does trying to push responsibility back on customers because no verification is in place at the point of purchase.</p>
<p>But I agree with unsecure sites... anywhere that say has had thousands of accounts compromised would suggest THAT is an unsecure site... wouldn't you agree.</p>
<p>3 A password is my access to my account a safeguard is what the company puts in to protect me. I have 2 other sites where I purchase online and both ask for a verification at the point of purchase every single time and neither has had a single account compromised.</p>
<p>4. I need neither... if I'd known about the account compromising that has been happening for years and years I would have never used my details or made a purchase from a flawed outlet. I certainly would not purchase anything from any site without a duty
 of care to their customers that involves taking some preventative measures to ensure account theft is pointless.</p>
<p>In fact I should set up a site similar to paypal and channel payments to sites who do not incorporate verification safeguards themselves.</p>

<p>Well it's not thousands of accounts where do you get that figure post studies Please</p>
<p>Forums posts seem to only be in the 100s not thousands and most of them are mostly me to or repeat my story 100 x posts</p>
<p>When a UAI Is complete ms will issue a refund within 3 days after the fraud department issues it</p>
<p>The rest is upto your bank which can be 30 days</p>
<p>It's less then a week if you live in the us longer if you are outside</p>
<p>Although depends because it may be issued as ms points onto your account rather then money</p>

<p>2 account thefts is 1 too many and this has been happening for years not just the last few hours. They will not issue ms points they will refund the money.</p>
<p>All online companies can implement a very simple safeguard where they themselves can still take a direct payment without verification but protect the customer by requiring verification for all other transactions. It would prevent account migration, unauthorised
 purchases (even those accidentally done by children left with authorised access to the accounts), prevent unauthorised spending of MS points and would make account theft completely pointless. All online companies wishing to deny a care of duty to their customers
 should be punished with government imposed fines of sufficient size as to affect them and their staff until such tiny tiny safeguards are imposed.</p>

<p>Spoke to support today.... guess what... an investigation is being started to find out why my refund has not been paid... and they couldn't understand why I have no console. simple I've never owned an xbox, my purchases were for pc games through games for
 windows live. It may be the cause of the hold up. Not sure if the new investigation will freeze my account or not but it has no effect on me, no xbox, no online playing and no need for an XBL account but my sympathy lies with all those who are suffering. I'm
 sure there are companies who believe if they make it too much effort and annoyance to get a refund people will just swallow the loss.... I say don't... keep on till the money is rightfully returned. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hello Kushal,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for providing us the opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are willing to send an email when windows updates are ready to install on your grandparents computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to set an option of automatically install the updates from the advance option of Windows updates then you don't need to send an email or need to worry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To have Windows install important updates as they become available, turn on automatic updating. Important updates provide significant benefits, such as improved security and reliability. You can also set Windows to automatically install recommended updates,
 which can address non-critical problems and help enhance your computing experience.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For more clarification you may refer to the article mentioned below.</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still want to send an email notification you may refer to the steps provided in the link provided below to create a task. Though the link is for Windows 7 but steps valid good for Windows 8/8.1 too.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Query about Pause&#47;Break key on the Keyboard</h2>
                    <p><span>Like Saroseus,</span></p>
<p><span>I have a program that uses the Pause/Break to continue to function and without it I can't continue to use it to work. The company work for gave us keyboards with the Pause/break key but it isn't ergonomic and it hurts my wrist to use it. This is why
 I purchased this keyboard. This is a great keyboard and it works well, but I need that "Pause/Break" Key. So Microsoft can you do something about this.</span></p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
            </span>
            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me ask you;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What exactly are you referring to when you say, "I need that "Pause/Break" Key"?</li><li>Isn't Pause/Break key in the keyboard you have purchased, working?</li><li>Doesn't this keyboard have a Pause/Break key?</li><li>Are you saying you have now bought Ergonomic keyboard?</li><li>Does the keyboard have Pause and Break keys separately?</li></ul>
<p>It could be possible that some newer keyboards may have separate keys for the pause function and the break function. Instead of both functions being on the same key, the keyboard has a PAUSE key separate from the BREAK key.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On many keyboards, the key that commands the pause and break functions is typically labeled as the BREAK key. Therefore, many keyboard shortcuts instruct you to "press a key plus the BREAK key." However, when you press
<span>only</span> the BREAK key, the default behavior is to
<span>pause</span>. <br />
<br />
This behavior that many people are familiar with can cause some confusion on newer keyboards that have separate PAUSE and BREAK keys. For example, newer portable computers may have separate PAUSE and BREAK keys.</p>
Steps to reproduce the behavior
<p>Follow these steps on a keyboard that has a single PAUSE/BREAK key:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Open a command prompt window. To do so, click <strong>Start</strong>, click
<strong>Run</strong>, type <span>cmd.exe</span>, and then click
<strong>OK</strong>. </li><li>At the command prompt, type <span>dir</span>, press the ENTER key, and then immediately press the PAUSE/BREAK key.
<br />
<br />
Notice that the listing of files in the directory pauses. This behavior shows that the default behavior of the key is to pause. To notice this behavior for a directory that has a short list of files, you must press the PAUSE/BREAK key very quickly after you
 press the ENTER key. </li><li>Press CTRL+PAUSE/BREAK. <br />
<br />
Notice that the listing of files in the directory stops and returns you to the command prompt. This shows that the secondary behavior of the key is to break.</li></ol>
<p>Additionally, if you follow these same steps, and if you press the CTRL+Windows Logo+PAUSE/BREAK keyboard shortcut to open the
<strong>System Properties</strong> dialog box, the dialog box does not appear. This behavior is additional proof that the default behavior of the PAUSE/BREAK key is to pause.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the keyboard does not have Pause/Break key, you can use On-screen keyboard and check.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open On-Screen Keyboard by clicking the&nbsp;<strong>Start&nbsp;</strong>button&nbsp;<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=https%3a%2f%2fkbdevstorage1.blob.core.windows.net%2fasset-blobs%2f11899_en-us_8" />, clicking&nbsp;<strong>All Programs</strong>, clicking&nbsp;<strong>Accessories</strong>,
 clicking&nbsp;<strong>Ease of Access</strong>, and then clicking&nbsp;<strong>On-Screen Keyboard</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can refer to: <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10762/windows-use-on-screen-keyboard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Use the On-Screen Keyboard (OSK) to type</a></strong></p>

    <title>Microsoft Surface Ergonomic Keyboard sometimes doesn&#39;t connect - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> matthew l25  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Surface Ergonomic Keyboard sometimes doesn&#39;t connect until I&#39;ve logged in and refreshed bluetooth devices</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Been using a Microsoft Surface Ergonomic Keyboard for the last couple of weeks since I bought it with my desktop PC. The problem I've been having is that sometimes, when I boot the PC up from sleep, the keyboard simply won't connect at all, so I have to
 use the on-screen keyboard to type in my PIN. It only finally connects once I've opened up the list of Bluetooth devices in Settings, and suddenly the PC seems to remember that the keyboard exists and reconnects. But clearly this isn't okay, because I need
 it to work at the login screen as well. Is anyone able to please help me figure out what's gone wrong and how to fix it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>
<p>Matthew</p>

    <title>Cannot copy audio files to CD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> williamjslade  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot copy audio files to CD</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 8.1, trying to use File Explorer to copy six mp3 audio files totaling 205 MB onto a new Memorex CD-RW (700MB).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The files are "ready to be written to disc." I select them and under "Share" I click on "Burn to disc," and nothing happens.</p>
<p>'</p>
<p>Trying something else, I de-select the files, and under "Manage" I click on "Finish burning", then "prepare the disc" and click "Next",&nbsp;</p>
<p>then I select "Make an audio CD" and click "Next," and it open up the Window Media Player .</p>
<p>
</p><p>The files to burn appear in the "burn list", but they are divided into four separate discs, although all together they can easily fit on a single CD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And when I click on "Start burn" it very slooooowly copies only the one or two files which are listed as "Disc 1"</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I have read several other threads in this "community" on this topic, and I have tried various things that they have suggested, but they have not helped me.&nbsp;Isn't there some simple, straightforward way to copy audio files from my computer onto CDs using
 Windows's own tools?</p>

<h2>            Photos app face recognition and naming people detected</h2>
                    <p>Dear Sir/Madame,&nbsp;</p>
<p>since the photos app on windows 10 has a <strong>people&nbsp;</strong>tag sorting people based on the faces detected, it must have an option where the user can associate every face with a name so that it becomes easier to search and to share the photos of the
 people only if they are in them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>how is it possible to add names to the detected faces?</p>
<p>is it possible to share the photos based on their sort in the people tab?</p>

<p>Hi Firas,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Photos are currently indexed based on the algorithm currently in place for the Photos app. This algorithm allows the app to scan and search photos based on the criteria that you've entered. Tagging friends, family members or people is yet to be added as
 a feature. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We'd recommend sending our team a message via the Feedback Hub application on your device. This will help us improve the features and performance of the Photos app. To do this, you can perform the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. On a Windows 10 device, search for “Feedback Hub” in<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Cortana search</strong>, then launch the app.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Navigate to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Feedback</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>in the left menu, then press<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>+ Add new feedback</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Select the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Problem</strong>, and share any details you think are relevant, and choose an appropriate category and subcategory.</span></p>
<p><span>4.<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Important:</em><span>&nbsp;</span>If possible, reproduce the problem(s) after clicking<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Begin monitoring</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>(or<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Start capture</strong>) near the end of the form;<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Stop
 monitoring</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>when you’re done.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Once you’ve completed the form and monitoring, click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Submit</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>6. Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Continue using Feedback Hub</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>7. Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>My feedback</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>at the top, then find the item you submitted (it may take a while to appear).</span></p>
<p><span>8. Open the item you submitted, then click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Share</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>9. Click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Copy link</strong>, then paste the link here in your response (it will look like<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://aka.ms/%3cunique" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>https://aka.ms/&lt;unique</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span>link&gt;).</span></p>

<p>This would be incredibly useful! because whenever I take a photo of a friend or a family member, it will be able to recognize them and puts their photos in their face collection which then I will be able to share their face collection with that individual.
 This way, all my friends and family members will instantly get notification from OneDrive whenever I take a photo of them. and they can see it in their OneDrive folder without me having to create an Album for each event and then having to email them a link
 to that Album!<br />
Like this, everything gets fully automatic! All I have to do is just keep taking pictures with my phone, it automatically uploads to OneDrive and detects faces. then friends and family get to see their photos instantly! would be amazing! because it would bring
 more people to OneDrive. They will use it daily because they can all see each other's photos with ease.
</p>
<p>Gone are days you would have to waste your time creating stupid albums then sharing them manually to each friend.</p>

<p>Can you explain your answer clearly and please answer my questions because my photos app wasn't able to recognize any faces .<br />
You have mentioned that one of your systems is recognizing&nbsp; fine,<br />
Please send me the specs of that system such as OS version. Ram details, Graphic card and also the photos app version.<br />
These details well help me a lot for solving the problem on my system.<br />

<p>Dear SaliendraReddy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I reported this problem on January 21, 2018 there have been updates to the Photos app. At this time I am running&nbsp;Microsoft Photos 2018.18021.12420.0 and&nbsp;
<strong>I am no longer experiencing the problem</strong> I reported on my machines on January 21, 2018. I am logged into the same User account on both machines and I am able to face-tag successfully&nbsp;<span>(after allowing the Photos app to access my
 Contacts)</span> on both machines. Both machines are currently running Windows 10 Pro OS version 16299.248. One of my machines has 64 GB RAM and NVIDIA GTX 960, and the other has 4 GB RAM and AMD Radeon HD4540.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be nice if the Photos app would sync these tags across identical photos on different devices. At this time I have to tag photos separately on each machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Jan</p>

            Yes, I have looked at using OneDrive to sync all my photos. However, my upload speed
<span>on DSL </span>is horribly slow. It's not practical at this time, given that I have so many large photo files.

<h3> jeffrey addison  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I access Command Prompt or Windows 7 recovery options&#63;  Currently I am in a continuous boot loop of manufactures screen and scanning of Disc.</h2>
                    While my daughter was using the computer for school the computer went into a sudden boot loop.&nbsp; It did not shut down before going into the loop.&nbsp; The loop consists of the manufactures screen, The boot options (drive, disc drive, etc...) and right at the
 point Windows boots, it boots back to startup, manufactures screen, disc, etc...<br />
I receive no response with pushing f11 for recovery mode.&nbsp; I am able to access boot mode with esc key, setup with f10 key, and f9 allows me to see if the processor, disc and memory are ok.&nbsp; Which all is testing well there.<br />
I can not find my recovery disc, however, I do have a recovery image on a partitioned drive (E:) but I am unable to access it.<br />
My computer is a HP Pavilion Elite HSE-210y.&nbsp; I initially thought the power supply was going bad because we had to trip it a couple times over the last couple weeks.&nbsp; I replaced our 300w power supply with a 600w gaming power supply (my daughter's art classes
 require a lot of graphics).&nbsp; The install was smooth as butter, but it did not fix the problem.<br />
I attempted to download a recovery disc on line for $9.75 and that failed as well.
<br />
&nbsp;If I boot from my dvd player and put my Norton 360 disc in, I am able to access a command prompt.&nbsp; I went to my System disc (D:) and attempted to clear or fix issues to reboot, but that failed as well.&nbsp; Here are the steps I did:<br />
D: ----- CD Windows\system32\config-------MD mybackup----------Copy *.*--------CD regback---------copy*.* ..---------exit<br />
<br />
In order to reboot, I had to exit out of the Norton in which I used to access the command prompt.&nbsp; I don't know if not rebooting immediately effected the results, or if it just didn't work at all.<br />
<br />
Now you know what I have been doing for the last three days.&nbsp; Any help at all so I can resume my normal life would be fantastic<br />
<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 Update Error &#40;0x8024000d&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I have a Windows 10 PC and the other day noticed this error message relating to updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There were some problems installing updates, but we'll try again later.&nbsp; If you keep seeing this and want to search the web or contact support for more information, this may help (0x8024000d)</p>
<p>
</p><p>While searching the web found few articles on this error.&nbsp; One is to run Windows Troubleshooter and another is to install KB4025342 file.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before i do either can anyone else give me any suggestions on how to resolve this issue?</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you see a single square in the 2nd position top right of the window, that means the state of the window is Windowed</p>
<p>if you see a pair of squares in the 2nd position top right, that means the state of the windows if full screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yours shows the single square in that position, then my suggestion will apply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That behavior usually means that someone has expanded the Windowed window to the margins of the physical screen.&nbsp; Grab a corner and make it smaller.&nbsp; It can be tricky because you have to get the mouse pointer in exactly the right position when it turns to
 a double headed arrow, and while holding it there, move the mouse away from the corner</p>

<p>The problem is that when I click on the top border bar to move the window the whole top bar ACTS LIKE I clicked the minimize/maximize button. In the past I could click the top border bar and then move the minimized window where ever I wanted.&nbsp;</p>
