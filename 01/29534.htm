<h2>            PRINTER PROBLEMS with Windows 7 Pro&#47;Office 2013  - hpmsn093.dll</h2>
                    <p>PC is&nbsp;to Custom PC Magazine&nbsp;Extreme Ultra specification (June 2013 issue). I have installed an HP colour laserjet CM1312nfi MFP. Test page prints fine. Opening an application such as word and selecting print the first time works fine BUT the second time
 print is selected the program hangs. The document appears in the print queue as spooling but spooling never occurs. A little box appears on start bar - it won't open to a window but if you try to close it you get message saying hpmsn093.dll is not responding.
 Closing hpmsn093.dll allows another print and then same problem occurs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would be grateful for any assistance on this rather irritating issue.</p>

<p>What mouse are you using ? Does it use a software\driver to create custom settings ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fps players have different preferences, both in regard to mouse settings, and how they hold the mouse.</p>
<p>I suggest you experiment with the settings and find what suits <em>you</em>. You can always go back to default.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Mouse acceleration (enhance pointer precession)&nbsp; is traditionally not favoured by gamers as they want evenly calibrated movment
</p>
<p>for better accuracy.</p>
<p>However, I believe some players do use acceleration with special hand movements so they can flip around quickly. Getting in a panic</p>
<p>and jerking the mouse suddenly with acceleration enabled can get messy as well.</p>
<p>Angle Snapping\mouse correction\smoothing (but some games have a smoothing option) is also generally not desirable for gaming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Gaming mice with a DPI switch to allow switching between slow and fast mouse speeds while in game are also popular.<br />
Angle snapping and acceleration are desirable on Desktop, so it's good to be able to have a profile for both games and Desktop</p>

            <p>Thanks Aswin for replying to my query.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will read the site references you have given me. I am used to operating a running system and at 76 I am not capable of delving to deep.</p>
<p>I was glad to accept microsoft doing the upgrade over the Internet. &nbsp;It seemed to be going well and and they said they would be finding the problem.!!. So presumably they know the fault</p>
<p>All I need now is to get back to my old system but need advice do I turn of computer half way through the installation and what key /s must I press to get into my old system and restart my hp 620</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>

<h2>            iCloud for WIndows fails after Windows 1703 upgrade</h2>
                    <p>After the Creator's edition update for Windows, iCloud Contracts and Calendars no longer are accessible in Outlook using iCloud for Windows.</p>
<p>A problem similar to this happen when upgrading from Windows 8 to Windows 10 2 years ago. At that time problem was corrected with update to iCloud for Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem is occurring on at least two of the machine we have updated so far.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a solution?</p>

            Uninstalled all Apple software, reinstalled iCloud and iTunes, still having the same problem. "iCloud for Windows did not install properly". This is very annoying.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We understand that you're having issues trying to install iCloud on Windows PC.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to clarify, were you able to perform the suggested steps provided by <strong>
Andre Da Costa</strong> from the post above? That post was marked as answer and was found helpful by the other community members. We suggest that you thoroughly follow those methods. We also suggest that you try to delete some files and clear some space to
 accommodate the size of the program that you're trying to install. </p>
<p>
</p><p>We are keen on hearing back from you regarding this matter. </p>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>These steps have not helped me at all unfortunately I was syncing fine until this week (w/b December 17 2017) and the most recent Windows update, followed by the iTunes and iCloud for Windows updates. Going along with these updates as prompted has proved
 to be a bad move. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uninstalled/reinstalled the latter updates but to no avail. I haven't tried rolling back to the previous version of Windows 10 yet.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To reiterate, the ongoing problem I have with iCloud for Windows is the iCloud add on for Outlook so I can sync calendar and contacts etc. Other elements seemed to be as normal.

<p>My problem is not a compatibility one.&nbsp; My problem is that I cannot INSTALL iCloud for Windows on my Windows 10 laptop.&nbsp; I did all that Andre stuff while I had an Apple tech on the phone.&nbsp; We could not get iCloud for Windows to install properly.&nbsp; Here's
 the message I get after the "install":</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/220ec2f0-ce78-4748-89a2-ab44eb041959" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/220ec2f0-ce78-4748-89a2-ab44eb041959" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The "Repair" process does nothing.&nbsp; I've got to believe that this is a Microsoft problem, not an Apple problem.&nbsp; I installed iCloud for Windows on my Win 7 desktop without any problems.&nbsp; Some update to Win 10 is causing this problem.&nbsp; There are literally
 hundreds of posts about people having all kinds of problems that cropped up with iCloud when one of the recent Win 10 updates was released.&nbsp; I wish someone would actually look into this problem instead of telling me to uninstall every last Apple program on
 my computer and trying again.&nbsp; That doesn't work.</p>

<p>I totally concur with dluhop above. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already worked through all the trouble shooting solutions previously identified within my technical capacity - which has up until now been entirely sufficient for my IT needs. It certainly encompasses the uninstall/reinstall options. A total waste
 of time. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It was originally a bit of a fiddle to get the icloud extension working with Outlook 16 in Windows 10 last year but, having got it sorted, it was then perfectly compatible until the update last week.

<p>You could try what I did.&nbsp; Back up all your data, with control panel --&gt; backup and restore (Windows 7) --&gt; Image Backup.&nbsp; Then do a COMPLETE format of your boot drive, and reinstall of Windows to the latest version 1709.&nbsp; Then install the software you want,
 with Office first and then the apple products (hey, I must be on to something.....I'm running icloud&nbsp;for windows 7.3 [latest] with the Outlook Data Store as the default data file, and office 365 with 2016 office apps.&nbsp; So far everything seems to work).</p>
<p>
</p><p>The OTHER thing I would recommend is to google Code Two, and download their Outlook add-in called Code Sync for I-cloud.&nbsp; This add-in IS FREE, and I know it's compatible with 2010, 2013, and 2016 (maybe earlier)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This add-in lets you create (your choice) ONE of three possible sync relationships (either one way from Outlook to Icloud, one way from icloud to Outlook, or a bi-directional sync between icloud&nbsp;and Outlook, for THESE THREE FOLDERS: the Reminders folder
 (for icloud and Outlook), the contacts folder (for icloud and Outlook) and ONE calendar folder of your choice on the icloud&nbsp;side, to sync with the Outlook Calender folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the outlook side, the Outlook folders would be the folders in the Outlook folder hierarchy for the CURRENTLY SELECTED default data file.&nbsp; The idea is that you install office (but don't run Outlook yet), then install icloud&nbsp;for windows (telling it to configure
 Outlook for icloud), THEN run your mail app in control panel and MANUALLY CONFIGURE YOUR EMAIL APPS AS ALL IMAP ACCOUNTS THERE (you have more configurability&nbsp;using the control panel's mail app then you do IN Outlook).&nbsp; You don't have to manually configure
 your icloud&nbsp;email account.&nbsp; Icloud for windows already did that, if you have one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>NOW run Outlook, verify everything looks as it should.&nbsp; Close Outlook, and download and run Code Two's Code Sync for Icloud add-in (free).&nbsp; Now run Outlook.&nbsp; Verify you are on the Home tab on the ribbon bar up top.&nbsp; Then on the right click on the Code Two
 button with the blue cloud and the work setup (the button has the add-in name above).&nbsp; Setup your sync relationships.&nbsp; Hit F9 to sync and watch it all just work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have some duplicates from non-default ios calendars being duplicated to your ios default calendar, then I would look for a free to use (or paid if you want) duplicate remover add-in that will work will calendar events.&nbsp; There are many to use from,
 and they are out there.&nbsp; I am using the free version of the add-in called Remove Duplicate Calendar items from Outlook Freeware.com.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I tell the calendar pane to display all of my NON-default IOS calendars.&nbsp; I tell it NOT to display my default IOS calendar, and to display my (there's only one) Outlook Data File default calendar that icloud&nbsp;for windows created when configuring Outlook.&nbsp;
 My bi-directional sync relationship in Code Two's add-in is synching everything between the IOS default calendar, and the Outlook Data File Calendar.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>EVERYTHING in Outlook appears to work, with no broken functionality.&nbsp; JUST BE AWARE there are OUTLOOK ONLY THINGS that you can put on a calendar/notes/task event using the outlook data file default folders (for calendar/notes/tasks) that WILL NOT SYNC OVER
 to the icloud equivalent folders (like categories, and custom category names - Icloud data files do not support this on an event level, categories are by the calendar only).&nbsp; I am sure there are other Microsoft Outlook only things that also won't sync over.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the EVENT data for the ios DEFAULT calendar (or whatever you pick in your sync relationship if you have multiple calendars), the ios contacts, and the ios reminders WILL sync.</p>
<p>
</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Another nice add-in is called Puresoft Outlook To-do pane (made in Germany).&nbsp; You used to have to pay for it, but it's free now.&nbsp; You configure Outlook when it's installed on the view tab of outlook to not display the default outlook to-do pane.&nbsp; Then you
 display and configure the Puresoft version.&nbsp; You can have UP TO FOUR DIFFERENT IOS CALENDARS, ALL WITH THEIR PROPER COLORS, displaying their calendar events in a combined daily appointment view.&nbsp; You can have UP TO FOUR calendar months with clickable dates
 at the top (just keep making Puresoft's to-do bar wider).&nbsp; You can configure your tasks (carried over from icloud by Code Two's add-in) to display at the bottom of Puresoft's to-do pane.</p>
<p>VERY NICE.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It took me a solid week of googling and start paging to find these.&nbsp; If anyone knows of other icloud related add-ins designed for windows Outlook desktop with icloud for windows installed and configuring outlook, then PLEASE let me know!&nbsp; My email is *** Email address is removed for privacy ***.&nbsp;
 Thanks, and I hope this helps someone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>fwiw;&nbsp; I dont move lots of pictures to my pc but if I plugged my phone into usb on the computer, I'd be looking in the computers File Manager for my phone and browsing the phone photo's folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your android phone is running on android 7 or newer you might want to install from both the google store and windows 10's microsoft store the microsoft app named&nbsp; 'your phone'&nbsp; .&nbsp; Then you wont need a usb cable connection.</p>

            Hi  MMedlin1
<br />
<br />To transfer photos and videos from your phone to PC, connect your phone to the PC with a USB cable. Make sure the phone is on and unlocked, and that you're using a working cable, then:
<br />
<br />On your PC, select the Start  button and then select Photos to open the Photos app.
<br />Select Import &gt; From a USB device, then follow the instructions. You can pick the items you want to import and select where to save them.
<br />

<br />
<br />If you're using having trouble with an Android device or iPhone, see the below notes:
<br />
<br />On Android devices: You might need to change the USB setting to allow you to transfer media or photos and not just charge the phone. Go to Notification Center and choose Transfer files or File transfer.

<p>If the Microsoft "your phone" app in the Google Play store is a great option.&nbsp; with your phone connected, you get immediate access to your top 25 photos.&nbsp; If this doesn't work for you, another option would be to setup&nbsp; auto back up of your photos using Google
 photos to your google account.&nbsp; it will auto-synch as soon as you are on Wi-Fi, or you can force the sync.&nbsp; Then to access the photos,&nbsp; simply go to your google account and switch to photos.</p>

            Windows 10 which includes DirectX 12 includes the necessary run times for older versions of DirectX. So, you should be able to install older games using compatibility mode.

<h2>            How Do I Excercise Control Over Windows 10 Update Downloads&#63;</h2>
                    <p>On a number of occasions, I've started my computer up,&nbsp;attempted to start doing something online, and discovered that I can't because Windows 10&nbsp;is downloading yet another update, and hogging nearly all of my bandwidth.&nbsp;&nbsp;The download takes up so much bandwidth&nbsp;that
 just visiting a simple website (one with nothing fancy on the front page) can take five or more minutes (or even time out) because the trickle of bandwidth that's left available is so tiny.&nbsp; How do I get Windows 10 to let me manually control when the downloads
 take place (i.e. notify me when a download is available, and then click "Yes" or "No" to start the download), or&nbsp;failing that&nbsp;throttle down the amount of bandwidth that the download&nbsp;is using?&nbsp; The internet is flat out unusable when Windows is doing this.</p>

            You are trying to view image thumbnails and not program icons, right? The available sizes for the latter depends on the sizes defined in the embedded program icons, so if the larger sizes aren't defined then naturally the smaller icons will be shown, just
 with extra whitespace around them.

<p>I've been using LGS software on Win7 64bit for years ( G13, G710+, and a new G502 all running on
</p>
<p>version 8.56.109 software atm).</p>
<p>- Are you logged on as administrator ?&nbsp; <br />
- You have downloaded either LGS 8.56.109 or 8.57.145 ?</p>
<p>- There is a firmware update for the G402 on the page below,&nbsp; which may help&nbsp; </p>

<p>or Clean Boot -</p>

<h2>            Ping.exe DNS Lookup Method</h2>
                    <p>How does ping.exe utility perform its domain name resolution as it does not seem to use the traditional port 53 UDP DNS lookup. I have tried using Network Monitor 3.4 from technet but couldn't find anything that seemed to fit the bill.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just another note the lack of any visible lookup in NetMon 3.4 is the same for uncached domains.</p>

            <p>If your local DNS cache contains resolved domain name then there is no need to query DNS server.</p>
<p>in all other cases I think it uses DNScache service for domain resolution, that is if local cache is missing the IP of domain being pinged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Try Process monitor from&nbsp;<a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">technet</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>apply filter for UDP only and you will be seeing UDP request's going out to port 53 while pinging some unknown host.</p>
<p>
</p><p>it will even tell you what program and what user initiated requests.</p>

<p>Sometimes Microsoft gives you Updates for 3rd Party Hardware: Audio,&nbsp;Graphics, Network Adaptors, etc.</p>
<p>You should only obtain the latest Drivers for them from the actual Hardware Manufacturer's website, as Microsoft normally does nor have those latest Drivers available as Microsoft relies of the 3rd Party Hardware Manufacturer to supply them.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Either of these two update Settings will give you the chance to see what you want to install through Windows Updates;</p>
<p><strong>Download updates but let me choose whether to install them</strong> - If you select this option, Windows will download updates to your computer, but not install them automatically. If you want to install the updates then you must install them manually.
 You should only select this option if you have a reason for not installing updates automatically. Only advanced users should use this option.</p>
<p><strong>Check for updates but let me choose whether to download and install them</strong> - If you select this option, you will be alerted when there are new updates available to download and install. You can then choose to download and install the updates
 that you wish. This option should really only be used by people who know exactly what updates they need or those who have limited access to the Internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But remember you normally only have problems with 3rd Party Hardware Drivers. The other Updates are&nbsp;to enhance&nbsp;your System's Performance and Security</p>

<h2>            cant download black ops map packs&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>So i ran into the region error with buying microsoft points before, as I used to live in the US and recently moved to canada (meaning i have an american account). So on my latest trip to the states i bought a 1600 points card which i planned to use on the
 escalation map pack when i got back. I redeemed it and went to download the map pack, but it tells me this item isnt available from my current location. So is this basically telling me i cant use my points at all and just wasted my money? Im sure many people
 have this problem and dont want to make a new account due to completed achievements, etc.&nbsp; So what is my solution? I already redeemed the points on this account. Please dont steal my money again microsoft.

<p>you can still use the points on any game dlc just not on treyach or gears of war or halo games dlc as they are region locked</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>to get the blackops map packs you MUST create a canadian account and buy canadian ms points cards or wait till you goto the states and download while there</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>your actual region must reflect the same region as your account to download treyarch games</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>the canadian account doesn't have to be gold and dlc can be shared accross accounts</span></p>

<h2>            Xbox one NAT problems&#58; moderate or strict</h2>
                    
<p>Hello! I have been having problems conecting with other players as well as my friends via xbox live due to NAT issues. THE ERROR consist in the console not letting you connect with other players via party or hearing them at all, as well as being unable to
 join online sessions. I believe it to be caused by the last update since the problems began since it came out. Another thing is that i tried every troubleshoot possible. From contacting my intermet provider, port forwardin, console and router resettin. Last
 thing i tried which confirmed that the error is from xbox live is the fact that i tried connecting my console on 3 different routers from 3 diffe internet providers. What a coincidence that every other internet provider i use gets the same error message....
 If anyone has any solution that has not been discussed or any update from x-live, new info or anything please let me know. Its kind of a bummer having a lot to play and being able to. Thank you for reading this and if you are having the same problem share
 a little !&nbsp;</p>

<p>i ended up putting my X1 in a DMZ on my router and it still goes strict, every time i'm having issues with joining games or chat, i just check my NAT and sure enough it's back to strict, i run the multiplayer test, not the detailed one, and at the results
 screen i hold both triggers and both bumpers at the same time and then it goes to the details screen where is still says strict, i hit B to back out to the main network screen and my NAT changes from strict back to open, and then no issues from there.</p>

<p>As well as what Zero suggested, holding the RT, LT , RB, LB after testing Multiplayer Connection, have you tried Clearing Mac Address which can be found on the Network Testing screen ( I believe it's in Detailed Test option but could be wrong ) I've seen
 others say this has helped them get an OPEN NAT.</p>
<p>Also, I know you said you've tried several resets of your router but I use the BT Home Hub 5, now usually if I get any issues I just hit the Rest button which is on top of the Hub but there's also a little hole on the back of Hub and it says next to it ..
 "Factory Reset" ... Not sure what the difference is between a normal reset and factory reset but is there an option to do this with your router? if so then that could be worth a try.</p>
<p>Also, are you wired or wireless? is it possible for you to try a different method to see if that fixes it?</p>

<p>Turn on UPNP on the router. Then take out any port forwarding or DMZ. It won't work if those are turned on. You also might need to clear your NAT table in the router . There is a good tutorial in the NAT section on xbox.com.
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/networking/nat-error-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
support.xbox.com/.../nat-error-solution</a></p>
<p>I didn't reset my cable modem, just the router. After doing this both my 360 and One have open NAT.</p>
<p>"Turn on UPnP to refresh your NAT table</p>
<p>Step 7: Turn on UPnP to refresh your NAT table</p>
<p>UPnP is a standard that helps routers communicate effectively. If your router or gateway supports UPnP, it is likely enabled by default.</p>
<p>In some scenarios, you may be able to resolve connectivity issues by refreshing the Network Address Translation (NAT) table. To refresh the NAT table on a router where UPnP is already enabled, you need to disable UPnP, save your changes, and then power cycle
 your router. After that, you will need to turn UPnP back on and save your changes.</p>
<p>Important Do not use a combination of port forwarding, UPnP, and perimeter network (also known as DMZ) settings. If you previously enabled perimeter network functionality on your router, you must disable the perimeter network before you try this procedure.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to turn UPnP off and on:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Log in to your router's web-based configuration page to and make sure UPnP is turned on.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Note Refer to your router's documentation or support website for help turning UPnP on for the first time, or off and then back on.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Note Make sure that the router is restarted each time you update any of the router settings. If the router does not restart automatically, manually restart the router.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Turn the UPnP setting off, and then save your changes.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Restart your console and all your network hardware (your modem and router).</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Log in to your router's web-based configuration page to and make sure UPnP is turned off.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Turn the UPnP setting back on, and then save your changes again.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Restart your console and all network hardware (your modem and router)."</p>

    <title>Migration from AMD to Intel - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Migration from AMD to Intel </h2>
                    
<p>I have an AMD Athlon Desktop with an ATA hardrive. I would like to transfer the files off the ATA and move them onto an Intel i3 Desktop with a SATA hardrive. As I was moving the files over, I encountered an error that would not allow the Dr Watson folder
 to be transferred. I skipped that file and continued. After I completed this, i booted up the SATA on the Intel and I barely reached the start up screen when it cutoff and restarted.</p>
<p>I believe that it is a processor error from switching but I am not sure.</p>
<p>The OS is Windows XP SP3 Home Edition that is being moved. I used a different XP computer to transfer the files from one HDD to the other.</p>

            Yes. There is a lot more hardware that is different than just the processors, too. *All* the hardware in Computer B is different from that in Computer A. Unless you are *moving* the hard drive from Computer A to Computer B, you will need to image as previously
 explained. If you want to use Computer A's hard drive as the system drive in Computer B, you *might* be able to do a Repair Install and get Windows to boot, change out your drivers then. But more probably you would need to do a clean install.

<p>OK, that's what I thought you meant. You have Computer A (Intel) and you want that Windows installation to be on Computer B (AMD). You can't do this the way you're trying. If you don't want to use Computer A's hard drive in Computer B (I interpret your post
 as saying you have a new SATA hard drive in Computer B) then you have to image Computer A using enterprise imaging software (I used Acronis True Image Echo with Universal Restore) and then restore that image to Computer B using the Universal Restore feature.
 Even then it will be tricksy because of the different motherboards, different processors, different hard drives (IDE and SATA). And then of course you'll have an activation problem with Windows unless the version installed on Computer A was a retail version
 and not OEM. If you're keeping Computer A up and running, you need a second Product Key for Computer B and you'll have to change to that new Product Key using a special utility.</p>
<p>You can't just copy files like you're doing. All in all, unless you have a *very* pressing need to do this, you will be far better off to just do a clean install on Computer B, install your programs from CDs or installers downloaded from the Internet, restore
 your data from backups. If you feel you *must* do this, then you can purchase imaging software (make sure it has a Universal Restore feature which means you can install on bare metal with disparate hardware). It will take a fair amount of computer skills to
 do this, too. Or you can have a reputable local professional do this for you. Certainly a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place will not be capable and it won't be cheap, particularly if you *are* going to keep Windows running on Computer A because you'll
 need to buy a second copy of the operating system. If you do this yourself, between the imaging software and the OS figure at least $200-$300. I can't address how much it would cost to have a professional do it because I don't know where you live or the prices
 in your area.</p>
<p>I hope I've understood your post and explained the solution clearly. If not, please do post back with clarification, etc.</p>
