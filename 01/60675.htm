<h2>            CANNOT ACCESS ONETOUCH 4 EXTERNAL USB DRIVE AFTER REINSTALLING WINDOWS 10 WITH NEW MICROSOFT ACCOUNT</h2>
                    We have been unable to access our external usb drive (Seagate) Maxtor Onetouch 4, 500gb ever since we reinstalled windows 10 with a new microsoft account. NO amount of trying to take ownership of the drive has been successful. IT IS visible in device manager,
 disk management AND file explorer but we cannot access ANY files. It is assigned the drive letter E. What are we doing wrong? ALSO, there are 'account unknown' things showing up in the groups and users section of the security tabs of some of the folders, When
 we WERE Able to access it, we have no idea what those are? We were able to access this drive last night, but it keeps going in and out of access denied. We don't know what the account unknown things are?? HELP! There are IMPORTANT files on this external drive
 we need to get off there onto our new back up external drive.

                    Hello.&nbsp; My HP computer worked fine until two days ago - December 12 when there was a "major" update done on Windows 10.&nbsp; Since then I cannot access any websites even though it tells me that I am connected to my wireless internet provider.&nbsp; My other computer
 works fine which does not have Windows 10 so I know it's not a modem problem.&nbsp; Please help - I am NOT really comfortable with computer "speak".&nbsp; Thank you

<p>Hi Mary,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue may have something to do with your network adapter driver. The Network adapter is a computer hardware that connects a computer to a network. It may also have to be updated in order for your computer to properly connect to the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">While it's likely that you already have the most recent driver, you can try resolving it by&nbsp;updating the driver. Here's how:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select the&nbsp;<strong>Start</strong> button, type<strong>&nbsp;Device Manager</strong>, and select it from the list of results.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Expand one of the categories to find the name of your device, then right-click (or tap and hold) it, and select&nbsp;<strong>Update Driver</strong>. For graphics cards,&nbsp;expand the&nbsp;<strong>Display adapters</strong>&nbsp;category, right click
 your graphics card and select&nbsp;<strong>Update Driver</strong>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select&nbsp;<strong>Search automatically for updated driver software</strong>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If Windows doesn't find a new driver, you can try looking for one on the device manufacturer's website and follow their instructions.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 0"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If&nbsp;these steps don't work,&nbsp;try reinstalling the driver:&nbsp;Open&nbsp;<strong>Device Manager</strong>, right-click (or tap and hold)&nbsp;the name of the device, and select&nbsp;<strong>Uninstall</strong>. Restart your PC and
 Windows will attempt to reinstall the driver.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0">

<p>Hello Darian......thank you for your quick response.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately your fixes didn't help resolve my problem....in fact may have made things worse.&nbsp; I tried to update the drivers as you suggested but it wouldn't update them so then I tried to uninstall them hoping that Windows would reinstall.&nbsp; That didn't
 happen - my display went dark and nothing was fixed.&nbsp; So then I noticed an option in Windows recovery to "go back to an earlier version of Windows" so I chose that.&nbsp; All looked well after it rebooted - my display was normal again BUT the "ONE DRIVE" window
 that opens up for you to sign in to your Microsoft account on startup opened but froze the screen with the cursor spinning and spinning.&nbsp; I cannot close it nor can I open the Taskmanager to get it closed.&nbsp; I am completely dead in the water now.&nbsp; I have done
 complete REBOOTS to no avail - I am stuck at the One Drive window and cannot do anything at all!&nbsp; I wasn't having ANY problems prior to this Windows 10 update and now my computer is nothing but an expensive paperweight!&nbsp; Please help......I sure would appreciate
 it!&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

<p>Hello once again Darian.....again thank you for your quick reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately I cannot do/try any of the fixes that were suggested in the article since I cannot type anything in....cannot access the start menu....can't do anything!&nbsp; As I said I am completely dead in the water looking at the Microsoft OneDrive sign in
 page watching the cursor spin round and round.&nbsp; I cannot try a different browser since I cannot access any.&nbsp; I am using Microsoft Edge but I can't get at it either since I am stuck at this sign in screen.&nbsp; I am not getting any error messages - just the frozen
 screen.&nbsp; I live on the third floor and may soon see if this computer likes to fly!!!!!!&nbsp; Is there any way that I can start this computer up in Safe Mode and try to fix it?&nbsp; Not sure if it will even let me do that since once it's started up that's it....game
 over....tilt!&nbsp; I am sorry to be such a pain in the *&amp;*&amp;* but please help if you can!&nbsp; Thank you so very much!</p>

<p>Good morning once again Darian,</p>
<p>Unfortunately starting the computer in SAFE MODE is also a non starter!&nbsp; I tried both ways described in the article that you attached to no avail.&nbsp; When I click on the "START" button nothing happens......if I right click on it I get a limited menu ie Command
 Prompt, Power Options, Task Manager etc. so I cannot get&nbsp;to Settings!&nbsp; Holding down the Shift key while pressing the Power button only makes the screen go blank and then nothing.....it just sits there and doesn't restart - doesn't do anything and I left it
 for a LONG time in the hopes that it was just being slow!</p>
<p>I am pretty much at my wits end and wish that I had NEVER seen Windows 10 before!&nbsp; I have been using Windows computers all my life and thought that I was good with them but this has me completely stopped in my tracks!</p>
<p>There HAS TO BE SOMETHING that can be done to get this computer back up and running!&nbsp; PLEASE HELP!&nbsp; :-(((((((((</p>

<h2>            when watching video&#39;s , the picture is way zoomed in&#33;</h2>
                    <p>this is driving me insane. whenever I try to watch a video on my laptop the picture is super zoomed in and gray looking. it happens everywhere. hulu, youtube and Netflix and even gif files or ad's too. facebook videos just turn weird and gray and don't zoom
 in like the rest so far. its not just online though. it also happens in the Netflix app as well as any video&nbsp;files on my laptop. its weird and very frustrating! why is this happening? &nbsp;I was dealing with this for a couple days then today&nbsp;I just discovered
 something new. it really just happens when my laptop is on the charger.&nbsp;i tested it out and plugged it out and then&nbsp;back in again and for some reason the picture turns&nbsp;blurry, zoomed in and gray when plugged in. that may&nbsp;seem better cause I can watch some
 if I plug it out.....but it still sucks cause I&nbsp; literally will have&nbsp;stop what I'm doing , pause the movie etc and charge then watch later and that's just doing too much. &nbsp;I cant literally be the only one this has happened to. does anyone know why this is
 happening to my laptop?????</p>

            Same thing is happening to me and I dont know what to do. Its really getting on my nerves because I have to stop watching Netflix because everytime I charge, &nbsp;it zooms in and when I unplug it goes back to normal. I also charge my computer which takes a
 long time and go back on Netflix and continue what I was doing.

            Hi Jamie,<br />
<br />

There are several reasons why you're having issues with watching videos. One of the reasons that could affect this is when a video card is not updated. We suggest that you update the drivers on your Windows 10 computer. You may check this

                    My file explorer was always hanging whenever i click any file (e.g .doc, .ppt) in a&nbsp; folder , then i realize that i should clear the file explorer history so that my folder will not hang anymore, so why would clearing the file explorer history make my
 folder not hang anymore whenever I click a file in it?

            Hi Astoach
<br />
<br />Clearing File Explorer History simply deletes the list of file/folder locations visited in Explorer along with the list of any searches you performed in Explorer
<br />
<br />Somehow that cache must have become corrupt and clearing that history deletes the cache and creates a new one
<br />
<br />It is no harm to delete that history from time to time, it will not affect the good running of your PC . . .

    <title>Homegroup Broken After Upgrading to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> genepaine  say:</h3>
<h2>            Homegroup Broken After Upgrading to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Before Win10 came out, I had a Toshiba netbook running Win7 Starter Edition and a HP Pavilion laptop running Windows 7 Home. I had a working homegroup that had been created by the laptop. After upgrading the laptop to Win10, I no longer have a functioning
 homegroup. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop does not "see" the old homegroup and when I try to create a new one, it throws the error "Windows can't create a homegroup on this computer."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The netbook "sees" the old homegroup and suggests that&nbsp;I join the homegroup: however, when I try to join the homegroup, the netbook throws an error to the effect that it can't create a homegroup. Note: I was trying to join not create a homegroup.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My troubleshooting revealed the following related or unrelated facts:</p>
<p>
</p><p>(1) The Peer Networking Identity Manager service&nbsp;is running.</p>
<p>(2) The Peer Networking Grouping service is not running and throws the following error when I try to start it: "Error 1068: The dependency service or group failed to start."</p>
<p>(3) The Peer Name Resolution Protocol service is not running and throws the following error when I try to start it: "Error 0x80630203: Unable to access a key."</p>
<p>(4) (Possibly related to #(3) above.) When I double-click on file C:/windows/ServiceProfiles/LocalService/AppData/Roaming/PeerNetworking/idstore.sst the following message is displayed "This file is invalid for use as the following: Microsoft Serialized Certificate
 Store."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have endured&nbsp;two Level 1 support sessions where the technician knows no more than I do about homegroups, but none-the-less, spends over an hour poking around hopelessly. After the first session last week, the problem was elevated to Level 2 (apparently
 for free), but the phone connection was so garbled that I had no choice but to hang up. After the second session (today), the tech refused to elevate the problem to Level 2 unless I bought a $150 subscription which I refused to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So any help would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Hello.&nbsp; I have the same problem.&nbsp; All PC's now on Windows 10, fully updated.&nbsp; Tried turning all PC's off and re-booting only one.&nbsp; Tried navigating to the peernetworking folder and deleting all folder contents on all three PC's including the "idstore" files.&nbsp;
 Have run homegroup troubleshooter dozens of times on all three - at the same time and separately.&nbsp; The original PC the homegroup was set up on no longer exists.&nbsp; Have checked all network adapters and network privacy/sharing settings.&nbsp; I am never given the
 "Leave Homegroup" option, or "Create New Homegroup" option.&nbsp; It continues to offer me only the option to "Join" the existing homegroup, which does not in fact exist and produces the "homegroup no longer exists" message. It says I can close and start a new
 Homegroup, but I can't - it will only go to the same "join" loop.&nbsp; I can find no way to delete or disable this homegroup to start a new one.&nbsp; I am extremely frustrated.&nbsp; Any help appreciated.&nbsp; Thanks</p>
<p>Patti-Ann</p>

            <p>I have had same sort of issues, all the computers display join a homegroup, you have been invited to join a homegroup.</p>
<p>Starting the services mentioned made no difference. However I did find that if you changed the name of the workgroup, for most the default is WORKGROUP, to something else, eg. BOB the create a new workgroup option is displayed. So the homegroup settings
 are being stored in another folder or in the registry somewhere and need to be cleared.<br />

<p>Ok, I know this is&nbsp; an old thread, but wanted to see if there's any better help out there.&nbsp; I upgraded one of my machines to Windows 10 this weekend, the one that has the printer attached to it, not realizing that the old machine that generated my Homegroup
 was gone and I don't have the code.&nbsp; Therefore, I need to get rid of that old homegroup and start a new one.&nbsp; I unjoined the old Homegroup from every PC.&nbsp; Turned them off, and was able to create a new one, and join one of my machines to the new homegroup.&nbsp;
 Subsequent machines still see the old Homegroup, even though I have cleared the PeerNetworking folder, unjoined the group, etc. - it asks me to join every I go to Homegroup, but the password isn't the new one, so it must be prioritizing that old, dead homegroup
 for some reason.&nbsp; Any ideas on how else to purge the old group???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now, one week into being on windows 10 , I'm getting used to it...what pissed me off was the rearranging of all my tiles as I had them grouped specifically to my liking.&nbsp; No mater, I had to waste a lot of time re-arranging them back, but its done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>MY BIG BIG issues with 10, are my secondary e-mail accounts not syncing.&nbsp; I have tried all the suggested recommendations for fixing, and none work.&nbsp; I have my primary aol and my gmail that are ok.&nbsp; I cannot get my secondary aol and my icoud/me accounts to
 sync.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have reached a major frustration level.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot even click on the '<strong>Change mailbox sync setting' </strong>because it is<strong> NOT highlighted for me to select on it.

<p>Which browser are you using?<br />
<br />
Try to rename or delete the <b>WebSetup </b>folder and try again.<br />
<br />
C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\AppData\Local\Microsoft\<b>WebSetup</b><br />
<br />
Please let us know if you're able to continue after trying the above</p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gather all important application discs and hardware driver discs you might need to be reinstalled.</li><li>Check the manufacturer and software developers website for updates available and to find out about the status of compatibility with Windows 8. It is possible that if the software is compatible with Windows Vista it will likely work with Windows 8 since
 they share the same driver model.</li><li>If you are using software such as iTunes or Adobe programs, remember to deauthorize and deactivate them before running setup.
</li></ul>
<p>When making significant changes to your computer such as an upgrade, it is always recommended you backup your system prior to installing a new version of Windows. Thankfully, all editions of Windows 7 includes system imaging, which means you can backup your
 entire Windows 7 installation and restore it if it fails. Learn more about how to backup your Window 7 installation
<strong><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/24/how-to-backup-your-installation-of-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong></p>
<p>In addition to System Imaging, you can backup just your personal files using Backup and Restore, to do that, check out the following article:</p>
<p><a href="http://notebooks.com/2010/12/27/how-to-backup-to-an-external-hard-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://notebooks.com/2010/12/27/how-to-backup-to-an-external-hard-drive/</a><br />

<p>If you want to backup themes, wallpapers and other minor features, Windows Easy Transfer is another option, you can learn more about it
<strong><a href="http://www.notebooks.com/2009/10/07/using-windows-easy-transfer-in-windows-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong></p>
<p><strong>What you can do before attempting the upgrade?</strong></p>
<p>You can do some pre-requisite tasks to ensure a smooth migration from Windows 7 to Windows 8. If you are using a name branded computer such as a Dell or HP, go to the manufacturers website for the model computer you are using and download the latest available
 drivers for that computer. Store them on a disc or USB thumb drive. Important drivers you should try to obtain include Network and Video Drivers. Its possible that they might just have Windows Vista or Windows 7 drivers, those will work with Windows 8.
</p>
<p>Other things you can do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Uninstall any security software before attempting to upgrade.</li><li>Disable any encryption software you might have installed.</li><li>Disable/uninstall disk utility software such as DVD/CD burning utilities or third party defragment programs such as Perfect Disk.</li><li>Make sure your computer is updated (devices and applications).</li><li>Disconnect any external devices before installing.</li><li>Check your hard disk for any errors:<br />
- Click Start<br />
- Type: CMD<br />
- Right click CMD then click Run as administrator<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: chkdsk /r /f<br />
Exit the command prompt.<br />
When you restart your system, your computer will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.</li><li>Another thing you can do is disable Start items:</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>Click Start</li><li>Type: MSCONFIG.</li><li>Hit Enter on your keyboard</li><li>On the General tab, click Selective Startup.</li><li>Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup Items check box.</li><li>Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.</li><li>Click OK.</li><li>When you are prompted, click Restart.</li><li>After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.</li></ul>
<p><strong>Run the System File Checker utility.</strong></p>
<p>SFC/Scannow checks your Windows installation for errors and corrects them. This will help with ensuring that a smooth upgrade occurs.
</p>
<p>Click Start<br />
Type: CMD, from the results, right click CMD<br />
Click ‘Run as Administrator’<br />
At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow</p>
<p>This will check for any integrity violations</p>
<p>Restart your system</p>

            I've got the same problem. I've tried everything I can think of except a clean install (I have 1TB worth of files, no way will I be able to back that up, and I'm pretty sure selecting "Keep Nothing" erases everything, and even if I could back it up, what
 if it just fails again?). I'm using a HP dv6-6b06sa laptop in case Myles happens to be using the same (or similar).<br />
<br />
I don't care about my installation settings, does anyone know if it just moves the files to a Windows.old folder when you select nothing, or does it actually delete everything? If it just moves it then I can reinstall everything and copy my files out. In a
 worst case scenario I can recover the OS, I just don't want to have to do that.<br />

            Yes, I do have HP pavilion dv6. I think &nbsp;have also seen another post with someome having the same problems with the pavilion dv6. Also, I think the Keep Nothing options erases everything, and if that is the case, I really don't want to be doing that.&nbsp;

            Thought I'd reply. I found a solution, but you might not like it. I ran the installer from a flash drive again, and this time I selected "Custom", then selected my main partition, continued, it installed. I tested it on a 30gb SSD I had around first and
 it installed fine on that and moved everything to Windows.old. This wont' delete your files unless you click "Format", but you will have to reinstall everything.<br />
<br />
You can find guides on how to recover your firefox, chrome, etc settings in Google if you choose to do it this way. This implies it was some kind of driver problem, but I can't look into it any further because I've worked around it. If you do it like this,
 most of your files that weren't just stored in C:\ (or whatever your drive letter is) will be in C:\Windows.old =)<br />

<p>You can not have 2 gamertags on the same email/ MS account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best thing to do is to contact xbox support by going to support.xbox.com and give them the gamertags and if they can verify ownership of the accounts they can tell you what the email is that is associated with the gamertag.</p>

<p>I know the email that has the same accounts it is the same also know my password it wont work when I try to sign in on xbox live. This is the only way to contact service on xbox.com you guys do not make this easy what so ever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On another note I change the email on the new gamertag and removed the email I had on both from that Microsoft account. so now the new one has its own separate email.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem I am having now is I still cannot log into my old one because it does not have a Microsoft account now when I try to enter my password the same thing happens, the screen loads but never signs me in. When I try to reset my password I am stuck
 entering codes to check if I am a human. I get the code right but another one pops up and just continues to pop up codes even though I get them right.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi David, </p>
<p>
</p><p>The Microsoft Account can be attached to two gametags, however, it can only be set as the primary email for one gamertag. That means when signing into the Microsoft account, it will only show one gamertag. If the gamertag is on the Xbox then signing into
 the profile on the console, it would be possible to see what email is the primary email for the gamertag in question.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason why the Microsoft account is able to be assigned to two profiles is, because as the secondary email it will help to regain access to the account/gamertag.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Check out this link for ways to recover the account: <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/my-account/microsoft-account/manage-your-microsoft-account-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

                    For the last two days (Sept 28th/29th), it seems like the Windows 10 updates have hung my two computers.&nbsp; After the updates, the reboot goes on forever and rebooting into the Safe Mode provides no insight&nbsp;as to&nbsp;what is going south.&nbsp; The Event log has no
 indications as to what is going wrong on the reboot.&nbsp; I am not sure what got me out of KB3176936 other than image restore to a working state the day before and even though the problem persisted after that image restore,&nbsp;going thru a Reflect "fix Windows boot
 problem" did I finally get the computer up and running.&nbsp; Now it looks like my Surface Pro 3 is in an infinite "Getting Windows ready" notice after updating with KB3194496 after the second reboot that I manually initiated after the update reboot brought up
 the Surface with no problems.&nbsp; So why after the second reboot is the Surface attempting to Getting&nbsp;Windows ready which looks like it will go on forever? &nbsp;One big question I have is,

            I finally got my PC to reboot by going in to Safe Mode and running Device Manager and uninstalling all the USB drivers. I think the USB driver for my external monitor causes the problem.

            There is no repeatable&nbsp;way of getting into the Safe Mode from Windows 10; at least, that I've been able to find.&nbsp; I can get to the machine's boot options and sometimes selecting the Windows Boot Manager option will give me a screen where I can chose various
 Safe Mode options but at other times this doesn't work at all.&nbsp; If the machine thinks it has been powered down incorrectly, it will give me the Safe Mode options otherwise the best I can do is boot to my rescue media boot disk.&nbsp; This is a big problem for me
 since the Safe Mode works every time but I can not find out why booting into my full Windows 10 configuration seems to be a random hardware failure.&nbsp; I think it was only the fickle finger of fate that after doing the last two Windows 10 cumulative updates
 I would end up&nbsp;in an infinite boot loop. &nbsp; I don't necessarily think it is the two last updates per se but I know for sure that trying the KB3194496 update twice resulted in an never ending boot where t

            I get my computer into safe mode by turning my computer off as soon as the windows logo pops up and on the 3rd try it boots into a mode where I can troubleshoot and reboot into safe mode.

            <p>That might be a way of doing it since I find that a power up/down error code (0xc0000001) has to be generated in order to back into the Safe Mode.&nbsp; I guess pulling the power plug might be another way.&nbsp; So it is totally stupid that you can't get into the
 Safe Mode except by stupid mechanisms.&nbsp; I spent 3 hours researching this and&nbsp;ended up building a Windows 10 Recovery Disk (Windows ISO ??) which was supposed to get to&nbsp;Repair Your Computer --&gt; &nbsp;Startup Settings when booting off the system recovery bootable
 DVD.&nbsp; Guess what?&nbsp; It doesn't work for SSDs (solid state drives) since the Startup Settings screen was missing.&nbsp; Otherwise it was a good posting titled "Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start" in the Microsoft Community under Windows 10 area which leads you
 to creating an installation media (USB&nbsp;flash drive or DVD) using MediaCreationTool.exe&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've turned off automatic Windows updates (Defer Updates) since for reasons beyond my pay grade, there is something about rebooting from an update that is different from nominal restarts.&nbsp; The reboots from the updates causes my machine to end up with the
 little circle rotating for "infinity and beyond".&nbsp; So even though the updates for the last week have caused the problem, I don't think it is the updates themselves but something they do that causes my computer to refuse to boot into the full Windows 10 environment
 but works fine in the Safe Mode if I can figure out how to generate the power up error code &nbsp;(0xc0000001) that will allow me to get into the Safe Mode&nbsp;.&nbsp; The other part of my problem is that I can find no discernable way to determine the root cause while in
 the Safe Mode unless I know what the 10,000 lines of boot logging trace means to the common man.&nbsp;</p>

            I am having the same exact problem except I am reimaging the disk to the previous working state to get back to a working state.&nbsp; I thought I had turned off the auto updates but got nailed by an update last night&nbsp;which took me&nbsp;to the infinite little circle
 rotating boot problem.&nbsp; I've moved off to another computer since I've got better things to do that troubleshoot why the updates are killing me.

            <p>It's annoying because you can't delay or deffer updates on Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, it uninstalls all the games and updates that I installed on the 29th of September.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right now, I'm relying on sleep mode so it doesn't force the BROKEN update. That just stops me from repairing and reinstalling my programs when I turn off my PC.</p>

    <title>Why is my Start Menu not working&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeob mallari  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is my Start Menu not working&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I know this may seem to be familiar, but I just want to ask personally; to get answers from you, specifically for my case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon installing Windows 10, I have had no problems with it. It was all running smoothly and I was loving it. But there was this one time that the Start Menu stopped working. I asked friends and colleagues if they've encountered the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some told me to just restart the computer. I tried that and it'll work for some 3-5 mins. After the time frame, the start menu won't respond again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some told me to find internet solutions for this, so I googled it up and found several solutions. I have tried them all, one by one, but they all did not complete.<br />
<br />
One was to run a System File Checker on administrative command prompt, run PowerShell and type in the command
<em>sfc /scannow </em>but it did not show up any violations or irregularities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another proposed solution was to type in&nbsp;<em>Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\<span>AppXManifest.xml</span>"}
</em>in an administrative Powershell, but it stopped working at just about 30% of checking VCLibs, the first thing it checks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another was to run a windows image check using the D<span>ism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth</span> command.
 It stopped at 20%, and I don't know why.<br />
<br />
I just want the Windows 10 team of developers to create a permanent fix for this problem, because obviously, I'm not the only one having this problem. It may come with an update, or a software to be downloaded and installed, or what. Not everyone are techies,
 not everybody understands what the proposed solution actually does to our laptops. We may be changing our settings for this problem but it might just be a temporary fix and may cause worse problems in the future.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows XP Won&#39;t start up, F8 won&#39;t work either. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drone12  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows XP Won&#39;t start up, F8 won&#39;t work either.</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I have a Dell Dimension 2400 Series Bios Revision A05 (I'm reading what the splash screen says) running Windows XP Professional and I'm pretty sure the operating system is corrupted ( NTLDR is missing, strike F1 to reboot, or strike F2 to enter system
 settings), so I tried running in safe mode, but F8 isn't working anymore (Keyboard Failure, and each time I press F8 the computer beeps AFTER the Dell splash screen). I tried EVERYTHING I could find: tapping F8 repeatedly, holding F8, hold shift while tapping
 F8, hold shift AND F8, etc. I did realize that the only keys that work during boot up is F2 and F12, which appear on the Dell splash screen, but if I press F2, it says entering system settings, and if I press F12, the computer beeps. F2 Opens system settings,
 and F12 opens the Boot Device menu. Also note that there is no F lock key on the keyboard I'm using, and that the keyboard is NOT connected with a USB. I tried seeing if there's a possible way to enter safe mode/ do a system restore using those, but had no
 luck. I think I might have a recovery disc on there, and I want to do a factory reset on my computer (I moved all my vital things onto a 16 gb sd card before I started getting problems). Here's the actual question now:</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I factory reset my computer if Windows XP won't launch and F8 isn't working?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm also not THAT tech savvy when it comes to computer hardware, so if you feel there may be a hardware issue involved, please cope with me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the support in advance!</p>

            <p>The pc beeps that you hear,mean the pc is trying to tell you a major</p>
<p>problem exists....Usually a hardware failure,however,if its a desktop pc,</p>
<p>youre 1st&nbsp;repair should be replacing the board battery.The battery failure</p>
<p>will&nbsp;cause the exact same problem(s).The BIOS isnt functioning..To replace,</p>
<p>power off pc,remove battery,wait 10 minutes,replace with new..Once pc</p>
<p>starts,enter the BIOS &amp; reset date/time,etc &amp; any add-on cards,save &amp; exit&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Be sure to unplug the system from the wall outlet before attempting to change the motherboard battery.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have a Dell computer - tell us the Service Tag number so we can find out more about your system and look for manuals from the Dell WWW site.&nbsp; The service tag number will be usually be found on the back of the computer case, but it may be located
 on the top or side of the system.<br />
<br />
Tell us the exact error message you see about NTLDR (no paraphrasing).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to this beeping and no boot incident, what do you think happened to the system, when was the last time it worked, did you have a power failure, pull the plug, use the power button, etc. to try to solve some problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have a genuine bootable XP installation CD that is the same Service Pack as your unspecified Service Pack (this is not the same as any recovery type CDs that may have come with your system).<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>When your system reboots the BIOS performs a Power On Self Test (POST) and if there is a problem, reports the result of the POST with beeps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Beep codes are giving you a message and you need to interpret the beep codes.<br />
<br />
Usually a single short beep when restarting is a good sign.&nbsp; If you are hearing something else you need to figure out what the beep code mean by listening to the pattern of beeps.&nbsp; Maybe something like:</p>
<p>
</p><p>3 short-2 long-3 short.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you can use this Advanced Troubleshooting page where you can find more information about what the beep codes are telling you along with the diagnostic lights on the back of the unit (since I can't find it on Dell's page):<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.l3jane.net/doc//2400/advtshoo.htm#1105830" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.l3jane.net/doc//2400/advtshoo.htm#1105830</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the beep pattern you hear is not in that list, describe it and tell us what the pattern you hear is using the same short/long example above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To reset your system to the as shipped from the factory condition (the second worst possible troubleshooting idea), you press Ctrl+F11 at just the right moment (assuming your restore partition is intact) but you might not get very far until you fix the issue
 reported by the beep codes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a copy/paste from the Dimension 2400 User Manual about how to do that:</p>
<p>Restore restores your hard drive to the operating state it was in when you purchased the computer.<br />
Any programs or files added since you received your computer permanently deleted from the hard drive. Data files include documents, spreadsheets, e-mail messages, digital photos, music files, and so on. If possible, back up all data before using PC Restore.<br />
NOTICE:<br />
Using PC Restore permanently deletes all data on the hard drive and removes any applications or drivers installed after you received your computer. If possible, back up the data before using PC Restore.<br />
To use PC Restore:<br />
1 Turn on the computer.<br />
During the boot process, a blue bar with www.dell.com appears at the top of the screen.<br />
2 Immediately upon seeing the blue bar, press &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;F11&gt;.<br />
If you do not press &lt;Ctrl&gt;&lt;F11&gt; in time, let the computer finish restarting, and then<br />
restart the computer again.<br />
NOTICE:<br />
If you do not want to proceed with PC Restore, click Reboot in the following step.<br />
3 On the next screen that appears, click Restore.<br />
4 On the next screen, click Confirm.<br />
The restore process takes approximately 6–10 minutes to complete.<br />
5 When prompted, click Finish to reboot the computer.<br />
NOTE:<br />
Do not manually shut down the computer. Click Finish and let the computer completely reboot.<br />
6 When prompted, click Yes.<br />
The computer restarts. Because the computer is restored to its original operating state, the<br />
screens that appear, such as the End User License Agreement, are the same ones that<br />
appeared the first time the computer was turned on.<br />
7 Click Next.<br />
The System Restore screen appears and the computer restarts.<br />
8 After the computer restarts, click OK </p>
