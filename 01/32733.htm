            Hi  MaryLeef
<br />
<br />Can you please explain where you are trying to delete these files from?
<br />
<br />Are you trying to delete the files from the Recent list in Word and Excel or from your PC from inside Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />If you are trying to delete those files form inside Windows File Explorer, what if any error(s) are you seeing?       
        </p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Office mobile apps in Edge work like the Office desktop apps … you can open files, unpin files within Word or Excel but not delete them sending you back to the File Explorer for that task.</p>

<h2>            Copy &#47; Move files to a USB device</h2>
                    <p>I want to take some pics from my library and put them on a stick (usb) to make hard copies. When I plug the stick in it says there are no pics to download. That's a good thing. But when I go to the pics I don't see the Icon for the flash drive where it used
 to be. It shows its there on my devices page but not on the pics page where I can drag a pic to the flash drive. It used to be there? What did I do? Or not do? I want to transfer pics to removable device but cant. Perplexed</p>

<h2>            Skype on iPad Crashes While Retrieving Old Messages</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; On my computer I am only able to retrieve messages that date back to the history option I selected - BUT - on my iPad it will retrieve well over a year. The issue is that it crashes as I get past the one year mark. So, I know Microsoft has those conversations
 stored and I need them for pending litigation. With whom can I discuss the retrieval process?</p>

            Hi I am a fellow community member here to help if I can.<br /><br />Unfortunately Microsoft only stores the last 30 days on their servers. Further back needs to be retrieved from the device on which you used Skype. Perhaps Skype support can help you do that<br /><br /> skype support<br /><br /><a href="https://support.skype.com/en/skype/all/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.skype.com/en/skype/all/</a><br /><br />Skype Support Chat<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/help.support.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/help.support.skype</a> <br /><br />Or you can contact Microsoft as they own and operate Skype<br />You can Chat with Microsoft Support<br /><a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en/contact/menu/msa/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a><br /><br />Or<br /><br />Talk to Microsoft via Telephone<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/13948/

            Note that not all options at the above links will get you to a live support rep. Many will direct you back to the public community. If you choose "account" and "account blocked" as your categories it will get you to a live Skype support agent

<h3> helen2364  say:</h3>
<h2>            Epson Printer XP-335 &#38; Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I purchased the above printer being advised that it would work on Windows 10 system. (My computer is a Acer Aspire V5 laptop) I managed to upload driver from disc and eventually managed to get it to print from computer.&nbsp; However, Windows did an update the
 other week and then the printer stopped working, computer couldn't find printer.&nbsp; Reset router address on printer and still had problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now uninstalled the printer, tried to upload the auto run from dis and got message "INF file selected does not support this method of installation".&nbsp;&nbsp; Not to be deterred, I thought I would download the driver direct from Epson;&nbsp; I can download the
 driver folder, but when it comes to unzipping it and installing the driver I get the message "The printer driver and/or utilities cannot be installed your windows system".&nbsp; Finally I tried installing printer by going into windows, Devices, Printers and Scanners,
 add printers and scanners and the system found my printer - fantastic!&nbsp;&nbsp; I can now print!&nbsp; However,&nbsp; I cannot change any printing preferences,&nbsp; which I really need to access -&nbsp; that option doesn't exist, &nbsp;&nbsp; I literally can print whats on the page and I cant
 use any of the fantastic things that came with this printer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a simple answer to my problem?&nbsp;&nbsp; I class myself as a novice when it comes to computers so simple easy to follow answers to this question would very much be appreciated.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>

            Your reply was not helpful. &nbsp;It had nothing to do with printer or router. &nbsp; &nbsp;Microsoft remote spent three hours on my computer and eventually decided it was caused by corrupt Windows download and they reinstalled Windows 10 and transferred all my files.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sorry for the delay.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let's try these steps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Try connecting to different video outputs on the PC. Sometimes a change in driver can cause the video to be sent:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To a different Adapter: from integrated graphics to a discrete card or vice versa.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To a different output: from HDMI to DVI, DisplayPort to VGA, or any other combination.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Try to boot into Safe Mode with Networking or Enable low-resolution video. Advanced boot options, Safe Mode with Networking, or Low Resolution Video
</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>-Check Device Manager and look for Display Adapters.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>-If you see 2 items under Display Adapters, disable to integrated video card (e.g. Intel HD 4000 or AMD Radeon HD 4200) and restart. (try vice versa if it does not work)
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>-If you see 1 item under Display Adapters, rollback the driver or uninstall the display adapter in Device Manager, and enable the option to delete driver software.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>-Check the PC or display adapter manufacturer’s site for an updated driver.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please update us with the status. We will be glad to assist you.</span></p>

            <p>Not very helpful.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed Windows 10 - seemed to go fine - Windows 10 initial screen and sign on page worked fine - after signing in get what appears to be my old Windows 8.1 start screen that blinks on and off - Suggestions to go to Device Manager&nbsp; or Start Menu or some
 other place are not useful as cursor and screen blink and do not let me go anywhere else.
</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 backup - unacceptably slow</h2>
                    Just got a new Dell XPS PC with Intel i7 processor and Windows 7.<br />
Tried to run a backup using Windows 7.<br />
Ugg!!!!!<br />
I have about 400gb of data on my PC.<br />
I used to run backups on the old PC using Vista backup as well as Seagate software that came with&nbsp;onw of my&nbsp;backup drives.&nbsp; Full backup took 5-6 hours at most.&nbsp; I typically keep 3 backups.&nbsp; Acronis on Vista also took only a few hours and incremental backs were
 very fast.<br />
With Windows 7 after 18 hours, the backup is only 32% done.<br />
I pulled the plug.<br />
It will take almost a week to run 3 backups at this rate.&nbsp; <br />
Hard to believe this is such a huge step backwards from Vista.<br />
<br />
Anyone find a way to get Windows 7 backup to run at acceptable speed?<br />

            tried loads of things even microsoft recommended settings. found this great......its bloody works, thanks to the super brain who worked it out Go to 1. Control panel 2. System and Maintenance 3. Administrative tools 4. Run services shortcut Once the services
 program loads find the services called Background intelligent transfer service and stop it also right click on the same service and click properties then change the start value to manual or disabled this should also fix the network problem and USB copy and
 paste problem . Amazing problem solved

<h2>            Windows 10 Store is not installed, No folder exists</h2>
                    Many features don't work since upgrading to Windows 10 and I think the major issue is that my Store isn't installed. &nbsp;The folder that its targeted to does not exist. This is causing Apps, part of the start menu, Cortana, and the Store itself to not work.
 &nbsp;How can I reinstall the Windows Store App??

    <title>vista wakes up from sleep by itself - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> drivenbywhat  say:</h3>
<h2>            vista wakes up from sleep by itself</h2>
                    As the title states, my vista pc wakes up from sleep by itself. Normally it will sleep for 10-15 minutes before waking up. At other times it's random and will wake up within 2 minutes or 30 minutes. I've searched countless forums and tried the solutions
 suggested but can't solve the issue. The only thing I've found to keep it asleep is unplugging the network cable from the pc or unplugging the network cable from the cable modem. I suspect some service or program is waking it up but I have no idea which one.
 The following is all I've tried:<br />
<br />
I used powercfg in the command line to see which devices were enabled to wake the pc. They were only the mouse &amp; the keyboard. They are both wired usb devices. I've unplugged each separately before putting the pc to sleep and it will still wake up. I've use
 "last_wake" but I just get "0" and in the event viewer it says "wake source unknown".
<br />
<br />
I've made sure that "allow this pc to turn off this device to save power" was checked for the network card in the power management tab. I have also disabled the option in the advanced properties of the network card. I have also disabled it on the bios. Having
 done this and the pc still wakes up is what puzzles me the most when I know if I unplugged the network card the pc will sleep for hours until I decide to wake it. It is wired not wireless.
<br />
<br />
I only have "sleep" turned on. There is no hybrid sleep mode or hibernation available.
<br />
<br />
This is vista business so I do not have media center. Media player is not enabled to share files on the network or to look for them. Media sharing is disabled and this is the only pc on my network. Also just in case "multimedia settings" is set to allow pc
 to go to sleep in power options. <br />
<br />
I've checked the task scheduler for any tasks that may be set to "wake this computer" so it can run but only one of them has this option. It is for multiple monitors and I've unchecked the box and the pc still wakes up. I've checked for hidden tasks and the
 only one I found that could be the culprit was MS feeds. However, after deleting it the pc still wakes up.
<br />
<br />
I do not have sidebar enabled. <br />
<br />
Windows update is set to notify me when updates are available. <br />
<br />
I also did an msconfig &amp; selected "selective startup". I unchecked startup programs. The pc still woke up.<br />
<br />
Tried starting pc in safe mode but there is no sleep option available to test out if it will wake from sleep in safe mode.<br />
<br />
Last but not least is when the pc does wake up it will go back to sleep within 2 minutes.<br />
<br />
As you can see I've tried everything I could think of without much success. Can anybody tell me something new or that I haven't tried?

            I have no idea what you're trying to do but here is what I found to be my problem. I have an intel motherboard. Although I turned off "wake on lan" from both vista &amp; bios there was still a 3rd setting that I was not aware of. It was apart from the bios
 or vista. It's an intel setting in the "management engine interface" if I remember correctly. It's accessed after the bios option and before windows loads. Once I turned it off my pc stop resuming from sleep. So if you have an intel mobo then that's your problem.

<h2>            Windows 10 update got me into a endless reboot loop &#40;Please help&#41;</h2>
                    I had windows 10 for around a year now and last night before I shut off my computer it updated. Me having almost no experience with windows 10 aloud it to proceed. I got back from work and I booted up my computer it goes to a msi menu since I have a custom
 gaming computer where it shows me bios and such; I didn't touch anything thinking that this will continue to the next screen like it always does but instead it reboots. It doesn't reboot hard where the computer shuts down and turns back on but instead the
 screen turns black and it pops up again. Thinking that this may just be something wrong I let it happen a few more times. I tried to restart the computer 3 times to try and get the safemode options to come up but it didn't. The next time it booted I went into
 the bios and searched for a system recovery like it has on windows 7 but i couldn't find it (I don't even know if windows 10 bios has that kind of thing). Now im stuck at this point where the last update has put me into a endles

            You always give this stupid response and it's not the answer! He can't log in to windows!!! How is he supposed to download anything???? This is not a problem unique to this update. Every single update does this for me. I have never found a fix no matter
 how many times I asked for help. I just keep shutting it off and back on for several hours or days until it magically starts running again. And then I do all I can to prevent the next update from happening.&nbsp;

<h2>            XBox Live Keeps disconnecting</h2>
                    
<p>I've had my XBox One for about 2 weeks and whenever I play online, 5-10 minutes later XBox Live disconnects for no apparent reason,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I've forwarded Ports, turned up UPnP, my NAT is open, I'm getting around 90MBps download speed and 11MBps Upload speed. My internet in general is fine and isn't cutting out.</p>
<p>Any idea why this keeps happening? I just want to play some GTA V Online, I'm getting fed up with this now.</p>
<p>I've also tried both Wireless and Wired, doesn't make a difference.</p>

<p>Are you using 2.4 or 5 ghz? &nbsp;If you are using 2.4 with a lot of other 2.4 devices then you may have interference problems. &nbsp;If you have a smart phone or tablet I recommend downloaded WIFI Analyzer to select the best wifi setup including channel on your router.</p>

    <title>Are you a Windows 7 user having issues installing drivers for 7th - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> 1337creator  say:</h3>
<h2>            Are you a Windows 7 user having issues installing drivers for 7th generation Intel GPU&#39;s&#63; READ HERE FOR THE FIX</h2>
                    Hi! My names Christian. I am 23 years old and have spent over 15 years of my life programming, customizing, repairing and diagnosing various things for the PC.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I'm writing this topic because 72 hours ago, my mother had bought me an Acer E17 Laptop, to which I immediately installed Windows 7 on the machine, as I've never upgraded my Windows copy (nor should I) until the extended support is gone.<br />
<br />
Problem? Well, i thought all was good... Until it came down to installing the prerequisite intel graphics driver so i could then install the geforce drivers....&nbsp;<br />
<br />
You see, my machine has both an Intel 620 GPU and a beautiful Geforce 940MX, now using the intel website it guided me, to what was SUPPOSED the Win 7 x64 driver. Trying to install it proved unsuccessful.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Rather- it turns out Intel, the company i grew up pouring money into, the company i relied on for CPU's to combine with Nvidia cards, the company thats powering this Core i5 processor thats fueling this laptop.. DESTROYED THEIR INTEGRITY to cut corners in businesses,
 and did NOT ATTEMPT to add SIMPLE Windows 7 support.<br />
<br />
THE SOLUTION?!?!?!<br />
One Line of Code. Yes- you read that right. One line of code in the igdlh64.inf file and compatability was restored..VOILA. Here is the download link for the modded driver&nbsp;<br />
https://1drv.ms/u/s!AkR79484fpjxgi9EZCBfc4Qdzyzl<br />
<br />
Download the file,go to your driver folder, delete the old igdlh64.inf,<br />
paste the new one, then as usual update the driver manually with have disk in device manager...&nbsp;<br />
<br />
And point it to the igdlh64.inf file, (its in the graphics folder FYI)<br />
<br />
SO IN CONCLUSION-<br />
<br />
Now yes, I understand AMD has done something similar, and i could have just kept Windows 10.<br />
<br />
<br />
But its principle, and does not excuse this shady behavior, just so they dont have to spend time/money to help YOU- THE CUSTOMER. They do NOT need to cut costs this badly to sustain.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I will continue reverse engineering what i please, and this is no exception. Intel will not impose an upgrade on us users, when WE are the REASON they stand where they are today! WE choose how we use our machines.

            <p>I think the best thing you could do now is to make System restore of your PC or laptop.</p>
<p>It will only restore all the system settings before something bad is occur to your PC. You will not loose any file like music, video, movie and documents if you restore your system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How to Restore your System.</strong><br />
</p>
<p>Step 1.&nbsp;<span>press&nbsp;</span><em>windows&nbsp;+ x</em><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Step 2. <span>click "</span><em>System</em><span>"</span></p>
Choose the restore point and click&nbsp;</span><em>next button</em><span>.</span></p>

    <title>Can&#39;t get recovery environment to load - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can&#39;t get recovery environment to load</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently resolved an issue upgrading my preview build whereby it went into a memory_management stop code every time it tried to load the lock screen on boot. The problem seemed to lay with avast security. I was able to get in via safe mode after 2
 failed boot attempts and uninstall avast.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The parade then went smoothly to 14332 and I then reinstalled avast.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything was fine for a couple of days until I started getting the stop code error again. This time, it seems to continually loop. It gets to the grey screen with the circling dots just before it loads the lock picture, then immediately blue screens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This ime, however, it just keeps on looping and will not default to recovery mode. I have tried forcing it by hard resetting when it's on the loading dots. Nothing. I have tried loading from Windows 10 CD. No restore point, no refresh option, no safe mode
 or boot options. Revert to previous build fails with a nondescript error message. This evening I tried installing windows 10 on another machine and creating a recovery media. The same issue with no safe mode options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My only option now seems to be to reset my OS including all of my installed apps, which is something I really do not want to do.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is the anything I can do to recover this situation in the short term?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I must inform you that I am running an asus motherboard with Kingston ssd, so the f8 trick will not work.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the response. I already tried that, but I gave it another go just now to see if it was an issue with the specific image. Still no ability to get into safe mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continue</li><li>Troubleshoot</li><li>Use a device</li><li>Use another operating system</li><li>Turn off your PC</li></ul>
<p>Obviously, I go into Troubleshoot to find "Startup Options" but it is not there. I get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reset this PC</li><li>Advanced Options
<ul>
<li>System Restore</li><li>System Image Recovery</li><li>Start-up Repair</li><li>Command Prompt</li><li>UEFI Firmware Settings</li><li>Go back to the previous build</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li></ul>
<p>I have tried System Restore, but it says there are no restore points.</p>
<p>I haven't got an image to recover from.</p>
<p>Start-up Repair never finds any problems, and the bootup bluescreen loop continues.</p>
<p>I'm not sure what I could do in Command Prompt to fix the issue</p>
<p>UEFI Firmware settings are not relevant because it's booting from the correct partition and OS, it's the OS that's broken.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried bootrec with all of the above options. It errored when I came to rebuildbcd.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>With a little bit more fishing, it turns out that the drive was locked (hitting the reset option told me that the drive was locked).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In attempting to rebuild the uefi partition, I managed to mess up my drive using diskpart. So the last course of action left to me was to wipe and reinstall windows from installation media.</p>

    <title>USB Wireless adapter says there is internet connection, but cannot - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            USB Wireless adapter says there is internet connection, but cannot access internet&#63;</h2>
                    A friend of mine has a Netgear USB wireless adapter on their desktop (running Windows XP). The Netgear software says there is a connection to the internet (via her wireless router), and the icon in the bottom right of the screen says there is an internet
 connection, but when she tries to run Explorer or anything else using the internet, it says there is no connection. There is another computer (with Windows 7) connected to the internet via a direct cable through the router, and it works fine.
<br />
<br />
Anyone know what the problem could be? Is there a good website that could help me with this problem (that's free)?

            Well, there's not really an error message. It's acting like there is no internet connection at all. Explorer won't go to any web pages, Yahoo Messenger won't log in. I can't believe this is such a difficult problem that nobody has any idea what's going
 on.

<br />
What, exactly, does Explorer say when it doesn't show a web page?&nbsp; It must be an error message of some kind.<br />
<br />
What kind of wireless router does she have?&nbsp; Can she ping it by IP address?

Do you have a computer with a non-wireless internet connection? Pull the plug out of the modem/ethernet card on the back of the computer and turn on Explorer. That's what it says.<br />
<br />
Please try to reply with some suggestions of what to do. I can't check this that often and this back and forth is not helping.

I don't have any machines with a NetGear USB Wireless no, and since my machines all work it really doesn't do me any good to look at those.&nbsp; I can give you 3 random things to do and if they work, great and if they don't you'll be right back here again and we
 can play the "3 things" game for weeks if you like.<br />
<br />
Or we could have some actual information so I'm not just tossing random guesses at you.<br />
<br />
But hey, here's your random things for today:<br />
<br />
1. Ping the wireless router.&nbsp; Start | Run | CMD.&nbsp; At the command prompt type PING followed by the IP address of her router.&nbsp; Hopefully she knows what that is because giving you the IP address of my router won't help.<br />
<br />
2. Run a cable from her computer to the router.&nbsp; Does the Internet work now?&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Right-click the icon at the bottom right corner of her screen and choose Repair.</p>

            Thank you for giving some suggestions.<br />
<br />
1.) Have not tried this, will give it a shot if I can figure out the IP address of the router.<br />
<br />
2.) The internet does work when plugged directly into the computer.<br />
<br />
3.) The Netgear software and the Windows Network Connections windows both say the internet is on and functioning properly. When Explorer says whatever it says and has a thing to click on and repair the connection, a message comes up that says something to the
 effect of "Another program is managing your internet connections, Windows cannot repair it."

<p>Which provider ?<br />
Some providers have a wait time when you can actually use the internet rather than connectinng.<br />
<br />
So:<br />
<br />
Try to reinstall the software of the wireless adapter again and wait like 1.5 hours ( just to be sure, you can wait 1hour if you'd like&nbsp;).<br />
Close off any internet-using programs and start waiting.<br />
Only keep up the software of the wireless adapter, to keep an eye on the connection itself.</p>
<p>It happened at a friend,relative or something of mine, that used sitecom or netgear itself&nbsp;and it worked.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Sounds like you have tried many of the correct steps. Did Microsoft Support analyze the minidump<br />
files? If not please post those (last 4 or 5) on your SkyDrive.</p>
<p>Use SkyDrive to upload collected files and post screen shot/picture<br />

This is usually heat related, defective hardware, memory or even processor though it is "possible"<br />
that it is driver related (rare). Remove ALL power and reseat all cards, memory and cables (on<br />
both ends) - actually remove and replace&nbsp;- do not just snug. Make sure the system has adequate<br />
ventilation - add a small fan blowing into intakes. Carefully inspect the motherboard and other<br />
cards for damage. Pay attention to the <strong>fatal hardware error</strong>&nbsp;implication.You may need a real<br />
computer shop (not leeks and peeks at a BestBuy or other BigBox stores) or the System maker's<br />
Support.</p>

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a>

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually<br />
be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it)<br />
and then go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

==========================================<br />
<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for sticks<br />
that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind slower memory.<br />
So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all memory tests fail to show<br />
a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<p>Ok, I added the error report made from blue screen view as well as the minidump files themselfes to skydrive. &nbsp;(Do I need to post a link or anything for those?)</p>
<p><a href="http://cid-a641271fba08126b.office.live.com/browse.aspx/minidump%20files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://cid-a641271fba08126b.office.live.com/browse.aspx/minidump%20files</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;?</p>
<p>I think that is the right link. It works for me but I don't know if that is because I am signed in to me. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried doing ram tests but the computer usually blue screens before they can finish. &nbsp;I just bought a new stick and only used it for a while and the error persists, so I doubt it is the ram. &nbsp;I also just bought a new hard drive and freshly installed
 windows 7 into that. So it should not be the hard drive as well. &nbsp;Ive been using the same cpu for maybe a month so i'm hoping its not that. &nbsp;I left the case open with a fan on it as well as the internal, (which was working) I also installed speedfan to watch
 temperatures which were all low enough to not be a heat issue. &nbsp;I do have avg installed. &nbsp;Is this one of the antivirus programs which could produce the error? &nbsp;I just reinstalled a few days ago after I received the new ram and hard drive. &nbsp;The only programs
 installed were drivergenius, avg, google chrome, and vlc. &nbsp;I installed MS office after a bit, it had already erred at this time. &nbsp;I would like to hope it is drivers except that the laptop i have&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ocztechnology.com/products/diy_notebooks/ocz_diy_17-gaming_notebook-small_intel-nvidia_edition-small_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ocztechnology.com/products/diy_notebooks/ocz_diy_17-gaming_notebook-small_intel-nvidia_edition-small_</a>&nbsp;is
 no longer made so drivers are hard to find. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When i was researching other places as to what was my issue, some stated that in similar cases that the ram/cpu was not getting enough voltage. &nbsp;Does this make sense/have any validity?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Those are not the minidump files themselves from C:\Windows\minidump&nbsp;&nbsp; post the contents from<br />
there to you SkyDrive. Did Microsoft tech support analyze those minidumps?<br />
<br />
AVG could well have a role.<br />
<br />
The OCZ drive could also be the issue so check with their Support. Was this an ungrade to Windows 7?<br />
If so the drive definitely is part of if not all of the issue.<br />
<br />
Use the default values as suggested by the maker of the laptop.<br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>The only times I have seen this issue with OCZ drives eventually OCZ agreed to replace the drive.<br />
(Total of 3 times and none of&nbsp;the&nbsp;three was the same models the others.)<br />
<br />
Here is one of the threads with similar issue.<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Did Microsoft Tech Support analyze the minidump files???????????<br />
<br />
The one minidump you posted was Bug_Check D1&nbsp; 0x000000D1 which was CAUSEd by<br />
L1E262x64.sys which is part of the Atheros Network Driver (NIC) so check for updates<br />
to that at the System Maker's Site and/or the Network Device maker's site.<br />
<br />
If the system previously had another version of Windows it was an upgrade even if using a<br />
clean install.<br />
<br />
Since&nbsp;you upgraded to Windows 7 did you run the Upgrade Advisor and check with the<br />
Compatibility Center (for the major devices)?<br />
<br />
Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor - run this <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/get/upgrade-advisor.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<br />
<span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/get/upgrade-advisor.aspx</span></a></p>
<p>Also check the Compatibility Center (for the major devices)<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/default.aspx</span></a><br />
<br />
Check with the System and Device makers for updated drivers and many have special<br />
instructions to help with upgrading to Windows 7.<br />
<br />

<br />
Did you use the AVG Removal Tool?</p>

-----------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Here is what I use and recommend : (These are all Free versions and very effective.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Avast and Prevx have proven extremely reliable and compatible with everything I have<br />
thrown at them. Microsoft Security Essentials and&nbsp;Prevx have also proven to be very<br />
reliable and compatible. Use MSE and Prevx or Avast and Prevx however not all 3.<br />
<br />
Avast Home Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web, and<br />
Network running.</p>
<p>Prevx - Home -&nbsp;Free</p>
<p>Windows Firewall</p>
<p>Windows Defender (not needed if using MSE)</p>
<p>IE - Protected Mode</p>
<p>IE 8 - SmartScreen Filter ON&nbsp; (IE 7 Phishing Filter)</p>
<p>I also have IE to always start with InPrivate Filter active if IE 8.<br />
(You occasionally have to turn it temporarily off with the little Icon on LEFT of the + bottom<br />
right of IE)<br />
<br />
Two versions of Avast are available 5.x and 4.8x<br />
<br />
Avast 5.x - Home - Free - Stop the Shields you do not use (except File, Web, Network, &amp;<br />
Behavior) - double click the Orange Icon in Notification Area - Real Time Shields - click the<br />
Shield you want to stop - STOP. To stop the Orange Icon from showing an error indicator -<br />
click the Orange Icon - Upper Right - Settings - click Status Bar - uncheck the Shields you<br />
disabled - click OK <br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download</span></a><br />
<br />
Avast 4.8x&nbsp;- Home - Free - stop any shields you do not need except leave Standard, Web,<br />
and Network running. (Double Click&nbsp;Blue icon - details next to OK. - upper left Shields -<br />
Terminate&nbsp;those you do not use.)<br />
<a href="http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download#tab4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.avast.com/free-antivirus-download#tab4</span></a><br />
<br />
Or use Microsoft Security Essentials - Free<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/Security_Essentials/</span></a><br />
<br />
Prevx works well along side Avast or MSE<br />
<br />
Prevx - Home - Free small, fast, exceptional CLOUD protection, works with other security<br />
programs. This is a scanner only, VERY EFFECTIVE, if it finds something come back here<br />
or use Google to see how to remove.&nbsp;<br />

<p>Also get Malwarebytes - free - use as scanner only. If you ever suspect malware, and that<br />
would be unsual with Avast and Prevx running except for an occasional low level cookie<br />
(no big deal), UPDATE it and then run it as a scanner. I have many scanners and they<br />
never find anything of note since I started using this setup.</p>

            Ok, microsoft said that they analyzed them, since it kept pointing to hal.dll they blamed it on hardware without considering much else. &nbsp;I ran windows 7 upgrade advisor, &nbsp;It blue screened 2 times within the first minute of running the program, the third
 time it made it through and stated that everything was compatible. atheros network adapter, bluetooth, chipset family, audio, mass storage, and video all said that they were compatible. &nbsp;At first I was going to assume that the computer was not windows 7 compatible,
 then the program finished and stated that it was. &nbsp;Avg was uninstalled and blue screens still persist. &nbsp;Sorry I took long to respond, I had a couple days of finals i needed to focus on at college. &nbsp;Also thank you for the quick replies.

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Looking a lot like hardware. Did you update the atheros driver? Remove as many devices<br />
as you can (all the USB ones) and see if that allows better operation.<br />
<br />
You probably need the help of a need a real computer shop (not leeks and peeks at a<br />
BestBuy or other BigBox stores) or the System maker's Support.<br />
<br />
Happy Holidays!</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Ditch driver updating programs, which will fail often and sometimes in very undesireable manner,<br />
and update the drivers manually. Use the manual methods in the troubleshooter posted above on<br />

<h2>            sound through multiple output channels</h2>
                    Hi
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is it possible for me to stream sound from different applications through different interfaces in windows 8 pro. For example I want my music through xbox music, a radio app to play through the speakers attached to my computer and I want the sounds from
 my browser to stream through to my headphones. My headphones and speakers are plugged into different sounds cards in the computer.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks</div>

    <title>Windows 10 Desktop Icons - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> georgefoust1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Desktop Icons</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10, at whim, moves my desktop icons to columns on the left.&nbsp; I cannot find a way to lock the icons into the positions I want.&nbsp; Windows Help Desk has not resolved this problem.</p>
<p>I would think there is some really simple program out there that records the icon locations in a matrix or spreadsheet and will re-position them after this glitch occurs when the owner runs a script or program file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help!!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is getting really, really annoying.</p>

            Hi George.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Right click the desktop, under View menu make sure that Auto Arrange Icons is not selected, only Arrange to Grid.  
<br />
<br />Now drag your icons to where you want them.  If any resist being in the column nearest the edge of screen, slightly zoom the size of icons by holding the Ctrl key and using the mouse wheel or + or - keys until they will settle down and not pop away.  
<br />
<br />Once everything is where you want it, right click the Desktop again and choose Refresh which should program them to stay put.  Sometimes however a Windows Update will scramble them, another in the growing list of annoyances.  
<br />
<br />If you want to address Microsoft you'll need to use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback; you can even click the Share button there to generate a link to your Feedback to post back here for others to vote up or add to it. But Microsoft will not see it here as this is a mostly volunteer-staffed forums where we try to solve your problems. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
