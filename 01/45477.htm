    <title>Internal Microphone Array NOT WORKING after a fresh install of Windows - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Internal Microphone Array NOT WORKING after a fresh install of Windows 8&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <div>
<div>I recently upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 8 on my&nbsp;HP Pavilion m7 1015-dx laptop.&nbsp;After the upgrade, I ran the HP Support Assistant to update all of my drivers specific to this computer, and also ran Windows Update as was instructed. Everything seems
 to have been installed except for the Internal Microphone Array (IDT High Definition Audio CODEC) driver, with the hardware ID of MMDEVAPI\AudioEndpoints. It's almost as if my microphone is non existent anymore. I have tried everything within my knowledge
 and power to gain back access to my mic, with no avail.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have freshly installed Windows 8 twice, and do not want to try it again. I have also restored my system to many previous dates and disk images. Is the IDT CODEC not "fully" compatible with Windows 8, or is it with this specific model, because I do notice
 a few differences with this model being that it has the "<span>Beats Audio with 4 speakers and the HP TripleBass Reflex Subwoofer" which uses the Beats Audio Control Panel instead of the normal Sound control panel used in most models.&nbsp;</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Help is greatly appreciated!!!</span></div>

    <title>In Windows 10 Folders Will Not Have Their Items Stay Viewing As Tiles - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            In Windows 10 Folders Will Not Have Their Items Stay Viewing As Tiles Even Though They Are Set To, They Keep Reverting Back To Details</h2>
                    <p><em>I am placing this under this category because it involves personalizing the setup of your Personal computer and those personalized folder settings always reverting back to something you don't want!
</em><br />
<br />
I can not ever get the Document View in Windows 10 Home to display everything in my folders as "Tiles" instead of always reverting to the "Details" setting after a few days to a week. I have a lot of folders on my computer and every time this happens I have
 to go back and set them way I want them to be viewed before I can even do anything at all and this is very extremely annoying and also time consuming. All my Settings under Control Panel for Folders are correctly set to view Documents as Tiles and not as Details
 yet this constantly occurs and I want it to stop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never had this problem on Windows 7 whatsoever but ever since upgrading to Windows 10 back in August 2015 I have to deal with this almost everyday to every week whenever I access any of my folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've mentioned this in another Topic that I started with a group of Windows 10 Errors and NO ONE EVER ADDRESSED THIS. Instead they wanted me to "<strong>Install Windows 10 using the media creation tool</strong>" to repair the other errors that even other
 people were having with Windows 10 that had already installed Windows 10 via the Windows Media Creation Tool. There has been no escaping these problems and as a Computer Repair Technician I am having to deal with them every business day with customers having
 all these different problems with Windows 10. All my research into these errors as well as the their fixes all point to the Windows Shell being the problem and it too heavily used and required in Windows 10. A simple program such as Microsoft Edge or the Windows
 Store crashing shouldn't result in the Start Menu becoming unusable yet that is totally what is happening with Windows 10 when any of the stock programs in Windows 10 crash. As a Computer Repair Technician I have heard and seen this happen far too often for
 Microsoft to overlook it and the Windows Shell in Windows 10 as not having a problem. Especially when many third party programs interacting with the Windows Shell cause the Critical Error of Start Menu &amp; Cortana Aren't Working. Uninstalling any of these programs
 that cause it apparently fix that problem as well as the problem with the Start Menu not being accessible at times, but also a simple restart fixes that as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>WELL BACK TO THE MAIN REASON FOR THIS POST.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a HP Pavilion g7-1310us Notebook PC and it has a Widescreen Display. Thus I
<strong>WANT</strong> my entire screen to be used for displaying folders and thus I don't want to see "Details" for everything in my folders,
<strong>I WANT THE TILES</strong>. This is how I've always wanted my folders to be&nbsp;viewed on my computer even before I had a&nbsp;widescreen computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since posting this among another topic I started before (as stated above) didn't get any help whatsoever I am going to post the rest of this in screenshots that I have taken of one of my folders doing this (this is just one folder (group of folders) but
 ALL folders with documents are doing this). I am using a folder for a modable game's mod for this demonstration with the screenshots. (The game is Star Trek Armada II and the Mod is KA2 Empire At War; for the record). Each Screenshot will be numbered with
 my original Screenshot name for each picture:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1. Windows 10 IS ALWAYS SETTING VIEWS TO DETAILS EVEN AFTER SET TO TILES</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5ee4d712-3ddc-413c-96b6-f21e51ab8c2d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/5ee4d712-3ddc-413c-96b6-f21e51ab8c2d" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>2. This Is How I Want My Folder Views &amp; I Don't Want To Constantely Have To Change It Back To This View Ever Few Days</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2ecec6f2-9ca6-4f9a-a8ed-b883fb05e30f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2ecec6f2-9ca6-4f9a-a8ed-b883fb05e30f" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3. Looks How This View Takes Up Half The Screen &amp; Requires Scrolling Down To View Everything</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9295e49d-b422-4229-adff-563e49dbface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9295e49d-b422-4229-adff-563e49dbface" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>4. This Is The Same Folder As In The Previous Picture - With Tiles The Whole Screen Gets Used &amp; NO SCROLLING NEEDED TO SEE ALL ITEMS</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c80cfc11-baeb-45b9-989b-8877cd0123c0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c80cfc11-baeb-45b9-989b-8877cd0123c0" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>5. The Following Screenshots Are From The Folder Options Under Control Panel &amp; Shows That The Settings For Documents To Show Up The Way I Want Them To Are Way They Should Be For Tiles&nbsp;&amp; Not Details. These Are Also The Same Settings From When My Computer
 Was Using Windows 7 Home Premium.</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fa6f339c-18b2-40e7-ae41-92b1c722d452" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/fa6f339c-18b2-40e7-ae41-92b1c722d452" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/20f8cb07-258b-4778-8592-f771c7eb0cdb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/20f8cb07-258b-4778-8592-f771c7eb0cdb" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/30a0daf6-f763-4ae7-bb64-2267e4b33865" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/30a0daf6-f763-4ae7-bb64-2267e4b33865" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Now hopefully all of that easily explains what the problem is with how Windows 10 keeps displaying my folders and how I actually want them to look. I have tried this on multiple Windows 10 computers thanks to my job as well as have had customers giving the
 same complaint. I really want to have my computer displaying these and every other folder with documents in it the way I WANT THEM TO BE DISPLAYED and not have to WASTE TIME resetting them manually to display as tiles through the Tiles option under the Ribbon
 in every Folder that I want viewable like this (and it is every folder that I want viewable like this) except ones' with pictures or videos. Those I want displaying as "Extra Large Icons" for pictures and "Large Icons" for videos respectively.</p>

<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. We regret the inconvenience caused and apologize for neglecting your previous post regarding the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may be facing the above issue due to some of the missing system files or corrupted files &amp; folders present on your PC.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong><span> I suggest you to perform

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

 is resolved.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue does not occur in the new user profile, it means the old user profile is corrupted. The corrupted user profile does not function normally such as not launching

            <p>Reset Folders, as mentioned above, is a good start, but then you need to set your default folder templates.&nbsp; You will need to the following once for each folder type: Generic, Documents, Music, etc.&nbsp; Check the Customize tab of the folder's Prosperities dialog
 to verify the applied template:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/48dbffc7-89f3-4ac5-a983-40a1a7fa952c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/48dbffc7-89f3-4ac5-a983-40a1a7fa952c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Set the view the way you like.&nbsp; Even if you don't want to default to Details view, give some thought as to what columns you like in Details &amp; select them before returning to your preferred setting of Tiles.&nbsp; Then from the View tab -&gt; Options -&gt; View tab
 -&gt; Apply to Folders:</p>

</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>As a Computer Repair Technician, I have already tried Resetting the Folders and that DIDN'T WORK and then I had to go back and reset everything the way I wanted them and that turned
 out to be really time consuming with the fact that I do have a busy schedule.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>Furthermore, my Version of Windows 10 doesn't Say "THIS PC" Anywhere Whatsoever. It kept the Windows 7 name of "My Computer" and I can take multiple Screenshots to prove this as
 well. This is in fact what my coworkers and I have always seen on Windows 10 Computers that were upgraded from Windows 7, there is no "This PC" anywhere on those computers, every place people say it is there is only "My Computer". This hasn't even ever changed
 with any Windows 10 Update or newer version including Windows 10 Version 1511.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>And as For Method Two, What Part of this exact same thing is happening on MULTIPLE COMPUTERS didn't you get. It isn't a User Account problem. It is clearly a Windows 10 Problem
 because we've duplicated on a Windows 10 Test Computer in the Computer Shop I work at, and that was also creating a new Administrator Account. Thus logic dictates creating a new Administrator Account on my own personal computer that is having the exact same
 issue with not showing Documents as Tiles but always showing Details instead would clearly be a 100% waste of time, and as I have previously said my time is already valuable because of how busy I am daily.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>Furthermore, the user account isn't corrupted on my personal computer nor is it corrupted on the Windows 10 Test Computer in the shop that is having this problem. And the same
 can be said for the customers that are having the exact same problem. This problem after all is occurring on a NEW computer fresh out of its box that came preloaded with Windows 10 as well. Now if you want to say that User Account is corrupted as well, pure
 and simple logic would dictate that it isn't.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>****</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
</p><p style="text-align: justify"><span>As a person that works as a Computer Repair Technician and every time I make a post here I am always asked to do something that I have already done to attempt to fix the problem
 or problems. I only post here after everything that is supposed to have worked to fix any problem doesn’t work to fix it as it should. Really I am always getting tired of being told to do something that I have already done. With Windows 10 I can actually write
 a book on how much errors I have discovered and either fixed for customers or have discovered a workaround that actually works until Microsoft will admit there are major problems with Windows 10 and actually fix them.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Pardon&nbsp; me if that reply comes off as rude or harsh, but its irking to always get the same type of reply here with something I've already tried. And to get the same exact excuses that the User Account has to be corrupt when the same problems occur on new
 computers freshly out of their boxes as well as ones upgraded&nbsp;to Windows 10. Thus clearly it isn't&nbsp;a corrupt User Account, it isn't plausible or even logical in that case.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Already Did All Of That As Well, It Isn't The Problem. This is the exact thing I have to repeat EVERY FEW DAYS TO EVERY WEEK and it doesn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Neither does resetting the Folders and resetting everything.<br />
<br />
Also&nbsp;my personal&nbsp;computer as&nbsp;well as all the other computers with this&nbsp;has already PROVEN that the User Account (or Accounts) are not corrupted. There isn't any corruption whatsoever. ALL USER ACCOUNTS DO THE EXACT SAME THING, INCLUDING THE NEW ADMINISTRATOR
 ACCOUNT! Apparently the issue is a Windows 10 issue that no one complains about to Microsoft that they just deal with since all searches on these forums don't have any issue like it, yet its even happening on many of my friends' Windows 10 Computers, both
 new and upgraded. It is also occurring on multiple customer computers as well.</p>

            <p>It would have been nice if you'd been specific about what you had tried --- it would have saved us both some wasted time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The behavior you're seeing is not universal.&nbsp; I have a distinctive default of List grouped by Type, so I'd notice if it was reverting to something else.&nbsp; Are you &nbsp;running any "cleaners" or the like?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you do use "Apply to Folders", a value&nbsp;named for &nbsp;the GUID of the folder template you're defining is created under:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>HKCU\S'OFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Streams\Defaults</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>so backup that key once you've set your folder templates the way you want &amp; you'll have an easy way to restore them.&nbsp; It will also prove useful to see if these values are getting changed when you lose your preferred views.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might want to go a little more 'nuclear' that Reset Folders by deleting saved views for individual folders by deleting:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>HKCU\SOFTWARE\Classes\Local Settings\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Shell\BagMRU</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>and</p>

            <p>There are no cleaners of any type installed on my personal computer and the same can be said for the repair shop's test computer. And a majority of our customers don't use them either. Neither do any of my friends with these same problems with their folder
 views. Plus if you read carefully my initial first post you'd have seen I've tried all of those things that have already been stated, you may have misinterpreted how it was written but it is there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only folders that constantly stay the way they should be, the way I want them are always the folders I access every single day. The ones I don't access that much within a few days to a week they have reverted back to "Details" yet all other folders with
 the same type of items (documents, pictures, videos, etc) in the folders I go to daily are all set as Tiles as they should be. The default setting saved for every non picture or video folder is Tiles and not Details and it is set to be applied to the corresponding
 folder types.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the values for the GUID match my desired Folder Settings and never have changed, even when the folders revert back to Details. Windows just isn't following the commands it has been given/designated to follow for Folders and how they are views EXCEPT
 THE ONES I ACCESS EVERY DAY, the ones I don't access daily are the ones that constantly change from Tiles back to Details until I access that folder and then have to waste time with those folders to change their folders and their Subfolders back to Tiles.
 Even if the main folder is set to Tiles the remaining Subfolders aren't displaying as Tiles but as Details instead. Some days I can go and check these troublesome Main and Subfolders to find the Main one is all Tiles but the Subfolders are not; and even sometimes
 some of those Subfolders are displaying their contents as Tiles well others are displaying their contents as Details. And it is all random which folders will be displaying right one day when checking to the next.</p>

</p><p>My writing is 100% accurate and precise, you're just not understanding it. Thus the screenshots. Under Control Panel is the Folders Options Menu. You don't need to use your regular folders to get to it and it governs EVERY Single folder and their settings.
 It's been like that since Windows XP and the exact same settings are there. You must not know much about Computers or how Control Panel works to set up how you want folders to look. Even Google searches for editing folder settings says to go to Folder Options
 under Control Panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is I don't want everything Tiles. Your methods as much as they don't stick turns everything to tiles</p>

            <p>It's actually very simple, you open Folder Options through the Control Panel instead of doing it through the folders when you have multiple folders with slightly different types and modify the options for them all, then you alter them in the folder. It's
 stated that when you change a view in a folder directly after it stays that way for that folder until you change it. So you use the Folder Options menu through Task Manager to do all types of folders at once and that's how you use the Control Panel to get
 to Folder Options to set the options for how folders are displayed. Furthermore, it doesn't directly say Tiles in folder options, you have to follow the regular steps and then alter the individual folders once through their different folders depending on how
 you want the individual folders to be viewed. A majority of mine are Tiles, set like that, others aren't. Some pictures are set to be Large Icons, others are set to be Extra Large Icons. Then the folders with mixes of documents, pictures, and videos are sometimes
 Tiles, Large Icons, or Extra Large Icons depending on the pictures in the folders. All the manually set folders are the ones keeping their views correctly set through this method. The ones set by the steps you say to do are the ones constantly reverting back
 to Details and not staying as Tiles!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Folders I go into daily I set the way that works (my way) and they have <strong>
NEVER</strong> changed to Details ever. It's the ones set by the option within the folders themselves and applying it to folders of that same type that constantly keep reverting back to Details. Those are the folders I don't go into all the time, the ones I'm
 complaining about not working right. The ones that are constantly requiring time consuming to fix back to the way they are supposed to be, a majority of which are Tiles, some are not and others are mixed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, the reason he "Apply To Folders" is frayed out is very logically simple, the screenshots are taken with the settings already applied so there is nothing needed to apply. When there is no changes made under Folder Options it's grayed out until
 any changes are made that need to be applied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Those settings under Folder Options haven't <strong>EVER</strong> been changed since Windows 7 was pre-installed on my personal laptop when I first got it. Took screenshots of them prior to upgrading to Windows 10 in August 2015 to make sure none of the
 settings changed installing Windows 10 and if they did I had the exact originals to restore the checked boxes. Thus when I took those screenshots for this post I didn't have to make any changes so "Apply To Folders" is grayed out&nbsp;because no changes were made,
 only the screenshots taken.</p>

            Windows Update KB4034658 fails to complete update every single day. Has been doing this for weeks now. Have followed all advice I can find, downloaded and ran the troubleshooter above (didn't identify anything) and have even tried to find a way to turn
 off auto updates to stop it taking ages every morning updating, failing, uninstalling, restarting etc. No luck there either. Solution please Microsoft, completely unacceptable.

<p>Hi Keith,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order for us to further investigate and verify what causes your computer to not be able to install Windows version 1607, we would like to gather more information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Are you getting an error message when trying to update to Windows version 1607?</li><li>What other troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</li><li>How are you trying to update your computer? Through the automatic updates? Or by manually updating it?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
</strong></span><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1. </strong>Navigate to the %systemroot%\Minidump folder.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Copy any and all DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop and then zip up these files.<br />
<br />
<strong>3. </strong>Upload the zip containing the .DMP files to Onedrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply. Preferred sites: Onedrive, Mediafire, Dropbox, etc. Nothing with wait-timers, download managers, etc.<br />
<br />
<strong>4 (optional):</strong> The type of .DMP files located in the Minidump folder are known as Small Memory Dumps. In %systemroot% there will be what is known as a Kernel-Dump (if your system is set to generate). It is labeled MEMORY.DMP. The difference
 between Small Memory Dumps and Kernel-Dumps in the simplest definition is a Kernel-Dump contains
<em><strong>much </strong></em>more information at the time of the crash, therefore allowing further debugging of your issue. If your upload speed permits it, and you aren't going against any strict bandwidth and/or usage caps, etc, the Kernel-Dump is the best
 choice. Do note that Kernel-Dumps are <em><strong>much larger </strong></em>in size due to containing much more info, which is why I mentioned upload speed, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/skydrive/add-photos-files-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Upload photos and files to Onedrive.</a><br />
<br />
After doing that, to learn how to share the link to the file if you are unaware, please visit the following link -
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/onedrive/share-file-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Share files and folders and change permissions</a> and view <strong>'Get a link'</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Please note that any "cleaner" programs such as TuneUpUtilities, CCleaner, etc, by default will delete .DMP files upon use. With this said, if you've run such software, you will need to allow the system to crash once again to generate a crash dump.</strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
<strong>3.</strong> Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log'.
<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />

            <p>These appear to be .OLD files, which implies they are from a previous Windows install, and they are very old too. The latest is nearly 7 months old.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have nothing newer from your current Windows install?</p>

<h2>            Need to have my HP Scanjet G3110 work with Windows 7.</h2>
                    When I try to use my HP Scanjet G3110 with my new computer that has Windows 7 on it, I get the following error:<br />
<br />
The Operating System on this computer is not supported. The installation cannot continue until this is resolved.

Current OS: 601.64<br />
<br />
Supported: Windows 2000, Windows XP 64 bit, Vista, Vista 64 bit<br />

Action required: Click Cancel to exit this software installation. Install this product on a computer that is running one of the supported Microsoft operating systems or refer to your computer's documentation for information on upgrading your computer's operating

In another forum, someone tried to get the drivers but says HP told him to go to Microsoft but the person gave up. I do not have the luxury of the time to bring this scanner back, please help me.

            Incredible - it all worked like clock work without a hitch. Here are the actual steps then for this manuever:<br />
<br />
1. Start Menu<br />
2. Control Panel<br />
3. Programs &amp; Features<br />
4. Run programs made for previous versions of Windows<br />
5. Run Troubleshooting Wizard<br />
Wa la!<br />

<p>Windows 10 is a big change over Windows 8, and an even bigger change over Windows 7. Lots of new technology and new ways of doing things. For people who are not comfortable with all this change, Windows 10 can be very intimidating. In addition, there's a
 new version of Windows 10 every 6 months or so, which only makes it more intimidating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Judging by the wide success of Windows 10, it's clear that most users have adjusted to the new technology. Unfortunately, that leaves behind people who are not technologically adept, and you see their struggles here every day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For its part, Microsoft does a lousy job (in my opinion) of explaining how to use its consumer products, which leaves these struggling users to fend for themselves in forums like this one, where self-proclaimed experts will say anything, no matter how misguided,
 to satisfy a poster because Microsoft runs a competition that gives out awards based on the number of answers that posters accept.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's cruel that people who are having trouble keeping up get treated this way. Computers are difficult to understand, so you can't blame people for getting lost. Sadly, at the pace of technology today, if you don't keep up you get trampled. That, in my opinion,
 is why people are reluctant to use Windows 10.</p>

<h2>            Activation.exe fatal error, CLR8000... &#47; laptop not booting without plug, very slow &#47; taskbar not functioning properly</h2>
                    <p>I had my laptop hooked up to the TV to watch a movie two days ago (I don't know if this is relevant but it's the last time it was working) and then yesterday I turned it on and it took several rounds of blank screen and holding the off button down until
 it turned off again for it so come up with the "restarting" symbol. I plugged it in then, and eventually got it onto my desktop to save all my files on a memory stick in case it died suddenly. Then the "Activation error" thing came up, and everything was taking

            Hi Gregory.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Right click the Start button to open Device Manager.
<br />
<br />Scroll down to Human Interface Devices (HID) and expand tree by clicking on arrow head to the left of HID.
<br />
<br />Scroll down to HID - Compliant Touch Screen.
<br />
<br />If there is a red cross next to the entry, right click on it and select the enable option. This should restore the touchscreen. 
<br />
<br />If there is a yellow exclamation mark next to the entry, right click on it and select the Update Driver Software and follow the prompt Search Automatically for Updated Driver Software. This should find and install the driver software for your Touchscreen
<br />
<br />
<br />Check Mice and Other Pointing Devices in Device Manager and see if there is a listing for a USB touchscreen controller.
<br />
<br />Right click on the listing and select Update driver. When you get to browse my computer, you'll have the option to "let me choose" and then you select "usb input device" instead of "touchscreen controller."
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/fix-unresponsive-windows-10-touchscreen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/fix-unresponsi...</a>
<br /> See also this tutorial for fixing touch screen:  
<br />
<br />If not report back the PC make and full model number from attached sticker and we'll help you find the driver. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<br />
<br />I would start at the top and install all drivers recommended by HP, Windows Update does have a habit of installing incompatible drivers and I would say this is what has happened here . . .

<p>I tried F12 and changed the boot sequence to 1. IDE CD-ROM device, 2. Hard-Disk Drive C:</p>
<p>but I get the same message.</p>
<p>I also tried F8 and selected Last Known Good Confirguration but I get the same error message as above.</p>

<p><span>Hi helaman,</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·</span></span><span>What is the reason for reinstallation
 of windows XP?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>It seems that the CD is not recognized by the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Follow the steps from the below link and check the results. Link:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you are getting the error: "Windows could not start because the following file is missing or corrupt:
 \windows\system32\config\system", and that is why you are trying to re-install Windows XP then you can try the steps mentioned in the below link: How to recover from a corrupted registry that prevents Windows XP from starting:</span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307545" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/307545</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>But as you are not able to boot from the Windows XP CD, you might have to crosscheck if the CD is bootable
 on another computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Or else you may have to make bootable floppies. Refer the below link for steps:</span></span></p>

<p>I'm reinstalling because I cannot start up Windows on my computer. I am using a Dell Dimension 8300 with Windows XP Home Edition installed. The reinstallation disk is also Windows XP Home edition. It will not boot up.When I try to boot up from the CD drive

<p>sfc /scannow will not run in Safe Mode (have you ever even attempted it?)<br />
<br />
If you try it, you will get the following messages:<br />
<br />
Windows File Protection could not initiate a scan of protected system files.<br />
The specific error code is 0x000006ba [The RPC server is unavailable.].<br />
<br />
You cannot start the RPC Server in Safe Mode either.</p>
<p>Running sfc /scannow only looks after file in the following folder:</p>
<p>%Systemroot%\system32\dllcache</p>
<p>Running sfc /scannow will not update any files in any other folder on your system.</p>
<p>Even if sfc /scannow would run in Safe Mode, it will not help with this issue.</p>
<p>You will not boot in any kind Safe Mode, Last Known Good Configuration, etc.</p>
<p>I have never used KB307545 to fix this problem, but it is the first thing to come up in a Google search, therefore it is usually the first suggestion for something to try and just about the the least likely thing I can think of to work.</p>
<p>You can easily recreate the problem on your own system to practice learning how to fix it.</p>
<p>By recreating the problem and actually fixing it, one can learn what things will work, what things will not work and what things are just impossible to work and a waste of time.&nbsp; This beats Googling and merely posting links from the Google (or Bing) results
 to other articles or web pages.&nbsp; When you get done, you will know what works.</p>
<p>When you see this issue, always start with a chkdsk /r from the XP Recovery Console first.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you have no genuine bootable XP installation CD from which you can boot the Recovery Console, make a bootable XP Recovery Console CD (no XP media required).</p>
<p>Many times, a chkdsk /r is all you need to do and you will be on your way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Do, or do not. There is no try.</p>

    <title>New, RAW, or Crashed HDD, Windows 7 PE can see the disk, but cannot - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zdshadow  say:</h3>
<h2>            New, RAW, or Crashed HDD, Windows 7 PE can see the disk, but cannot partition or format it.  IRRT is enabled in BIOS. Intel RAID Drivers are loaded.</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I have newer laptop that recently experienced a catastrophic BSOD crash.</p>
<p>The HDD in the unit is a 250 GB Western Digital Scorpion Black (7200 rpm)</p>
<p>In the process of trying to restore BCD on the boot partition, all 3 OEM partitions ( Boot, System (Win7 OS), and Recovery ) disappeared.</p>
<p>The partition table has clearly been fragged or otherwise destroyed.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I copied my critical user data from the drive already, using a data recovery application.</p>
<p>I have run WD's DataLifeguard quick and extended drive diagnostics ( with a full surface scan ), and it passes no problem.</p>
<p>I have wiped the HDD several times writing zeros with WD's DataLifeguard&nbsp;as well as trying other DoD compliant wipes (Acronis and EASEUS).</p>
<p>Seems as though no matter what I do, the Win PE environment is unable to partition and format this disk now.</p>
<p>My laptop uses the newer&nbsp;Intel Mobile Express Chipset that incorporates the IRRT technology and SATA RAID controller. ( Intel Matrix Storage Manager ).</p>
<p>I have loaded the drivers&nbsp;for this chipset and RAID controller in Win PE&nbsp;7 ( Windows Pre-Install Environment that loads from OEM Windows 7 Professional 32-bit install media, hereafter&nbsp;referred to as 'Win PE&nbsp;7'&nbsp;).</p>
<p>So far though, I have not been able to partition and format the disk to re-install windows on this device.</p>
<p>I am currently using diskpart in Win PE 7, with storage controller drivers loaded, to clean the disk.</p>
<p>I will then retry partitioning and formatting from within&nbsp;Win PE 7&nbsp;Diskpart to prep the drive.</p>
<p>Any other suggestions as to steps I may be missing?</p>
<p>Any assistance is&nbsp;greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
Do you get any error when disk part fails to partition or format the hard disk?</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1:</strong></div>
<div>Run “CHKDSK” (check disk) from recovery console to check if there are any errors. Try the following step to run check disk using command prompt from System Recovery options.</div>
<div>“Click on Command Prompt and type the following command CHKDSK /r”.</div>
<div>Refer the following link to open system recovery options.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/What-are-the-system-recovery-options-in-Windows-7</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 2:</strong></div>
<div>You may also format the drive by running the Clean command from system recovery&nbsp;options using command prompt option.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Type "<strong>C</strong>": Press "<strong>Enter</strong>". (Where C: is the drive where you want to install Windows).<br />
Type "<strong>Clean</strong>". Press "<strong>Enter</strong>".<br />
<br />
<div>Reply us the outcome so that we can assist you better.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope this helps.</div>

            <p>Tried CHKDSK, does not function on RAW nor unallocated disks.&nbsp; You must have a partition to run CHKDSK.</p>
<p>Errors received in Win 7 PE when trying to partition and format&nbsp;are:</p>
<p>0x80004005 ( permissions error, really?! )</p>
<p>and </p>
<p>"Windows could not format a partition on disk 0.&nbsp; The error occurred while preparing the partition selected for installation.&nbsp; Error code: 0x80070057"</p>
<p>Tried 'Clean ALL' from DISKPART in the Win 7 PE environment as well.&nbsp; No Dice.</p>
<p>I have since tried a completely different HDD that I had and I was able to&nbsp;partition, format and install Windows 7 Professional 32-bit&nbsp;just fine from the OEMs media.</p>
<p>It appears as though the old HDD just needs to be replaced.&nbsp; Could be some orphaned HDD security from the BIOS that won't let me partition, but the drive simply does not take any partition or format commands from Win PE, nor when docked in another Windows
 7 environment using disk management.&nbsp; In fact not even using&nbsp;Acronis, Easeus, and GParted.&nbsp; All fail to partition.&nbsp; ( All as 'Basic MBR' disk )</p>
<p>I think the bottom line is that whatever crashed, did in the old HDD for good.&nbsp; The laptop is under warranty and a brand new HDD will be here in the morning.</p>
<p>Given that another HDD worked just fine, it does not appear to be anything software related.</p>
<p>Now if anyone has any suggestions on low-level formats that will remove any and all orphaned hardware security measures, that might be a lead worth chasing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>The usual suspects have all been tried and failed, but I'm am curious to see if this drive could yet be resurrected since it does check out during drive diagnostics.&nbsp; Could be useful troubleshooting info for all of us.</p>

            <p>I have experienced a power supply issue causing bizare hd problems.</p>
<p>When I had a hd that had 'partition' problems I used a utility from bootdisk.com to completely scrub the drive, I was then able to partition/install win (I dont remember which bootable utility, it was some time ago, I had been unable to wipe the drive with
 other hd utilities)</p>
<p>If you have the restore disk set from your laptop maker, does that work on that drive?</p>

<p>
</p><div>
<div>
<div><span>As far as I know you can only choose the drive but not a download folder.</span></div>
</div>
<div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
</div>
<div>
<div><span>It just jams a drive full of folders which brings my OCD to another level.</span></div>
</div>
<div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<p><span>Is there a solution to this or can you just move those folders to another one?</span></p>

</p><p>Thanks for coming to the forums. Unfortunately, this all saves to the game pass folder. There re ways to change it, but they aren't official so unable to post here. You can search the internet as to how to change the folder/drive. I will go ahead and lock
 this thread also as to prevent repetitive answers.</p>

<h3> bj81  say:</h3>
<h2>            Will automatic bluetooth file receiving come to Win10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>It appears that Windows 10 removes the "share" option from the Bluetooth settings, and that in order to receive a file from a phone or tablet, it is 100% necessary to open the "receive a file" dialog.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/573afd44-9905-4527-9c50-1c288fafd4e8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/573afd44-9905-4527-9c50-1c288fafd4e8" height="359" width="510" /></a></p>
<p>Is there any good reason why Windows makes Bluetooth file transfer more annoyingly manual with each new OS?&nbsp; Back in XP we could browse and drag/drop from device folders... now we need to manually receive each file.&nbsp; What gives?</p>

            <p>Why are microsoft "Support Engineers" with no real knowledge of changes to Windows 10 menus replying like this....</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Yes I have paired devices - Im not an idoit</p>
<p>- Yes it is widely reported that Windows 10 doesn't have "Share" option in Windows 10, and that fsquirt has to be alive and listening for even the most basic operation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to assist on this is to check with developers what happened to share in Windows 10 ans will it be restored at any time.&nbsp; This is a Surface4 by the way, so its 100% a Microsoft build.</p>

            <p>I blamed Win10 too initially, until I finally figured out that it was a problem with my Bluetooth driver. My Acer laptop's Win7 BT driver was probably incompatible with Win10 and so during the upgrade it got replaced with MS' own generic driver. Unfortunately
 MS' version has minimal functionality and lacks both the Share tab as well as, most importantly, the ability to auto receive files without making the user select Receive Files every single time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once I tracked down and installed the proper updated Win10 driver for my laptop's BT chipset, voilà, I immediately got the Share tab and can send files to the laptop as before without having to select Receive Files explicitly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See my post in <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-hardware/windows-10-and-bluetooth-file-transfer-from-phone/4d7fd370-fb55-4b67-ae04-f801666e88a8?page=3">

            yes but what is happening is that now that MS has a sub par generic driver even broadcom is no longer providing a "proper" driver and we are left with the weaksauce implementation that MS gives.

            If that is the case then go to Control Panel-&gt;Display-&gt;Calibrate Color

    <title>Pin two shortcuts to same EXE on taskbar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pauljarrow  say:</h3>
<h2>            Pin two shortcuts to same EXE on taskbar</h2>
                    So it seems that I want to have two copies of a shortcut ( or two shortcuts ) of the same EXE file pinned to the taskbar. The reasoning is arbitrary, but should be obvious. I need to add different post command line flags for each icon.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any time I attempt to add the shortcut to the taskbar again, it's removed or not allowed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now I know that the people paid professional salaries wouldn't INTENTIONALLY make it impossible to pin a shortcut twice KNOWING FULL WELL how their operating system works and that people will inevitably want to do these sorts of things. I really must be
 missing something.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>How does one go about doing this?</div>

            <p>Thanks Anil,</p>
<p>I have tried IE. Message says problem is with website</p>
<p>Also Firefox<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"> occasionally</span> connects but displays only one account!</p>
<p>Google Chrome very rarely connects but sometimes does. On the first step there usually is no "NEXT" or "CONTINUE" button displayed! When I do get past this to the second step and press "NEXT/CONTINUE" nothing happens. Message bottom left corner says "waiting
 for Halifax Secure...."</p>
<p>I can access my accounts using another computer which has Windows 7 and Google Chrome without problem which suggests to me that the problem is with Windows 8.1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards &nbsp;Fred</p>

            <p>Hi Ganesh,</p>
<p>I have tried all the suggestions made from the community and nothing does the trick. I have spoken to Halifax and they say it is a browser problem and I have spoken to Microsoft and they say it is a Website problem, so I'm caught in the middle! However since
 I can access my accounts via my partners m/c and Windows 7 and also via my smart phone I'll leave it until Microsoft and Halifax get their heads togetther.</p>
<p>My thanks to all who contributed&nbsp;</p>

I have done everything that I can think of - I have run memtest86 to check the RAM (all sticks have passed at least 8 passes), updated every driver, used driver verifier, and done two completely clean Windows 10 installs. Any help at all would be sincerely
 appreciated.

                    <p>I have noticed that my internet connection is slow and on checking which programs are accessing the internet I found several connections from svchost.exe(HTTP_C_Bulk) connecting to remote ip addresses 176.255.246.155:80 and 176.255.246.177:80. The connections
 are taking my full internet bandwidth in short pulses.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run three antivirus/antimalware programs and they have found nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried deny access to the two ip addresses via ESET Smart Security firewall.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I use cfos to check if the connections are still opening I find that they are.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows update is not downloading and I have checked if steam is updating any of my games and it is not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot seem to stop these connection being made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how I can remove these connection?</p>
