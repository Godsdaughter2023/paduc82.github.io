    <title>Windows installation cannot continue because a required driver could - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stark_a1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows installation cannot continue because a required driver could not be installed.</h2>
                    <p>I am trying to deploy a Windows 8.1 image to multiple Dell OptiPlex 9020s. I loaded and updated Windows 8.1, installed Office 2013 and its updates, updated drivers from Dell's site and installed other programs. I then performed a sysprep and uploaded the
 image to the server(Windows 2012 R2). I'm now trying to deploy the image to another 9020 and am surprised about the driver message since they are the exact same machine. What can I do to get past this since the installation cancels? Is there a way to find
 out which driver is the problem since the message provides no clue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note: I even tried this on an image where I had not updated the Dell drivers and still got the same message.</p>

    <title>Google Document - Onscreen keyboard appears when keycover is in place - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pilgrimoffice  say:</h3>
<h2>            Google Document - Onscreen keyboard appears when keycover is in place</h2>
                    <p>Surface Pro 3, my company uses Google Docs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I select a point in my Google document using the touch screen, the on-screen keyboard appears, even though the keyboard/cover is attached. &nbsp;Is there anyway to stop this from happening since obviously I don't want the onscreen keyboard to appear when
 the keyboard/cover is attached.</p>

            <p>Hello&nbsp;<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/4e33f7be-9ff3-4145-bb17-e219435ecb2a">PilgrimOffice</a>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for sharing your question regarding using Google Documents with the onscreen keyboard on your Surface Pro 3. I'll do what I can to help you with this question.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I should ask, just to verify: you are using Google Chrome, correct? You stated that you are editing Google documents, but you don't specify whether you are using Chrome while doing so. Assuming that you are using Google Chrome, it is a touch-optimized
 program, and as such, when you tap on a writing field, the onscreen keyboard will pop up. What you can do to avoid this is use a mouse or the touchpad on the Surface Pro 3 cover to select the positions in the document that you would like to edit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if we understood your issue correctly. Also, please post again if you have any other questions or issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Wishes,</p>
<p>Zack_T</p>

            <p>Yes, I'm using Google Chrome while editing a Google Document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To be functional, the onscreen keyboard should only appear if the external keyboard/cover is NOT attached. &nbsp;Or it should be a user selected option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, If I accidentally touch the screen when editing my Google Doc in Chrome (because I'm pointing something out to a friend for example with the keyboard attached), Chrome suddenly goes 1/2 screen on me and an unwanted and unneeded keyboard hogs
 the screen.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have to stop what I'm doing, close the onscreen keyboard, and re-size my document.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I have to try and use the mouse to point something out using a touch pad that I can't control or use effectively.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not good. &nbsp;Not user friendly. &nbsp;Really a pain to use. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very undesirable behavior. &nbsp;This happens so often that I'm reluctant to use my new Surface Pro on my vital Google docs. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>HELP!</p>

            I'm overall extremely happy with my SP3, but the constant pop-up of the on-screen keyboard is driving me nuts. The thought with a touch screen is to be able to use it instead of a mouse, but as soon as I press a text field, the OSK pops up and ruins my
 day. Could you PLEASE add an option to disable it while a physical keyboard is connected?

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1 for my HP laptop. i was delighted on getting the new OS from Microsoft when i had the chance to upgrade to the latest OS. Everything was working fine until the keyboard suddenly not working in my Outlook which
 i used it for work. I could not find any solution online and i was thinking to restart the computer to see if it works. i have tried and it works, it went back to normal but i know that this is not a permanent fix for this bug.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This bug has revisited me again now and you can see that i have no issue to compose this feedback but i could not write anything in my outlook. I am going to restart my computer again after i have posted this.</p>
<p>

<p>Dear Sheri:</p>
<p>I couldn't make the switch; I think it's an issue of permissions.?&nbsp; I followed your steps.&nbsp; The issue occurred when the "MOVE" icon was dimmed out; hence unavailable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I attempted to change&nbsp;<em>"permissions"</em>.&nbsp; I went through the steps to do that yet the permissions still read "<em>READ ONLY".</em>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Could the issue be "<em>Controlled Folder Access"?</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the very quik reply earlier.&nbsp; This is the first opportunity that I've had to reply.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>DanMcMak</p>

            Is your OneDrive a personal OneDrive or is a Business OneDrive. It sounds like you don't have permissions to move it.

<p>Dear Sheri:</p>
<p>This is a personal OneDrive on my personal laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Going with my hunch, I switched off&nbsp;<em>Controlled Folder Access (CFA).</em>&nbsp; Then I rebooted the PC.&nbsp; I went back to your original post; the
<em>MOVE</em> icon was now active &amp; available.&nbsp; I followed the remaining steps in your outline.&nbsp; It worked!&nbsp; Its now running on D:\.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reactivated <em>CFA</em>.&nbsp; The ability to move folders, via the <em>MOVE</em> command, is once again "dimmed out".</p>
<p>
</p><p>My conclusion: Controlled Folder Access was the culprit!</p>
<p>
</p><p>A side note: there's not much help around about&nbsp;<em>CFA.</em>&nbsp; Error messages abound in
<em>MESSAGE CENTER</em>.&nbsp; Yet the messages are truncated and impossible to decipher.&nbsp; Yet I don't dare turn off the setting, except in this one instance. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate your help with this! &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Most sincerely yours,</p>
<p>DanMcMak, Syracuse, NY</p>

<h2>            question about license for games...</h2>
                    
<p>my original xbox 360 is being sent in for repairs since the dvd built in optical drive on it failed because of the update.&nbsp; i am still downloading halo reach and halo 3 into the hard drive so i can play them for the time being. i had to sell my discs to
 buy enough ms points to download reach and will sell more so i can get enough for halo 3. is there any way i can find out if they will transfer my license to the xbox 360 that they will be sending me after they get my broken xbox? i'd like to still be able
 to play my downloaded games on the new xbox and all the maps i downloaded...can anyone answer this for me? i know that they usually transfer the license automatically or i have to do it myself, but i've already used my one transfer for this year already and
 i'm screwed if i cant get it done after the repair is done and i get a refurbished or new 360&nbsp; slim. (yes i am sending a 360 slim in. it broke in less than a year and it was still under warranty, so i'm covered regardless)</p>

<p>Yes after a repair they would transfer the licenses manually there and all you have to do is queue and redownload them if you got a warning that it's associated with another console please call xbox support immediately</p>

<br />
I have a problem with Windows Explorer. It just won't stop crashing! Well, technically, it just becomes unresponsive. But then I am left with no other option but to crash it by forcing it to terminate via the Task Manager. But why does it not respond to begin

I am using genuine Windows Vista Home Premium 64-bit edition, SP2.<br />

<br />
===========================================<br />
<br />
Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

            The SFC.exe scan (<span style="font-weight: bold">sfc /scannow</span> command) is complete, but I am stuck at viewing the results.<br />
<br />
According to the Microsoft support article you linked to I am supposed to use the command
<span><span style="font-weight: bold">findstr /c:"[SR]" %windir%\logs\cbs\cbs.log &gt;</span></span><span><span style="font-weight: bold">sfcdetails.txt</span>
</span><span>to find and output entries tagged as "[SR]</span>" to a file called sfcdetails.txt.<br />
<br />
The cmd completes the command but the file <span><span style="font-weight: bold">sfcdetails.txt</span> doesn't seem to be created. Is this file supposed to be created in
</span><span>%windir%\logs\cbs? I can't find it there, and a file search on C: drive returns nothing.<br />
<br />
The cbs.log is a very big file, so it's not a simple task to open it in Notepad. The Notepad I know freezes up when trying to open files this big.<br />
<br />
So what do I do now? Is the command above correct? How do I extract the relevant information from that file?<br />

            </span>
            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            OK, I managed to extract the details from the cbs.log file. I simply changed the directory from the default System32 to the cbs directory, before running the command.<br />
<br />
Microsoft Windows [Version 6.0.6002]<br />
<br />
C:\Windows\system32&gt;findstr /c:"[SR]" %windir%\logs\cbs\cbs.log &gt;sfcdetails.txt<br />
<br />
C:\Windows\system32&gt;findstr "[SR]" %windir%\logs\cbs\cbs.log &gt;sfcdetails.txt<br />
<br />
C:\Windows\system32&gt;findstr "[SR]" %windir%\logs\cbs\cbs.log&gt;sfcdetails.txt<br />
<br />
C:\Windows\system32&gt;findstr /c:"[SR]" %windir%\logs\cbs\cbs.log&gt;sfcdetails.txt<br />
<br />
C:\Windows\system32&gt;cd %windir%\logs\cbs\<br />
<br />
C:\Windows\Logs\CBS&gt;findstr /c:"[SR]" %windir%\logs\cbs\cbs.log&gt;sfcdetails.txt<br />
<br />
C:\Windows\Logs\CBS&gt;findstr /c:"[SR]" %windir%\logs\cbs\cbs.log &gt;sfcdetails.txt<br />
<br />
C:\Windows\Logs\CBS&gt;<br />
<br />
So yeah, I would say, the command provided in the Microsoft support article is probably wrong.<br />

            It gets stuck at tasks like recovering files from the recycle bin. The dialog for recovering files appears and it starts to calculate the time left for the task to complete and it just sits there, and does nothing! Several minutes can go by without any
 glimpse of progress. Then at some point it becomes impossible to open up a new Windows Explorer window by using the Win+E command. Everything just drops to snail pace. At that point I have no other choice but to terminate Explorer via the Task Manager.<br />
<br />
After terminating it, I am usually unable to bring up the Windows Run prompt. So I am not able to type in 'explorer' and press Enter to start it up again. Instead, I have to trick Windows to start up Explorer again through the Open dialog box.<br />
<br />
Simply, if I have Firefox still running, what I do is I press Alt+Tab and bring up the Firefox window, press Ctrl+O to bring up the Open dialog box, browse to C:\Windows\System32, press E, X, P, L to locate explorer.exe, right click it to bring up the context
 menu, and then click the "run as administrator" option. That way Explorer starts loading and it operates normally.<br />
<br />
Although one drawback of this "trick" that I discovered is that the Open dialog box becomes unavailable, in other words I can not click it to make it in focus, it just stays there and does nothing, so I am not able to click Cancel or press Esc to exit the Open
 dialog box. This eventually causes Firefox to become unresponsive and I have to crash it and start all over again and reopen my 50+ websites in tabs by first recovering them from the Firefox sessionstore.js file (if not saved by Session Manager plugin or similar).<br />
<br />
This whole problem with Explorer seems to only appear when I am browsing or accessing files from drive K: which is an internal disk drive where I store my photos. I just ran CheckDisk on this drive and it didn't find any problems with the disk. So I will do
 some testing and a try the clean boot to try to narrow down the probable cause of the problem.<br />

            OK, I have done some tests now. I have narrowed down this problem to Microsoft Camera Codec Pack, version 16.0.0652.0621. I have no idea why this is causing problems, but after uninstalling this piece of software I have not had any problems with Windows
 Explorer.<br />
<br />
I would really like to be able to preview RAW images in Explorer. I don't feel like paying for third party software like FastPictureViewer Codec Pack or the Ardfry Imaging Canon RAW CR2 codec for 64-bit and 32-bit Windows. This is something that Microsoft should
 support nativity in modern Windows systems like Vista and Windows 7.<br />
<br />
So Microsoft finally took the time and effort to create this camera codec pack last year that allows you to view your photos without launching Photoshop or Lightroom. But as always, Microsoft products are full of bugs. It doesn't matter if it's a payed software
 or a free software like this one.<br />
<br />
Could this have anything to do with the 32/64 bit compatibility? I am using Vista 64-bit and I also downloaded the 64-bit installer for the Camera Codec Pack. So it's no problem there. But what about the Windows Explorer? Is there a 32 and a 64 bit version
 of Windows Explorer? Is the 32-bit Windows Explorer the standard version used on Windows Vista 64-bit? Could a 64-bit Camera Codec Pack cause the 32-bit Windows Explorer to stop responding or even crash it?...<br />
<br />
It's a pity that there is currently no 64-bit version of the original Canon RAW Codec. Otherwise I would never have installed the Microsoft Camera Codec Pack to begin with. I am hoping to see RAW file support in the upcoming Windows 8.<br />
<br />
It makes me angry that Microsoft expects people to pay and upgrade the whole damn operating system just to get some extras like simple file format support for certain files. It was the same with the AAC, MP4 and MOV back in the days when Windows 7 and Windows
 Media Player 12 was released. They never released the media player 12 for Vista. That's one of several reasons why I refused to upgrade to Windows 7. I may not even get the Windows 8, unless it comes pre-installed on the computer, of course. Thankfully there
 are free and open source alternatives for both Windows Media Player and for Windows!<br />

<br />
That is the latest version of the Microsoft Camera Codec Pack so you might try re-installing<br />
it. It is also very probably you have something running that is interfering with it.<br />

Checking with your camera maker's support and forums would be a good idea.<br />

<br />
Did using the Clean Boot point to other issues? <br />
<br />
Don't fail to use the rest of the troubleshooter as those type issues usually have several parts<br />
that work together to cause them.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

                    <p>I have a photo saved somewhere on my computer, that has previously been used as a lock screen photo. I cannot locate where this photo is stored. Where should I look? I've tried all the usual places, and have Googled the answer, to no avail. My computer was
 recently upgraded to Windows 10, if that helps.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

            I tried that already. I found all the other wallpaper images used for lock screen (the ones that came with the computer), but not my current lock screen photo that I added myself years ago. It seems not to be saved anywhere.

            I can see it on "preview" on "choose your picture" in the lock screen settings, but can't find where the image is stored. The other wallpaper options there are all stored where you said to look.

<h2>            &#91;SOLVED&#93; Windows 10 &#34;INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Greetings,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently upgraded my computer from Windows 7 Home to Windows 10 Home using the free upgrade. The upgrade was successful but i wanted to clean install so i used the built-in recovery. If you are familiar with this, it also asks if i wanted to just delete
 my files or CLEAN CLEAN install and i chose that. Took an hour or so and several more hours on 99% but it finished.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem is that EVERYTIME i start my computer it automatically boots to Windows 10 and thats where it loads for about 7 seconds and then an error comes up stating that there is an&nbsp;INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE. I have a USB that i can use to reinstall HOWEVER
 my Windows 10 starts waay too fast for me to access the computer's BIOS or boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If there is anyway i can reinstall my computer or at least access the boot menu please tell me.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE*** OK so how i solved this - I opened my computer's case and unplugged my hard drive, this forced my computer to boot my usb instead of my hard drive. Then as my USB was being booted, i replugged my hard drive in hopes of it working. (YES IT IS DANGEROUS)
 The first time around, i went through the process of reinstalling windows but when i got to selecting a drive, my hard drive was not listed. I tried again and again but it wanted me to install drivers for my HDD. Later i checked this post and Vanessa had listed
 me instructions on ways to fix it. I went to the USB boot drive and i selected the repair computer and then i opened the command prompt to check the disk. Although it did not do anything as it didnt find any problems, somehow when i restarted the computer
 and went to reinstall windows again, my hard drive was finally displayed. From there it only took about 15 minutes to reinstall windows 10. :D &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I sincerely thank Vanessa Sohtun for the answer :)</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>UPDATE 2*** I recently see that many others have had this problem and want to know how to fix it.
</p>
<p>First of all, for your Windows 10 to work correctly and be <strong>activated</strong>, YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST have "upgraded" it; not clean installed it.</p>
<p>Secondly if you are having the same problem then you need to give us a detailed description on how you got this error and what you did during your upgrading process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem is more prominent when you clean install your computer so make sure you have upgraded to windows 10 before clean installing. If you have clean installed your computer before upgrading then you will need to get a windows7/8.1 recovery media or
 disk and downgrade because u must have the activation. When upgrading to Windows 10 the installer registers your computer on the internet for activation. however it can only be done when u &nbsp;have a genuine version of windows. BUT when you clean install Windows
 10 then your windows 7/8.1 product WILL NOT be transferred over.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The correct method of clean installing to windows 10 would be to "upgrade it", download the media creation tool -&nbsp;http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10 on the newly upgraded computer. Run the tool and click "create media for another
 computer or something like that. Now u must select the exact same type of windows 10 as u have upgraded to. To find out whats ur type go to settings, update and recovery and tehn to activation. NOTE that u must select the exact same type of windows 10 otherwise
 it will not be activated after the clean install.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After you have created the bootable media, restart your computer and check if u can access bios and change the boot to the usb if not then follow these steps&nbsp;</p>
<p>http://acer.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/37064/~/windows-10%3A-access-the-uefi-bios</p>
<p>From there it is straight forward, just boot the usb and install it on your hard drive, this will clean install your hard drive so copy any files you need beforehand.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">As per your query, I understand that you have an error loading your OS.
</span><span>The INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE bug check frequently occurs because of a boot device failure. During I/O system initialization, the boot device driver might have failed to initialize the boot device (typically a hard
 disk). File system initialization might have failed because it did not recognize the data on the boot device. Also, repartitioning the system partition or installing a new SCSI adapter or disk controller might induce this error.</span></p>
<p><span>To resolve the issue I would suggest two methods:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Insert the installation USB&nbsp;and boot Windows 10 from it.</span></li><li><span>In the

</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 2:</span></strong></p>

<li><span>If the issue persists, you may perform a check disk and check if that helps.</span></li><li><span>Insert the installation USB&nbsp;and boot Windows 10 from it.</span></li><li><span>In the

<h2>            Forgot Admin password for Vista Home Premium&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I was trying to install Flash in my laptop but this thing popped up saying "User account controll" and "&nbsp;Windows needs your permission to continue". Also I notice my Administrator account is my guest account and I have no clue of what the password is. But
 I am using standard user right now with a password. Please help me!!</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            A. - Guest Account - Do not use the Guest account you see in the User Accounts applet in Control Panel. The Guest account is a special system account, not one meant for when you are feeling hospitable. It is disabled by default in Windows XP, Vista, Linux,
 Unix, and OS X for a reason.<br />
<br />
From TechNet:<br />
<br />
"The Guest account is intended for users who require temporary access to the system. However, if this account is enabled, a security risk may exist because an unauthorized user could gain anonymous access to the system through this account."<br />
<br />
<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb418978(TechNet.10).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb418978(TechNet.10).aspx</a><br />
<br />
So if you enabled Guest, disable it now and create a Standard/Limited (Vista, XP Pro/XP Home) for your visitors. Call the new user account something like "Visitor".<br />
<span><br />
B. Forgotten password - You can change your password to something you will remember from another administrative user's account. If you only had one administrative user account and you've forgotten the password, you can use one of the methods below instead.
 You might then want to follow the general recommendations for setting up user accounts in Vista that I'll give you at the end of this post.<br />
<br />
</span><span>Doing all this requires a certain level of computer skills. You know yourself best and whether taking the machine to a competent local computer tech (not a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place) is the better solution for
 you.</span> <br />
<span><br />
If you have a Vista installation DVD (not a recovery DVD) you can boot the system with it. Select the default language, then choose "Repair your computer". Then select "Command Prompt". At the command prompt type:<br />
<br />
net user administrator /active:yes<br />
net user [insert your administrative user account's name here] [insert new user password like 1234 here]<br />
<br />
[Note: Do not type the brackets!]<br />
<br />
Now you will be able to log into your administrative user account using the password you set; i.e., 1234. If you don't have a Vista installation DVD you can either make a bootable Vista Repair DVD from the file at this link:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</a><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp; Log into your administrative user account (not the Built-in Administrator) which will either require no password or something simple like "1234".<br />
<br />
If you used Method 1, after you have logged into your administrative user account you should disable the built-in Administrator again for security purposes:<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: cmd<br />
When cmd appears in Results above, right-click it and choose "Run as administrator" [OK]. Now you will get the command prompt. At the command prompt type:<br />
<br />
net user administrator /active:no [enter]<br />
<br />
Exit the command prompt.<br />
<br />
</span><span><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration-line: underline">General Recommendations For Setting Up Users In Vista:</span><br />
<br />
You absolutely do not want to have only one user account. Like XP and all other modern operating systems, Vista is a multi-user operating system with built-in system accounts such as Administrator, Default, All Users, and Guest. These accounts should be left
 alone as they are part of the operating system structure.<br />
<br />
You particularly don't want only one user account with administrative privileges on Vista because the built-in Administrator account (normally only used in emergencies) is disabled by default. If you're running as Administrator for your daily work and that
 account gets corrupted, things will be Difficult. It isn't impossible to activate the built-in Administrator to rescue things, but it will require third-party tools and working outside the operating system.<br />
<br />
The user account that is for your daily work should be a Standard user, with the extra administrative user (call it something like "CompAdmin" or "Tech" or the like) only there for elevation purposes. After you create "CompAdmin", log into it and change your
 regular user account to Standard. Then log back into your regular account.<br />
<br />
If you want to go directly to the Desktop and skip the Welcome Screen with the icons of user accounts, you can do this:<br />
<br />
Start Orb&gt;Search box&gt;type: netplwiz [enter]<br />
Click on Continue (or supply an administrator's password) when prompted by UAC<br />
<br />
Uncheck the option "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer". Select a user account to automatically log on by clicking on the desired account to highlight it and then hit OK. Enter the correct password for that user account (if there
 is one) when prompted. Leave it blank if there is no password (null).</span>

I have no idea why you're getting the error (unless .NET Framework 4.5.1 is already installed or something's wrong with your install of .NET Framework 4*).&nbsp; I can point you to...</p>

<p>As for the German-language error, did the computer come with an <em>English-language</em> version of Win7 preinstalled? ...is it a Win7 Ultimate or Enterprise computer?&nbsp;...are you currently located in Germany?</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 x64 HP installer is not working properly</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My school uses NAC agent (I have latest version) but it gives me an error that it cannot find the NAC server, now this only happens to my computer, it does not happen to anyone else or with my MacBook. I also had some problems installing other programs.
 I have uninstalled and installed NAC agent at least 5 times. It does work randomly (few times, random) and when I switch from my Mac to my W7 and have to log-off the Mac through the NAC in Windows</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I just ran the FixIt program from MS support and found no issues with the registry, but there has to be a problem with the installer. What else can I do?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you</div>
                </div>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
As I understand you are unable to access NAC on your School's Network on your Mac Book, as the connection fluctuates, randomly. Is this correct?<br />
<br />
In order for a better understanding of the issue, please provide some information.<br />
<br />
1. Please elaborate on the NAC connection / program?<br />
<br />
2. Are you using secure credentials to log in to the School network?<br />
<br />
3. Is the issue specific to Windows 7 or both Mac and Windows 7?<br />
<br />
4. Which fix it program did you run from Microsoft?<br />
<br />
5. Is there any specific error code / message displayed?<br />
<br />
Please provide the requested information for a better understanding of a issue and to receive<br />
<br />
accurate troubleshooting steps.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for your help<br />
<div><br />
<div>I'm able to connect on my MB (Mountain Lion) but not on my HP Windows 7 x64. My MB never has the problem, neither people I know, that either have Macs or Windows PCs.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The school uses the Cisco NAC agent 4.9.1.13 (Module version 3.5.3084.2)</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have to input a password to connect to the network and then after downloading Cisco NAC I have to log in. It checks my system for latest "important" windows updates and up to date antivirus software (Kaspersky).</div>
<div><br />
<div>The issue is specific to my Windows 7 computer, as&nbsp;apparently&nbsp;there are no other people with the same problem in the school. My Macbook has no issues</div>
<div><br />
<div>I used MS FixIt (<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/mats/Program_Install_and_Uninstall?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/mats/Program_Install_and_Uninstall?wa=wsignin1.0</a>) it checks for registry errors, etc</div>
<div><br />
<div>The error that I get is "<span>NAC server is not available in the network. Please contact admin.." plus other stuff. Pretty much just says if it keeps happening contact administrator</span></div>
<div><br />
<div>EDIT: I ran ccleaner to clean up any problems in the registry (mainly stuff left from uninstalled software). Then I used the install/uninstall program to "repair" the Cisco NAC, and it made it worst, it kept saying I didn't have an antivirus and that I
 didn't have Windows update working. So I ran windows update, only optional stuff, which I installed. At the end had to uninstall and install again (after downloading it again). Still same problem</div>
<div><br />
<div><span>Thank you</span></div>

<p>What Windows version is running on your Surface Pro?</p>
<p>For Bluetooth connections to a Xbox One controller you need at least Windows 10 Version 1709 (better would be 1809).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can check the Windows version by typing "Windowskey + R" and starting "winver".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also make sure your controller has the most up-to-date firmware. Connect the controller via a Micro USB cable, and use the Xbox Accessories App to check for the controller firmware.</p>

<h3> ns276  say:</h3>
<h2>            All USB connected devices stopped working</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am using Asus laptop with Windows 10. Recently I changed the mouse and keyboard&nbsp;I have been using to a Logitech&nbsp;keyboard and a Trust wireless gaming mouse (9 buttons).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All were working fine until suddenly they stopped working and in device manager, they are listed under unknown devices with question marks with them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also the mouse or the keyboards I have been using before these ones are now also giving same error and not working and listed under unknown devices. Basically whatever is connected to USB won't&nbsp;be recognized and will go directly under other devices and will
 be listed as an unknown device so they will be plugged in but won't work while they work with other laptops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>1- To update all drivers, especially chipset to see if there was a problem but they are all up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2- I removed and re-installed all USB drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3- I tried to make the system go to an earlier date but that gave and error so I couldn't&nbsp;do that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So none of the things above worked for any solution.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found the driver of the keyboard on&nbsp;Logitech&nbsp;website and downloaded it manually and now keyboard works but even though it displays correct&nbsp;drivers under keyboard title there are still "unknown drivers" under other drivers section from the keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And since the mouse is a plug and play mouse there are no drivers of it online or in the manufacturer's&nbsp;website, therefore, I couldn't make that one work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even if I could find driver to make mouse work too this would just mean every device I connect to laptop with USB won't&nbsp;be recognised and I will have to find drivers of that certain device manually and try to make it work that way (even in that time the
 drivers it didn't&nbsp;recognise will stay under the other drivers as "unknown drivers) and since its almost impossible to deal with that for every single product&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was really hoping someone that knows what happened all of a sudden could help me to solve this problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I can fix it and drivers would be installed and recognized automatically after they are plugged.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be appreciated&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update. </p>
<p>

    <title>Why is my computer becoming so slow all of a sudden&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> john_1991  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is my computer becoming so slow all of a sudden&#63;</h2>
                    About one month ago my McAfee Antivirus could no longer update automatically, and I had to update it manually by going to McAfee's website. &nbsp;Then today, my computer became incredibly slow and would take forever to open anything. &nbsp;Going full screen with
 flash videos caused flash to crash until I went to settings and unchecked the "Enable Hardware Acceleration" feature. &nbsp;I also attempted to open iTunes and it appeared to worked until it attempted to access the internet, when it would freeze and ultimately
 crash. &nbsp;Could programs accessing the internet be the problem? &nbsp;I uninstalled McAfee and performance increased a little, but iTunes will still not work unless I turn off my wireless internet connection.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm lost and have no idea what to do. &nbsp;I tried to have Windows automatically diagnose my problem but all it told me to do was to stop having so many programs open on start-up, which I did, but it is still painfully slow.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Could it be overheating? (I've never had this problem before)</div>
<div>Could it be some issue with the registry? (I often use&nbsp;AVG PC Tuneup 2011 which deletes some items from the registry which it claims is no longer necessary)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>

            <p>Uninstall McAfee (disconnect from the Internet before you do.)&nbsp; Replace it with something else.&nbsp; Avast!&nbsp; Avira or AVG will work (if you want free) or eSet NOD32 (AntiVirus ONLY - not the suite!) if you are willing to pay about 60 U.S.D. every two years.&nbsp;
 You'll be happier.</p>
<p>It could be overheating - but you should be able to PHYSICALLY test for that. heh</p>
<p>Don't mess with the registry in any manner you wouldn't do 100% manually.</p>
<p>My suggestion - cleanup the computer and get the latest drivers for your hardware (perhaps even a later BIOS) from the manufacturer(s).&nbsp; Do not use any built-in method from Microsoft to do the driver updates - actually visit the manufacturer(s) web pages
 and get the proper drivers installed per component.</p>
<p><strong><u>Check for malware:</u></strong></p>
<p>Download, install, run, update and perform full system scans with the following two applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://malwarebytes.org/mbam-download.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MalwareBytes (FREE)</a>
</li><li><a href="http://superantispyware.com/downloadfile.html?productid=SUPERANTISPYWAREFREE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">SuperAntiSpyware (FREE)</a></li></ul>
<p><br />
Removing everything they find.&nbsp; Rebooting when needed.&nbsp; (You can uninstall one or both when done.)</p>
<p>Then perform an online scan with the <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
eSet Online Scanner</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>Free up some hard drive space and get it organized:</u></strong></p>
<p>Open an elevated command prompt by&nbsp;clicking on the start orb and browsing through All Programs --&gt; Accessories and&nbsp;right-clicking on "Command Prompt" and choosing&nbsp;"Run as Administrator".</p>
<p>Type in the following in the command prompt:</p>
<p>dism /online /cleanup-image /spsuperseded</p>
<p>... and press ENTER.</p>
<p>The process takes a few minutes to complete, it ends with the sentences “Service Pack Cleanup operation completed. The operation completed successfully”.</p>

<p>You can use an application that scans your system for log files and temporary files and use that to get rid of those:</p>

<p>Those can help you visually discover where all the space is being used.&nbsp; Then you can determine what to do and what to delete/archive.</p>
<p>After that - you will want to check for any physical errors and&nbsp;arrange&nbsp;everything for more efficient access...</p>

<p>Hi Coo1guy1,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reaching out to us in the forums for this question. Sadly, the backward compatibility library is not something that we can make requests to directly any longer. In order to request for the game to become backward compatible, you would need to
 reach out to the developer of the game directly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The listed developers for that particular game are as follows:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://www.vvisions.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Vicarious Visions</a></li><li><a href="http://www.heavy-iron.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Heavy Iron Studios</a></li><li><a href="https://www.mobygames.com/company/awe-productions-inc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">AWE Productions, Inc. - MobyGames</a></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully, if enough people make the request, we'll all be picking up our golden undies &amp; spatulas, fighting a big jellyfish and attempting to defeat Plankton soon!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps out!</p>

<h3> keystonerose  say:</h3>
<h2>            CONNECTING EXTERNAL HARD DRIVES - MOVING DATA FROM eXTERNAL hARD DRIVE TO COMPUTER AND BACK AGAIN</h2>
                    <p>The other day I was reading some questions and answers on the community forum and there was one discussion about moving data from an external hard drive to a desk PC or laptop, working on it on your computer/tablet, and then transferring it back to the external
 hard drive.&nbsp; The Microsoft person said something about the downside of doing this, and I cannot remember (I'm 70 and getting forgetful) exactly what she said about this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just work on files about books and authors and other data files that aren't too big&nbsp; --&nbsp; less than 200 pages.&nbsp; I have a Seagate external hard drive that I work on and then when I have updated information on it, I transfer the file to my desktop computer
 or to my Surface Pro 3, whichever one I'm working on.&nbsp; It seemed to me that the technician said that this was not good for the computer--that a person should download the file from the external hard drive, work on it, and then download it back to the external
 hard drive.&nbsp; Then one should delete that file from the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I guess I'm asking what is the best way to transfer data back and forth from my computer to my external hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks a million.</p>

            <p>Just leave the data on the hard disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can navigate to the hard disk and to where the file you want to work with and just double-click it and the default program for it should load.&nbsp; When you are done with the file, it will save in the same location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Later, when you remove the hard disk and go to another computer, just do the same thing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today's hard disks are a lot more reliable than yesteryears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you don't want to use a hard disk, you have the 'cloud' storage OneDrive.&nbsp; You can treat OneDrive just you would a hard disk.&nbsp; Open the file manager on the Desktop (Folder icon on the taskbar) and you will see a OneDrive folder.&nbsp; Just put your files in
 there and like you would with the hard disk, open the file from there, edit, and save back to that folder.&nbsp; A few minutes later, that edited file will sync with the cloud storage and you can then open it with another computer.</p>
