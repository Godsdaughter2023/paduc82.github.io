<h2>            create a new pool and storage space in the manage storage spaces</h2>
                    <p>Dear all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have connected two USB storage drives, each one of them is 16 GB. I tried to create a new virtual pool but it did not work out.</p>
<p>I thought the size is not enough and it may need extra storage spaces. I connected 64 GB then opened the storage space but I am still unable to create storage space.</p>

<p>Virtual Pool ????????????</p>
<p>
</p><p>You mean just storage space, or are you trying to use one for virtual memory or a pagefile using ready boost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, you need to right click on the Thumb Drives and select Format&gt;&gt;Quick NTFS</p>
<p>restart PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you can store files on them.</p>
<p>If you want to use it for ready boost, then right click on the TD and select properties and then ready boost tab and set it up.</p>
<p>If you use a TD for ready boost, (If the TD supports it), you MUST use the safely remove the device before removing it from your PC or the PC can crash.</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My question is clear. I am asking about this new feature in WIN 10 that help you to create logical drive from thumb drives.</p>
<p>Is there an answer from Expert or Microsoft team?</p>

<p>Just plug in the thumb drive, format it quick NTFS and that is it. There is nothing else to do.</p>
<p>restart PC</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regardless if it is another internal drive or USB external drive or thumb drive. They all store data the same.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I am an expert and I have many storage drives.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a50464fd-b2b0-49b3-a17b-e3692c98597a?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/a50464fd-b2b0-49b3-a17b-e3692c98597a?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>And you do not need to use that storage spaces garbage. Totally useless and not needed.</p>
<p>You just copy or move files onto the thumb drive that you access from THIS PC.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And I see that D:\Data already has data on it, so formatting it will delete all the data on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And what did you originally format it to???</p>
<p>FAT or NTFS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Can you not access this 1 only thumb drive I see connected. D:\ Data ????</p>
<p>C:\ is you OS drive</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now if you are trying to use this for storage as part of the operating system, then you are limited in what you can use it for and store there that pertains to the OS, user account folders or installed programs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>See, you have a cheap laptop with a small drive. Go buy you a bigger drive such as 500GB.</p>
<p>Create a system image of your current drive C:\ OS and WRE and EFI Boot (if you have that)</p>
<p>Put in new drive and restore the new drive with the image.</p>
<p>

<p>Also, Using it for the purpose you want to as a storage space, it formats the drive and deletes all the current data on the drive. Not the way you want to do it as a storage drive for any files or images.

<p>
</p><p>Just plug in any drive and format them quick NTFS one time and restart PC and use them any way you want. Usually less options using a thumb drive compared to a USB HDD. But pretty much the same for both</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can just use file backups or create a system image &gt;&gt; A MUST anyways and back up your files or image to the external drive. I would not use storage spaces.
</p>
<p><strong>Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Backup and Restore (Windows 7)</strong></p>
<p>With system image, back up C:\ OS, WRE and EFI<strong> (if you have EFI)</strong></p>
<p>This is for windows 10 also.</p>

    <title>Oblivion Errors - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Oblivion Errors</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Recently, I have been getting errors from Oblivion. The error itself looks something like this:</p>
<p>This disc is unreadable.</p>
<p>1. Clean the disc with a soft cloth.&nbsp;2. Restart the console.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This error happens&nbsp;with and without&nbsp;an actual disc. It happens with and without the newest update. It happens with and without the DLC's. I have tried redownloading the DLC's, but I don't think it's a confliction problem. The problem occurs with
 and without all my saves, too. My friend, playing on my same xbox, but with a different hard drive IS able to play the DLC's and game without the error popping up. Even after reformatting my hard drive, both the disc and the downloaded version still give me
 the error. I only get the error for Oblivion, though.</p>
<p>Do I need a new hard drive, or is it the game itself? Is there a viable fix for this?</p>

<p>You might want to install the game on your hard drive. Sometimes, this solves problems with cd's that are broken in some way.
</p>
<p>To install, you should put the disc inside your Xbox, then go to my Xbox, Game Library.</p>
<p>Select Oblivion in your recent games and then select install. After the game has been installed, you should start your game in Game Library in the list of your installed games.</p>

<p>You could try clearing the hard drive cache <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971755" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971755</a> however if that doesn't resolve your issue you will have to buy a new hard drive.</p>

<p>The 'Disc Unreadable' error still occurs with the game installed. I think that since Oblivion caches info on hard drives, it might have cached the wrong info. Clearing it did nothing. I even tried using only a usb to play Oblivion, but it's still the same.
 I dug up my old pathetic 10GB and Oblivion works.......</p>

<p>Hi Barb, </p>
<p>thank you for your feedback.</p>
<p>I use Ancestry not FTM, and can access it, using a browser (I assume)</p>
<p>I was just hoping (as I use the Surface as a tablet a lot) that there was an app, as well.</p>
<p>I guess, no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>Beth</p>

<p>I would really love to see some of these accessories, I'd love to wall mount the kinect and I'd love to have a charge station that I could wall mount and run the cord into the wall and into the back of the xbox to have my controllers displayed properly and
 charging at all times.</p>

<p>You can buy a small wall bookshelf to make a kinect mount...I saw a picture somewhere where a guy modified a book shelf to be just big enough for the kinect to mount on it, looked really cool. Probably cheaper this way, rather than some special mount that
 would likely be way overpriced.</p>

<p>True, I have an idea design for my own kinect wall mount involving glass but just thought it'd be cool to be able to mount the kinect to the wall then be able to pull it out and swivel it and such like a wall mounted TV, also a chat pad would be nice.</p>

<p>You can get some 3rd party Kinect mounts really cheap. I've heard a lot of people who have them and say, despite the price, they're really good.</p>

<p>Have a look on Amazon, I know they've popped up in my suggested items more than a few times.</p>

<p>First, there is a set of updates coming on February 11th. Along with some general information regarding updates to assist with app creation as well as stability updates and Kinect improvements, several items were detailed that readers here will be happy
 to see.</p>
<p>-The ability to see and manage your storage space. With this update, you will find it easy to find how much space your content takes up and better manage your content. You can also control your install lineup and more easily manage your download queue. We’ve
 separated My Games and My Apps into separate lists, so you can easily create separate queues for both. Now you can pick the order in which you want your content to load and we’ve added a boot progress indicator so you can better track updates while they load.</p>
<p>-The battery power indicator is back! You can see it right on the home screen, so you can easily track how much battery life is left on your controller.</p>
<p>-And, you will be able to use your USB keyboard with your Xbox One.In addition to that update, there is another updated schedule to land on March 4th, in anticipation of Titanfall. Once again, details are rather scarce, but Microsoft has promised the update
 will include "many new features and improvements, most significantly to our party and multiplayer systems."</p>
<p>Microsoft promised that further details about these updates, and further planned improvements, will be revealed in the near future.</p>

            <p>When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation
 Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
</p>
<p>Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate.
</p>
<p>So, there is no need to know or get a product key, if you need to reinstall Windows 10, you can use your Windows 7 or Windows 8 product key or use the reset function in Windows 10.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 1903 media corrupt</h2>
                    for some reason, i have no ability to install windows. I have tried multiple usb drives, dvds and ran the media creation tool more times than i can count and still get the same problem. On any pc i run it on, it fails during “getting files ready for installation”.
 Can anyone tell me why every installation media i make is always corrupted? This never happened to me with any previous versions, so i am completely stumped with 2 unusable PC’s.

<h2>            Windows Download Tool&#58; Error 0x80042405 - 0xA001A</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am trying to create a install USB device so that I am able to install windows on another laptop. I am using a 16GB USB as the drive, and I have used FAT32 to format it. The build I am trying to download is 64bit Windows 10, English (United Kingdom).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am able to select the drive, go through all the settings and start the download to the USB and then, at some stage, the follow error pops up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">"There was a problem running this tool!<br />

We're not sure what happened, but we're unable to run this tool on your PC. If you continue experiencing problems, reference the error code when contacting customer support. Error code: 0x80042405 - 0xA001A"</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">

<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>I have tried running the Windows Download Tool as administrator, and have tried with several other flashdrives. I have tried through wifi and ethernet, both of which are strong, and have ensured that all other devices are disconnected, barr the charger.
 My security system is disabled.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have just watched the process to see where the issue was occurring. The tool downloaded 100% of necessary files - it verified the download - it reached approximately 45% of "creating media" and then the error popped up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have included some information on the laptop I am trying to install Windows on - however I must note that it currently does not have a version of Windows, or any other OS, installed. The laptop crashed around November 2017 due to a compulsory update from
 Windows, and in the crash, all restore points were deleted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">- I purchased the laptop around April/May 2014, and as far as I can remember it came with Windows 8.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">- I updated to Windows 10 as soon as it was available.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">- The laptop is an HP Envy. </p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">- The laptop had AVG security installed when it crashed.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">- There is no current version of Windows installed.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>I have tried creating a bootable USB Device using an ISO file (which I had no issue downloading using the Download Tool), however the laptop did not recognise the drive as a bootable device.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I am using a 2017 Surface Laptop running 64bit Windows10 to download the install files, and I have the "use recommended settings of this computer" option ticked in the Download Tool options.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
As far as I am aware I have tried almost every option I can find on Google.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance for your help.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Chris.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I'd use the surface image to reinstall:  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/warranty-service-and-recovery/downloadablerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support...</a>

<br />Then the driver pack for your model:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4023482/surface-download-drivers-and-firmware-for-surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/402348...</a>
<br />
<br />You can still apply the tools and methods given in the gold standard Clean Install in this link, which compiles the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

            Hi again Chris.  
<br />
<br />Got it.   Try this alternative MS download site, making sure you choose the correct version and bit-rate (almost always x64 bit):  <a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/public.php</a>
<br />
<br />WIth the ISO downloaded completely, burn to DVD with Windows Image Burner on right click menu.  If you want flash stick installer then install Rufus and set it to UEFI for GPT for a UEFI BIOS, or Legacy MBR for a Legacy BIOS.  
<br />
<br />Then folllow these steps which compile the best possible install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, and has zero reported problems.:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Make sure during the booted install to follow the illustrated steps to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, then click Next to let it auto-create the needed partitions, format them and begin install - this makes it foolproof.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

I have tried this already this morning, and the Envy did not regonise the USB as a bootable device. I will try again now with the GPT/MBR partition and let you know if anything is different.&nbsp;<br />

            There are some things you need to do before booting from USB:
<br />
<br />Make sure you have disabled Secure boot/Fast boot:
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-usb-drive-windows-10-pc.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/21756-boot-...</a>

<br />For HP, Press Esc when Starting up, then F10 to open BIOS settings.
<br />Turn off Secure boot and Clear all HP default keys.
<br />If you use GPT you would have to disable legacy BIOS

</p><p><em>It is important to note that Windows 10 does support Java. The issue Edge users encounter is plug-ins are not supported by Edge.&nbsp; By “not supported,” we mean there is simply no way to activate or enable the Java plug-in with the Edge web browser. Period.
 If Windows 10 supports Java, but the Edge browser does not, the question about how to use Java on Windows 10 remains.&nbsp; The answer lies in alternative web browsers.</em></p>

    <title>Cannot access network even though it shows up with full bars - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot access network even though it shows up with full bars</h2>
                    


Ok, so we just changed our internet provider from Frontier to Comcast and my Vista laptop easily accessed the network and internet before but now it doesn't. We have two other laptops in the house (one is a vista) and they connect just fine. Mine shows a big yellow triangle with an exclamation point inside and says to "press the configuration button on the access point before continuing." I've  tried resetting the access point several times and a couple other troubleshooting techniques but nothing worked. It also has an option to input the passcode, but then it tells me it can't connect to the network. 



When we had the Comcast guy come to our house to fix something else, we showed him the laptop too. He typed some things into the command prompt and said that it doesn't want to let go of the previous IP address and told me it's my computer not the router. I tried to get the number to call Microsoft vista support by putting in my Vista ID number, but it says my number is not supported

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>That usually means a program, such as a messenger, did not properly release the camera.<br />
Check the StartUp Programs to see if something that starts up has access to the camera.<br />

<strong>References to Vista apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
You probably need to reload the camera drivers&nbsp;and any camera control software <strong>
"IF"</strong> there are<br />
any for Windows 7.<br />
<br />
Logon as Admin.<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Imaging - write down make and model of camera - double click<br />
on it and on driver's tab get version. Now click Update Drivers (which may not do anything as MS
<br />
is far behind certifying drivers). The RIGHT CLICK on the camera - UNINSTALL - REBOOT - this<br />
will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site and download the latest camera driver and other related camera<br />
software (if no newer get the same ones).<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to them and RIGHT CLICK - RUN AS ADMIN - reboot after each driver.<br />
<span><br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

</span><span><br />
Then leave windows updates on however stop it from loading drivers which are often older than the<br />
ones you have installed. If Updates suggests a driver then HIDE it and look manually to see if their<br />
really is a newer one (at both system maker and device maker's sites).<br />

                    Hey all,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I recently bought a second-hand ASUS EeePC 1001px for Uni and I've been having issues connecting to the wireless networks at Uni. When I do the troubleshoot process I get a long winded message that eventually says:</div>

<div><span>Any help would be greatly appreciated, as they have no wired connections at Uni and it'd be great if I didn't have to use a Uni computer to download stuff onto a USB and then put it on my laptop.</span>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div><span>Oh yeah, the OS is Windows 7 Ultimate.</span>&nbsp;</div>

            1.&nbsp;Do you see the status of the device as red in Device manager or to the right bottom of the taskbar?
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The Radio switch might be a physical button in the Laptop. I would suggest you to refer the manual and turn it on.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If the issue still persists proceed with the method below.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Method 1: </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Make sure you have the latest network adapter drivers installed on your computer. Just to make sure, I’d suggest you to visit the manufacturer’s website and confirm the same.</div>
<div><br />
You may also uninstall and re-install the wireless network adapter drivers and check if that fixes the issue.</div>
<div><br />
Method 2:</div>
<div><br />
Firstly, run the Network troubleshooter to see if it can help diagnose and solve your problem.</div>
<div><br />
Open the Network troubleshooter by right-clicking the network icon in the notification area, and then clicking Troubleshoot problems.</div>

<h2>            Downloaded files from Microsoft do  not have a file extension</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 Home</p>
<p>Build 10240</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently downloaded several files in an attempt to get my laptop working properly on Windows 10, and get the November Update installed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strangely, the files that should be executable just&nbsp; pop up a "What program do you want to use to use to open&nbsp;this
 file" dialogue.&nbsp; This started happening within the last few weeks, yet I have been using Windows 10 since October 2015.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, the Media Creation Tool downloads as "MediaCreationTool_exe" instead of "MediaCreationTool.exe"</p>
<p>
</p><p>"MicrosoftCameraCodecPack-x64_msi" instead of "MicrosoftCameraCodecPack-x64.msi"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried using Firefox, Internet Explorer and Edge.&nbsp; Each gives the same results.&nbsp; Often, there is an initial "The file could not be downloaded".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Executable files from other sites, for example updating other programs I have on my laptop, work perfectly.&nbsp; It is only Microsoft that gives this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The workaround is for me to manually change the file names, which does work.&nbsp; But it makes no sense.</p>

<h2>            Xbox Beta</h2>
                    
<p>I'm having the same problem as a lot of other users.&nbsp; I can't purchase games because the points were converted to currency.&nbsp; The account was supposedly downloaded on another Xbox that is a beta console.&nbsp; I know that didn't happen.&nbsp; I was chatting with a
 service rep who ended the chat conversation because "they couldn't help me."&nbsp; Something is very wrong.&nbsp; At this point, as I understand it, I can't purchase games until the download is made available to the public in November.&nbsp; This saddens me greatly.&nbsp; Something
 went wrong somewhere.&nbsp; It would be nice if that would at least be acknowledged.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;Zappy,<br />
<br />
If you're sure your account wasn't downloaded to a beta dashboard console then you'd want to check your transaction history&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://commerce.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>. The only other possibility that I can think of if you didn't download
 your profile at a friends or family members house that has the beta update is that someone has your account information has done that. The only way to have your points converted to currency at this point in time is if someone has recovered your account onto
 a dashboard beta console.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, this does mean that you'd need to wait until this update is made available to the public sometime later this year (Fall 2013). You can ask your friends/family to see if any of them have the dashboard beta update so you can make purchases on their
 consoles for the time being and then download the content on your own console using the download history (Dashboard &gt; Settings &gt; Account &gt; Download History)</p>

<p>I myself, like many others have also had problems and I know its not really helpful in any way i would like to say Microsoft do listen and are working thier hardest to get everything ready for the new dashboard.</p>

<div>
<p><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time
<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure: </span>
<a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<br />
<br />
If the System Restore doesn't work, do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator.<br />
<br />
Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s)
 using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><span>.<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a cause.</span></p>
<p><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer&nbsp;(Start
 / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event Viewer).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic40108.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/forums/topic40108.html</span></a><span>.<br />
<br />
You could be infected with malware.&nbsp; <span>
While in <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Safe Mode</span> with networking (click repeatedly on F8 during the boot process) and try to run anti-malware programs.&nbsp;To fix this problem (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp; install, and run the following two programs:
</span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;and
</span><span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span><span><a href="http://www.pandasoft.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>www.pandasoft.com</span></a></span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials
</span><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/default.aspx</span></a></span><span>&nbsp;(with
 the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). Reboot after completing all the scans.<span>&nbsp;
</span>You may also want to try the free OneCare at <a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/default.htm</a> and let it run all the options because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span><br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/88236-repair-install-vista.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;along
 with the upgrade from an earlier version of Windows section of the following: </span>
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918884" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/918884</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. If the other procedures don't work, THIS one is almost certain to work.&nbsp; You may have a lot of updates to re-install
 (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the system cane with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:
</span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></a><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hopefully one of these procedures will resolve your problem.&nbsp; If not, post back and we'll try something else.&nbsp; Post back in any case so we'll know how it turned out.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 7 - CAPI2 and root certs update &#40;Error 4107&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>Hi - I'm getting this error as well (full text below) - I've searched for every possible combination of words to try and find and answer to this issue - I've turned CAPI2 loging on but the results don't really help - I've tried almost every fix listed but
 with no improvment.</p>
<p>The core of the problem as I see it is that Microsoft have released a damaged or otherwise unusable .stl file - and no-one appears to be prepared to give a straight answer as to what to do about it - Confusingly the error reported by CAPI2 is that the certificate
 is outside its validity period however if you actually download and extract the file the error given is that the cert used to sign the .stl file is not valid for the requested usage - which is it MS as the time stamps look right to me !</p>
<p>For the record I'm running Windows 7 Enterprise 32 bit with IE8</p>

<h2>            Outlook 2007 sometimes -for hours or days - hangs when I click any message or folder</h2>
                    &nbsp;
<p>I’m having all kinds of grief with Outlook 2007 hanging up. &nbsp;This problem comes and goes randomly. &nbsp;I wonder if you might have any ideas?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's my configuration:</p>
<ul>
<li>I connect to an Exchange server via VPN (RAS). </li><li>I use a local PST as the default store. </li><li>In addition to my Exchange account, I also have another "additional mailbox" open (it's a shared mailbox on the Exchange server).
</li><li>I have a very fast connection - about 15-20 MBps </li><li>I'm running Windows XP SP3. </li></ul>
<p>I know - it's a complex configuration, but most of the time, Outlook is very fast - so I know it can and does work well.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I can't figure out is that sometimes, a problem occurs in which Outlook hangs, or just takes a long time to respond when I click any message or folder. &nbsp;It's like someone throws a switch that causes a very different performance
 behavior. It’s as though Outlook forgets my credentials and needs to keep checking with the Exchange server for every action.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the problem happens, if I click Cancel Server Request, Outlook is fine for about 10 seconds, and then it slows down again. If I click Work Offline on the File menu in Outlook, Outlook runs fine. If I try to run Outlook in
 Online mode again, it starts hanging again. This problem occurs if I am Ras’d in or if I’m working offline using RDP over Http.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other times, most of the time, Outlook is fine – it’s very fast. It runs great, and then bam – for no apparent reason, it starts hanging again. When the problem happens, it can last a day or two or only just a few hours. It’s a
 major pain though. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s what I’ve tried – none of these have resolved the problem:
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Change the VPN</p>
<p>Disable all add-ons</p>
<p>Run Outlook /safe</p>
<p>Run Outlook /cleanrules&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Run outlook /cleanprofile </p>
<p>Delete everything here: C:\Documents and Settings\v-dgit\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Outlook</p>
<p>Built a new profile</p>
<p>Run PST repair tool on the PST</p>
<p>Detect and Repair on Office</p>
<p>Uninstall/Re-install Office</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nothing resolves the problem. The problem is there, and then suddenly, for no apparent reason, Outlook starts working properly again. Then a day later, it happens again.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only thing that seems to affect the problem (when it happens) is to click
<b>Cancel Server Request</b>, or click <b>Work Offline</b> on the <b>File</b> menu in Outlook.
</p>
<p>This suggests that it’s directly related to Outlook trying to communicate something to or from the Exchange server.
</p>
<p>Could it be an issue with my corp user account being corrupted? Maybe Outlook is trying to verify my credentials?
</p>
<p>Why would this problem stop and then start again for no apparent reason?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m considering flattening the box, but that seems extreme for an issue that seems suspiciously as though it is server related.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I finally have a logical answer on why Outlook performance tanks when I add a second account as an additional account in Outlook (piggy-backed onto a personal account).</p>
<p>The key issue is that Outlook can only run “Cached mode” for one account. (Cached mode means that all the email is initially downloaded to an .OST file (similar to a .PST file). and changes are made gradually, using few resources.)</p>
<p>When you add a second account, the main account runs in cached mode, and the second account runs in online mode.&nbsp; In online mode, mail is not cached locally – everything is accessed in real time over the network. This is very slow if the second account is
 big.</p>
<p>Workable solutions:</p>
<p>One option is to have a second computer running so that you can run two Outlook accounts – not entirely practical though.</p>
<p>Another option is to have two profiles in Outlook – one for each Outlook account. That’s not terrific though, because you have to log off and on to switch back and forth.</p>
<p>The best solution that I’ve found is to run Outlook in a virtual machine that accesses the second account exclusively. Because the virtual Outlook runs in cached mode with an .OST, the performance is actually pretty good.</p>
<p>I then run Outlook from the host machine to access my own account.</p>
<p>I’m running the Outlook virtual machine in “XP mode” so that I only see the Outlook window instead of seeing the entire guest operating system with Outlook running inside a window. This is working very nicely, and it’s pretty cool to see two Outlook windows
 running side by side monitoring two completely different Exchange accounts!</p>
<p>Windows XP Mode (a form of Virtual PC specifically created for Windows 7) is available here:</p>

    <title>Problems with mouse selection - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jlstep6  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems with mouse selection</h2>
                    I recently replaced my mouse from I believe a GE mouse to a Logitech mouse.&nbsp; I am often copying data from a MSHA website.&nbsp; Prior to the mouse change I was able to select exactly what I wanted from the website.&nbsp; Now, when I select what I want and move down
 the page to select what is not showing or move the cursor too far to the right towards my scroll bar, the mouse selects everything all the way to the beginning of the page.&nbsp; If I only select items that are visible within the window and do not have to move
 down the page, then it is fine (nothing additional is unintentionally selected).&nbsp; I have tried to replicate the issue with other websites and it is hit or miss.&nbsp; Some will have the same problem while other will not.&nbsp; This is a major inconvenience for me because
 I have to delete all additional information and am unable to select only what I want when it involves information outside of my window view.&nbsp; Please let me know if anyone else is having this problem or has a solution.&nbsp; Neither CTRL or Shift keys are being
 held or pushed during selection, on the mouse is being used.&nbsp; Also, I used a Microsoft mouse that was having the same problem.<br />

            If that is the case, then why did I not have the problem with the previous mouse?&nbsp; Also, I asked a coworker of mine to see if he could replicate my issue with his computer and mouse on the same website and he did not have the issue I am having.&nbsp; Doesn't
 sound like it is the websites problem.<br />

            It just depends where you begin your drag and where the &lt;DIV&gt; sections in the underlying HTML code is.&nbsp; Some are easier than others to hit the sweet spot. But I do assure you, there's nothing you can do differently or set differently on your PC.&nbsp; You might
 try using a different browser though.

            What is the complete error message, and what file is indicated as being corrupt?&nbsp; Although it may in fact be advisable to run chkdsk, you should be aware that sometimes chkdsk can cause data loss.<br />
<br />
It's spelled chkdsk.<br />
<br />
To use it, click Start, then click Run.&nbsp; In the "Open" box, type the following and then click OK<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chkdsk /f<br />
<br />
A black Command Prompt window will open with the following message:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>The type of the file system is NTFS.<br />
Cannot lock current drive.<br />
<br />
Chkdsk cannot run because the volume is in use by another<br />
process.&nbsp; Would you like to schedule this volume to be<br />
checked the next time the system restarts? (Y/N) </blockquote>
<br />
Type Y and then reboot the computer.&nbsp; Chkdsk will run after the reboot, before Windows starts.<br />
<br />
The following information is from official XP documentation, but&nbsp; take the comment about the length of time things may take with a grain of salt (it might be true for "millions of files" but not for a 70 GB drive):<br />
<br />
<br />
<blockquote>
<p>Fixing disk errors </p>
<p><b>Chkdsk</b> corrects disk errors only if you specify the <b>/f</b> command-line option.
<b>Chkdsk</b> must be able to lock the drive to correct errors. Because repairs usually change a disk's file allocation table and sometimes cause a loss of data,
<b>chkdsk</b> sends a confirmation message similar to the following:</p>
<p>10 lost allocation units found in 3 chains.</p>
<p>Convert lost chains to files?</p>
<p>If you press <b>Y</b>, Windows saves each lost chain in the root directory as a file with a name in the format File<i>nnnn</i>.chk. When
<b>chkdsk </b>finishes, you can check these files to see if they contain any data you need. If you press
<b>N</b>, Windows fixes the disk, but it does not save the contents of the lost allocation units.</p>
<p>If you do not use the <b>/f</b> command-line option, <b>chkdsk </b>sends a message if a file needs to be fixed, but it does not fix any errors.</p>
<p>If you use <b>chkdsk /f</b> on a very large disk (for example, 70 gigabytes) or a disk with a very large number of files (for example, millions of files),
<b>chkdsk</b> might take a long time (for example, over several days) to complete. The computer is not available during this time because
<b>chkdsk</b> does not relinquish control until it is finished.</p>
</blockquote>
<br />
P.S.&nbsp; Even if chkdsk finds "lost allocation units" and converts them to files, I have never seen any useful data in the files created by chkdsk.<br />
<br />
<br />
