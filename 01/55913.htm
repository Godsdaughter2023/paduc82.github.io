<h2>            Xbox Ambassadors</h2>
                    <p>I got suspended once for communications started by another player harrassing me after reporing&nbsp;and blocking them. I've been trying to become an Xbox Ambassador but I cannot complete the process because of tbis old suspension. Will I ever be able to become an ambassador? This player complained and repeatedly sent me messages jist because I defeated him fairly in a game and I tried to repeal the suspension but I wasnt heard. I got the hammer and now I cannot benefit from the ambassadors program. Isn't there like parol or anything I can get for good behavior lol.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>You can see the date on the file is a little old (2012) and there might be a newer version available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have an MSI motherboard, there is a help page on their site that lets you download the latest version and also tells you how to disable the Killer Network Manager - maybe for a test to see if your system still crashes under the same conditions
 when it is disabled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can read some about that here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://service.msicomputer.com/msi_user/support/techfaqdetail.aspx?formid=3082" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://service.msicomputer.com/msi_user/support/techfaqdetail.aspx?formid=3082</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can recreate and reproduce the crash anytime you want by doing a certain thing (like playing a game) then after installing the latest drivers (or disabling the KNM) you can go through the same test to see if the system crashes again under the same
 circumstances.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might also find other users in the world that can help you with this specific problem in the MSI Support Community which you can find here:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://register.msi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://register.msi.com/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>That might be a good place to look for help since your problem doesn't appear to be with a Windows file.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes it is a good idea to look at more than one dump file to spot a pattern of failure so after making sure the drivers are current, if you have more you can upload them for a peek.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do let us know how you get on.</p>

    <title>USB Wireless Network Adapters don&#39;t work with my desktop PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> euanhamilton  say:</h3>
<h2>            USB Wireless Network Adapters don&#39;t work with my desktop PC</h2>
                    After experiencing multiple issues with bad connections etc with my internet, I assumed that a drop in connection to my desktop PC was down to the router/ISP etc. When trying to connect to my home network, Windows would constantly give me messages saying
 it was unable to connect to the network. Usually, a restart of my PC would fix this and it would be fine.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, after ordering some RAM to upgrade my PC with, I had a quick look in my PC to see where it actually goes. I had to move a few wires here and there to get a clear view, but I was extremely gentle, and I assume that I couldn't have broken/damaged
 anything seeing as you would need to move wires etc to get into the other parts of the hardware. I put my PC back together and ever since then, I have found it impossible to connect to my network using my USB wireless adapter.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have tried everything possible that I could think of:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- Restarting PC</div>
<div>- System restore to the earliest possible point where the adapter was working</div>
<div>- Uninstalling and re-installing the driver for the USB adapter</div>
<div>- Disabling the wireless connection and then re-enabling it</div>
<div>- Checking to see if the USB adapter works in a different PC (it did)</div>
<div>- Using a different USB adapter that I know to be working (still didn't work in my PC)</div>
<div>- Creating my own network profile (with the same SSID and password as my home network) and trying to connect to that manually.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Absolutely NOTHING has worked for me, apart from at one point it couldn't even identify any networks to connect to. Apart from that one time, it has ALWAYS shown my home network as being available to connect to, but has always failed. I can provide screenshots
 if necessary, but I'm completely stumped.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The WiFi works on multiple phones, laptops and on the desktop PC downstairs which has a USB adapter in it. I have tried my own USB adapter in the downstairs PC and it works flawlessly, and the original USB adapter from the downstairs PC does not work in
 my own PC either.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Completely lost. I fail to believe that I have damaged something inside the PC itself as I was extremely careful and didn't physically move anything apart from a couple of wires (which were protected and rather thick, not something I would think could
 be damaged easily). Any help would be appreciated, I'm not the most computer-literate person around, but I will try anything, save a fresh re-install of Windows 7 (because I don't have a disc).</div>
                </div>

            <p>&nbsp;I think I'd look at Device Manager to see if your network adapter is OK.&nbsp; To get to Device Manager click Start and right-click Computer.&nbsp; Then click Properties -&gt; Device Manager.&nbsp; Click to the left of where it says Network adapters and see if there's a
 yellow exclamation or question mark there.&nbsp; If so, that's your problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I assume you properly grounded yourself when you were probing around inside your PC.&nbsp; When chips have millions of circuits in them, a very tiny current you can't feel can cause damage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;I hope this helps.&nbsp; Good luck.</p>

            Hello there, thank you for the quick response! I've never really dabbled in the whole hardware thing, so I took EVERY precaution possible, including the grounding glove/mat/the whole business (I wasn't taking chances!) so hopefully all is well in that
 department.
<div><br />
<div>As far as device manager goes, it says the device is working properly etc for both the adapters I have tried, and I can see no visible issue/exclamation mark so i presume the PC thinks the adapter is ok?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Small update though: currently, the device is connected to my home network with no problems. I had the second adapter in initially, and all of a sudden it connected to the home network (when I put in the password, it just worked for whatever reason) and
 as a test, I turned my computer off, then back on again and it was back to not being able to connect to the network (though showing it was available to connect to).</div>
<div><br />
<div>I uninstalled the driver, and then installed the driver for the original adapter to see if that worked and it eventually connected too, but not before the usual issues cropped up. As I type this, it is still connected, with a strong connection and a good
 speed (so I guess it's kind of fixed), but I'm worried that a restart/shut down and power up will just set it off again.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sorry I can't be more clear - to me this sounds like some sort of configuration issue, and not damage per se to the hardware of the computer? All the readings suggest that the hardware and the device is working fine and installs fine, but the connection
 just doesn't want to work sometimes. Completely confused!</div>

            <p>&nbsp;Well if you haven't been confused by a computer lately, you just haven't spent enough time around them!&nbsp; :-)&nbsp;&nbsp; Personally I think they're female, but for some strange reason women don't seem to agree about that.&nbsp; :-)</p>
<p>Is it possible you could've picked up a virus or some form of malware?&nbsp; You could boot to Safe Mode and check.&nbsp; I recommend Safe Mode because some viruses can hide in normal mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Another thing you could try would be to go into Device Manager and uninstall the network driver(s), then reinstall.&nbsp; It does sound like you could have something scrambled in this area.&nbsp; I've seen it happen, and networking is a rather mysterious area anyway.&nbsp;

            Double checked with Safe Mode (good suggestion, hadn't thought about that!) and everything seems clean. Also disabled/enabled the device multiple times but it doesn't seem to change anything :/
<div><br />
<div>Turned the PC on this morning and the internet worked fine. Turned it off afterwards, then back on again and we're back to square one! Same connection issues, despite the device working properly and being able to see my Home network. Still as confused!</div>

            Hi Kelly
<br />
<br />I noticed an updated driver was released for this model in February of 2019:
<br /><a href="https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/nb/DriversForWin10/Audio/Audio_Realtek_Win10_64_VER6018564_Logo.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://dlcdnets.asus.com/pub/ASUS/nb/DriversFo...</a>
<br />
<br />I recommend you download and install it.
<br />
<br />Other things you can try....
<br />
<br />What is the exact make and model?
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: system information
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Click System summary
<br />Look in the right pane
<br />
<br />Copy the system sku info into reply here.
<br />
<br />See example: <a href="https://imgur.com/qzektpA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://imgur.com/qzektpA</a>
<br />
<br />First, run the Playing audio troubleshoot - open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Playing audio
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart your computer then check if audio is working again.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Sound, video and game controllers
<br />
<br />Right click your audio adapter
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Driver tab
<br />
<br />Is there an option rollback?
<br />If so, click it.
<br />
<br />Also, check to make sure the audio driver is fully updated. This is often the problem when you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10. Sometimes reinstalling the latest available driver from the manufacturers website helps.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: change sound card
<br />Hit Enter
<br />Select the Playback
<br />Right click your Speakers
<br />Click Set as Default Device if it isn't already
<br />
<br />Select your speakers
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click the Levels tab
<br />Use the slider to adjust level
<br />
<br />Other options:
<br />
<br />1. Play a youtube video with the soundcard speaker jack unplugged and let it play through the laptop's inbuilt speakers.
<br />2. While it is playing, plug in the audio jack and see if it starts playing. 
<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately that driver didn't seem to resolve things or the audio troubleshooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The make and model of the computer are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Manufacturer<span> </span>ASUSTeK COMPUTER INC.</p>
<p>System Model<span> </span>UX390UAK</p>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>There is no rollback option for the driver.&nbsp; The only option is to completely uninstall the driver and go with a standard high definition driver.&nbsp; That gets the audio playing from all speakers but not at the same quality as the machine used to have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the reply on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kelly</p>

<br />This is a bug that the Windows Engineers might not be aware of.
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:

<h2>            My photos &#40;.jpeg&#41; are opening in Wordpad</h2>
                    <p><u><strong>Correction s/b Wordpad</strong></u></p>
<p>My photos (.jpeg) are opening in Wordpad as code instead of one of the photo programs. I can open them individually once they are saved (right click and then 'open with'), but that does not solve the overall problem, which is how to change the defaults to
 the correct programs. Using Windows 7 with Outlook 2010.</p>

If it came preinstalled on your computer, you might need to reinstall from the recovery discs that might have come with the computer. Some applications that come preloaded with the computer can only be reinstalled if you reinstall the system software. Considering
 that is not a practical option, you might want to consider looking for an alternative.

<h2>            The Walking Dead&#58; Survival Instinct - 29th March 2013 &#40;Too early&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I don't know about ya'll, but the first time I read the release date I was in a bit of a shock and worried because 29 March 2013 is a pretty early date and we're not that far away from March 2013, which makes me wonder if the game is going to be a quality
 survival game, or rushed to be released on the 29 March 2013.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>That alpha gameplay footage is extremely disappointing, but hopefully there'll be a final gameplay footage published and, maybe a demo too (wouldn't count on it, though).</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>The <em>Launch Date Trailer</em> didn't even have any gameplay shown, sadly.</p>
<p>-</p>

<p>I could be wrong, but I think the original Walking Dead episodic series was all finished before they released the first one on the marketplace. So they have had a while to get this one done as well.</p>

<p>it's walking dead, i'll kick myself if i don't give it at least a rent. but to answer the question, yes, i think march is way too early given the footage we've seen so far. there hasn't been any kind of promotion outside the previously mentioned lackluster
 footage, that can't bode well for a game coming out in about 2-3 months.</p>

<p>I don't think it's possible for this game to impress me after playing The Walking Dead (XBLA). Plus all the footage, etc. I've seen looks awful. As a Walking Dead fan I'll rent this one but my expectations are LOW.</p>

            Hi Joao,
<br />
<br />I recommend that you do as follows:
<br />1) Go to the Chrome settings menu - click on Advanced - scroll down to find 'use hardware settings when available' and turn this Off. After that, re-launch Chrome.
<br />If the problem persists, follow the steps below:
<br />2) Try resetting Google Chrome browser.

<h2>            Do you want to copy file without its properties</h2>
                    I am trying to transfer an embroidery design using my digitizng software to a USB Stick.&nbsp; The embroidery design stitch is JEF and the software is Janome DigitizerPro.&nbsp; I am getting the "without properties" popup.&nbsp; I have gone ahead and transferred to the
 stick but there is no design there when I try to put it on my machine to sew out the design.&nbsp;&nbsp;I am only encountering this problem when doing a design for a large hoop.&nbsp; I have no trouble with smaller hoop designs and am using the same USB sticks I have always
 used.&nbsp; I read the similar problem others were having but the language is too technical for me to decipher.

    <title>One Drive Syncing and icon in taskbar - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> iansikora  say:</h3>
<h2>            One Drive Syncing and icon in taskbar</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Having some trouble with syncing OneDrive on my PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have uploaded files to OneDrive on another PC, and they are accessible from OneDrive online (email login), but a previously working sync to file explorer on my main PC cannot see them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On going through some sync diagnosis, my main PC doesn't seem to be syncing.&nbsp; I have tried a number of tips from this forum and still not getting anywhere.&nbsp; I have tried taskbar settings and changing which icons appear, but OneDrive is not listed here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think this has happened following a recent big windows update (1803?).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help appreciated.</p>
<p />

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
1. Is that an issue only with .txt extension or other file types?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Method 1.</strong><br />
If you're having problems locating specific files, folders, or other items on your computer, try using the Search and Indexing troubleshooter to fix the problem. It makes sure that the Windows Search service is running, and checks to see whether you have the
 correct permissions to search all the directories on your computer.</div>
<div>Refer to the article below for steps and additional information.<br />
<strong>Open the Search and Indexing troubleshooter<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Search-and-Indexing-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Search-and-Indexing-troubleshooter</a></div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2.</strong><br />
Also I would ask you to <strong>re-index </strong>the files and then check. Follow the artticle below for steps.<br />
<strong>Change advanced indexing options</strong><br />

<p><strong>Methods 1 and 3<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>Been there, done that, didn't work.&nbsp; In my experience the features of this type in Windows 7 are all muppet-level; they're not any use for anyone who would have checked the obvious (i.e. that the service is running and that files that contain the
 text that I'm searching for are indexed and are turning up in search results).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yes, also done that some time ago, but it is not relevant here.&nbsp; As my question makes clear the problem is finding TOO MANY search matches.&nbsp; Perhaps you didn't read my original question and just decided to cut and paste some text from the MS help
 site here instead?<br />
</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>To reiterate:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Search for simple stuff is working.&nbsp; .TXT files are indexed.&nbsp; I can search for them by content.&nbsp; The problem is that quoted search expressions aren't handled correctly.</strong></p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>It appears the the Windows Search function is working successfully.&nbsp; You are successfully capable of searching for your files by name as well by content.&nbsp; If by any chance there is a documents that contains a phrase or statement that is quoted.&nbsp; You should
 be able to type a portion of the data from the document in the search box and the file that contains that data should populate.&nbsp; However, you want to ensure the quotes are included within the document as well.</p>
<p>For Example:&nbsp; The work document that you have contains this information verbatim "30,30".&nbsp; When performing your search, please type you inquiry are you see it on the document.&nbsp; In addition, it would help if you type a portion of the sentence that contains
 the quoted expression.</p>
<p>The links below may prove beneficial for obtaining a resolution for your inquiry regarding your search.&nbsp; In addition, create an alternate user account and verify if you are able to search under an alternate account.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>No, in error any file containing "30" seems to be found.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am not sure what the relevance of the "http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/desktopsearch/technicalresources/advquery.mspx" page is.&nbsp; There is nothing there that describes searching for search strings containing commas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Findstr" does find only strings containing commas (hurrah!) but doesn't use the index doesn't seem to support searching more locations than the current directory.&nbsp; I've been using Cygwin's ports of "find" and "grep" to do the searches that Windows search
 can't, but with no index obviously they're much slower.&nbsp; What I was looking for was a solution using Windows Search that did use the index.</p>

    <title>Corrupt driver prevents booting in safe mode and every other - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Corrupt driver prevents booting in safe mode and every other configuration I&#39;ve tried</h2>
                    Hi my laptop was booting Windows 7 x64 and while at the "Starting Windows" black boot screen I plugged in a Rocketfish bluetooth key fob and it apparently corrupted a driver. Now I can no longer boot into windows and I have tried everything I can think
 of. The system repair ran (both off of auto repair and my win7 install disk) and said the problem is a corrupt driver but it can't fix it. The HDD is fine. Chkdsk came back with no problems. Booting using the last successful configuration fails. Booting to
 any of the safe modes fails at classpnp.sys (or least that's the last text that appears on the screen). And lastly disably auto restart on system boot failure so that it kicks to BSOD only gives the error message "verification of KnownDLL failed" and some
 error codes (0xc21a I think it was). Is there any other way to fix it? I have a thumb drive with windows installed on it that I can boot from, is there a way to figure out what the corrupt system file is and fix it from that?

            Here you go:<br />
1. Set your BIOS so that it uses the DVD drive as its primary boot device.<br />
2. Boot the machine with your Windows 7 Repair CD.<br />
3. Press a key if prompted to boot from the DVD.<br />
4. Select "Repair PC" from the menu.<br />
5. Select Repair when prompted.<br />
6. Select System Restore when prompted.<br />
7. Set Windows back to a point before this problem occurred.<br />
8. When finished, remove the CD before rebooting the system.<br />
In Step 2 you could also use your Windows 7 installation DVD. The subsequent steps are similar to the ones above.<br />

<h2>            LX-3000 headset microphone stopped working after unplugging it</h2>
                    I unplugged my headset briefly and plugged it back in later. The playback is working fine and all, but the only thing that's wrong with it is that the microphone has stopped working and after playing with some of the sound device settings, that being the
 "Level" tab in the recording device tab inside the sound device manager. it did work, but only as static. I've checked to confirm the mute button is off and that the headset has been set as default device in both the system and in my applications. I am using
 Windows 7 64-bit. Thanks in advance

<p><span>First test your Lx-3000 headset microphone on another Windows 7 computer to check whether the same issue exists.</span></p>

<p>Hi Anwesh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The life support of Money Plus Sunset Deluxe has already ended although it is still available for download. As you can see, this product was mainly supported with the earlier versions of Windows limited to Windows 7, Windows Vista, and Windows XP accordingly.
 You may still use the program under the latest versions through <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/15078/windows-make-older-programs-compatible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
compatibility mode</a>, although support is no longer guaranteed since this is already included on our legacy products.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are looking for alternatives, we believe that the best recommendation for you is to use MSN Money instead. Although it is in an online platform, it is most reliable for your financial management needs. For more information, you can visit Welcome to

    <title>What happened to the button for navigating up one directory level&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            What happened to the button for navigating up one directory level&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>What happened to the "up a level" button in Windows Explorer that was available in XP? If I open, for example, 'C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows' directly from the address bar, what's the fastest way to get back to 'C:\ProgramData\Microsoft'? The folder
 tree on the left does not seem to automatically expand to my current directory like it did in XP, and without the "up a level" button, I find I am always manually paging through the tree on the left to find my current folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Adam</p>

<p>Microsoft removed the "Up" button from Windows Explorer, you must click on the folders in the address bar as KJBlake described.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<br />
<p>Unfortunately when Microsoft redesigned Windows Explorer they made some pretty horrendous decisions - of which many people have complained about. There are many other file managers available, both free and for a price. One of them might be easier to use
 and have the features you want, here is a list of most that are available:<br />

<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Most important features to fix or return to Windows Explorer:</span></strong>
<p>1) The option to disable Auto Arrange.<br />
<br />
2) Fix The Left Pane Scroll Bug: If you are viewing a folder and expand it in the left pane to show it's subfolders, the folder is annoyingly auto-scrolled to the bottom of the pane causing the subfolders to not be shown, making it difficult to work with. Double
 clicking a folder in the left pane can also cause this problem.&nbsp; <strong><a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/WindowsServerFeedback/feedback/details/621426/bug-when-expanding-folders-in-explorer-server-2008-r2-and-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Vote to fix it.</a>
</strong><br />
<br />
3) When multiple files are selected they should stay selected when changing the sorting order (ex: Name to Size). Maintaining selected files when sorting should be a requirement and this feature should not have been removed.<br />
<br />
4) The option to remember each folder's view settings (remembering individual folder window sizes and positions).<br />
<br />
5) The option to remove "Full row selection" for details view. "Full row selection" is very annoying when the folder is full and has no empty space to click on. Also, when dragging/dropping files to a different folder - if you release the file on the row of
 a subfolder or .exe/.zip/.rar file "full row selection" causes the file to be moved into the subfolder or .exe/.zip/.rar file rather the the intended folder.<br />
<br />
6) A search window with all the advanced search options. No syntax required.<br />
<br />
7) The option to always show free disk space and folder size in the status bar and/or details pane. Also always automatically show the size of selected files (when many files are selected it will not show the total size).<br />
<br />
8) The option to scroll the pane your mouse is in with mouse wheel even if that pane is not selected.</p>

<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Let Microsoft know you want Windows Explorers features returned:</span></strong>
<p>Since many people seem to agree that some or all the changes made to Windows Explorer have actually made it less user friendly, you can go to the Windows 7 Feedback page and (politely) let them know your suggestions for improving it:<br />

<p>Left pane scroll bug (and other fixes):</p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Using Classic Shell To Restore Some Features To Windows Explorer</span></strong>
<p>After installing the free <a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Classic Shell</a> you can customize Windows Explorer closer to how you want it, the quote below is just one way to do so.&nbsp;<a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/features.html#explorer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Click here</a> to see some of the options you can
 customize, and here is the&nbsp;<a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/faq.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">FAQ page</a> for Classic Shell.</p>
<blockquote>A solution which did work for restoring some features.
<p>1) Install the free&nbsp;<a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Classic Shell.</a> &nbsp;This is very customizable, and works as a mod for Windows Explorer rather than a full blown replacement. You didn't need to install the Classic Start Menu
 option, but you can if you want.<br />
2) Reboot the computer.<br />
3) Launch Windows Explorer (Start - Computer) and turn on "Always Show Menus" (Organize - Layout - check Menu Bar). This is just for configuration, you can turn it off again afterwards if you want.<br />
4) Right click on the menu bar and turn on the "Classic Explorer Bar". This adds a series of cut/copy/paste icons to Explorer. Crucially, it also adds the "Configuration" icon.<br />
5) Go into the configuration and from here you can tweak things to your heart's content. To kill the horrible Windows 7 folder-jumping, switch the "Navigation Pane Style" to Vista. You can even knock it back to XP mode if you want (this adds in the lines to
 the folder tree and adds a classic "+" icon for expanding folders). The Windows Vista style folder view looks pretty much the same as the Windows 7 view, but gets rid of the horrible jumping.<br />
6) Tweak any other settings you want.</p>
<p>After this, you can turn the toolbar and menus back off in Explorer if you wish. Windows Explorer looks largely the same, but folders no longer jump around.&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/WindowsServerFeedback/feedback/details/621426/bug-when-expanding-folders-in-explorer-server-2008-r2-and-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Vote
 for Microsoft to fix this bug.</a> </strong></p>
<p>Now, if only MS could code properly so that we don't have to mess with third party apps to get Windows to actually work properly...</p>

<h2>            Status Code&#58; 8015000a-00b96084-1ed9e66e out of the blue</h2>
                    So, i was just laying on my bed watching Two Best Friends Play Bloodborne on Youtube, then my internet cord pops out sp i plug it back in. After i come back online i get an update, so i do the update and it restarts my xbox. Problem is... When my Home
 screen loaded up, it was missing the Social Tab, so my friend invites me to a party so i can tell him about this, all of a sudden, a message pops up with the Status Code: 8015000a-00b96084-1ed9e66e. So, i guess its just an after update problem like always
 and decide to restart my xbox. Doesn't Work. I delete my account and redownload it. Still nothing. I turn off my xbox again. Nope. So I'm sitting here wondering, "why the heck is this happeneing?", so i go to my back-up account to see if the same things are
 happening. Heck yeah they are. So im guessing that whatever was in that update, *** up my system. I'd like the most professional help with this problem, it's really bugging me.

            I had the same problem. I discovered that the "Microsoft sign-in assistance..." service had been stopped. Go to your services (msconfig) and make sure that it is not stopped and has a tick mark next to it. After I activated it, I was able to sign on to
 my microsoft account and change my account back to the admin account. Everything worked like it was supposed to.

    <title>Skyrim Achievements Reset to 0&#47;50 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> faultymoose  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skyrim Achievements Reset to 0&#47;50</h2>
                    
<p>I was playing Skyrim a short time ago, turned my console off for about 15 minutes, then came back and reloaded the game. As the game was loading, a message popped up saying something about having played the game recently on another console (I'm not sure
 of the exact message, as I spammed the A button thinking it was going to ask me to select a storage device). I exited the game and checked that I everything was in order, but my Skyrim achievements had been reset from 22/50 to 0/50 and the Skyrim gamerscore
 from 360/1000 to 0/1000. My actual gamertag gamescore hasn't changed.</p>
<p>If I examine the Skyrim achievements panel, all 22 of the old achievements are highlighted as having been unlocked, even though the total says zero.</p>
<p>If I check my profile here on xbox.com, it continues to report the old achievement totals (22/50 and 360/1000), but my xbox still says 0/50 and 0/1000.</p>

<h2>            How do I find out my family&#39;s gamer tags&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    The problem is my kids have more than one Microsoft account so how can I easily check what gamer tag is associated with each account? One of my sons has £15 credit in an account he's not currently using so it would be useful to check which gamer tag this
 account is linked with.&nbsp;

<h2>            Change Microsoft Account to child account........</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I created a MS account for my 9 year old. I made a mistake (I think ) by not ticking it as a child account. I think I need to change it to a child account to add her to my family as a child. I'm not sure. I added her to my list in the child section but is
 marked as "NO DEVICES TO SHOW YET". when I double click into the settings, it says she "<span>is
 not currently associated with any accounts."</span></p>
<p><span>I don't know what that means
 or how to address it.</span></p>
<p><span>What have I done wrong?</span></p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Sean,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I understand that you have setup the Microsoft Account as a standard account instead of selecting Child account and hence you are not getting any information of the account.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suggest you to change the Family Safety setting of the account and see if it helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the steps provided under “<strong>To change someone’s Family Safety settings</strong>” in the article below to do so:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/set-up-family-safety#set-up-family-safety=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/set-up-family-safety#set-up-family-safety=windows-8</a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps, do let us know if you need further assistance with Windows.</p>

            <p>Hi Shrikar,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply. I had seen this solution but I don't think it applies in my case.</p>
<p>I had created my child's account with an email address. I can not create another account using that email.</p>
<p>I think all I can do is delete the MS account and start again. I understand I won't be able to use the email for 60 days so I will create a new email.</p>
<p>thank you</p>
<p>Sean</p>

<h2>            Win10 Creators Update stuck on &#34;Choose your keyboard layout&#34;</h2>
                    My win10 64 bit stopped in mid-use, powered off. Tried to restart and I now have "Choose your keyboard layout" with no keyboard or mouse usage. The Media Creation Tool did not work. Tried my USB Recovery disk, did not work either. Tried my WIN 10 Pro CD
 but that did not work. Suggestions.

<em>Yes, I have a recovery media but have not yet used it. None of the specific issues seemed to apply...upgrades, moving to a different computer. As I mentioned above, I believe I did not correctly tried the MCT since after download I did not run the application
 on the flash drive.</em></li><li><em>Regards,</em></li><li><em>Zoltan</em></li></ul>

            If a Windows operating system is preinstalled on your computer when you&nbsp; bought it, you can go ahead and use the recovery media that was created using this
<strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="Click here">link</a></strong>.
<br />
<br />
In addition, for steps on how to use the recovery media to reinstall Windows 10 on your computer, you can refer to
<strong>Using the tool to create installation media (USB flash drive, DVD, or ISO file) to install Windows 10</strong>.<br />
<br />
Feel free to post back for the results.<br />
<br />
Regards.

            <p>Ran the MCT and now at Windows Setup, with Install Now in the middle of the screen. Also, there is a "Repair&nbsp;your computer" option in lower left corner. I'm assuming since I already had Win10 Pro 64 bit installed, I should use the "repair" option?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

            You can run the <strong>Repair your computer</strong> option to repair Windows using the recovery media that you've created, and let us know if you need further assistance.<br />

            I ran this multiple times but there was no clearing the problem. I contacted a PC pro and he determined both my graphics card and hard drive needed to be replaced. There was no other solution. It seems the Creators update and my hardware failures were
 coincidental. Thank you for your help on this.
