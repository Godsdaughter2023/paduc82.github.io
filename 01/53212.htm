                    <span>
<p>on this forum, I have read instructions on how to fix my problem using Windows 7, but it does not address how to fix this problem with Windows XP.</p>
<p>I recently purchased a MacBook using OS 10.6. &nbsp;I have always been able to print wirelessly from my Dell laptop (Windows XP SP3) using a home office network where my printers (I actually have 3-I know, crazy!) are connected to my desktop Dell PC running Windows
 XP SP2. &nbsp;</p>
<p>My Mac can see the printer(s), and it when I tell it to print, it acts like it's printing, but nothing happens at the printer or desktop and the Mac then puts that printer on pause on the Mac.</p>
<p>The other posts indicated using LPD protocols, but, assuming this is how to fix it under Windows XP, I am not sure how to even activate LPD on XP.</p>
<p>Please provide a solution so I can print on a Brother, Epson or HP connected to my desktop PC from a Mac wirelessly. &nbsp;I have shared my printers on the desktop. &nbsp;I have installed the drivers on both the PC and the Mac.</p>
<p>Do I need to update to SP3?</p>

            I had told this to go under Windows XP forum, but it didn't change it. &nbsp;If one of the moderators can move this question to XP, that would be great!

<h2>            IE8 possibly hijacked, MS instructions don&#39;t work</h2>
                    <p>I have Win XPsp3 using IE8 and&nbsp;also Google.co.uk as my browser or home page?; In Internet options I get "Google.co.uk "which works.
</p>
<p>Instead of Internet Explorer 8 as default,I have in dropdown as my default.</p>
<p><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/?LinkID=9634754" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Http://go.microsoft.com/?LinkID=9634754</a> .
</p>
<p>I used&nbsp; to be able to swop from one to other by going from current to default. But I'am no expert and I begin to start to think I don't what I used to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I went to MS and followed these instructions</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Press <strong>CTRL+ALT+DEL</strong>, click <strong>Task Manager</strong>, and then click the
<strong>Processes tab</strong>. </p>
</li><li>
<p>Click <strong>IEXPLORE.EXE</strong>, and then click the End Process button. </p>
</li></ul>
<p>This closes all instances of Internet Explorer. Then you can re-open the program to continue browsing as usual. To help prevent future attacks, you should also have a pop-up blocker turned on.</p>
<p>To turn on the pop-up blocker in Internet Explorer 8 click the Tools button (the gear icon), point to
<strong>Pop-up Blocker</strong>, and then click <strong>Turn On Pop-Up Blocker</strong>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I tried to do this exactly; <strong>no </strong>iexplore.exe. tried again when the google browser open and there is iexplore.exe 36,876k mem use</p>
<p>But also another iexplore.exe saying 16,328k mem use. ie 2 iexplore.exe.</p>
<p>I do not understand</p>
<p>could someone explain simply</p>
<p>1] why didn't MS's instructions work?</p>
<p>2] why do 2 iexplore .exe appear when its open.?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any simple info would be apprciated&nbsp; </p>
<p>regards Fatzi</p>

            <p>Dear Srimadhwa</p>
<p>My Main Pc is a gerneric pc built by my local shop; , worked perfectly for 3 years.</p>
<p>Has WIN XP sp3 with IE8 ;security is Avira free;&nbsp; auto update.</p>
<p>MY usage is; power off if not in use.</p>
<p>No games, no iffy sites; no twitter facebook or whatever else there is.</p>
<p>connection Broadband Virginmedia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As All main providers are now changing&nbsp;how they present and want you to use &nbsp;their site to logon for all things. [Google totally ruined Picasa web mail] My virginmedia mail broadband trying to force&nbsp;me to google chrome ie. as using the gmail platform where
 it only seems to work as designed on chrome.</p>
<p><strong>NB. I have 2 PC,s same installs I only try new things on 2n</strong>d.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I&nbsp;am so glad I have always used &nbsp;OE6 to save my emails, simple and clean to save to my PC HD.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have quoted in&nbsp;above,&nbsp;from MS's article&nbsp;"Hijack"</p>
<p>If a tab is not open, iexplore.exe does not appear in Task manager. and if open there is &nbsp;just a nasty message of disasters that could happen to my PC, if I ended program now.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What am I the non tech supposed to do. I <strong>don't know</strong> if&nbsp;iexplore.exe&nbsp; should be in TM list;&nbsp;if its not open; so I just do What any sensible non tech does;; Nothing.</p>
<p>So why do MS's instructions not&nbsp;say whether IE8 should be open or closed,&nbsp;iexplore is&nbsp;not there&nbsp;if not running when&nbsp;you access thru Task manager as instructed.</p>
<p>Explanation please.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>XP ROCKS says below, "appears to be happening to a lot of people."</p>
<p>But still the original MS instructions should make sense to a non tech user. ie every step and what will appear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I blame the Big boys MS and Google changing at same time, how ever " things" talk to each other should not have been done at same time.
</p>
<p>Regards Fatzi</p>

<p>nitpicking I know. But How would I know, MS designed so I believe their ans to problem.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am going to monitor and wait for ans, if, as you say, happening to lots of people, hopefuuly a ? something will happen.
</p>
<p>As I can still access my emails and internet, its a good learning curve;&nbsp;&nbsp;I decided to learn</p>
<p>&nbsp;[ having been given a 2nd similar PC that i paid to have clean installed and more Ram added ]</p>
<p>to use my virgin webmail/gmail, which has far to many bells and whistles for a non tech. But the Big Boys decided they want to change so oldies like me have to learn to keep up.</p>
<p>Some day I will have to change to next version of Windows. but only when I have to.</p>

            I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Step 1: download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>

<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />There are some compatibility issues with Windows 10 version 1709 and older hardware. There is no explanation why a lot of these problems are happening in Windows 10 1709, but the release significantly flawed. Hardware that once worked in previous versions, just suddenly stops working in Windows 10 1709 after an upgrade loses functionality.

<h2>            I5&#8216;s &#34;turbo boost&#34; disabled after recovering from hibernation</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I got a laptop with i5 430m which works pretty well with win7's power plan at first place.</p>
<p>When I choose the "power saver", it'll low its frequency to 12xx MHz (from 2266 MHz), or reaches 25xx MHz at "high performance".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
But the problem is, after recovering from the hibernation, the highest frequency will be locked at 18xx MHz whatever you change the power plans.<br />
I've tried to log off and log in again, not works. Switch to a new user and change the power plans ,not works.<br />
The only way I found&nbsp; is to restart the computer.<br />
<br />
Have anyone have encountered the same problem?<br />
<br />
Any help will be appreciated~

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>1. Which application or a program are you using to measure the speed?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<div>This speed is generally not directly&nbsp;controlled by Windows but by drivers available&nbsp;for it.You may try updating the chipset drivers and the BIOS. You can contact the computer manufacturer to accomplish this. Also you may check with the Intel Support.</div>
Here is the link:<br />
<a href="http://communities.intel.com/community/tech/processors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://communities.intel.com/community/tech/processors</a></div>
<div><br />
<strong>Note: </strong></div>
<div>Modifying BIOS/complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS
 settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.<br />
<div>Hope this helps.</div>

<h2>            HELP&#33; Unwanted Revert To Backup&#33; LOST DATA&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Windows Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>About three days ago I booted up my PC which is running Windows 10 only to find that it had some how reloaded to a back up I had made in April of the year. I did not knowingly do anything to produce this effect and was not &nbsp;even aware that it was possible
 until three days ago. &nbsp;I have lost a lot of data and programs because of this unexpected change and I really need it back. I have no idea what happened and have probed Google for potential answers but no matter how I put my search terms I cannot seem to find
 anybody who has suffered the same problem. There seems to be plenty of help for people looking to recover backups but not anybody who is trying to un-recover one and get back data and programs. &nbsp;I am extremely frustrated because this has negatively impacted
 my ability to do work. Does anybody have even the faintest clue about what could have happened? Have I been hacked? Can I get my data and programs back or are they lost for good? If they can be recovered then how can I do that? It is literally like my computer
 decided to go back in time without my consent and screw me over in the process. Any help is very welcome because I am at wit's end.</p>

<p>What you report sounds extremely unlikely, if only because in April 2015 Windows 10 had not been released. You need to look at alternative explanations, e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>You're booting off a different disk</li><li>Your'e using a different machine</li><li>You have a multi-booting system</li><li>Someone playing a prank on you</li><li>An error in observation</li></ul>
<p>Your report about "lost" data suggests that you belong to the large group of people who defer the implementation of a robust backup process to an external device until they have suffered a major catastrophe. For most people it's the only effective incentive.</p>

            Well it would be April 2016 would it not? Was Windows 10 released then? I only say april because when I updated chrome the last web history was from April. So that seems like the time I must have made this backup. Although based on your response it seems
 like those other ideas might be worth exploring. Suppose I &nbsp;was booting off another disk or had a multi-booting system. &nbsp;Is it possible to do that unintentionally? I know very well that this is the same machine I have always used because the programs installed
 are programs I had installed around the apparent time of this back up and because it is the only PC I own. I'm not sure how someone would play a prank that would produce this kind of effect because unless I have gone completely insane then I know that it is
 the same machine and because I have a rather high attention to detail(although not an infallible one) which seems to suggest that I have not made an error in observation. So of the alternative explanations you suggest it seem

            <p>Sorry, my eyes read "April of the year" and my mind understood "April last year".</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are booting off a different disk then you need to consider who might have swapped the disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have a multi-booting system then you could tell by the number of partitions and their names as displayed by the Disk Manager (diskmgmt.msc).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your system really dropped back to April 2016 then the System branch of the Event viewer (eventvwr.exe) must show a huge gap between April and November 2016.<br />

<p>What do you see?</p>

            <p>Hey no problem it was my typo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what I think you are saying is that A) if I'm booting off a different disk then somebody had to have done it intentionally; which either means I did it accidentally, I've been hacked, or someone is actually playing a prank on me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>and B) if my computer did 'jump back in time' then there should be evidence of it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>and C) if I have a multi-booting system then I would know it.</p>

            Wow yeah there is a giant gap. It jumps right from 4/11/2016 @ 9:52pm to 11/20/2016 @ 9:53 pm. Then the next selection after the jump has a message saying that "There are 0x1 boot options on this system." and the one after that says &nbsp;"The bootmgr spent
 0 ms waiting for user input.". I'm not sure what that means though.

            <p>If the event recorder shows a gap between April and November of this year then it is safe to assume that your current Windows installation did not run during the months in between. I can think of the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>This is not the same PC as the one you used a week ago.</li><li>You do not use the same disk as the one you had in the machine one week ago.</li><li>You have a multi-booting machine.

<p>Ok so it would seem that the most likely bet is that I have a multi-booting machine. Is it possible to boot back to my 'normal' boot? Also is it possible for someone to do a system image recover remotely? I know for a fact that this is the same machine;
 the dents are in the right places and it is the exact same brand, make and model; besides I only have one. If I am running off a different disk would it have to be manually inserted or could it be done via keyboard? Btw thanks for all the help.</p>

<h2>            I can&#39;t change the power plan settings in Windows 7 64 bit.</h2>
                    I'm trying to change the power plan settings on my Windows 7 64 bit computer. I just installed Windows 7 over Vista Home Premium. I had the settings turned to "never turn off hard drive" so that I could get my files restored from an on-line provider. When
 I went into the power settings to change it back to sleep after a certain period I got a message that my power plan settings are not available. I tried creating a new power plan, but still got the same message. Is there a way to make those settings available
 again?

            <p>Hi Shalini, thanks for your reply. </p>
<p>The headsets work fine on WinXP - absolutely no issues.</p>
<p>Various headsets all exhibit problems on Win7, not just the Microsoft Lifechat but also Plantronics DA55 and DA60's.</p>
<p>There are several issues with controlling sound in Win7.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ten second delay in identifying headset</li><li>A limitation of 32 bits in the headset identifying string</li><li>Difficulties in controlling volume of microphone and speaker, when the mic volume is adjusted it is automatically put in to mute mode.</li></ul>
<p>Of these issues, the worst is the ten second delay in identification, this is unacceptable in an operational environment when running a call centre.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a clean build of Win7 with all drivers updated to the latest available.
</p>
<p>Win7 install attempted on various hardware, all with the same result.</p>
<p>All tested hardware configurations work 100% when running WinXP.</p>
<p>Check of event viewer logs etc. offers no indication of what may be causing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers - Derek.</p>

    <title>Font Size File Explorer Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Font Size File Explorer Windows 10</h2>
                    I am running Windows 10 Pro, 64 bit. All of my displays look good....I don't want to change anything. However, the font size in FILE EXPLORER is a little bit too large. In folders where I have lots of items, they tend to overlap one another at the top
 and bottom. This make it hard to read some of the file names. I don't know if the box that the file name appears in is too narrow, or the text is too large. I like the size of the text. If I could change the size of the box , that would be my choice. Can anyone
 help?? Thanks!!

            Thanks for your reply Robert. I am using the LIST view. In that view, the lists of files are slightly chopped off at the bottom of the file name. I can still read them, but this was not like this before....ever! It appears the text is a little too large
 for the line it appears on in the list. Just before this started happening, Microsoft did several automatic updates per day for about 2-3 days. &nbsp;This happened right after that. Additionally, in FILE EXPLORER, I now have several new popup menus at the top of
 the window that were not there before. These appear if I right click on a particular file type to do something. The&nbsp;menu that appears depends on which file I am trying to change. So far I have seen the following menus....SHORTCUT TOOLS, APPLICATION TOOLS&nbsp;and
 MUSIC TOOLS. Additionally,&nbsp;another problem has popped up since the updates took place. I have a folder with my music files in it. (large folder)&nbsp;If I open that folder and go down somewhere in the list to look at a

 automatically jump back to the beginning of the folder before I finish looking at the original file I went to. Also, the MUSIC TOOLS&nbsp;tab will pop up at the top of the window. &nbsp;I have to then go back to my file and try again, quickly, or it will jump back to
 the beginning file in the folder. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, I never had any of these issues...EVER!!... till the Automatic Updates installed . Very irritating!! Looks like Microsoft's effort to "help me with updates" caused more problems than it fixed!!&nbsp; I'm tempted to shut off the auto updates, but I'm afraid
 I cause myself more problems than it would fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Per your suggestion, I have already tried to make adjustments using the ADVANCED settings for DISPLAY. This didn't help either. Thanks again for your reply! I really appreciate your help.</p>

            <p>Ok, there seem to be multiple issues here that I'll try to address, but next time one per thread would be better.</p>

<p>What's your monitor resolution? Right-click on an empty space on your desktop and select Display settings towards the bottom of the context menu. Alternatively, you can go to Start menu &gt; Settings app (gear icon) &gt; System &gt; Display.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/34eed560-c138-4967-aca6-fc7198160d66" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/34eed560-c138-4967-aca6-fc7198160d66" /></a></p>
<p>Once there check the slider for the size of text, apps etc. - what is it set to? Try reducing the scaling a little and see if it helps.</p>

<p>These new context-specific tabs appear on the ribbon dynamically depending on the file type you select, and this has been a feature of File Explorer since the ribbon was introduced back in

This is a bug that was probably introduced in Win10 1607 (Anniversary Update) and hasn't been fixed by MS yet. Follow the instructions

            <p>Robert, my monitor resolution is a lowest point on the scale...100%. As far as the pop-up menus, I assure you they haven't appeared on my PC until recently, for whatever reason. I appreciate the info about the bug in the anniversary update. From what I read
 on the link you gave me, I have a couple of work-arounds that may solve this problem for now. You have been very helpful. Thanks again!!</p>

            <p>My PC was upgraded to Windows 10 Creators. &nbsp;Now font sizes are all wonky, some too large, most are too small. &nbsp;I tried to use your suggestion to adjust "<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">System -&gt; Display -&gt; Advanced display settings

<h2>            Xbox One Problems</h2>
                    My Xbox One has recently (last few days) been having issues, when my friends invite me to a party/game the invites will pop up on the Xbox App however not instantly on my xbox one. They can see my invites normally and thats how we've been playing together.
 &nbsp;Several minutes later their invites will pop up on my Xbox One. &nbsp;I also have been having issues viewing messages ( when I go to the messages screen it sais some of my messages may not pop up and if I click somebody it just forever loads until saying an error
 occurred). It isn't my Wifi as everything else in my house is fine and I have logged out and logged back into it on Xbox. &nbsp;I have tryed a Hard reset several times and have even unplugged it. Anybody know a solution?

</p><p>If not, since you already did a reset yoy can try removing and readding your profile.&nbsp; Also, you can check the status of Xbox Live for any alerts.<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status</a>.&nbsp;
 Right now there is an alert for Purchase and content.</p>

<p>Are you on the insiders programme by any chance?? I am aware that some insider tier builds have had this issue of late. If you are an insider member, you can report this issue via your console by holding down the Xbox guide button and selecting Report a
 Problem...</p>
<p>

<p>So if your an the Insider and have an insider build, you would have an app on your console called Xbox Insider Hub.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Within this app it will say if your console is currently enrolled. to view this, open the app and go to Settings in the left hand menu, then select Manage Devices. Your console will show up here if you are an active member running an insider OS build. You
 can choose to remove your console from the programme in this section of the settings also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Announcements section on the main page of the app, it tells you what Tier you are in, and you can press A on this to open the Xbox One Update Preview section. Click on Manage, and this is where you can potentially change your tier, that does depend
 on the tier your currently in though.&nbsp; you can also access this management menu by going to Insider Content, again in the left hand menu, and navigating right to the System Category, again select Xbox One Update Preview</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also Report a Problem direct to the Insider developers from within the left hand menu.&nbsp; The report will take a short DVR and screenshot of the last thing you did before going to report. I try to recreate my issue before hitting report so the devs
 can see my issue for themselves.</p>

<p>Hi&nbsp;<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/e899d75f-428d-457c-9fbf-b925b2a37f14" title="YourWorstCringe">YourWorstCringe</a>,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for updating us with your reply. If you're part of the Insider program, your console is likely receiving Preview Program updates. This means that traditional troubleshooting steps most likely will not be able to resolve your issue. You can find information
 regarding the Insider Program and check to see if you are enrolled via the support article&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/xbox-insider-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox Insider Program FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recommend that you report any issues that you're experiencing since the last update via the Insider's Hub app, either on your console or via PC. Alternatively, you can report this via the Insiders Subreddit page as well. All feedback is welcome as they
 are working to improve the next console update and your contribution would be super helpful so that the developers can hear your issue first hand to work on a fix. Bonus info: You don't have to be enrolled in the preview program to report issues via the Insider's
 Hub app.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - SOUNDS - Audio Device<br />
<br />
Write down description make and model - double click on it - drivers tab - write down version. Now<br />
Click UPdate Drivers which may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers. Then RIGHT<br />
CLICK on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;- REBOOT - this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
If your driver shows 06 you have the windows default and that is part of the issue.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site and get latest Sound/Audio drivers - Download - SAVE - go to where you<br />
put them - Right Click on - RUN AS ADMIN - Reboot <br />
<br />
Check the Version on Driver's tab in Device Manager as often sound drivers rollback and then finally install<br />
the current version. Reboot and check after each try, not unusual to have to run the driver 1-4 times or so.<br />
Just make sure the version you installed shows up in the driver's tab.<br />
<br />
Then go to Device Maker's site and look for even newer drivers and repeat install procedure.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
---------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
After updating driver.<br />
<br />
Right click Speaker near Clock -&nbsp;Recording Devices - right click in box - check Show&nbsp;Disconnected Devices
<br />
and Show Disabled Devices - check your mic - highlight them and then on lower right properties. Make<br />
sure the proper one is enabled and check other settings - on Levels tab make sure MUTE is unchecked<br />
and APPLY / OK changes.<br />
<br />
Also in Control Panel look for some Audio Manager (maybe named after sound driver maker). Mine<br />
is RealTek Audio Manager, yours can be entirely different name if you have one.<br />

<h2>            WINDOWS Backup &#38; Restore utility not recognizing my backup file</h2>
                    <div><strong>WINDOWS Backup &amp; Restore utility not recognizing my backup file</strong>
</div>
<hr />
<div>
<div>
<p>I periodically backup my data files which is on another hard drive than WIN7 OS so this backup is not a system image. Every time I do a backup I do a restore to a dummy partition to double check the backup was successful. Anyway, I recently tried to restore
 my backup from March 2014 &amp; the backup utility is not recognizing the file. It recognizes other backups so something must be off with this particular file.<br />
<br />
I checked &amp; it appears all of the catalogs &amp; zipped files are present. Is there another manner or 3rd party software I could restore this particular file? The file is just over 100 GB. I should add that I have transferred that file from one hard drive to another
 since last March, but transferring should not be a problem as far as I understand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried both the DSK MGR &amp; MACRIUM REFLECT. When I went to ATTACH VHD &amp; the popup dialog box to browse to the file it sees the file, but when I select it then it opens to the subfolders of the various backup set subfolders. When I select them the cascade
 of more subfolders is displayed. So that did not work or I am not executing the procedure correctly.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I do see the contents within WINDOWS EXPLORER, but how would I get the files to be assembled into the correct directory structure or organization as I had at that point in time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate any suggestions </p>

<p>
</p><p>"I have resolved the issue. It appears that for a new installation (reinstall of OS), it is necessary to set up backup to the same location the original backup is stored. After backing up the new installation to the same location as the older backups, the
 older backups are available to be applied."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I acted upon this with no avail.&nbsp; However,&nbsp; when I removed the older backup sets the new backup set became visible within the dialog box to select which backup to restore.&nbsp; When I then move the old backup sets to the mainPC folder again the new backup set
 disappears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect there is some kind of permission conflict that needs to be resolved to see all of the backups?</p>
<p>Anyone have intimate knowledge on this aspect of the restoration process?</p>

<p>I simplified it &amp; simply now working with&nbsp;a new one &amp;&nbsp;an old one.&nbsp; The new one is a small backup of an individual subdirectory within My DOCS directory to reduce the time of iteration.&nbsp; The large backup set is from last March.&nbsp; That backup set resides on
 a hard drive on another computer which I then transferred to a USB external drive to interface with the computer where I would do the restoration on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to transfer the new backup set to the other computer &amp; then put it on the external drive &amp; then restore it to the primary target computer to see if I could repeat the problem &amp; save on iteration time to diagnose the problem, but I was not able to
 replicate the situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I can replicate is that if I move the backup set folders of the old backup into the myPC backup folder the new backup is not detected by the BKUP &amp; RESTORE utility.&nbsp; When I remove the old backup folders the new backup set can be detected.&nbsp; So the media.bin
 file I guess is OK.&nbsp; My suspicion is permissions may be blocking the utility, but that is PURE speculation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way I did do an extraction of the files via 7-ZIP software so I know the files are present in the old backup set.&nbsp; Unfortunately, using 7-ZIP cannot reconstruct files larger than 200Mb so I have a number of fragmented files that need to be combined.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to figure out this problem so I do not lose any impending backups.</p>

<p>I conducted further experiments &amp; have finally been able to replicate the behavior.&nbsp; I created 2 backup files on 2 separate partitions.&nbsp; Then on 1 of the backups I deleted the mediaID.bin file.&nbsp; I then transferred both backups to another computer via REMOTE
 connection.&nbsp; On the 2nd computer I copied the 2 different backups to an external hard drive on 2 separate partitions.&nbsp; I then connected the external drive to the 1st computer &amp; started up the RESTORE procedure.&nbsp; The utility recognized 3 out of the 4 backup
 sets.&nbsp; The 1 backup set it did not recognize was the 1 on the external drive which has the mediaID.bin file.&nbsp; The other backup on the external drive is the replica of the backup on the 1st computer from which the mediaID.bin file was deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now I surmise that the mediaID.bin file for the 1 case has been rendered obsolete through this process.&nbsp; How can I rectify this?&nbsp; Simply deleting the mediaID.bin&nbsp; file did not result in detection of this 4th backup set.&nbsp; The MARCH, 2013 backup set still
 has its mediaID.bin file &amp; deleting it now will not resolve the situation.</p>

            <p>I resolved the problem.&nbsp; I rebuilt the mediaID per the procedure outlined by:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.howtogeek.com/forum/topic/little-known-error-for-windows-7-backup-and-restore</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following link describes a procedure which does the same thing (I think), but the procedure is far more tedious:</p>

<p>
</p><p>I posted a reply to that link asking if the same result is obtained by both procedures.&nbsp; Maybe future users will find the simpler procedure as effective &amp; certainly less tedious.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>What is the make and the model of the computer?</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>I would suggest you to boot the computer into BIOS and check if the correct date and time is set, refer this link to boot into BIOS:</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/BIOS-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/BIOS-frequently-asked-questions</span></span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>Modifying BIOS/complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent
 your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>You can also check with the computer manual to set date and time in BIOS.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Once you set the time and date correctly in BIOS boot the computer normally and follow the steps from the below link and check if it helps:</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Set the clock:</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Set-the-clock" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Set-the-clock</span></span></a></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>Change the display of dates, times, currency, and measurements:</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Change-the-display-of-dates-times-currency-and-measurements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Change-the-display-of-dates-times-currency-and-measurements</span></span></a></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>If this doesn’t help, then try creating an new user account and check if it helps, here is the link:</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Fix-a-corrupted-user-profile</span></span></a></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>If you still face the same issue even after creating new user account, then it might be possible that your BIOS battery is dead, so I would suggest you to contact the manufacturer.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span>&nbsp;<br />
Please respond</span><span> back</span><span> and let us know the status of the issue.</span></span></p>

            Hi ortmanl,<br />
<br />
You can definitely connect your VCR to computer and use movie maker to edit and burn it on to a DVD.<br />
<br />
Here are the steps that exactly explains what you need to do.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 1</strong> .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Read over your PC manual. This is to ensure that you have the proper hard drive space and RAM to capture video from your VCR to your computer. The minimal requirements that you should have is 10 gigs hard drive space and at least
 256 Megs of RAM. However, 512 are recommended for a faster transfer.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 2</strong> .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Decide on the type of video capture device that may suit your needs better. You can go the video capture card route. Most people choose this method because it the most functional. The USB cards are the simplest way to connect a
 VCR to your computer. They do not require installation and plugging your RCA cables directly into the device from your VCR is a breeze. A firewire is the faster method you can decide upon. It is also more reliable to get all of your videos copied smoothly
 to DVD.<br />
<br />
<strong>Step 3</strong> .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Purchase your video capture device. There are a couple of ways to do this. You can find local retail stores like Best Buy or Wal-Mart have some types of cards that you can explore in their store. Online retailers may give you more
 information about the card you are seeking. They could also be less expensive than local stores. However, you usually need to pay for shipping. Computer Geeks and NexTag may be your best bet when buying online. They have very low prices and a wide selection
 of the type of card you are looking for.<br />
<strong><br />
Step 4</strong> .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set up your video capture device. Since the product range varies, each method is different. You will need to follow all the instructions that come with your newly purchased device. Step by step instructions are presented to allow you to
 set up your VCR to computer project with ease.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />
