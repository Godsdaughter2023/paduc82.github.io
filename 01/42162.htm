<h2>            Error 0x80070002 when I try to create a system image backup</h2>
                    
<p>Since I replace the system disk of my system (partitions get copied from old disk), when I try to "Create a system image" from control panel, I get the popup message:</p>
<p>Windows could not find backup devices on this computer. The following information might explain why this problem occured:</p>
<p>The system cannot find the file specified (0x80070002)</p>
<p>Close Windows Backup and try again</p>
<p>....and the problem still there...how to fix this?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Perhaps the key lies in your remark "partitions get copied from old disk". How did you copy these partitions?<br />

            Is Easeus Partition Manager certified for Windows 7? I had some quite intriguing failures when using partition managers that work perfectly well under previous versions of Windows. For example, Windows 7 itself might work perfectly but I would be unable
 to get the boot-up menu when tapping F8 during the early boot phase.<br />

<p>I used the 5.0.1 server edition which is "Support Windows 2000/XP/Vista/Windows 7 (32 bit &amp; 64 bit)." I try the F8 to get the boot menu for example boot in safe mode and work perfectly.</p>

<p>My inability to get into the boot menu was one of several examples demonstrating that there is more than meets the eye when modifying Windows 7 partitions. I note that one of the leaders in the industry, Acronis, has yet to release its Windows 7-compatible
 version of a partition manager, which makes me wonder if Easeus is fully compatible or if this version has a few wrinkles.</p>
<p>If this was my show then I would do this:<br />
1. Create an image of the old installation, using the native Windows 7 tool.<br />
2. Apply that image to a new disk.<br />
3. See if this resolves the problem.</p>
<p>If it does and if I was very curious then I would repeat the above steps with Easeus.</p>

<p>I don't have access to the old disk installation anymore... I am looking for help from someone which can understand what happen..and&nbsp;know well&nbsp;the "create a system image" process of Windows 7 and propose me solution. I&nbsp;don't have any&nbsp;doubt about the fact
 to re-install a fresh&nbsp;copy of Windows 7 will fix my issue...but I suspect is just a mitmatch between some registry&nbsp;key and the ident from my new disk volume...</p>
<p>Somebody&nbsp;can help me here?</p>

<p>Had very similar problems. Found a solution that worked for me (after hours of trial and error- deleting old back ups or restore points (you can do this sometimes on the HDDs properties by running a "clean up") can sometimes help by either freeing up space
 or other related issues, but this did not and I had plenty of space for the back up):</p>
<p>My solution is bolded below but first, look at the basics:</p>
<p>First off, normally, most problems with MS Windows can be resolved by just doing a repair install or upgrade install (worst case scenario is a full format which wipes the disk - usually you can recover some files even if that is needed - heck, you can even
 recover fried HDDs from over-voltage or physical damage if you have some know-how - even externals!).</p>
<p>Also, if you use air cooling - never under-estimate Dust Off - you should routinely ensure your case is free of dust or other particles/contaminants which can cause physical damage to your internal components. Dust off should not damage your equipment if
 used properly - this has not only lowered my operating temps of my PC by several degrees Celsius, it has also fixed a lot of major problems I had with speed/reliability).</p>
<p>Reinstalling windows should always be your first step, otherwise - I have used windows since 3.1 as a power user and 9 out of 10 times this fixed my problems if I did not have a system image backup handy.</p>
<p>When you do this make sure you ARE CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET - this is critical - activating and installing windows and updates during a repair install could be critical - also remove any conflicting software such as ITunes before the re-install - then re-install
 after if you like)</p>
<p>In my case, windows being reinstalled fixed other issues I had but still did not fix my ability to create restore points, access them, or backup my computer - I'd get volume shadow copy errors, file cannot be specified errors/location errors).</p>
<p><em>What worked for me was this (I have provided other solutions I tried which may also help others if this one does not):</em></p>
<p><strong>I used PC-Tune Up (Pro) from Large Software - you can run a trial of it with full capabilities I think and if it works, might be worth paying for the license. I am not a big fan of their software by the way, but this time, it worked.</strong></p>
<p>I think it's like $30; for me, it was like an additional $10 more with my zone alarm extreme security purchase (firewall antivirus - not endorsing this product or work for this company)</p>
<p><strong>I also used (and recommend) CC Cleaner (free - but good - been using this for years - with very little hassle but it cannot pick up as much as PC-Tune Up for a major problem) - PC Tune Up Pro is good for major problems and conflicts but should not
 be ran at startup if you use it (it tries to do this by default sometimes - might be okay for vista or XP, but wouldn't recommend this option for win 7).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Restart (don't over-install/remove too many items/sequential restarts are best to ensure no conflicts arise between cleaning/repairing/compressing of files).</strong></p>
<p>Don't worry about third-party software screwing your PC up - if it does, they usually create a backup of the registry/other files/conflicts that you previously had in addition to a restore point (some third party solutions can do backups and restores through
 their own proprietary software - you may want to see if another restore solution other than windows works if these conventional methods do not</p>
<p>Even without a restore point, you should be able to fix things in safe mode or by running/reinstalling windows, after the fact (I have never had a problem to-date using a good and reputable 3rd party PC Cleaner-like program aside from some minor bugs and
 issues which are rare in my case). MS cleaners from advanced tech support I have used have only been good for very rare or hard-to-find bugs/virus or program incompatibility issues.</p>
<p>Use one or both of these then Restart and see if that helps, if it does (or doesn't) see the following other steps:</p>
<p>If reinstalling windows or the above tips don't help, these might:</p>
<p>Many common backup problems can be resolved in disk management by ensuring a simple volume of the hdd (hard disk) you want to use for backup is visible in the windows GUI (e.g.: my computer). Video sites (e.g.: Youtube and Microsoft Support) I think have
 videos showing how to resolve assigning disk management solutions for your backup if the actual disk is the problem.</p>
<p>(your bios/boot agent may see it but the computer may not, have it offline, or has not formatted it - sometimes driver probs cause this as well). External HDDs don't typically have this issue since they are built more for backup - you may want to test it
 on another drive and/or external if the first one does not work to see if the problem is simply the HDD your are backing up to (I doubt this is for a DVD or BRD).*</p>
<p>If you have good antivirus (Widnows Defender is actually decent but some third-party software is worth the investment because it has other features windows or win defender does not and can work side-by-side with it).</p>
<p><strong>Use your anti-virus </strong>and run an extensive deep scan (these can take several hours - you may want to run a quick set of scans first and do a deep scan as a last resort). Also, make sure you have a reputable<strong>firewall program</strong>
 . Windows 7 has a built-in OS Firewall, but, I personally prefer independent security over Windows Firewall. Zone alarm is a good OS Firewall even if you use the free version (personal opinion - do your research and find out what works best for your needs).
 More experienced users may choose other firewalls, but this is really good for novice and intermediate (even advanced people with computers). AVG is also a popular anti-virus software for free (I do not use them or endorse them personally, but, a free firewall
 or antivirus tends to be better than none in some cases - I tend to find even some free online scans like the ones from Trend Micro can pick up stuff that even paid anti-virus cannot - again, research). I personally use Zone Alarm Extreme Security for home-use
 since it's somewhat easy to use (it's paid). Microsoft may be able to provide products or recommendations as well - see the Microsoft Store - sometimes using windows solutions, even paid, are better than other paid solutions for various reasons.</p>
<p>To fix the back up, I also enabled the Volume Shadow Copy in windows services before running backup (sometimes the VSS or SVM is disabled and you can make it set for auto run instead of manual (you can do this through control panel or by the task manager
 under services - e.g.: control alt delete) - but odds are if this fixes your problem, you should still re-install windows anyway because you probably have other conflicts you may not be aware of).</p>
<p>I also defragged and check the physical disk for errors (you should do this periodically anyway depending on how often you use your computer (Windows 7 usually schedules an auto defragmentation of the physical disk and most people do not have to worry about
 this - "Do not do this if you are using a solid state drive!)</p>
<p>I also ran memory checks, went into disk management, created new partitions and disk access tags/etc.... Even had an advanced microsoft tech assist through remote management and checked several forums through Microsoft - no solution. Normally, a reinstall
 of windows for a repair or upgrade can work</p>
<p>Some people have success by going into a selective startup through msconfig and disabling all other services except MS. You can do this by hitting the start key (windows key and then typing that in to the command line). Other things: Some programs should
 be ran with as an administrator (normally right click and choose run as administrator - a lot of times, you can have repair and recovery software do more for you than they would otherwise - especially if a firewall is blocking some of the repair features -
 this is a common problem, you may want to disable your firewall and antivirus without a web connection or in safe mode and see if you can fix things there).</p>
<p>If these don't work, don't fret:</p>
<p>First thing: "if you can," create a restore point. If not, that's okay (remember some third party solutions can back up where Windows can't - I cannot recommend one off the top of my head however - but I know some PC manufactures provide their own back up
 solutions with drivers/etc in case windows is at fault - you may want to check the support website to see if they have repair disks or hot fixes and drivers for download).</p>
<p>Second, make sure all your device drivers are up to date - sometimes, these can be problems too, especially your bios (check with your motherboard manufacturer/sometimes windows update does not catch all drivers or will even provide older versions of drivers
 before the new one is available - this has happened to me before).</p>
<p>Third - run windows update (sometimes this must be done manually when win update fails and you can install critical updates off Microsoft's support website - this has helped me a lot too) - install necessary updates and check for solutions to ones which
 may not have installed correctly.</p>
<p>Four: Defragment your disk(s) - sometimes the problems are more related to the source disk than the backup source - you can alternatively partition one HDD if only have one disk for back up purposes - search engine can show you how.</p>
<p>Five run a memory check for memory errors (F8 - advanced options and memory diagnostic - this is sort of the same way you would access safe mode pre-boot of your OS) - your main Hard disk will require a restart to do this - you can adjust the aggressiveness
 and time this takes - any other drive can be checked while you are in windows usually, however. This step can take a while, but, to do it, go into the drive's properties, check it for scan and fixing of errors (this can take a while on particularly large hard
 drives, but even new drives may have issues related to physical wear/poor manufacturing/static/electrical/heat damage) - Physical damage which chkdisk program can resolve by telling the HDD to ignore corrupted clusters, for instance on the hard disk) where
 maybe a program was installed on and is no longer working.</p>
<p>Six - Unlikely, but, you may need to re-defrag the disk after.</p>
<p>7: Update your bios if you haven't already, to the latest version (sometimes rolling back software helps too by the way - it is important to isolate when you first encountered the problem or what installs/activities you did which lead up to the problem -
 windows restore, even if it does not work can sometimes identify problems even if it cannot utilize the restore point, you may be able to view it in windows or during a protected startup (e.g.: F8 at boot).</p>
<p>If this does not work:</p>
<p>You may have to do this an old-fashioned way: Set up a Windows Easy Transfer for your basic stuff - you can do this on a USB flash drive or USB HDD, it does not have to be a Windows easy transfer cable, exclusively (easy transfer probably is not affected
 by your current problem but even if it is, there are ways to fix it). Put that on the other drive. Then copy the disk data you want (easy transfer will unfortunately not cover every file or setting, I think, so save some of your needed drivers/documents/programs
 in a separate folder on the other disk).</p>
<p>Boot off that disk (change disk booting priority in bios - this is fairly simple to do - just use your search engine to find the answer or check your computer/motherboard vendor for support) - make sure if you re-install windows on there - assuming easy
 transfer does not work, that the corrupted disk or windows on the other disk is still readable (preferably non usb - internal drive) - windows sometimes wants a legitimate copy of windows installed on at least one HDD it can read before it will allow you to
 install it again on another (this is a problem sometimes if your recovery disk is based off an upgrade disk vs. a full retail copy of Windows or a repair disk). Even corrupted disks and faulty/conflicting drivers do not always interfere with boot up managers
 detecting the installation of windows on the other disk(s) you want to restore to.</p>
<p>If that doesn't work...well...whatever does probably isn't worth the "time" it would take to copy your data and just format the bad disk(s) and reinstall your stuff.</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If I put a new SSD in the laptop and then install W10 HOME will it automatically activate or will I have to buy a new licence as there is no key to activate on the underside of the laptop.</p>

<h2>            Fax &#38; Scan hangs sending&#47;receiving a fax after upgrade to Windows 8.1</h2>
                    I upgraded from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 on two different computers.&nbsp; Fax &amp; Scan could send and receive faxes before the upgrade on both computers, and now the fax programs hangs on both computers.&nbsp; The problem occurs during the handshake initialization
 with an external fax machine.&nbsp; i.e., after the external fax answers the phone and they are trying to connect with each other, fax &amp; scan just hangs.&nbsp; I've seen others with this problem, where they say they have 'fixed' the problem by replacing Fxst30,dll (in
 System32 folder) with a version from Windows 8 or Windows 7.<br />
Is this a know problem to Microsoft, and is the problem being fixed?<br />
Thanks, Gary<br />

            Hello,<br />
The fax program is Windows Fax and Scan.<br />
Method 1 - everything up to date - and no optional driver and firmware updates.<br />
Method 2 - did the uninstall, then reinstall (with restarts) - did not make a difference.<br />
Method 3 - sfc /scannow - result -&gt; "Windows Resource Protection did not find any integrity violations"<br />
<br />
So problem still exists.<br />
Are you aware of pending Windows Updates for this problem?<br />
<br />
More detail:<br />
After clicking "Send Fax", another progress window comes up.&nbsp; The message says "dialing xxxx"<br />
During this time:<br />
1. The modem is sending a 'beep' about every 3-4 seconds while the remote fax has the 'ringing' sound waiting for the remote fax to answer the phone.<br />
2. After the remote fax answers, the remote fax starts generating the well known fax signals.<br />
3. At this point, the modem stops generating the beep signals and just stops any activity (hangs).<br />
4. Eventually the remote fax just hangs up.&nbsp; At which point, after 15 or 30 seconds, the process repeats with the modem again dialing the remote fax.<br />
<br />
I have seen this problem mentioned on the internet several times.&nbsp; Proposed solution that seemed to work was to replace the Windows 8.1 Fxst30.dll (in System32 folder) with the file of the same name that was shipped with Windows 7 or 8.<br />
<br />
Finally, the fax was working prior to the upgrade to Windows 8.1.<br />
On the Dell laptop Lattitude D820, the modem is the "HDA CX11254 Soft Modem"<br />
On the desktop, the modem is the "PCI CX11252-11 Soft Modem"<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
Gary<br />

            Hi there Gary.<br />
<br />
I had the same problem, when I spoke to Microsoft, I was told I would have to buy a new USB Fax Modem, really helpful (Not). And if the .dll file is not right and new fax is not going to work.&nbsp; So after doing loads of searches on the internet on Google, (Remember
 Google is your friend) this is how to fix the problem and is it simple and straight forward.<br />
<br />
Gary, you are dead right,&nbsp; you do need to replace the Fxst30.dll file, with an old Windows 7 or Windows 8 version. (NOT Windows 8.1)<br />
<br />
If you have an old computer running Windows 7 or 8 (7 is better), you may find the file in the Windows Old folder or look for the file on a Windows 7 DVD&nbsp; it dose not seem to be on the upgrade disks.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If not - email me and I will send you the copy of the file I have used.&nbsp; *** Email address is removed for privacy ***&nbsp;
<b>Please note:</b> I am not a computer whisskid, but the following worked for me.&nbsp; :)<br />
<a href="http://www.whizzkid.uk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><em><br />
</em></a>
Here is what to do.<br />
<br />
1. The file you need to replace can be found in the system32 folder.<br />
C:/Windows/System32<br />
<br />
2. Delete it.<br />
<br />
3. Replace it with the OLD Fxst30.dll<br />
<br />
4. Turn your computer OFF and then ON again, and send your fax.<br />
<br />
As I say, it worked for me and I am very happy faxing again.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
John<br />

            I installed a new windows 8.1 compatible modem (USR 5670) (compatible according or microsoft).&nbsp; Issue still remains as before.&nbsp; I did not want to change driver stuff with Fxst30.dll.&nbsp; Can Microsoft fix this problem?<br />

            Ok, I finally did as many others have done.&nbsp; I got a FXST30.dll from Windows 7, and used it to replace the FXST30.dll in the window\system32 folder.&nbsp; I can now send and receive faxes.<br />
So big question -- why did Microsoft break this, and why don't they fix it?<br />

            Hi there gscott260.<br />
<br />
To answer your question, is very easy and simple.&nbsp; I had a Microsoft guy on the phone trying to fix this problem for hours (and I do mean hours) it was a waste of time.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
They do not have a clue what they are doing half the time, just following instructions in a book, in a call centre. and I am very sorry to say that, but it is true.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
There is the saying "Jack of all trades, master of none."&nbsp; Sorry but it is very true when it comes to Microsoft.<br />
<br />
I am on the other hand, very pleased to read that you got your Fax to work.<br />
<br />
Kind regards<br />
John<br />

            When I restored the FXST30.dll version (6.3.9600.16384) that was installed with 8.1, after the sending fax hangs, I received error code 0xC000005 from FXST30.&nbsp; Also in the detail error it stated the fault offset was 0x00....005371.&nbsp; Perhaps this is a reference
 to some library that is not installed with a Windows 8.1 upgrade, but is installed with a clean install of 8.1.&nbsp; Can someone get this info to Microsoft development and get this fax hang fixed?<br />

I repost the solution here.&nbsp; It's an easy fix.&nbsp; <br />
<b>It would be useful if an MS tech, reading this message, would pass it up the corporate line so this proven fault can be addressed in a future update.</b><br />
<br />
The problem, which first surfaced in W8, is caused by a DLL file:&nbsp; FXST30dll.&nbsp; It should be 252Kb.<br />
<br />
This is the file used in W7, where FAX performs correctly.&nbsp; To fix the issue, copy the file from a W7 installation, then replace the W8/8.1 FXST.dll with that file.&nbsp; It resides in c:\windows\system 32.<br />
<br />
In order to do so you must first "take ownership" (have permission) of the W8/8.1 file.&nbsp; An easy way to achieve that is to download this, which will create a right-click "take ownership" context menu item.&nbsp; Though the site offers this for "Vista" it's good
 for W8/8.1 as well.<br />
<br />
http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/add-take-ownership-to-explorer-right-click-menu-in-vista/<br />
<br />
Once the new file is in place, FAX should work normally.&nbsp; Be aware however that if you run the system file checker (SFC), the bad file will be restored, so keep the W7 DLL on hand.

<h2>            Recording Devices MIssing and don&#39;t work with 1803 for non-Admin Account</h2>
                    <p>I updated to 1803 yesterday on my PC where I am converting my library of Vinyl LPs.&nbsp; Today I tried using for the first time.&nbsp; Here is what is happening:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. When you right click on the speaker, recording devices is no longer an option.<br />
</p>
<p>2. In Audacity, the LIne In input device does not work.&nbsp; No levels are shown in Audacity or in the Sounds Control panel</p>
<p>3. When I try to record, I get an error that Audacity cannot open the sound device.<br />
</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Oddly, when I log in or run Audacity with an admin account, the problems go away.</p>
<p>
</p><p />

<p>Same problem with 1803 update.&nbsp; Afterwards the Sound Blaster "What U Hear" is disabled.&nbsp; Nothing I can do will restore any recording capabilities.&nbsp; I installed updated SB device package for Win 10 afterwards and even that does not help.&nbsp; Looking for a device
 driver does not help either. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to use my normal Audacity and it cannot find any recording device.&nbsp; Nor can&nbsp; a few other software programs.&nbsp; Totally dead for recording any sound.&nbsp; It seems that the :what U hear" device is disabled and cannot be switched back on.</p>

<p>I found the cause and a solution from another poster who already submitted at bug report.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that the privacy settings for the microphone has to be set to allow applications to access the microphone.&nbsp; This I guess applies to all input devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The reason my admin account worked is that I had never setup the privacy setings.</p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
Good luck.</p>

<p>It is the privacy settings that are turning off any sound recording.&nbsp; Thanks...</p>
<p>
</p><p>To recap for others....</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you cannot record sound on your Win 10 system after update to 1803 try the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Go to settings then the Privacy section</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; In the top change using the button to allow the microphone to be on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; Turn to ON the "allow apps to access your microphone"</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; Below that "Allow which apps can access your microphone"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn that those that make sense.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the 1803 update Microsoft has decided to enforce the privacy settings.&nbsp; What is mis-leading is that the settings mentioned above really apply to more than a microphone but to any (I guess) recording device. &nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now unfortunately I turned on microphone but I really don't want that device to be on, only sound recordings. &nbsp; To me this is less privacy until Microsoft tell us exactly or allows us to exactly turn on/off devices not just some general app names. &nbsp; I don't
 want the chance that some hacked software is using my mic.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to play with the setting to get the least permissions on my system and still have sound recording.</p>

            <div>Hi,</div>
<div><br />
1. What exactly are you referring to when you say "turn into a page icon"?<br />
You my upload a screen shot of the same using the link mentioned below:<br />
<strong>See Use SkyDrive to upload collected files and post screen shot/picture<br />
</strong><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itproui/thread/4fc10639-02db-4665-993a-08d865088d65</a>
<br />
<div>2. What is the game that you are trying to play?<br />
<div><strong>Note:<br />
</strong>Rundll32.exe is not a virus, it is a system file used by third-party program to run itself on the computer.<br />
It is not recommended to replace rundll32.exe by downloading it from internet.<br />
<div><strong>Method 1:<br />
</strong>Uninstall the game and check if that makes any difference or if you find any changes in CPU usage:<br />
<strong>Uninstall or change a program<br />

<br />
</strong></div>
<div><strong>Method 2:<br />
</strong>You may place the computer in a clean boot state and check if that works fine.<br />
To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</div>

    <title>Controller is Moving up by itself. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thomanji  say:</h3>
<h2>            Controller is Moving up by itself.</h2>
                    
<p>I specially bought the Xbox One Special Edition Green Camouflage Wireless Controller about 6 months ago. I had it shipped from PlayStore because I live at the moment in malaysia. So I had to pay $20 shipping and $15 import tax to get this.<br />
3 days ago the controller started to moves up by itself. Its strange because there is a delay. If I play any game and stand still, it starts moving up after about 2 seconds. I can press it down and than center and it will stop for 2 sec and than move up again.
 The stick does not move, but somehow it sends the move up command or is not calibrated.</p>
<p>After spending hours to find a calibration function or tool I just found some post but no solution unless you want to start soldering and buy senseors from China to have better quality, LOL.</p>
<p>Of course I did first upgrade the controller to the latest firmware, I and also switched off the console and removed the power cable for 10 minutes but still the same. To be sure I keept the console unplugged for a night (8 hours) but all is the same. Then
 I also re-synced the controller, replaced the batteries. Nothing helps.</p>
<p>What to do now, I did never expect this. in 10 years with Xbox and 20 years in gaming I never had a joystick malfunction like this. Non of my previous controllers was $50 ($85 for me) so I thought this is a high quality product and I am really disappointed.</p>
<p>What is the statement of Microsoft on how to fix this issue? Is there a solution that you can offer. What else can I do to get this resolved so that I can play again.</p>
<p>I also want to mention that this controller was handled very careful, it never lies around and is always placed on the holder once I am done. Also there are no children and animals in my household so this controller was not exposed to any ruff treatment.</p>
<p>I hope you have a solution for me.</p>

<p>Since controller the warranty is such a short span, the only thing to do is get another controller and swap shells or do a quick search for Xbox One controller drift fix, get a Torx screwdriver set and try to do a little repair yourself.</p>
<p>On the 360 I had taken several of my controllers apart and cleaned them, which seemed to fix some of the issues and extended their life. It isn't a great answer but it is what it is.

<p>Thank you for commenting. I have already assumed that once again I got&nbsp; by Microsoft disregard for quality. Its just amazing that they get away with this all the time. Obviously they knew that it is a faulty product which is why they give it only 6 months.</p>
<p>Double the price half the quality, this is also a way for increasing accessories revenue by just cutting the life cycle to a quarter.</p>
<p>Its funny, because I still remember the adverts where they told us that this new controller is &nbsp;state-of-the-art and high quality. Just another lye which is no big deal from Microsoft because they know there is no consequences, because once you switched
 on your XBox you already agreed to not start any class action lawsuit, in addition they have a "get out of jail" card anyway because hey are close with the NSA. We small consumers are always getting love, this time with Microsofts "Joystick", how ironic.</p>

<p>@FearedNightmare this is the official response from Microsoft? Members are not allowed to find a way to repair products that Microsoft dumbed on its loyal users for lots of money? Instead of suggestion a resolution you threatening the community. This is
 quite sad. maybe Microsoft could suggest something to make good to their failure to deliver a working product, how can this flaw have fallen trough the cracks, are the testes so incompetent or was this an attempt to boost sales by making things break after
 6 months conveniently after the unusual short grantee time frame.</p>
<p>We are discussion solutions here because we hoped for a response from Microsoft on what to do. You can be sure that non of the users want to repair anything themselves. We just want to be able to play our games with an accessory that works. However, Microsoft
 ignores our cries for help. The least I would have hoped for is a coupon towards a new controller or something that shows that Microsoft is dedicated it its users and a goodwill gesture to say that you are sorry for selling us a flawed product. I understand
 this can happen because you also relay on a 3rd party and probably your quality control department was not doing its job right. So the least you could do is to resolve your mistake. I am a business man and if any of my employees mess up, I as the principal
 have to resolve the issue. It really is a disgrace that the official response seems to be that the consumer should simply buy another $60 controller, maybe Microsoft thinks that everyone out there is a billionaire, but for the normal consumer $60 is a lot
 of money to pay every 6 months.</p>

<p>Non of this applies to a faulty controller or M$ has to be clearer.</p>
<p>"Including any threads or posts regarding modifying the way your Xbox operates such 'modding' and/or 'chipping' your Xbox or otherwise altering the way it is intended to operate. This includes ANY discussion of self-repair."</p>
<p>This specifically talks about the Xbox and modding. Please do not make assumptions on the legal meaning. No one is suggestion any mod or self fix. We simply suggestion that Microsoft should clean up its mess and be a responsible company that cares about
 the people they buy their stuff. As a gamer it should be in your interest to find a solution instead of being a busy body legal expert fighting for your employer.</p>
<p>It also seems to me that Microsoft staff is discussing self fix all the time. In fact a official moderator suggested that I fix it myself. They told me to take the battery out, restart my console, update firmware. etc. So it seemed to me that Microsoft violated
 the policy by suggestion ways to me to fix it myself. Of course all fixes were all a joke, because they know very well that the only fix is to give them another $60.</p>
<p>How sad for a gamer to fight fellow gamers in finding a solution to this serious problem.</p>
<p>I guess you have no problem if Microsoft messes with your JoyStick.</p>
<p>You will read much more on this in the comping weeks in various Gaming magazines that we write for.</p>

<h2>            Bluetooth Device Constantly Disconnecting</h2>
                    <p>My Bluetooth&nbsp;headphones (BeatsX) keep disconnecting from my Surface Laptop 2 whenever they are not in use for 5 seconds, then they immediately reconnect. This is really annoying because my headphones make a ring when they disconnect and reconnect.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have already tried to adjust the power management settings in Device Manager (to stop Windows from turning the device off to save battery), but there is no power management tab for my BeatsX. There is only one for Marvell AVASTAR Bluetooth Radio Adapter,
 which I did turn off.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Cortana error&#58; &#34;Interests aren&#39;t available at the - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> diego mathias olivares  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cortana error&#58; &#34;Interests aren&#39;t available at the moment.&#34;</h2>
                    Good day everyone!<br />
<br />
Recently I've updated my laptop from Windows 8.1 to 10, and I must say I'm largely satisfied with it: driver update went smoothly (which did not happen between 7 and 8), I love the new look &amp; feel and the new features as well.<br />
<br />
My only problem is about Cortana: my interests cannot be loaded, no matter what.<br />
Here is what happens in detail:<br />
1. First time I open Cortana dialog after a boot or a reboot, the usual welcome message is shown and after few seconds the first interest cards appear below. However there is a first issue: no image can be loaded correctly (not even Cortana icons) and in their
 place there is an error placeholder. Text content appear normally.<br />
2. Each subsequent time I try opening the dialog, no interests is loaded and only one obscure message is shown: "Go ahead and tell me to do something. Interests aren't available at the moment."<br />
<br />
I can suppose this could be a network problem: I searched everywhere on support forums and the only posts describing a similar bug where all solved through the removal of 3rd party antimalware and firewalls. This is not my case though: I've updated to 10 from
 a virtually clean install of 8.1 (I had switched my HD with an SSD one and I took the opportunity to have a clean install), and no antimalware or firewall was installed except built-in Windows Defender.<br />
<br />
I tried to consider an account migration problem, but then I've added another hotmail account (which was never linked with Windows 8 to begin with) to my pc and the issues still persists.<br />
<br />
Truth is I've done the same upgrade process on my work pc (from 7 to 10 in this case) with the same device creation tool from Microsoft, logged with the very same account, and in this case Cortana works seamlessly (images loaded, interests always available).
 In this case obviously no hotmail account was linked to the local user account before the upgrade.<br />
<br />
At home I'm connected to the internet through a standar WiFi ADSL router-access point. Maybe is some kind of port-forwarding problem?<br />
<br />
(I didn't try using my home pc with a different internet connection yet)<br />
<br />
By the way, I'm Italian so I'm pretty sure Cortana has been enabled for us since almost a year by now (I'm using it on my Lumia smartphone seamlessly)<br />
Thank you in advance for any answer :)

            <p>Hi Jansen P,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your help :) Sadly, the clean boot doesn't change the situation, so probably it is not about an application/service conflict, at least not a 3rd party one...</p>
<p>Here are the two different status for a visual help (they are in italian but the messages are correcly translated as in my first post)<br />
</p>
<p>First opening of Cortana:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Each time after, until the next reboot (or Cortana process kill &amp; restart):</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/6bf8baf4-760f-45bc-be4f-8122919d5992" /></p>

<p><span>Hello Rakashelle,</span></p>
<p><span>If you are using Windows Photo gallery to import pictures, it will import all the pictures that are on your camera including your old photos.<br />
<br />
To import pictures only the new pictures, do not use the ‘Auto Play’ feature and browse through your camera when you connect it from the Windows Explorer and simply drag them in the Photo Gallery window, or copy them in the Pictures folder of the current user
 (this will automatically add them to the gallery).<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you can download and install the Windows Live Photo Gallery.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Here is a link to download and install Windows Live Photo Gallery: </span>
</p>
<p><a href="http://download.live.com/photogallery" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://download.live.com/photogallery</span></a><span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>The Windows Live Photo Gallery gives you an option to review the photos before importing. This way, you will have an option to select the pictures
 you want to import. Here is a link that will give you information on importing pictures using Windows Live Photo Gallery:

<h2>            NVIDIA Driver artifacts seem to be blocking win10 install</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm ATTEMPTING TO INSTALL/UPGRADE Windows 10&nbsp; from windows 8.1. on a &nbsp; DELL490.&nbsp; &nbsp;The &nbsp;Windows 10 install is&nbsp;blocked by&nbsp; a non-compatible &nbsp;NVIDIA 3500 driver artifacts.&nbsp; &nbsp;I have removed the non-compliant hardware -- an NVidia fx3500 and all its drivers
 and all associated programs and replaced it with a radeon r5-220 video card and driver.&nbsp; Only keyboard and mouse are installed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The system runs fine with win 8.1 but refuses to allow an upgrade to windows 10 -- due to some artifact or history from the fx 3500 which the MS10 install program thinks is still installed.&nbsp; How do I clean the driver&nbsp; up so I can&nbsp;do an upgrade to windows
 10.</p>

<ol>
<li><span>How are you upgrading to Windows 10 (Media Creation Tool or Windows Updates)?</span></li><li><span>Did you update all the device drivers of the PC?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:
</span></strong><span>Uninstall the unwanted program, software, driver or an application from
<strong>Control panel</strong> completely by following the steps below and check if the is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>

<strong>Uninstall</strong> button which will appear next to <strong>Organize</strong> option.</span></li><li><span>Close the window and check if the changes are effective.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:

    <title>Ripping cds on windows media player 12 causes computer to slow down - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dgrin  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ripping cds on windows media player 12 causes computer to slow down</h2>
                    When I rip some CDs, WMP 12 rips the CD very slowly (15+ mins at least when it should normally take 2) and also slows down my computer incredibly. This doesnt happen for all CDs, but when it does happen, its clearly because of the WMP. Everything on the
 computers becomes extremely slow and the second I click stop rip everything goes back to normal.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Its also&nbsp;definitively&nbsp;not because of my computer - I have 3.4gz cpu and 8gb of ram.&nbsp;</div>

            You should leave the attitude at the door. Most people here do NOT work for MS. I answer when i have the time.
<div><br />
<div>Have you :</div>
<div>- tried cleaning the lens on your cd burner with a cleaner cd ?</div>
<div>- does this happen on all CD's or only a few - tried leaning them in warm soapy water ?</div>
<div>- tried seeing what is running in the background, turning off non-essential resource hogs ?</div>
<div>- disabled other burning software you may have on your machine (conflict) ?</div>

            <div>These are (mostly) new and/or unused CDs so they are all very clean and scratch free. I have done been buring in all scenarios - with and without stuff in the background. And if you would look at my original post you would see that it only happens on some
 CDs.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>This is clearly not a hardware issue, or something wrong with the background - it is CLEARLY an issue with WMP.</div>
<div><br />
<div>As for my attitude - I got a response from the support engineer guy. I expect some follow up on my question from someone who actually works from MS. The fact that all I got is your response that didnt help at all makes the customer support for MS seem
 very bad. If you want to put some answers whenever you have time, that is fine, but I expect more from the actual company.</div>

<h2>            Epson printer does not print</h2>
                    <p>Original title : Epson printer not printing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The printer goes thru the motions of printing but the paper has no printing on uit when it comes out of the printer.I</p>
<p>&nbsp;have told it to clean the heads and the ink jets but it still does not print on the paper. I'm not sure the paper gets close enough to the print heads.</p>
<p>The ink cartridges are older but have been sealed until yesterday and there is ink in the opening..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there an 'online type' problem?&nbsp; What else shall I try? the carriage moves freely, but nothing appears on then paper after I tell it to print it puts the paper through and the carriage moves about as if it were printing.&nbsp; Any suggestions.</p>

            <p>Hi Vincent,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for choosing Microsoft Community!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I understand, you want to update <span>Kodak Easyshare 5100 all in one printer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please reply to these questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Is there any specific reason why do you want update the printer?</p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Do you have issues with the printer?</p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Was it working fine before?</p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to the issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Ideally, printers or any hardware is updated from its manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Kodak does not have any drivers for your printer, however is has drivers for 5000 series. This can be installed for your printer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Here is the link:</span></p>
