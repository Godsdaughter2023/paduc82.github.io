<h2>            Creators Update - .NET 4.0 and earlier issues with Touch Screens</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having an issue with certain software on the Windows Creators Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My issue is that every time I open a version of AutoCAD that uses .NET 4.0 or earlier (AutoCAD 2014 and earlier), when I try to switch between ribbons, I immediately get a software crash and the entire application closes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When AutoCAD crashes, I can examine the call stack, which I have posted below. &nbsp;If you look, you will see that the three most recent calls in the stack refer to 'Stylus' related devices. &nbsp;I can only assume that these are calls to Touchscreen components,
 which my laptop does have.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of this worked just fine prior to the Windows Creators Update, so I can only assume that there was a change that began causing these issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to resolve this on my end or can Microsoft put out an update/bug fix for this issue? &nbsp;Because as it stands, AutoCAD 2014 or earlier is 100% unusable on my laptop.</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you so much for posting this clue about the touchscreen. We have encountered the same issue with our customers using AutoCAD 2013 OEM based product.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We found that disabling touch screen interface worked for us, which is a minor tradeoff for most users:</p>
<p><br />
<a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/disable-touch-screen-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/disable-touch-screen-windows-10</a><br />
<br />
<span>open Device Manager and search for Human Interface Devices. Expand it.</span><br />
<span>Then, right-click on HID-compliant touch screen and from the list of options displayed, select ‘Disable’.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this is an option for you.</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

<p>Wow. Months later, same deal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Noticed this exactly just after Creators Update.&nbsp;Also noticed there isn't any HID-compliant touch screen to disable on desktop computers with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tracked the crash down to Splashtop Streamer and Touch Injection. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Fix:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open up Regedit.exe and navigate to the 64-bit path "HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Splashtop Inc.\Splashtop Remote Server"&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>(32-bit&nbsp;path is "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Splashtop Inc.\Splashtop Remote Server" alternatively. )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Add a DWORD called&nbsp;EnableSrvTouchInject and leave it equal to 0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Restart the Splashtop Streamer or reboot. Test AC2014 after that.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously, if you have this problem and Splashtop isn't installed, it could be another tool doing something similar. Good luck.</p>

<div>I can connect to the internet when I first turn on my computer, but after a while, it just suddenly can't connect to any websites. &nbsp;It still says that I'm connected, and when I ask it to fix the problem, it starts to, but then says it can't connect to
 microsoft. &nbsp;So I tried to repair it when it was working, but it says everything is fine, so it won't repair anything. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The only way to get back on the net is to restart the computer. &nbsp; &nbsp;I used to have dsl and when this happened, I would just unplug the router/dsl box and then reconnect- but back then it knew it wasn't connected. &nbsp;Now I have road runner and unplugging/turning
 them off doesn't work anymore. &nbsp;I hate this!</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This also happens with the sound. &nbsp;Suddenly I can't get sound. &nbsp;I check everything, it says the drivers are all working, it even says the device is working. &nbsp;But no sound. &nbsp;I have to restart. &nbsp;</div>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>Road Runner authenticates (usually uses MAC number)&nbsp; differently than DSL.</p>
<p>Dis you adjust the Router's WAN side to authenticated correctly with RR.</p>
<p>Additionally if your computer was set to authenticate with the DSL by software it has to be disabled.</p>

    <title>Eudora 7 and Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> antoniolambe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Eudora 7 and Windows 8</h2>
                    Eudora 7 has been my e-mailer for many years and I FAR prefer it to anything else I've seen including Eudora OSE.&nbsp; Having just acquired a new computer I was therefore thrilled to read in this forum and elsewhere that the old programme can actually work
 within both Windows 7 AND the latest Microsoft OS, Windows 8.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I retrieved the software and installed it in the new laptop, copying all the Options settings from my old XP-running machine.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When I try to send a test message with it, however, I am asked for the password of the server of my domains host, InMotion.&nbsp; This was duly furnished but I am then told:<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &lt;Dominant&gt;, Contacting secure23inmotionhosting.com [66.117.3.211], [time] could not connect to "secure23.inmotionhosting.com"&nbsp; Cause: permission denied [10013]<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On attempting a second time two new failures are described:<br />
<br />
&lt;Dominant&gt;, Logging into POP Server, PASS [time] There has been an error in transferring your mail. I said: PASS &lt;Shhhhh! Don't tell&nbsp; anyone.&gt;<br />
<br />
and then the POP server [*** Email address is removed for privacy ***@secure23.inmotionhosting.com] said:<br />
<br />
ERR Login failed. and <br />
<br />
&lt;Dominant&gt; 1 messages [sic] left to send ., RCPT TO: &lt;*** Email address is removed for privacy ***&gt; [time] Can't send to".&nbsp; The server gives this reason: "550 http//www.spamhaus.org/query/bl?ip=85.247.240.118".<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet I checked with Spamhaus and there is no problem there.&nbsp; So I would be extremely grateful for any suggestions of what must I do next? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you

            <font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sincere thanks, Mary, for the prompt and not discouraging reply in which you wrote:<br />
<br />
<blockquote>&gt; Make sure to use this program only on the win 8 Desktop, not on the Start page in the Mail App.</blockquote>
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eudora's icon was on the Desktop but a plain square labelled Eudora also appeared at the right of the Start page.&nbsp; This was duly unpinned - is this what you meant? - and Eudora restarted from the desktop.&nbsp; But a Ctl-m test elicited "...permission denied
 [10013]".<br />
<br />
<blockquote>&gt; AND you cannot use the old xp settings in windows 8. You must start the setup all over again for win 8 because the OS will not allow eudora to place anything in the system files.</blockquote>
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is less clear.&nbsp; Most of those settings appear completely unrelated to the system files if, indeed, there are any.&nbsp; (Win 8's search function finds only three small candidates when seeking "system files".)&nbsp; Hoping that "start the setup all over again"
 means turning the e-mailer off and on again and reentering any Tools/Options that have anything possibly related to the System files I scrolled through every Category (from Getting Started on), leaving Secure Sockets as "Never", Server configuration as POP
 and (almost) everything else as default, again without success. <br />
<br />
<blockquote>&gt; Your mistake is transferring all the settings.</blockquote>
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure I have made mistakes.&nbsp; Yet the only other non-default specification I recall a<font>pply</font>ing, and this during installation, was specifying a new, non-system Eudora Mail directory rather than the cryptic one proposed for received
 attachments.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>&gt; Read this thread--<br />
<a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/comp.mail.eudora.ms-windows/BkluLzvXgHg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/comp.mail.eudora.ms-windows/BkluLzvXgHg</a></blockquote>
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am grateful for your advice here too.&nbsp; But that "thread" is actually an extensive collection which contains many very long and often seemingly unrelated ropes.&nbsp; I fear what this inadequately computer-literate user needs is a step-by-step list of what
 to do, &amp; not do, at each stage of the installation or setup process.&nbsp; Does such a route map exist?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any further suggestions will be much appreciated.&nbsp; I rely heavily on electronic communication in my work and have found no e-mailer that comes close to the old Eudora.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, many thanks.<br />
<br />

            Have been using Eudora extensively for many years on many Windows platforms. I still use it on Windows 8, and it works just fine.<br />
<br />
1. Install Eudora 7.1 (http://www.eudora.com/download/). The installation process asks where to install the user files. I always put this in a separate folder from the program files because it makes moving Eudora to a new computer very easy. This folder can
 be copied over the top of a new installation's folder of the same name, making the migration process a snap.<br />
<br />
2. After the installation is complete, copy *.mbx, *.toc, nndbase.*, filters.pce,, the sigs folder, the embedded folder, the filters folder and the euroda.ini file from the old computer to wherever you installed Eudora's files.<br />
<br />
3. Start Eudora, and it will have all the mailboxes, accounts and account settings, and the address book you had before.<br />

            <font>Many thanks, <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/e2934142-81b8-4f8a-928f-8c6cf628ce7c">
MarkPerl</a>, for yesterday's reply in which you wrote:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
<blockquote>&gt; Have been using Eudora extensively for many years on many Windows platforms. I still use it on Windows 8, and it works just fine.</blockquote>
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Excellent.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>&gt; 1. Install Eudora 7.1 (<a href="http://www.eudora.com/download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.eudora.com/download/</a>). The installation process asks where to install the user files. I always put this in a separate folder from the program files
 because it makes moving Eudora to a new computer very easy. This folder can be copied over the top of a new installation's folder of the same name, making the migration process a snap.</blockquote>
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fine, I think.&nbsp; Transferring old correspondence to the new laptop isn't essential to me.&nbsp; A clean, blank 7.1 which WORKS in Win8 is all I want.&nbsp; I agree, though, that Eudora's default folder for mail is cryptic and I am planning to assign it to a much
 more accessible spot such as My Documents\EudoraMail.&nbsp; Any objections?<br />
<br />
<blockquote>&gt; 2. After the installation is complete, copy *.mbx, *.toc, nndbase.*, filters.pce,, the sigs folder, the embedded folder, the filters folder and the euroda.ini file from the old computer to wherever you installed Eudora's files.</blockquote>
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very well.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>&gt; 3. Start Eudora, and it will have all the mailboxes, accounts and account settings, and the address book you had before.</blockquote>
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Super.&nbsp; BUT you are way ahead of me.&nbsp; First, I must get the e-emailer to work so that it sends and receives correspondence normally.&nbsp; And most of the time it fails miserably apparently because of an inability to communicate with my website domain's
 host.&nbsp; So Eudora regularly reports:<br />
<br />
"Error getting network address for "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***"&nbsp; Cause: host not found [11001]"&nbsp; or<br />
"the POP server (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***@*** Email address is removed for privacy ***") said: ERR Login failed." or<br />
- "Eudora got tired of waiting for the server. [10100]" or<br />
- "Could not connect to "secure23.inmotionhosting.com" Cause: Permission denied [10013]"<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The issue appears to hinge on Eudora's configuration.&nbsp; Some aspects, such as the POP setting and authorising authentication, are essential and clear.&nbsp; But others, particularly the Secure Sockets settings prove arcane.&nbsp; Moreover, some specs work fluently
 one moment but not another.&nbsp; I cannot tell you how many disparate variations have been tried.&nbsp; Yet you cite none of these.&nbsp; Could you at least please tell me what you are using?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you again,<br />
<br />

            Create the <font>My Documents\EudoraMail folder before you begin the installation, so you can point to it during the installion.<br />
<br />
The easiest way to get e-mail flowing quickly is to copy the Eudora.ini from the old installation to the
</font><br />
<font>My Documents\EudoraMail folder immediately after the installation. Eudora will then come up with all of the correct personality/account information.
<br />
<br />
Oh...just read the rest of your message, and I'm not sure if those errors were from your old installation or the new one.<br />
<br />
Re: setting up POP and SMTP server info, the first thing to remember is that Eudora is a very old e-mail program, and as such, it's server settings screen labels often don't match up with the modern settings information we're given by our e-mail host providers.<br />
<br />
Sending you my settings would not help you, as my settings would be different from your because we use different mail servers. Send your settings, and I'll try to point you in the right direction:<br />
<br />
POP server name:<br />
POP server SSL required?<br />
SMTP server name:<br />
SMTP authentication required?<br />
</font>If <font><font>SMTP authentication required, is it the same as the POP server?<br />

<br />
</font>
<blockquote><font>&gt; Create the My Documents\EudoraMail folder before you begin the installation, so you can point to it during the installion.</font></blockquote>
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm surpris<font>ed doing so can make a difference.&nbsp; (Or perhaps this is just for convenience.)&nbsp; But will follow your advice.&nbsp; As I recall, when the question about where to store mail arises during the installation, it is just that - where
 to put correspondence.&nbsp; And this, presumably means the various mbx and toc files.&nbsp; But you refer to half a dozen additional ones.&nbsp; I assume the others are all part of the same packet.<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OK, I <font>think this is clear.&nbsp; But, again, this is mere convenience.&nbsp; First I want to get the basic e-mailer to work.<br />
<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;T<font>errific, thanks so much.<br />
<br />
</font>
<blockquote><font>&gt; POP server name:</font></blockquote>
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is no<font>t promising.&nbsp; The only servers MY 7.1 Eudora refers to are Mail Server (Incoming) and SMTP Server (Outgoing.)&nbsp; There is no "POP server" anywhere.<br />
<br />
</font>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In any even<font>t, the In and Out servers currently specified ar</font>e bo<font>th secure23.inmotionhosting.com .&nbsp; ( mail.aambiental.org and gs23.inmotionhosting.com were also suggested by InMotion Support.&nbsp; But these were
 worse still.)<br />
<br />
</font>
<blockquote><font>&gt; POP server SSL required?</font></blockquote>
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, my e-mail<font>er asks no such question - do you really have 7.1? - so I am unsure how to answer.&nbsp; In my programme there is a Secure Sockets when Receiving section whose four options are:<br />
<br />
- "Never" [my current setting]<br />
- "If Available, STARTTLS"<br />
- "Required, Alternate Port" and<br />
- "Required, STARTTLS"<br />
<br />
</font>
<blockquote><font>&gt; SMTP server name:</font></blockquote>
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A<font>s above, secure23.inmotionhosting.com<br />
<br />
</font>
<blockquote><font>&gt; SMTP authentication required?</font></blockquote>
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Allow au<font>thentication" is checked (or on).<br />
<br />
</font>
<blockquote><font>&gt; If SMTP authentication required, is it the same as the POP server?</font></blockquote>
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again I am l<font>eft wondering </font>abou<font>t our respective Eudor</font>as.&nbsp; All I can say is
<font>that in the first Tools/Options/Getting Started section in which both In and Out servers are as stated above, authentication is ALLOWED.&nbsp; There is no (stated) requirement.<br />
<br />
<blockquote>&gt; SMTP port: </blockquote>
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is increasingly discouraging to see these queries which have no parallel in the 7.1 version I retrieved.&nbsp; The only port reference in my Eudora is under Sending Mail in which one can use or not use port 587.&nbsp; This is presently selected.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I earnestly hope these answers are of some use.<br />

<br />
Please do not be discouraged. We are both talking about the same Eudora 7.1. The difference is that I'm using tech jargon that you're not familiar with. POP is the same as Incoming server!
<br />
<br />
Also, there are 2 different ways to configure the server configuration information. We're each using different method, but the information is the same.
<br />
<br />
When I asked for the mail server information, I should have been more specific. E-mail hosting companies usually have a page on their website that lists the POP (incoming) and SMTP (outgoing) mail configuration settings. Some even have pages for configuring
 various e-mail programs. Same even still have Eudora in their list!<br />
<br />
With that information in hand, one can then configure Eudora successfully. And one sometimes has to "play" with the settings a bit because old Eudora's configuration screens often times do not match up with the e-mail host's config information.
<br />
<br />
More perspective on Eudora...Eudora was created before we all began to have problems with SPAM. Once the problems with SPAM to become really serious, e-mail hosting companies, in order to cope the mounting SPAM problem, began to require settings changes in
 e-mail programs...and Eudora was left in the dust as other e-mails programs were forced to evolve.<br />
<br />
Re: creating the <font>My Documents\EudoraMail folder before you begin the installation, this is a requirement because old Eudora does not give you the ability to create this folder on the fly like a modern program would. And, yes, this folder ends up with
 lots of files and folders in addition to the mail box and address book files. When I migrate a new computer, I copy this folder in its entirety to the new computer before installing Eudora. I point Eudora's installation to this folder and am up and running
 immediately after the installation is complete. This is one of the real strengths of Eudora.<br />
<br />
My suggestion for you at this point is to...<br />
1. Uninstall Eudora.<br />
2. Delete Qualcomm folder in C:\Program Files (x86) or C:\Program Files, depending on your installation type.<br />
3. Create the </font><font><font>My Documents\EudoraMail folder.</font><br />
4. Install Eudora, pointing to the above folder when prompted.<br />
5. After the installation is complete, copy the eudora.ini file from the WinXP computer to
</font><font>the </font><font><font>My Documents\EudoraMail</font></font> folder on the Win8 computer.<br />
<br />
Assuming all worked well in your WinXP computer and you still have access to the files, the above procedure is the quickest way to get you up and running.
<br />
<br />
<font>The eudora.ini file will be found in the C:\Program Files\Qualcomm\Eudora folder on the WinXP computer. Suggest you also grab the nndbase. nnt and the nndbase.toc files as well. The nndbase files are Eudora's address book.<br />
<br />
If you no longer have access to the WinXP computer, and you'd like, I can remote into your computer, with you watching of course, and configure Eudora for you. I'm an IT consultant, and would do this for you free of charge because we Eudora users have to stick
 together. <br />

            Hello Mark,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What a long, detailed and decent reply.&nbsp; Many thanks.&nbsp; You began: <br />
<br />
&gt; Please do not be discouraged. We are both talking about the same Eudora 7.1. The difference is that I'm using tech jargon that you're not familiar with...<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Then you are patient as well.&nbsp; However, cosmetically (and curiously) 7.1 LOOKS different in XP - sharper corners, darker blue and for me more attractive - than the face Eudora displays in 8.<br />
<br />
&gt; Also, there are 2 different ways to configure the server configuration information. We're each using different method, but the information is the same.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fine, I hope!<br />
<br />
&gt; When I asked for the mail server information, I should have been more specific. E-mail hosting companies usually have a page on their website that lists the POP (incoming) and SMTP (outgoing) mail configuration settings. Some even have pages for configuring
 various e-mail programs. Same even still have Eudora in their list!<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Impressive.&nbsp; But it is surprising, then, that the otherwise good InMotion Support staff have offered a range of options.<br />
<br />
&gt; With that information in hand, one can then configure Eudora successfully. And one sometimes has to "play" with the settings a bit because old Eudora's configuration screens often times do not match up with the e-mail host's config information.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fair enough, and so I have found.<br />
<br />
&gt; More perspective on Eudora...Eudora was created before we all began to have problems with SPAM. Once the problems with SPAM to become really serious, e-mail hosting companies, in order to cope the mounting SPAM problem, began to require settings changes in
 e-mail programs...and Eudora was left in the dust as other e-mails programs were forced to evolve.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Again, fair enough.&nbsp; I have a pretty strong sense of civic duty in some areas and feel that merely deleting the stuff is not enough.&nbsp; So for several years I reported such mail to Spamcop.&nbsp; But it was time-consuming and appeared to accomplish little or nothing.&nbsp;
 Now any correspondence with terms I have blacklisted on InMotion's server's filter is sent "This account rejects spam".&nbsp; Whatever effect the measure may, or may not, have on these cyber polluters it has certainly made a difference here.<br />
<br />
&gt; Re: creating the My Documents\EudoraMail folder before you begin the installation, this is a requirement because old Eudora does not give you the ability to create this folder on the fly like a modern program would.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ah, understood.&nbsp; Thank you.&nbsp; (BTW, this all seems completely unrelated to advice originally given by Mary.)<br />
<br />
&gt; And, yes, this folder ends up with lots of files and folders in addition to the mail box and address book files.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fine.<br />
<br />
&gt; When I migrate a new computer, I copy this folder in its entirety to the new computer before installing Eudora. I point Eudora's installation to this folder and am up and running immediately after the installation is complete. This is one of the real strengths
 of Eudora.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Exactly.&nbsp; You are unusual not only for the qualities already appreciated but because you continue to use such a dated e-mailer (in spite of the manifold alternatives available especially to you) and because you choose to keep correspondence with you and
 not on a remote server.<br />
<br />
&gt; My suggestion for you at this point is to...<br />
1. Uninstall Eudora.<br />
2. Delete Qualcomm folder in C:\Program Files (x86) or C:\Program Files, depending on your installation type.<br />
3. Create the My Documents\EudoraMail folder.<br />
4. Install Eudora, pointing to the above folder when prompted.<br />
5. After the installation is complete, copy the eudora.ini file from the WinXP computer to the My Documents\EudoraMail folder on the Win8 computer.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This sounds good.&nbsp; I am pretty backlogged on other tasks but will definitely (attempt to do all of this and, I hope you and other forum readers won't mind, report back.)<br />
<br />
&gt; Assuming all worked well in your WinXP computer and you still have access to the files, the above procedure is the quickest way to get you up and running.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Very good.<br />
<br />
&gt; The eudora.ini file will be found in the C:\Program Files\Qualcomm\Eudora folder on the WinXP computer. Suggest you also grab the nndbase. nnt and the nndbase.toc files as well. The nndbase files are Eudora's address book.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Thank you, Mark.<br />
<br />
&gt; If you no longer have access to the WinXP computer, and you'd like, I can remote into your computer, with you watching of course, and configure Eudora for you. I'm an IT consultant, and would do this for you free of charge because we Eudora users have to
 stick together.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This is extremely decent.&nbsp; But two provisos:<br />
<br />
1. First I want to try, and perhaps learn, from the experience of at least attempting to do this on my own;<br />
2. I will definitely keep you in mind for future paid assistance.&nbsp; Two possible areas:<br />
<br />
- I am getting increasingly fed up with Microsoft (US &amp; Portugal) and HP (US &amp; India) over changing the Win8 keyboard/language so that with just two strokes I can generate many nonASCII characters (e.g. Alt n = ñ, 'c = ç).&nbsp; The spec used to be US English International.&nbsp;
 But Win8 offers no such option.<br />
<br />
- My 7-year-old Dell Inspiron continues to provide sterling service.&nbsp; But it is increasingly showing its age and needs much more than regular chkdsk and registry clean-ups.&nbsp; Here I am sure you'll be able to help.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Although an architect by training, my work, indeed my life, is now devoted to environmental conservation.&nbsp; So I was intrigued (and impressed) by your UCLA recycling link since I continue doing (free) landfill work.&nbsp; Can you tell me more?&nbsp; (I'll send&nbsp; my
 contact separately.)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Sincere thanks again.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;All the best,<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The link you provided no longer works.&nbsp; Is there somewhere else I can get it? &nbsp;I was actually a paid user before they abandoned it. I tried OSE, but the search engine was a disaster.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now my 7.1 appears to be corrupted. For example, I can't turn off full headers, the Help function no longer works, and the search engine misses a lot of things so that it can no longer be fully trusted. I was limping along ok however, until a couple days
 ago, when I began getting the following error:</p>
<p>
</p><p>SSL Negotiation Failed: Unknown Error</p>
<p>The connection with the server has been lost</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I click OK, the next error popup says:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The server's SSL certificate was rejected for the following reason:</p>
<p>Unknown Error</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you want to trust this certificate in future sessions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>[Here there's a whole page of Certificate Data]</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whether I click yes or no, it still doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone at AT&amp;T told me to "change the POP3 settings", but they're set for the right incoming and outgoing, and there's no way to set the ports or update the SSL certificate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I'd be happy to hire someone to fix these issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

Eudora_7.1.0.9.exe</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I stopped using Eudora shortly after I began using Windows 8, now 8.1 because Eudora lost functions in Windows 7 and even more in Windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is also more and more difficult to configure in the much more security conscience world we now live in.&nbsp;

<h2>            Can&#39;t back up computer. Several different error codes.</h2>
                    I have tried to back up my computer many times, and it keeps failing.<br />
<br />
Most of the time, I get the "I/O device error" with error code - "0x8078002A<br />
<br />
I have tried running chkdsk on my internal and external hard drives, and I have had no problems. I have tried it on a clean boot, with nothing. I have turned on the shadow drives, and that didn't work.<br />
<br />
The only change I have gotten is that "Access is denied" with error code - "0x80070005" (I believe. I didn't write it down, so I am basing this off my search history.<br />
<br />
I have a Pavillion DVS laptop, with Windows 7 Home Premium, and I am trying to back everything up to a Seagate 3TB external hard drive with USB 3.0.<br />
<br />
Any ideas on what to do now?

            <p>Hi DRockin, </p>
<p>I see that you have some issues with the data backup to an external drive. I will help you with this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.Which security software is installed on the computer?</p>
<p>2.Did you make any changes to the computer recently?</p>
<p>3.Were you able to perform backup earlier?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1.</b></p>
<p>As you have already tried the clean boot step, let us continue further with other steps.</p>
<p><span>Disable firewall and check if that helps to backup.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Turn Windows Firewall on or off</span></b><span>:
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-Windows-Firewall-on-or-off</span></a></p>
<p><b>Note</b>:
<span><span>You should not turn off </span></span><span>Windows</span><span><span> Firewall unless you have another firewall enabled. Turning off
</span></span><span>Windows</span><span><span> Firewall might make your computer (and your network, if you have one) more vulnerable to damage from worms or hackers.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><b><span>Method 2.</span></b></span></p>
<p><span>I would like you to create a new user account and check if that helps to backup.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Create a user account</span></b><span>:
</span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/Create-a-user-account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows7/Create-a-user-account</span></a></p>
<p><span>If the issue does not occur in the new user account, then you can transfer the
 files from the corrupted user account to new user account using the "<b>Fix a corrupted user profile</b>" article.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3.</b></p>
<p><span>Run a full computer scan with the Microsoft Safety Scanner to make sure that the computer is
 free from viruses.</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 4.</b></p>
<p>
<span>I would suggest you to enable the inbuilt admin account and try to backup from the in-built admin account.</span></p>

            I use Avast anti-virus, and I haven't made any serious changes to my computer. I do download games from the game service "Steam". I haven't been able to do this before. This is my first attempt to ever back up this computer.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, all these methods have failed to produce any results. I am still unable to back &nbsp;up my computer.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The error message I am getting still is the&nbsp;"I/O device error" with error code - "0x8078002A"<br />
<br />
Is there anything else I can try? I need to back up my computer before I send it in to get the track pad fixed (Using external mouse, and it is still under warranty).<br />
<br />
Thank you very much in advanced.

            I tried formatting it, and it did not work again.<br />
<br />
I was able to back up 40 gb of my hard drive, but not all of it. I still have about 120 gb left to back up. Is there anything else I can do?

</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to disable the security software and then try to do a backup.</p>
<p><b><span>Disclaimer</span></b><span>:</span><span>
 If you have to temporarily disable the antivirus to install other software; you should enable the antivirus as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to virus

            I went even further. I ran another clean boot, I disabled windows firewall, and I completely deleted my anti-virus, to make sure there was no way it was blocking the backup in any way shape or form.<br />
<br />
I still got the I/O error. I made sure to enable the firewall, and reinstall my anti-virus once I tried that.<br />
<br />
I have run anti-virus checks, spybot checks, I have used the program CCleaner to clean up my computer, and none of this is working.<br />
<br />
The only information I have dug up in my own personal research is that maybe there is a writing compatibility error between the two hard drives.<br />
<br />
I read somewhere (lost within the sea of links I have clicked on while researching this) that my Seagate 3.0 TB hard drive has a new writing method, compared to older hard drives. I can't say the exact information, since a lot of it goes over my head, but I'll
 try to recall and say what I learned as accurately as possible.<br />
<br />
After using CMD -&gt; msinfo32, and looking at components -&gt; Storage -&gt; Disks, I see that it runs 512 bytes/sector. This seems to be the standard. Well, I have read that this, and other external hard drives of this size run at a faster ratio, which is 4KB, or
 something close to that, I cannot recall at this time. This will create some issue when trying to copy system information between the two.<br />
<br />
or this may just be completely irrelevant. I am not sure.<br />
<br />
Here is the link to the hard drive I have. -&nbsp;http://www.seagate.com/external-hard-drives/desktop-hard-drives/expansion-hard-drive/?sku=STBV3000100<br />
<br />
It does run USB 3.0 if that would make a difference.<br />
<br />
After some research, I found this forum -&nbsp;http://forums.seagate.com/t5/GoFlex-GoFlex-Desk-GoFlex-Pro/windows-image-backup-fails-on-usb-3-0-3-TB-drive/m-p/123400/highlight/true<br />
<br />
Which states this <br />
<br />
"hard drive runs at&nbsp;<span>I have a Seagate 2.5" 500GB GoFlex drive and also recieve the same</span><span>&nbsp;Event
 ID 517 I/O error.</span>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I ran the following command:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>FSUTIL FSINFO NTFSINFO &lt;drive&gt;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>..and found that I have 4096 Bytes per sector and 4096 Bytes per cluster (4k/4k).</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>It appears Windows backup has problems writing VHD files to a 4K Native drive."<br />
<br />
And Seagate does not support any fix to this problem, if it is indeed the problem, except to download another program to fix this. I rather not, and I wish to be able to run Windows Backup and be able to backup my computer, and use that to fix it if there ever
 is a problem.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope all this external information helps, if it is relevant at all. I thank you for your continued support.</span></p>

            I was looking through the forums and I think I have the same problem. I have a seagate 3T external expansion desktop drive (model #SRD00F2). I try to preform windows backup and get a 0x8078002a error. I called Seagate and they said its microsofts problem
 because windows 7 doesn't support large drives. The standard sector size for the Expansion 3TB (like other drives) is 4096.
<strong>BUT,</strong> Windows 7 cannot use that big for the native backup tool. Is windows working on a fix for this or have they put one out that I haven't found. Thanks Rob

            I eventually found out that it was a formatting issue. Something about an 8k/8k writing issue. I read somewhere that the only fix is for Windows 8. I caved and downloaded the Seagate external program for backups but it would be nice for a fix. &nbsp;

            Seagate told me they didn't have backup software for this hard drive, that I would have to get a 3rd party backup software if I wanted to backup. I think its ****. Would take Microsoft or Seagate 5 minutes to write the software that would fix this problem. From what I have been reading other brands of large external hard drives work with windows 7. Just makes you think twice before opening the wallet, I never forget when I get screwed.

<h2>            Windows 10 Photos app slow scrolling</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I see really slow scrolling in Windows 10 Photos app, but rest of the system scrolling works fine. I can fix it by increasing no. of lines to scroll under Mouse settings to 50, but the rest of the system goes bizzare. How I can fix this inconsistency with
 Photos app?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I waited for the Fall Creators update thinking this might get fixed with the updated, but No!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            <p>Hi kkendric, </p>
<p>I see that you get a message while trying to launch an application. I will help you with this issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>2.Which security software is installed on the computer?</p>
<p>3.Did you make any changes to the computer recently?</p>
<p>4.Which application are you referring to?</p>
<p>5.Is the issue confined to any particular application?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This file seems to be associated with Nero burning software. You may try to uninstall and re-install Nero burning software to check if that helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please provide us with more information to continue with the troubleshooting accordingly.</p>

    <title>video adapter vga adapter conflict - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david anthony whitlow  say:</h3>
<h2>            video adapter vga adapter conflict</h2>
                    <p>Vista has shut down my video cards. The message upon start-up states, "At least one display adapter has been disabled because it is incompatible with the vga adapter. &nbsp;I'm running dual nvidia geforce 9800 gt cards and have installed new driver from nvidia
 but continue to get incompatibility message. McAfee scans indicate no problems. I have tried various scans and repairs from dell and ms to no avail.&nbsp; From device manager the highlighted cards properties message states that "windows has stopped this device
 because it has reported problems (code 43). If I click Check for solutions no results or suggestions are shown.&nbsp; During the boot process, lines of dots are displayed across the screen. The nvidea display manager will not open and displays the message "you
 are not currently using a display attached to an nvidea gpu.&nbsp; I have tried to install a previous vga driver from dell without success. Windows update has installed almost all updates except for one which it refuses to install.&nbsp; I've tried reverting back to
 a previous restore point but all saved restore points do not correct the problem.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Would a defective card be the problem and send the above incompatibility message?</p>
<p>Thanks, <br />

            <p><span>Hi
<b>David</b>,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forums.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>From the issue description I understand that you have issues with display drivers in Windows Vista computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I appreciate your efforts on this issue, but rest assured, we are here to help you and guide you in the right direction.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You might try removing one of the cards, then updating the driver. They should be using the same driver and might be conflicting at startup. You should also check the power
 supply if it's a few years old. Also make sure it's putting out enough electricity for the dual card setup.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Try these steps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may recheck the connections of the graphics card on the motherboard or remove the graphics card from the mother board and re-set it on the board again.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Thereafter, you may uninstall all the display drivers and install the latest video/graphics card driver and check if the issue persists.</span></p>

            <p>Anil, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for your prompt reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think your suggestion about removing one of the video cards is a good one and will be my next step. I have tried updating the video drivers directly from nvidea with an updated version but this did not help. I have also disabled and uninstalled the drivers
 from the device manager properties box that are reinstalled during the next boot but this did not help.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you know what the message "code 43" is about? &nbsp;I get this message with the video cards highlighted from device manager properties.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again, </p>
<p>David Whitlow</p>

<h2>            PC hangs and disk always 100&#37; -usually by &#34;windows problem reporting&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>i started having this issue a few weeks ago, when my PC was running on windows 8.1&nbsp;</p>
<p>i tried several approaches, including chkdsk and windows's auto fix tool, but none solved it. So I made a clean format for my pc, which made it roll back to windows 8. But still the problem persists. Also note that many times when disk is 100% there's nothing
 actually using it and all processes are 0 MB/s&nbsp;</p>
<p>many numerous problems popping here and there (like being unable to boot, or a message saying "Microsoft windows is not responding would you like to end the process" )</p>
<p>in addition, after the clean format, windows seems to be always trying to install updates, but failing.</p>
<p>i also made a disk check (using hd tune pro) and there happens to be 1.9% damaged sectors.</p>
<p>so is the problem caused by my hard drive? Or is it some software issue?&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>I suggest you to try to boot the computer in safe mode and check if you get the same error. Please refer to the below Microsoft article and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong></p>
<p>I suggest you to perform clean boot process and check if it helps.</p>
<p>Refer to the following link to perform clean boot.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135?wa=wsignin1.0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(91, 155, 213, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135?wa=wsignin1.0</span></a></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update
 or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily
 lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is
 connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.

<p>Once you perform clean boot do refer to the section “<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”
</strong>to boot the computer in normal mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To get started, you may also refer to the link given below.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upgrading from windows 8 to windows 10 , my PC got very very slow. In advance to that I had problems accessing my Windows account (onedrive-email etc) . So I managed (after hours and hours of password retrieve procedures) to delete my old windows account&nbsp;moving
 (copying)&nbsp;all my files to a new admin&nbsp;account I created. Problem is that not all my files were moved and I am missing some important ones. In the Users section my old account does not exist. Is there a chance there is a backup folder somewhere left in my hdd?</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t print to shared HP 1018 printer</h2>
                    
<p>I have an HP LaserJet 1018 printer connected to a desktop pc running Windows 7 32 Bit Home Premium.&nbsp; It is shared to the Homegroup.&nbsp; When I try to print to it from another computer in my homegroup, also running the same version of Windows 7, the print job
 shows up in the print spooler on the machine the printer is connected to, but it does not print.&nbsp; If I stop the print spooler service and restart it, then open the print queue and click on the job, it suddenly will start to print.&nbsp; This is the only way I can
 get jobs to print from the other computers in the homegroup.&nbsp; Suggestions?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Network Speed Test app reports incorrect results when tested behind a proxy</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/apps/network-speed-test/9wzdncrfhx52" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Network Speed Test</a> reports are wrong when tested behind a caching HTTP proxy. On my 100 Mbps connection, I get download speeds up to 750 Mbps because the test resources are retrieved from a local network proxy rather than the Internet. This should, of course,
 be mitigated by the app by making the test resources uncacheable by proxies using standard HTTP Cache-Control headers or otherwise ignoring resources served by proxies. Otherwise the app will be testing the wrong network speed.<br />
</p>
<p>Microsoft as usual assumes they're infallible, so there is no way way to report the problem to them other than leaving a message in a user forum. Great. Hope some Microsoft engineer will stumble upon this thread and report it to the correct internal department
 responsible for the said app.</p>

            <p>I have been searching this community trying to find out why every time I run speedtest.net it never drops below 90Mbps yet the Network Speed Test app keeps capping iteself at either 20Mbps or 10Mbps. &nbsp;Every single person who brings this up is told their
 network service provider is not giving them the data they signed up for.. I am in awe at this point.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You answered my question though. &nbsp;When I am on my VPN it just caps itself to either 10 or 20, even though Speedtest is showing 90. &nbsp;When I turn my VPN off the normal speeds return to Network Speed Test.</p>

    <title>Formatted a External to use on my Xbox One but now my computer is not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> k00mm00  say:</h3>
<h2>            Formatted a External to use on my Xbox One but now my computer is not recognizing it</h2>
                    
<p>So i recently formatted a 1TB external HDD to use with my Xbox One. Normally what I've done in the past is attach the external to my computer and load it up with movies and music files that i then play on my system (Xbox 360) using the video player and/or
 music player. It does not seem to be working the same way it did with my 360. Can someone please help me with this. I would say i'm pretty computer literate but can't seem to find this answer in any forum. So to reiterate, my newly formatted external hdd has
 been formatted by my Xbox one but is not being recognized by my computer, which is not allowing me to load it with music in order to play them on the ONE. Thanks in advance for all of your suggestions and wisdom!</p>

<p>Hello there! So when you format an external hard drive on the XBOX One, the console formats the drive into a file system that a computer PC cannot see. The 360 did not do it that way. A lot of the reason the drive is formatted that way is to prevent piracy,
 I would assume. This is an article I found when I Googled search this issue. There are others like it to.</p>

<p>Hi K00MM00! Scoob is 100% correct, a hard drive which has been formatted for Xbox One use is not recognizable by a PC, and vice versa, without a reformat.</p>
<p>There IS an option out there, but I have not tried it, so I can't vouch for its worth. There is a tool called "Xbox One Drive Converter" which will allow you to switch something called the "MBR" or Master Boot Record. This is rewritten when the hard drive
 is formatted to the Xbox One. If you then take that hard drive and plug it into your PC and run the Xbox One Drive Converter, you should see the drive in Xbox One format and can switch it back to PC format without reformatting - this will allow you to use
 the remaining space for media storage, etc.</p>
<p>Again, I can't vouch for the usefulness of this program since I haven't tried it myself, but it sounds reasonable. If you want to give it a try for yourself, click the following link:

<p>The Xbox One uses a different format for game installation as stated by those above, and requires USB 3.0 as well as being bigger than 250GB. If you want to use an external drive for media, (movies, music, etc.) you will need to use a different hard drive
 or USB flash storage. You would format that on your PC as you would normally, then load your media on that. Media drives for the One do not have the same requirements as those for a game installation drive - there is no minimum size and USB 2.0 is fine.

            <p>There is a conversion app out there, but I have not tried it as it is unnecessary. Go to "Computer" on older Windows PCs or "This PC" on Windows 10. right click and the first option should be "Manage," choose that and the Computer Management screen should come up with all of your drives. You should see the unformatted one as Online, but with no drive letter or format type to it. Select the drive then on the right side choose "More Actions" then "All Tasks" then "Extend Volume." A Wizard window should pop up, allowing you to choose the full size of the drive as the extended volume, then formatting the disk back to a PC usable format. Hope this helps everybody. </p>

            I realize this is an old post but I cant help but give a response. I had the same issue with my 4tb Seagate xbox edition game drive. It worked fine on my computer until i used it on the xbox one. I recently had to transfer my steam game library to a new
 computer and it was faster to try the xbox external to find my computer no longer read it. I found through several hours of failed research and experimenting that if you plug it in, hit the windows key, type in disk management and click the first option to
 create and format disk partitions in control panel. This will open disk management and you will see an extra hard drive with either one unallocated partition or two if you have xbox games stored on the drive. You can from here completely reformat the drive
 to a windows readable drive. Making small windows partitions is an option but it renders the drive useless on the xbox because the xbox will try to reformat the drive when plugged back in even if you delete the created windows partition. So

<p>
</p><p>IOS devices may have strick requirements for the connection. I do suggest configure the mobility follow the steps in the article above. I am not sure about the reason why Android devices works fine in this case since our forum focuses on the Online services
 of Office 365 for Business. I think you can post the question in this forum for dedicated help.

</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>There is a wide spread problem with Windows Updating throughout all versions of Windows.&nbsp; Quite simply put, Microsoft is making a mess of it.&nbsp; There are a bunch
 of us long term windows guys who have figured out a way to make it work (in spite of the lack of guidance and quality work by Microsoft), for this month. We have been struggling with this ever since Windows 10 was introduced, a year ago.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Quite frankly, we don't know what next month will bring.&nbsp; One thing you can be sure of is that a whole bunch of us will be trying our best to figure out how to
 guide you for the future.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>FYI, most of the very experienced "experts" on the forum do not work for Microsoft and actually are quite independent of them.&nbsp; If you click on then CT logo, it
 will take you to my profile where you can learn a little more about me.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><em><strong>Windows update fundamentally is a monthly process
</strong></em>that for decades has taken place the 2nd Tuesday of each month.&nbsp; It had its genesis as a way of patching Windows holes that the bad guys had discovered.&nbsp; The intent being to constantly improve the quality of Windows for security reasons.&nbsp; Doing
 Windows updates any more often than that is very seldom going to be helpful.&nbsp; Windows updating is one of the key reasons that Windows 7 has evolved to such a great system.&nbsp; It is the Gold standard today.&nbsp; One that Windows 10 is not even coming close to measuring
 up to.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Microsoft has corrupted the Windows Update widely-respected institution by including "updates" that do nothing for security but enable them to coerce (some would
 say trap)&nbsp;you into upgrading to Windows 10.&nbsp; If you have seen Win10 and like it, then go for it.&nbsp; However, there are a lot of us that do not want Windows 10, at least not now.&nbsp; So we have taken defensive measures to prevent it.&nbsp; FYI, Microsoft is committed
 to support Windows 7 until January 2020.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Microsoft has also installed quite a number of "updates" in your Windows 7 system that are designed to gather data about you, the way you use your computer, and
 what is stored on it.&nbsp; They pronounce that they will use this data carefully but require you to agree that they and their partners can use it for any purpose they see fit.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Fact:&nbsp; Other than Security updates, Microsoft has not issued a single update to Windows 7 that improves it any way since 2014.&nbsp; Consequently, I draw the conclusion
 that you do not want any non-security updates to Windows,&nbsp; I do recommend non-security updates to other Microsoft software and lots of other software&nbsp;that you use.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To start Windows Update manually, simply click on the Start globe in the bottom left, point at All programs and wait for it to display a menu.&nbsp; Then click on Windows
 Update.&nbsp; Do that once a month approximately several days or a week after the 2nd Tuesday.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The NEVER setting allows you to have complete control over the Windows Update process.&nbsp; But, it will no longer be automatic.&nbsp; You take the responsibility of updating
 and I encourage you to do that regularly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When Windows Update responds with a list of proposed updates, do the following:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Do not install any optional updates</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Do not check any updates that do not have check marks on them already</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>In the WINDOWS section of the list, find any and all updates that do not begin with the word Security.&nbsp; Right click on them, and choose Hide.&nbsp;
</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Then proceed to click the update button.</span></p>
</li></ol>

    <title>XP Mode auto attach USB&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lemp  say:</h3>
<h2>            XP Mode auto attach USB&#63;</h2>
                    I have an old Palm device (M515) that I'm trying to Hotsync via USB on a Windows 7 Pro machine.&nbsp; From what I've been able to determine, the only way to do this is to run an old version of Palm Desktop (4.1.4) in a virtual XP machine.<br />
<br />
I've downloaded and installed XP Mode and installed Palm Desktop 4.1.4.&nbsp; I can successfully run a Hotsync but ... in order to get it to work, I have to start the operation on the Palm device and then manually click the "Attach" item from the USB drop down menu
 on the virtual machine.&nbsp; Once I "attach," the virtual XP machine recognizes the USB connection and the Hotsync proceeds.<br />
<br />
Ideally, I'd like to run the Hotsync operation unattended, the way I have done on my old XP box.&nbsp; I leave the Palm physically connected and then it "wakes up" in the middle of the night and starts its Hotsync operation.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Is there any way I can automate clicking the "attach" button?&nbsp; <br />
<br />
As near as I can tell, I can't click it while the Palm is asleep, because at that point, the virtual machine doesn't detect any USB device to attach.&nbsp; I know the time that the Palm is due to wake up.&nbsp; Can I schedule an action to click the "attach" button at,
 say, one minute after the Palm has started its attempt to Hotsync (getting the timing right might be difficult, so if someone knows of a method to automatically detect the presence of a USB device and use that to trigger the "attach" command, I'm all ears)?<br />

<p>Dear Sarah Kong,&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Thank you&nbsp; for reply this to me. :) Actually I contact my dealer (Authotized Dell) who sold this computer to me and He already contact with Microsoft call center in Thailand about this ; however , he can not get solution for this issue. I guess that It
 might be in Thailand New year Holiday. But Microsoft should be online all the time isn't it? I am thinking to talk with hin today. That's sad that today i got bad news about him that he got accident between he travel on this holiday. So If you are kind,Can
 you provide e-mail of admin department of Microsoft to me or other solution to me.</p>
<p>For me I travel a lot and might not be in Thailand a long time :(&nbsp;</p>
