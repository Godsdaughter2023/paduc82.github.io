            It&nbsp;may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen&nbsp;crashes.
<p>
</p><p>Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a link on using OneDrive:</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.</p>

    <title>Network Drive Appears Disconnected But Isn&#39;t - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> abester605  say:</h3>
<h2>            Network Drive Appears Disconnected But Isn&#39;t</h2>
                    
<p>When I log off of my machine and log back on, Windows has trouble reconnecting my network drive right away.&nbsp; By the time I open explorer and click on the mapped drive i can see the files, but the drive shows that it is disconnected regardless.&nbsp; Normally
 this would not be a problem because all my files can still be accessed through the drive no problem, however a key program that must be used by my office, QuickBooks, refuses to accept that the drive is not actually disconnected.&nbsp; If I reboot my machine the
 problem goes away temporarily, until i log out and in. This is happening with several of the machines in my office.&nbsp; Other machines however are having no problems with it, and the problem doesn't seem to care which policy group the user or computer is in.</p>
<p>-I am running Windows 7 Professional 32-bit on all my machines.<br />
-The server is Windows Server 2008 with Exchange 2010.</p>
<p>-I have tried</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; changing group policy to start the computer after network is configured on the client machine</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Removing the S: Through Hkey_Local_Machine</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Removing mousepoint through hkey_local_machine</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; ensuring the atuodisconnect was turned off</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; and a host of other things i can't think of at the moment..... HELP!</p>

<h3> s2sap  say:</h3>
<h2>            Syncing Folders from pc and an external hard drive to onedrive business</h2>
                    <p>My PC contains 3 folders that backup to one drive - lets say they are on drive C on the pc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I have no more storage available on the pc I use an external drive to hold photos and videos etc - lets say that the external hard drive is drive E.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot place the files on E into the onedrive backup folder on the PC as there is no space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question can I have Onedrive look for two backup folders in seperate drives eg How do I backup Drive E as well as the already backed up Drive C. I cannot move the files from E to C as there is no space and I do not want to move the files currently on my
 pc on to the external hard drive?</p>

            Hi S2SAP ... Okay let me  make sure I understand.
<br />You want to back up E to onedrive in onedrive not to C correct?
<br />If so, backing up an external drive to onedrive your best bet is to get a backup software to do all this.
<br />I would suggest Veeam or Macrium.
<br />You would need to setup your onedrive as a mapped drive then run the backup of C and E to your mapped drive using the backup software.

<p>SarahKong&nbsp; &nbsp; Thanks for that but honestly that is too difficult for me to understand.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can I try getting an answer to a different question that might get me sorted</p>
<p>
</p><p>At present my onedrive has a backup folder on my pc and backs up files from that pc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to stop backing up files from my pc to onedrive and want to place the onedrive backup folder on an external hard drive that also contains all the files i wish to backup to onedrive - how do i do it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>does that make sense</p>

    <title>Downgrading from 8.1 to 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> rogerlindley  say:</h3>
<h2>            Downgrading from 8.1 to 7</h2>
                    <p>I built a new PC and bought/installed Windows 8.1 Pro OEM. &nbsp;After fighting it for over a month I finally gave up and decided to downgrade to Windows 7. &nbsp;I have a legal copy of Windows 7 Pro OEM installed on another computer so I used that media
 and key to do a fresh install of Windows 7 on the new computer. &nbsp;According to instructions, activation is supposed to fail since the key has already been used on my other computer. &nbsp;But the activation worked. &nbsp;No complaints from Windows whatsoever. &nbsp;Now I
 have two computers using the same product key and showing the same product ID. &nbsp;I have run the validation checker on both computers and it reports both to be genuine. &nbsp;I called Microsoft and the guy I got did not understand what I was trying to tell him and
 I could not understand his English. &nbsp;I asked for someone else but did not get to talk to anyone else. &nbsp;It was obvious I was not going to get him to understand my situation so I gave up. &nbsp;So now I wonder what will happen. Will one or both of my computers become
 disabled/degraded? &nbsp;Has anyone else run into this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going to include a couple of screen shots here of the two computer's system properties pages. &nbsp;One thing that puzzles me is that the downgraded computer shows a different windows logo than the old computer. &nbsp;Note the product IDs are the same.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First image is the downgraded computer. &nbsp;Second is the old computer.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f90e436d-ba26-49ad-99b0-869849a1f36d" /></p>

<p>
</p><p>Update:</p>
<p>The above images were compressed by the upload process and thus hard to read. &nbsp;If you open them in a new browser window then use your browser's zoom feature you can (at least I can) read them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I pursued this issue further with Microsoft through phone and chat sessions taking over 3 hours yesterday morning. &nbsp;I &nbsp;will spare you all the details but in general they just do not understand the downgrade scenario even after providing them a link
 to the downgrade instructions. &nbsp;They really tried but just did not know how to help me, even after claiming to have read the instructions. &nbsp;At one point they wanted to sell me a Windows 7 key for $40 even after acknowledging that I had downgrade rights according
 to the instructions. &nbsp;One guy asked for the Windows 7 key I used and came back with the following response:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Hi Roger, you have an OEM windows 7 Professional and has a limit of 10 activation and you have used only 2.<br />
Meaning you may still use this for atleast 8 times activation."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Never heard of that before, but that does not solve the problem. &nbsp;It still is not legal to have the software installed on two computers using the same key. &nbsp;And never throughout the whole 3+ hours did anyone ever ask for my Windows 8 key as they
 should have.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I gave up with trying to deal with Microsoft Support through these channels.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somewhere on the forums I saw references to running SLUI 4 so I tried it. &nbsp;And that led to what I think is the solution. &nbsp;If they had just said something about doing this in the instructions...</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I ran "SLUI 4" I got what you see in the following screen shot. &nbsp;I called the number and the guy actually knew what I was talking about. He had me read the installation ID (all 9 groups of 6 digits). &nbsp;(I altered the screen shot and put x's
 in the last fields in case for some reason I should not post these numbers.) &nbsp;After verifying verbally the installation ID he turned me over to an automated system which verbally gave me the 8 groups of 6 characters (A-H). &nbsp;Then I hit the next button and it
 came back that the installation was activated. &nbsp;The system then verified that my system was showing that it did activate and that was the end of it. &nbsp;I did not get to talk to the guy again or I would have asked some questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/842c4cd2-bfec-4f81-b810-2964cfe5b89d" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This guy did not ask for my Windows 8 key. &nbsp;All he wanted was the installation ID so maybe somehow the installation ID tells Microsoft that the PC previously had Windows 8 installed. &nbsp;I don't understand a lot of this, but I feel like I finally did
 what the instructions said so I feel like I should be legal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To follow up, I ran one of the key extractors and it shows the original Windows 7 key I used to do the install. &nbsp;So doing the SLUI 4 procedure did not change that. &nbsp;So in that sense I still have two computers using the same key. &nbsp;All I can figure
 is that the SLUI 4 procedure updated Microsoft's data base to show that this computer was downgraded from Windows 8 or something. &nbsp;I really don't know. &nbsp;But I did to the best of my ability follow Microsoft's instructions so I'm going to call it legal and go
 on. &nbsp;I just hope it does not come back to bite me later.</p>

            <p>Roger,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally!&nbsp; Someone who is struggling with the same vague instructions that I am.&nbsp; I am doing precisely the same thing that you are, and encountering the same problem.&nbsp; I have talked to 3 Microsoft activation "experts", and none of them had a clue what
 I was talking about.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am thinking about just continuing on and crossing my fingers that the other copies don't get deactivated.&nbsp; Have you learned anything more since April?&nbsp; Has either computer deactivated itself or caused any other problems?&nbsp; I have purchased 9 copies
 of Windows&nbsp;8 Pro (OEM) and trying to install all of those as Windows 7 Pro - so, same problem as you multiplied by 9!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!&nbsp; Greg</p>

            <p>Greg -</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been using both computers that used the same installation key for a few months now with no problems at all. &nbsp;Both get automatic updates just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you do the SLUI 4 stuff? &nbsp;I don't know if that was necessary or not. &nbsp;Also, I had installed and activated 8.1 on my new computer before I installed 7 so the computer was already in Microsoft's data base as an 8.1 computer before I did the downgrade to
 7. &nbsp;If you go directly to 7 on a new computer then it might work differently since Microsoft would not have the 8.1 key. &nbsp;In my case they must have had the 8.1 key since they never ever asked for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know of anything more you find out. &nbsp;I may have to do this again and would like to go direct to 7 without installing 8.1 first.</p>
<p>

            <p>Roger,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did not use the "SLUI 4" stuff, but by the description, it sounds like I was getting to the same screen by typing "Activate" in the Start Menu search and clicking the top result: "Activate Windows".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computers on which I have installed Windows 7 Pro (3 so far) all had Windows Vista on them.&nbsp; I never installed Windows 8 Pro on them - I just went straight to Windows 7 Pro.&nbsp; Microsoft has no record of these 3 computers having anything to do with valid
 Windows 8 Pro keys - they all validated with the same Windows 7 Pro key without even the opportunity to tell someone my Windows Pro 8 keys.&nbsp; The first one came pre-installed on my boss' laptop, I used it twice more on 2 of the computers and validated using
 the automated phone system.&nbsp; The 3rd computer forced me to talk to a 'validation specialist' (using the term VERY loosly!) at the same phone number.&nbsp; I explained the whole situation and what I was doing (just like I had done with 2 other MS people via online
 chat).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the 3 had a clue about what I was doing.&nbsp; One of them insisted that even though I had purchased 9 copies of Windows 8 Pro OEM (with downgrade rights) that the ONLY way to get Windows 7 Pro on 9 computers was to purchase 9 copies of Windows 7 Pro.&nbsp;
 I pushed the issue for at least 10 minutes (online chat) asking "What purpose does 'downgrade rights' serve, if not to allow you to use an older version of Windows without buying 2 copies of keys?"&nbsp; No matter how many times I explained it (in many different
 ways), she never could grasp the concept.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My plan (and believe me, I have tried EVERYTHING I can think of to do this the "proper" way, and HATE doing it this way) is to use other valid (and already used) Windows 7 Pro keys from other computers to install the remaining 6 copies - once one won't allow
 activation, I'll move on to the next one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have spent probably a total of at least 8 hours, simply trying to follow Microsoft's own instructions on how to exercise my downgrade rights, but they have forced my hand.&nbsp; I have to "fudge it" and then cross my fingers that no evil befalls any of these
 computers as a result.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you couldn't tell, I am EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; ;)</p>

            I certainly understand your frustration. &nbsp;It just does not make any sense that Microsoft never asked for the Windows 8 keys? &nbsp;We could have installed 7 without buying 8. &nbsp;That just is not how Microsoft does business. &nbsp;Is there anyone else listening that
 can explain this??

<h2>            windows 10 showing green screen</h2>
                    still having problem with windows 10 playing videos and its getting annoying. I did what Microsoft told me to do and nothing worked. I really like a lot of features on windows 10 but it isn't worth it because of my videos. I used internet 11 and Microsoft
 edge but nothing is working and now they are saying it is to late t switch back to my windows 8.1 pro. I paid over 100 dollars for my windows 8.1 pro when it first came out and now they are saying I cant go back to it. I hope this green and sometimes black
 screen is something that can be fixed now or I want to go back to my windows 8.1 pro which I never had this problem with.

<h2>            can i replace my original laptop screen with touch enabled one&#63;</h2>
                    i am planning to purchase a hp pavillion 15-p077tx laptop. this has excellent specs but the only disappointment is the non-touch screen. can i replace this screen with a touch screen after buying it or is it possible to order the model with touch screen
 itself? also if i can replace the screen , can i have a full hd screen replacing it?

            <p>Generally speaking no to both questions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from the screen itself most manufacturers only include the hardware components needed to drive the particular specification as in the original build. There is no guarantee that your main PCB has what is required.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Individual manufacturers may vary but HP quite often design the&nbsp;PCB to suite a range of models but save costs but only fitting parts to suit the order.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Instead of replacing the screen you could consider getting a second monitor with Touch enabled on it.&nbsp; E.g. the digitizing does not need to be done in the motherboard AFAIK.&nbsp; Another option that I have noticed some people describing is attaching a digitizing
 tablet, which apparently is not second display but somehow can extend the pointer to a normal monitor as if you were using a stylus on it.&nbsp; IMO using a stylus is the best part of using Touch and would be a much better experience than using a Touch pad for
 example.</p>

<p>I went through the troubleshooting, someone mentioned there were three known apps that cause these problems, my machine doesn't have any of these. So then I disabled the ROG system app, the slowed the flicker, but did not stop it. In the end I reset my machine
 and seems to be running fine now! Thank you all for your help!</p>

<h2>            Wibdows 10. Latest update ruined my computer.</h2>
                    <p>I was running Windows 7 Home Pro. During August 2015 I updated to Windows 10. I had no problems with this upgrade and everything worked perfectly. Only approved applications were installed. Now the new "November Update" was applied very recently. The result
 has been a disiaster!</p>
<p>My windows willnot start and keeps showing and error. I tried every solution on offer and eventually had to reset the computer. Windows 10 then restarted properly but of course most of the previously installed applications had been removed,</p>
<p>I then began to re-install applications as I needed them. Then right of the blue Windows 10 upadted itself again automatically! The same result occurred and I cannot start up anything anymore!</p>
<p>Before I reset the computer again can anybody please advise me of any work around available so that I can start Windows 10 in the normal way.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

            <p>dear zubaran</p>
<p>if you are just getting problems due to the new update.</p>
<p>Reset your computer while keeping the system offline and then disable automatic windows update using Group Policy Editor in Administrative Tools then the computer won't recieve updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are having problems on installing the apps which were running in previous versions of windows then try compatibility troubleshooter for installing those apps.<br />

            <p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Thank you for your last reply. Top say the least it was not very helpful you were encouraging me not to load any more updates, not so clever. After testing my ideas I found the work around is as follows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Reset windows 10. The reason it wont start is because the update will not allow it because of your old Windows 10.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Once reset go straight to Windows &nbsp;Update. The downloaded New Version update will still be there.</p>
<p>Start the new update. The computer will almost intermediately try to restart. However, this time the restart will be successful and the New Windows 10 program will self install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once installed, shut down the computer and then start again (do not do a restart you need to close the PC down.) Upon starting again the PC will continue to update and a shiny new windows will be the result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Zurbaran.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Update KB4093112 fails with error 0x80070643</h2>
                    I have an Acer Aspire TC-780 and for about a month now it has been locked in a loop every time I start it which is very annoying since it takes more than 10 minutes to boot.&nbsp; The problem appears to be the last version of the cumulative update for windows
 10 version 1709 for x64 based systems (KB4093113).&nbsp; It isn't loading and fails with the error 0x80070643.&nbsp; I've tried the Windows update troubleshooter, uninstalling my virus protection (McAffee) and doing a clean boot and nothing works.&nbsp;

            Hey David.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />You can also install the Updates manually that fail to install which are logged at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History, and then search for those to download and install from this Catalog:  <a href="http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=windows%207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/sit...</a>
<br />
<br />If they continue to fail and interfere, then you can block them using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a>
<br />
<br />What I'd do at this point is wait a few days for Spring Creators Update to be released, install Media Creation Tool from this link and choose Upgrade This PC Now:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> This is the most stable way to change to the newer version and because it reinstalls WIndows while keeping your files and programs in place, fixes most problems. It also brings all Windows Updates to date.  
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during install then these steps can overcome them:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />You can monitor the Windows 10 Blog here to get notified of the exact date for release of Spring Creators Version 1803 which is soon:   <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#utpDefLLBfmPO4gr.97" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/#ut...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Greg, thank you for the quick response.&nbsp; I think I'll take your advice and wait for a few days for the spring creators update.&nbsp; I've tried the "repairing Windows Update" piece to no avail.&nbsp; I've set my ethernet connection to metered to block the updates
 for a few days.&nbsp; I'll be back in touch after the spring creators update to let you know if it worked.&nbsp;

            <p>Drivers do not cost money, drivers are supplied free by your hardware makers.</p>
<p>American Megatrends is probably not your motherboard maker, but the BIOS chip supplier.</p>
<p>Did you run the win7 upgrade advisor prior to installing win7?</p>
<p>Belarc Advisor will provide a wealth of system info, including your motherboard make/model, and any sound card, if its not onbaord sound

References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</p>
<p>Stage 1 : Please do all the below even&nbsp;if you have done some before as it is often the total<br />
process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -<br />
REBOOT&nbsp;this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue<br />
below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose<br />
cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for you drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others<br />
do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some<br />
registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause.<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and the<br />
correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course<br />
as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as<br />
the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your
<br />
CD/DVD drive from someone with the same model.<br />

<p>Use DevManView to locate CD/DVD in registry (be careful and make a Restore Point before<br />
changing anything) - find the device in&nbsp;DevManView&nbsp;and then Right Click on it Open in RegEdit.</p>
<p>DevManView - Free - an alternative to the standard Device Manager of Windows, which displays
<br />
all devices and their properties in flat table, instead of tree viewer<br />

<h2>            RE &#58; Win_8.1 ScreenSaver &#47; Desktop Background Disable &#40;help&#63;&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I saw a couple of thread on here slightly relating to my question, but for different objectives.&nbsp; So I decided to start a fresh thread:</p>
<p>
</p><p>On my Win_8.1, I would like to conserve as much processing-power/CPU so that I can RUN my music recording (CUBASE ARTIST [DAW] and SIBELIUS 7) to the full potential.&nbsp; I have made all of the necessary POWER SETTINGS etc to my liking, no problem.&nbsp; But one
 thing I was recently warned about was that, on a Win_8.1, it is best to DISABLE any screensaver/background imagery one may have activated.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been into these settings but I am not really sure what is classified as being none/off?&nbsp; I see there is a choice of some
<em>basic</em> single colour back-drops so maybe this is what one might term as off/disabled?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, I can provide some screen-grabs if so required?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance (and also for all the continued kind assistance!) . . .</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul David Seaman (UK)</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern here in Microsoft Community. I would be happy to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description provided, I understand that you want to disable all the not necessary background applications and Programs while working on the software you have mentioned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to disable the screensaver option in your windows, please follow the below steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>A. Press the key combination&nbsp;Windows key +R&nbsp;from the keyboard.</p>
<p>B. Type in the following command:<br />
<strong>control.exe desk.cpl,screensaver,@screensaver</strong> </p>
<p>C. Select to <strong>None</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would also suggest you to place the computer in a clean boot situation to reduce any&nbsp;additional resources which may exhaust the CPU memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow below suggested steps and see if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. </span><span>To disable all non-Microsoft services consult the article called
<strong>Clean Boot</strong>.</span><span>&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>Follow: <span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">Note:</span></strong><span> After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting"</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Disclaimer: A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may
 also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a
 clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message, or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings
 may prevent you from following these steps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. </span><span>To disable any 3<sup>rd</sup> party unwanted startup programs in Windows 8 and above, follow:
<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/20119.how-to-enable-or-disable-startup-programs-in-windows-8.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the above information was helpful. However, if you want more information, we would be glad to&nbsp;help you further.</p>

            <p>Hi Sayan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much indeed for you helpful reply and LINKS.&nbsp; I appreciate that!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had a quick scan thru the article.&nbsp; If I just want to disable the SCREENSAVER imagery then do I really need to place the PC into CLEAN BOOT mode?&nbsp; I just wanted to check you you first?&nbsp; At present, I have turned of all NOTIFICATIONS, POWER SAVING
 OPTIONS, SCANS and UPDATES etc.&nbsp; In fact, when I am running CAMTASIA and the music (DAW) softwares, I am never connected to the internet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Secondly.do you think that all of the aforementioned software will actually work OK whilst in CLEAN BOOT mode?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Much appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Paul</p>

<p>
</p><p>I check with the music software manufactures and they will not RUN in CLEAN BOOT.&nbsp; I don't know about CAMTASIA 8 though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, I will only be able to DISABLE the SCREENSAVER etc.&nbsp; I did have a look/try, but I am really not sure how this is achieved because whatever I choose, the desktop imagery still remains!?</p>

    <title>Why do we need Window RT&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hoanglong tran  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why do we need Window RT&#63;</h2>
                    <p>According to Microsoft, the advantage of Window RT over Window 8 is that: The device will have a longer battery, a slim design, and an affordable price.</p>
<p>But lately, Samsung just announced its window 8 tablet with a battery that can last for 6 hour. Furthermore, its thickness is 8mm with the price at $700.</p>
<p>While Surface RT's battery can only last for 2 hours longer. Its thickness is 9.3mm, the starting price at $500.</p>
<p>*The advantages of Window RT over Window 8 are so blurred, not to mention Samsung window 8 device even beats Surface RT in the thickness contest. *While the disadvantages of Window RT compares to Window 8 are too many.</p>
<p>I think Microsoft should make the differences between them more clear otherwise they should just erase Window RT.</p>
<p>Let make the next Surface RT can last &gt; 15 hours on battery, 6mm thickness, with the price &lt; $400</p>

            <p>The Surface RT is here to compete with iPad.&nbsp; Long battery life (what is it, right now, 12 hours?), thin and lighter, and
<em>very</em> resilient to bad code (no viruses, uninstalling an app removes every trace of it just like an iPad app).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it has a great place, and I sure feel like it meets all my needs.&nbsp; But if the new haswell chips bring similar power/thinness to Windows 8 Pro, I guess I would of course pick that over RT.&nbsp; But right now I would always pick RT over Pro just so it's
 thinner, lighter, and quieter.</p>

            Hi Shawn, thanks for sharing your idea with me. The surface RT right now only can last for 8 hours according to Microsoft. And 1 more thing about Surface RT I don like is that the Tegra 3 is not strong enough to handle a number of game on the Market place
 such as Samurai vs Zombies :(&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p>It must be 8 hours continuous.&nbsp; I usually use mine about 3 or 4 hours a day and charge it once a week.&nbsp; But when it's asleep it must have&nbsp;a much greater standby time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a tough decision for me about whether RT should die. New chips from Intel that could run "full" Windows have almost or even the same power efficiency as ARM, but part of me really likes the resiliency of RT.&nbsp; Totally sandboxed apps that can't mess with
 each other. The system can't get "gunked' up over time and slow down, and quite nearly virus proof (never say never, right?).&nbsp; It seems to deliver the predictable performance&nbsp;and consistency that iPads/Android tablets do, and I sure like that.&nbsp; Even if I could
 get full Windows on a tablet, I'm not sure I would want it, I feel like I would be okay saving that for my desk PC.</p>

            Thank Shawn a lot, yeah you are right, RT get less chance to be infected by virus then Full Window version. This is a strength of RT. I think the Window Defender slow down the system but I don want to disable it since last week I&nbsp;visited a XXX website,
 and my Window Defender detected a virus and notified me. Haha. Hope Microsoft can allocate less resources to run Window Defender so it not affect the system performance

            Shawn has made some very good points about the Surface and Windows RT including that the
<br />
Surface RT is mostly competing against iPads.<br />

<br />
Four of the big differences there are Microsoft Office,&nbsp;microSD and USB ports, many more supported<br />
Printers,&nbsp;and the Price. For some multiple accounts will be a big plus.<br />

<p>Steve !, are you kidding me ???&nbsp; hard drives don't have password ???. Just gooling and learn some what man !.</p>
<p>Hard drive passwords are often in the boot sector of a hard drive and it is very difficult to remove it.</p>
<p>You must have a (USB) dongle or the right software to remove it (and those things are often illegal)</p>

            The question that I answered is about the password for a Windows administrator user account.&nbsp; Windows doesn't store user account passwords on hard drives.&nbsp; You don't have to know the password of the user account that wrote files to a hard drive in order
 to access the files on the drive.
<p>You might be thinking of an encryption key, which is used to encrypt the information on the disk. That's a completely different thing.</p>

<p>Assuming that the OP did not have encryption on his hard drive, it seems likely to me that when he removed it from the original computer and inserted it as a slave drive to his other computer, he is simply running into ownership difficulties and may be able
 to access the files if he takes ownership of them from his other computer</p>
