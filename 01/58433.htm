<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>80004001 error messages often appear as a result of cluttered Windows registry or faulty entries of non-existent programs which are usually due to improper software uninstalls. Other common reasons may include incorrect user input, missing files that were
 accidentally deleted from the registry and cause system malfunctions. Keeping track of when and where your error has occured is a critical piece of information for troubleshooting the problem.
<br />
<br />
In this case, we suggest running System file check. By doing so, the task will scan for changed or misplaced files. If sfc discovers that a protected file has been overwritten or corrupted, it retrieves the correct version of the file folder, and then replaces
 the incorrect file. Kindly follow the steps provided by <strong>ZigZag3143 (MS -MVP)</strong> on this
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/system-file-check-sfc-scan-and-repair-system-files/bc609315-da1f-4775-812c-695b60477a93">
link</a> to perform the task.<br />
</p>
<p>We also suggest that you use media creation tool to <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
access safe mode</a> to check that your hardware and driver are functioning. To do this, simply follow the steps provided on this

<p>
</p><p>If you received an email response that the information you provided is insufficient, I highly recommend to answer the form again. Please check the tips below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>The chances of passing the validation increase if you fill out this form from a computer that was previously used to sign in to that account, and was successful. Also, it is much better if you can do this process from a network location (i.e. home Wi-Fi
 or work network) where a previous sign-in occurred. </li><li>Be sure to use the information you had associated with the account originally, even if there were recent changes. The 4 basic information (First Name, Last Name, Birthdate and Current/Old Passwords are the best and easiest way to prove your Online Identity)
</li><li>Please be reminded that you just need to fill out information that you are just 100% sure and in the best of your knowledge. You don't need to fill out everything but make sure that you have provided enough for you to pass this validation.
</li><li>The 4 basic information is more than enough to prove your identity - as long as it matches the system's record.<br />
​</li></ul>
<p>

<p>
We are now 2019 and I am getting 240Mb throughput on a 1Gb internet connection.&nbsp; I was running 1803 out of the box and it was running at 480Mbps until it started downloading the drivers.&nbsp; I place an HP Spectre 13 beside the Surface Pro 2017 now with driver
 15.68.9125.57 on 1809 and the best speeds I am getting is 220-240Mb.&nbsp; I mean this is ridiculous that this issue is not being acknowledged nor worked on.&nbsp; Some people suggested to turn off bluetooth and check it again.&nbsp; That has no longer the desired outcome
 as the speeds do not increase.&nbsp; It is not my router as Microsoft likes to point out that the router might not be certified or compatible.&nbsp; This is the standard HiTron modem / router from Rogers in Canada and if it was the router how come it works well when
 I am not installing the driver pack...&nbsp; It is almost like it has something to do with QoS....</p>

<p>Games, the dashboard, and video apps have wildly different levels. I often find myself having to turn the volume up about 18-20dB when watching video content on the Xbox 360. They simply aren't compensating for differences in the way&nbsp;audio is mixed. Movie
 sound leaves a lot of headroom for effects and is expected to be played loud, so average dialog level there in a 5.1 mix is about 30dB below digital full scale.<br />
<br />
Surprisingly, Xbox 360 games don't leave as much headroom above dialog.&nbsp;All sound&nbsp;is typically louder and closer to digital full scale (some games even clip).<br />
<br />
So - unfortunately - those huge variations in audio levels between games and video apps are normal on the Xbox 360.</p>

<p>OP...though levels do vary amongst different programs, it should be direct applications, like games, that are louder. Many TVs have dynamic sound leveling, so check your sound menu for an option like a volume limiter, or Night Mode and turn that off.</p>
<p>.</p>

<p>Because I don't need an icon and a reward program to help out. And because that icon is increasingly becoming representative of gross misinformation...as your attempt to provide a solution shows.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>You want respect, Mr. Ambassador? At least learn enough to make your attempts to guide others worth something.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>You can start by not posting about things you have no clue on.</p>
. P.S. Not having some dinky icon means never having to worry about false niceties, either.

<p>Since I joined the ambassador program (6 days ago) I have helped 14 people that really do not know how to use the forums. They have told me that they feel better getting real time solutions exactly when they want. The only reason I joined is to help. I swear
 to god that I know all about the things I own and I am eligible to help everyone. That's the first mistake I have made. I started helping people out on the forums and just because I made that ONE mistake and just because I am an ambassador I get told off by
 some random guy that doesn't know me at all. Whats wrong with people!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>.tmp Files are&nbsp;created to temporarily contain information while a new file is being made. It may be created by&nbsp;computer programs&nbsp;for a variety of purposes; principally when a program cannot allocate enough memory for its tasks, when the program is working
 on data bigger than the architecture's address space, or as a primitive form of inter-process communication.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Some programs create temporary files and then leave them behind - they do not delete them. This can happen because the program crashed or the developer of the program simply forgot to add the code needed to delete the temporary files after the program is
 done with them. The temporary files left behind can accumulate over time and consume a lot of disk space.</p>
<p>Temporary files may be deleted manually.</p>
<p><br />
</p>

<div>Thanks for your reply but these rigxxx.tmp files are being created by the explorer.exe &nbsp;(Windows explorer) program - which has several dlls and subroutines that it calls. &nbsp;These files are not coming from an external URL.</div>

            <p>Windows Explorer displays the hierarchical structure of files, folders, and drives on your computer. It also shows any network drives that have been mapped to drive letters on your computer.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>It does not create/generate files on its own.</p>

</p>
<p>The file is a temp file.&nbsp; It is not known to me and search reveals nothing.&nbsp; I don't believe it is a virus.&nbsp;&nbsp; But to rule it out, I'd suggest that you reboot the system and begin tapping F8 key.&nbsp;

<h2>            Asus N10J-A1&#59; Windows 7&#59; LG HBS-700</h2>
                    I have an Asus N10J-A1 running Windows 7. I’ve been trying to get my LG HBS-700 bluetooth headset to work appropriately on it, but failed to do so thus far. As of now, my problem is that voices are rather high-pitched in stereo mode; everything seems normal
 in mono, but the sound quality is compromised. In addition, my computer tends to lock up when using either youtube or Pandora, which is primarily what I use sound for.

    <title>Xbox ONE Ground loop issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sly999_123  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox ONE Ground loop issue</h2>
                    
<p>Has anyone else experienced this??</p>
<p>I recently purchased a new Yamaha Receiver allowing me to connect all devices via HDMI. &nbsp;My Xbox One is now passing a charge through the HDMI cable, completing a ground through the coax connection from my (Xfinity) cable TV box. &nbsp;It's caused me to be shocked
 while handling my receiver and has created a hum noise in my subwoofer. &nbsp;The voltage is present regardless of my Xbox being powered on or off, and regardless of any other device in my system being plugged in. &nbsp;I've verified the voltage across the HDMI cable
 directly to the cable outlet on the wall, reading 3.2 VDC.</p>
<p>The voltage is passing through like this: &nbsp;HDMI output From Xbox ----&gt; AV Receiver HDMI Input 3 ----&gt; AV Receiver HDMI Input 2 ----&gt; HDMI output of Xfinity cable box ----&gt; Coax connection to the wall.</p>
<p>I understand that the coax from the cable company is introducing a "new ground" into my system, but should there still be a power output from the Xbox HDMI even when it's turned off? &nbsp;Microsoft customer service was no help.</p>

            <p>Sorry to hear it. &nbsp;This is definitely an odd situation and not something that I've encountered on the forums before. &nbsp;If you are getting a shock from your console then I would definitely disconnect it from the receiver and connect it directly to your TV. &nbsp;I would also contact the store you purchased the receiver from or Yamaha directly to find out about possible shorts within the receiver.</p>

<p>UPDATE: &nbsp;I installed a ground loop isolator (purchase from Amazon) which resolved the hum sound in my subwoofer, however, I recently started having internet modem problems. &nbsp;The modem started randomly rebooting for no apparent reason. &nbsp;I had Xfinity come
 test my system, and we verified that interference is being introduced into my cable lines from the XBOX one even though I had the ground loop isolator installed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I finally checked a loop between the xbox HDMI cable shielding to a screw on the outlet of the power receptacle the xbox was plugged into, resulting in the same 3.2VDC charge. &nbsp; Nothing else connected, just the console, power supply and Xbox HDMI cable.
</p>
<p>I will be heading to a local Microsoft store this weekend to process an exchange. &nbsp;Hopefully it isn't an issue by design and just a faulty power supply or console. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>UPDATE 2: &nbsp;Went to the Microsoft store and duplicated the problem in store (shot 3.2 VDC from HDMI cable, to a ground in the power outlet). &nbsp;Swapped out the power supply for a new one, and no voltage was present on the HDMI anymore. &nbsp;Completed the in-store
 exchange, no more issue.</p>

            Here is what I did. I installed a new hard drive...clean install...windows 8 would not activate and I did not have a previous windows. I called tech support at 1-800-936-5700, talked to a tech rep and he gave me instructions and a code to put it. Took
 5 minutes and it is activated. I would recommend to anyone that does a clean install of windows 8 pro that cannot activate to do what I did. Was simple and fast and fixed the problem.

</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp; I needed a new PC for various reasons - have been a windows user since day 1 and Windows 8 seems terrible.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wish I had known more about it before I bought my new p.c.&nbsp; I would have considered making my old pc work better.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your developers need
 to consider that a lot of us spend 8 hours a day infront of a pc at work (where upgrades are relatively infrequent) and we only use our home pc for a few tasks.&nbsp; Taking away functionality like this really slows people down and makes them cranky.&nbsp; Not a fan.</p>

<p>Ciao a tutti</p>
<p>intanto un po di dati</p>
<p>connessione ADSL con Vodafanone Station primo modello 7 mega (4/5 reali)</p>
<p>indirizzo ip fisso su xbox per eliminare il problema del nat moderato</p>
<p>connessione tra router e xbox tramite wiifi</p>
<p>Allora da piu di una settimana mentre gioco a MW3 la mia xbox si scollega continuamente dal live...."la connessione ai server xbox è stata interrotta"</p>
<p>da premettere che prima andava benissimo...mai avuto questo problema!!!!</p>
<p>unico cambiamento che ho notato è un calo di mega della velocita (2 mega circa)...ma non so se possa esser questo il problema</p>
<p>anche perche credo che altre volte la mia connessione non sia stata su 4o5 soliti, ma l'unica cosa che avevo notato era una certa lentezza nel connettesi al live!!!</p>

<h2>            In search for a touch-screen that is compatible with windows pen&#47;in &#40;for classroom setting&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am a student tech worker at OSU and I am in search for a regular 24 inch (or bigger) touch-screen desktop monitor that is compatible with Windows 10 PC and most importantly, compatible with Windows Ink/stylus pen. The setup is required in our integrated
 active-learning classrooms where the teacher ideally stands in front of a white-board, or in this case the monitor, and can freely write, draw, annotate et al. on said surface for the whole classroom to see on the big-screen (i.e we usually have projectors
 mirroring the desktop on large screens).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just for context, we currently have a Steelcase eno smartboard/pen system in our classroom which is quite outdated and inconsistent. The pen is used on a "smart" white-board and needs blue-tooth tech. to transmit whatever is being written on the board to
 the pc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or suggestions about this or any similar solutions would be appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

    <title>Wrong file order when &#39;casting&#39; music to my devices. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nevalti  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wrong file order when &#39;casting&#39; music to my devices.</h2>
                    <p>I have recently started using Windows 10 Explorer to 'cast' music (FLAC or ALAC) to my devices but unfortunately, it often gets the tracks/files in the wrong order. That is obviously unacceptable with most classical music.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, it may well try to play in this sequence:</p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 360px"><strong>06</strong> Allegro</p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 360px"><strong>07</strong> Finale</p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 360px"><strong>01</strong> Introduction</p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 360px"><strong>02</strong> Allegro maestoso</p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 360px"><strong>03</strong> Adagio</p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 360px"><strong>04</strong> Scherzo</p>
<p style="text-align: left; margin-left: 360px"><strong>05</strong> Poco Adagio</p>
<p>
</p><p>All tracks start with the usual sequential numbers (<strong>01, 02, 03, etc</strong>) in their track names, as above, AND also in their file names, as above plus '<strong>.flac</strong>' OR '<strong>.mp4</strong>'. All tracks also have sequential track numbers
 (1, 2, 3, etc) and all numbers for every track match as they should. I can see nothing in the rest of the track names to suggest that it may be sorting them alphabetically instead of the correct order. (Everything shown in bold above is just for emphasis.
 The filenames etc are obviously not in bold.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>No other equipment has any problem playing them in the right order, so why does Windows Explorer get it wrong?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Possibly a related issue: Sometimes it plays down the cast track list, as you would expect, but sometimes it plays just one track and then stops until you click on the next track........Why?</p>

<p>Hi - I do recall reading threads detailing similar issues back in Windows 7 - 8 days, (this included stopping after or repeating the first track) but I have not&nbsp;seen it reported with W 10.&nbsp;Anyway before I start digging, let's just rule out method (and possibly
 settings) -</p>
<p>What device are you casting to?(Make Model etc.)&nbsp;- and what system does it use? (Bluetooth&nbsp; etc.) - also when selecting 'Cast to' are you sending the folder or just the files? - You should also be able to rearrange the files in the 'Cast to' window if they
 have appeared in the wrong order.&nbsp; Update and we'll take it from there... Ric.</p>

<p>Thanks Ric.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am only really interested in my Musaic MPL which is a Qualcom Alplay device able to play 'any' file. &nbsp;I have however tried casting it to my Ruark R2 (an Undok device) or my Samsung TV (system?) or my Pioneer AV amp (system?) but the playing order is wrong
 on any of them so it does not seem to be related to the equipment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tend to cast the whole folder initially and then add folders or tracks to the cast-list. Sometimes it works perfectly and sometimes it does not. I played about 8 hrs of music yesterday without any problems and then I couldn't get it to play in order.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My file structure is generally something like: <em>This PC/Music/FLAC/Classical/Mahler/Symphony No 5/04 Adegietto.flac</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Casting from the 1st column of Explorer tends to be fairly reliable but casting from a lower folder level, in the next column, is definitely less reliable. &nbsp;Adding files OR folders to an existing cast-list is also unreliable no matter how I select them.
 If I select a bunch of individual tracks and drag them to the cast-list it very often fails to play sequentially and/or the file order gets messed up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, I can certainly rearrange the playing order by dragging the files around the cast-list but obviously I don't want to do that for everything I play. When you add files, they are usually not even visible because they are way down the cast-list. If you
 try to do it later, it is all too easy to mix up two similar folders when the next bunch of files starts with a high file number. For example, one CD may be &nbsp;tracks 01 to 07 and the next CD may, wrongly, start with 08 which is almost impossible to spot if
 the filename is similar.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thanks for the extra info - I'm not actually familiar with the Allplay or Musaic systems (I've checked online and it looks good!) but I'm wondering if there is not a better way to connect that rather than 'Cast To' which is a bit basic. I use&nbsp;Apple's Airplay
 (I have an iPad and a Marantz streaming system both of which support 'Airplay') and don't need to use 'Cast To' - I should have thought from my quick online search that Allplay should work in a similar manner to Airplay....&nbsp;Also with any Bluetooth based device
 you should again be able to sideline 'Cast To' and play directly from WMP (or any other media player) - Cast To is hopeless with conjoined tracks - it can take several seconds to move to the next track in a sequence... so for example you could have a problem
 with some Beethoven symphonies where one movement runs into the next. </p>
<p>I'd certainly look again to see if there is an alternative method of connecting using Allplay. Also, you could try 'cast to' from WMP rather than explorer...set up a sequence in the right hand 'Play' pane and click 'Cast To' from the menu above (to the right
 of 'Save list').</p>

<p>Thanks again Ric.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do prefer using an iPhone/iPad app to send music to the Musaic MPL but when I'm sitting at my PC, I don't always have my iPhone or iPad with me. Unfortunately, I am unaware of any Windows app that controls the Qualcom Allplay system which is why I have
 resorted to using 'cast to' when sitting at my desk. It obviously SHOULD work - so I do want it to work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although it CAN use Bluetooth, I use the Musaic MPL streaming directly from my PC or NAS and it will happily stream and play 24/192 hi-res tracks. The audio quality via the Musaic MPL is 'perfect' to my ears using my Benchmark DAC2 and every bit as good
 as the most expensive Linn or Naim etc streamers. With a good hifi system, and mine is good, the audio quality is vastly better than Bluetooth could ever be. Unlike Sonos, which always tries to manipulate the signal, the Musaic MPL really is bit-perfect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Musaic MPL doesn't work with Air Play. In any case, if I had my iPhone or iPad with me I would just use the Allplay app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>iTunes can't cast music nor can MediaMonkey. I hate WMP because it always wants to interfere with my metadata and it rearranges tracks how it sees fit rather than how I want them. I sometimes can't work out what om earth WMP has done and why. &nbsp;iTunes also
 interferes but I have more or less tamed that now. It still changes my album art though.&nbsp;</p>

            I might be able to help you sort out that last bit but it would be off-topic for this thread and anyway, as from tomorrow I'm away from the Internet for a week - but you could post a Q about it in the WMP section of the forum and I'll look at what's happening.
 I actually like WMP for library management - and <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
do</span> have it under control, so it is possible!&nbsp; Bluetooth is obviously not going to get close to what you can get with 'Musaic' but I should have thought the Allplay app should work from PC as well as mobile. I'll do a bit of digging&nbsp;when I have time...
 I'll check in on this thread when I am back to see if anyone more familiar with your set-up has chipped in. - Ric.

<p>I have not solved the problem but I have found a way to live with it without tearing my hair out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many of my tracks did not have track numbers by default. I have now laboriously inserted track numbers in thousands of tracks and the problem is halved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>:)&nbsp;</strong> IF I select a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">whole folder</span>, it now puts them in the 'cast list' in the correct order and it keeps the various movements of the Symphony together so that it plays properly. It does not get
 mixed up with other music already in the cast-list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>:(&nbsp;</strong> IF I select a <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">group of files</span>, which may well be exactly the same files as are in the folder, it frequently mixes them up in what appears to be a random order.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can live with this but it would be nice to understand why it goes wrong. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there, perhaps, some metadata hidden in there that I cannot see with MediaMonkey? I am VERY reluctant to try using any Microsoft programme to alter metadata as they always seems to default to 'correcting' my album art and of course it just messes it up.
 I don't want my music organised Microsoft's way, I want it organised MY way without mixing up the filler tracks with the main work. For example, I don't want to play a Beethoven Symphony and then automatically play a single Sibelius track which was added to
 the CD as a filler. I have all my composers filed separately and that is the way I want it to stay.</p>

            Hi - Yes that's a work around I have used in the past for playlists... Let's have a look at your WMP settings because I am able to set up all sorts of folders without any interference from MS/wmp. Having just got back from my 'break' (more a working holiday!)
 I've got a bit of a backlog but I'll get back on this tomorrow -&nbsp;if not later today because I'm interested to see what's going on! - Cheers, R.

<p>Right - I think I'm more or less back on schedule now, so let's see where we can go with this...
</p>
<p>Have you noticed in your second example <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
group of files</span> if the <strong>file type</strong> plays any part? I recall that FLAC files do still seem to have some tagging&nbsp;limitations so that could be a possibility.</p>
<p>I have never used <strong>'Media Monkey' </strong>although I know it is widely liked. Because I figured out how to get WMP to do what I wanted (rather than having it interfere) I have never really needed to look elsewhere. I use iTunes more as a player just
 because of 'Airplay' but WMP is still my preferred choice for library management.</p>
<p>With regard to examples like your Sibelius filler track, I often re-record items like this to a CD-RW and then it can be re-ripped with details added manually.&nbsp;I did this with the Von Karajan DG Classikon&nbsp;disc that combined Beethoven 5 &amp; 6 symphonies so
 that they became separate albums with tracks 1-4 and 1-5 respectively rather than a nine track combination. This denies WMP the opportunity to link it to the original source album, but it should also be possible to copy the Sibelius track to (e.g.) your

<p>Hi Ric</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am only allowing WMP access to my FLAC tracks on my E drive to avoid mixing them up the same tracks in other formats. I have all my music in FLAC and ALAC. I also have much of it in WAV and some in MP3 (all for different purposes). I also have everything
 backed up onto two different NAS. If I allowed WMP access to all my music I would get a list with multiple versions of albums, tracks etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am certainly not prepared to re-record hundreds of CDs onto CD-RW. That is far too much fuss just to attempt to get the casting working better. What is needed is for casting to be more reliable and/or the reasons for the problems to be understood.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All boxes in my&nbsp;<strong>WMP library</strong> screen are left empty. In <strong>
WMP security</strong>, the first three boxes are ticked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case I didn't make it clear, I have no intention of starting to use WMP. It does not do what I want it to do. Why fight it when everything MediaMonkey works exactly as intended?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

<p>No reason to start using WMP if you are happy with Media Monkey nor would I suggest you re-record existing stuff, but it&nbsp;might be a&nbsp;useful option for future reference... I'd recommend that you uncheck the second box in the 'Privacy' tab - the 'Update info'
 option can overwrite items you have amended (like artwork) but otherwise your settings match mine.</p>
<p>The 'Cast to' command seems to work independently of WMP anyway, and there are several different ways to initiate it. I have not been able to replicate the file disorder problem (so far!) but does it still happen if you initiate the file playback&nbsp;in WMP
 and then select the 'Play To...' icon from the 'play' tab?</p>

</p><p>Another issue, and maybe more important, is that under phones in the network file manager, I see a phone called 'angler'. &nbsp;&nbsp; When I look at the properties for this device it says that it is a Hawei (sp?) phone and I have never owned such an item. &nbsp; Is this
 something malicious and if so, how do I deal with it?&nbsp;</p>

<p>To remove a device from your network all you have to do is unplug it. Remove the Ethernet cable or the USB adapter. It will no longer be detected on the network. You're done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you see a device on your network that you do not recognize, you should be concerned. Is your network protected with an uncrackable password and a high strength encryption method, like WPA2-AES? Is your router's administration console password-protected
 with a different, uncrackable password? If the answer to either question is 'no' it's easy for anyone to use your network.</p>

<p>They appear there because the drivers are still installed - which means nothing. The devices aren't on your network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's akin to a parking spot with a sign saying 'reserved for Bulldog' but Bulldog doesn't work there any more. The sign has no practical significance and neither does the left behind driver.</p>

    <title>Windows 7 does not have the Auto Arrange Option&#47;or it does have - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lynhanduyen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 does not have the Auto Arrange Option&#47;or it does have this option but it can not be turned off.</h2>
                    
<p>So, why&nbsp;Windows 7&nbsp;turns off Auto Arrange&nbsp;? I feel very annoying that I cannot arrange the files/pictures the way
<strong>I</strong> want.<br />
<br />
Keeping files organised and having the <strong>option</strong> to is great but having it forced upon me is not! I keep the majority of my pictures/files in alphabetical order
<strong>but</strong> there are certain files/pictures which came from different sources and I access regularly and would like to keep out of sorting sequence made automatically by Windows 7.<br />
Was&nbsp;the Windows 7&nbsp;wiritten in such a way that the Auto arrange option is disabled? Or this option can be re-enabled. Please somebody helps with&nbsp;an answer!<br />
<br />
I know I am not the only user that feels this way as I have seen thread after thread asking how to disable auto arrrange within folders.</p>
<p>Thank You;</p>

<h2>            burning a dvd using windows media player__</h2>
                    I am trying to burn a dvd using windows media player.&nbsp; It says that my file is too big to burn.&nbsp; It is 1:57 long and the disc is supposed to hold 2 hours.&nbsp; I am guessing it has something to do with the codec that also had to be put on there as well that
 is making it too large of a file.&nbsp; Does anyone know what the max length is that a video can be to fit on a dvd?<br />
<br />
I have burnt this video onto a disc already once using windows dvd maker but when I tried to make copies with a disc burner it did not recognize the dvd so I know that the content can fit onto a disc.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
If anyone could help me I would greatly appreciate it.&nbsp; This thing is making me CRAZY!!!

<blockquote>Yes that is what I am wanting to do.&nbsp; The problem is the disc that I made using DVD maker plays beautifully in a&nbsp;dvd player but when I put it back into my computer it does not recognize that there is anything on the disc.&nbsp; I have contacted my computer
 manufacter and they say it must be something in the coding of the disc that got messed up in the software configuration.&nbsp; I have 65 copies of this dvd that I need to make.&nbsp; I have a multiple disc burner at my church that I can use to make the copies but I
 cannot get&nbsp;a master copy made that it will read to then make the copies.&nbsp; Like I said the one I made in DVD maker won't play in a computer and when I try and burn it in Media Player is says that the file is too big to be burned on a disc.&nbsp; It is a long DVD
 117 minutes so I am guessing that the codex for media maker is what is making it too big to put on the disc.&nbsp; Do you know exactly how long a video can be to fit on a disc with the codex?&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Thanks in Advance for your help!!!!</blockquote>
===============================<br />
Does your computer&nbsp;have more than one DVD <br />
drive?&nbsp; If yes...try the other one.<br />
<br />
Did you try ImgBurn? Maybe it will see the DVD?

    <title>Driver Installation Without MSI file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryangle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Driver Installation Without MSI file</h2>
                    I have an older Microsoft Surface Pro 2 computer with Windows 10 operating system that just suddenly lost control of the network adapter and can no longer search for or find any WiFi networks.&nbsp; I ran the network troubleshooter and it told me that the driver
 is missing for the network adapter.&nbsp; Going to the Microsoft surface driver page (https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/4023482/surface-download-drivers-and-firmware-for-surface) it tells me that "<span>An .msi file is not
 available for this device. You can manually download a .zip file instead." Well, now I've downloaded the files, but there isn't an .msi file to run to install them and I don;t know what to do with the files otherwise.&nbsp; I've tried hard resetting the device
 (holding down the volume up button and the power button for 15 seconds, etc.) and that hasn't fixed the issue.&nbsp; What do I do here?</span>

<h2>            Windows 10 error 0xc000021a will not boot</h2>
                    Upgraded to Windows 10. Worked fine at first. Now I am in the loop others have talked about. Can not get to desktop. Turn on and get blue screen trying to repair disk. error code 0xc000021a. I have pressed F10 and F8 and others to not avail. Sometimes
 if I press F11 at start up will go to screen that wants me to put in CD. I don't have this, as did update from Microsoft. One time when pressing one of these keys did get to my desktop. But i thought it was fixed so shut it down, and have not been able to
 get it to boot for a few weeks. This is so frustrating as this is my newest computer (less then 2 years old) &nbsp; I was running Windows 7 on this computer and it did not come with a CD, so I have no idea what to do next. I can't afford to buy another computer
 and the one I am using now is old and so slow. &nbsp;Any help would be appreciated. I feel like this is a Microsoft problem and why should I lose my newest computer cuz of this ?

            <p>Thanks for trying to help. So far nothing has worked. Made the media creation tool and the first time I put it in gave me choices. I should have picked Safe mode, but instead picked a boot one. That did not work. Now I can't get back to that screen. I get
 into the same loop. I started the computer and held down F11 in order to get the DVD to boot up. When it did get to a screen it was blue not grey and I got the square symbol till it either went into the same loop. I finally got to a screen that is giving me
 a choice of continue with upgrade, or do clean install. The upgrade does not work. I am scared to try the clean install as I don't know if it is going to wipe out all my files, or even Windows 7!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a CyberPowePC Gamer ultra GUA250. I had got a update on windows 10. I ran Advanced System Care Pro , and it said it needed to check my disc for errors of which it found one. So I think it was going to try to fix it on start up. Then it never would
 go to my desktop as Windows wanted to fix my disc. And hence this loop I am in. So now I don't have a clue what to do. I never had trouble with Advanced System care before. I have ran it on all the computers I have. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any more help you can give me would be so appreciated as right now the computer is just a big "brick" &nbsp;:-0</p>
