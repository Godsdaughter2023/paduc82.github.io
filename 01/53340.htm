<p>Why, when it is labeled as a full game does Crimson Alliance play as a trial? I can understand the characters being limited without the add-on packs, but the game itself only goes part way through the third scene and quits. If it had been labeled as a trial
 and not as a full game I would not have bothered downloading it. We just bought the system for our kids and this was supposedly part of joining Live Gold.</p>

<p>After talking to support it seems that they have posted this as a full game, but in order to actually play it you have to purchase the character packs to unlock the characters before you can actually play the game. This is wrong in so many ways. Makes me
 wonder why I even bought the x-box.</p>

    <title>SWAT 2 - Smartheap Library MEM_RESIZE_FAILED - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mcshortstuff86  say:</h3>
<h2>            SWAT 2 - Smartheap Library MEM_RESIZE_FAILED</h2>
                    <p>I'm aware that my question relates to software that isn't made by Microsoft, however I'm asking because I'm really keen to play SWAT 2 again.<br />
<br />
Recently I bought Police Quest: SWAT and SWAT 2 from gog.com, as a bundle. SWAT 1 seems to run OK, however I haven't tried going very far in to the game. However whenever I try to start a new career in SWAT 2, I get the error message MEM_RESIZE_FAILED from
 the Smartheap Library. I'm running a Sony Vaio on Windows 8.1 (if you need any more information than that, you'll need to tell me how to provide it because I'm not great with computers). On the webpage&nbsp;http://www.gog.com/game/police_quest_swat_1_2 you can
 see that the game is compatible with Windows 8, so I'm assuming it's not a compatibility issue. I have also tried running the game in compatibility mode on every version that there is available to me. There are other potential fixes that I've found, all listed
 below and none of which have worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) On the gog.com Blade Of Darkness forum here&nbsp;http://www.gog.com/forum/blade_of_darkness/startup_crash is a fix, however this doesn't work for me. The fix says to rename the video folder, which is in the Data directory. I can't find the date directory.
 I assumed that to find the directory, I would have to right click on the game logo, then left click "Open File Location". Is this not the way to find the Data directory?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) This http://www.gog.com/forum/police_quest_series/police_quest_swat_2_error&nbsp;is a thread started by me on the gog.com website, which hasn't helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) After contacting gog.com themselves for support, they have suggested all of the below, again none of it worked;</p>
<p>Starting in clean boot mod<br />
Running the game as administrator (right click, left click run as administrator)</p>
<p>Reinstalling the game &amp; adding it to my anti-virus/firewall software exception/trusted list.</p>
<p>Installing the June 2010 DirectX runtime package, then using the DirectX web installer. As a matter of fact, when I tried this one I got a message up saying that I have a more recent version of DirectX.</p>
<p>The advice from this gog.com thread http://www.gog.com/forum/swat_series/swat_3_movie_fix_possibly_for_swat_2_also however it is possible that I'm simply not good enough with computers to do this one properly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm pretty much at the point of admitting defeat, but I never actually beat this game and would love to give it a go again.</p>
<p>Many thanks all</p>

<h2>            Problems with internet and system events</h2>
                    <p>I am running windows 7 home premium service pack1. &nbsp;My daughter was using my laptop when an automatic update came up. &nbsp;When the computer restarted, she couldn't connect to internet. &nbsp;I went into network center and there is nothing listed. &nbsp;Once I restarted
 it, an error message popped up that says "Failed to connect to a windows service. &nbsp;Windows could not connect to the System Event Notification Service service. &nbsp;This problem prevents standard users from logging on to the system. &nbsp;As an Administrative user,
 you can review the System Event Log for details about why the service didn't respond."</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to roll back the newest updates but it didn't help. &nbsp;I ran Malware Bytes and it came up with no threats. &nbsp;There are 3 service that say starting: they are system event notification, TCP/IP netBIOS Hellper, and DHCP Client . &nbsp;I try to go into properties
 to start them and all options are greyed out. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can an someone please point me in the right direction?</p>

            <p>Hello Mike,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you have issues with the above mentioned error message. We will certainly help you in fixing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Firstly, check if the System Event Notification Service is running or not. To check for the services</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click on <strong>Start.</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the start Search box type <strong>Services.</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Right Click on - <strong>Run As Administrator.</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Check if the below mentioned services has the mentioned status and start up type.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;System Event Notification Service <span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Started&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Automatic</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Also, check the dependency services that are required for System Restore Service to run.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>To check that double click on the service and click on the dependency tab.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Also, if that doesn't help try to run the network troubleshooter and see if that helps. Follow the link below to do the same.</span></span></span></p>

    <title>Quicken 2016 Deluxe error 1723 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> foxdenvixen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Quicken 2016 Deluxe error 1723</h2>
                    <p>I have updated my computer to the latest version of Windows 10. I have had several problems since doing this. Context menu wouldn't show so I had to use CCleaner fix that. I can copy and paste but can't drag and drop from one folder to another yet (will
 figure that problem out later). Now Quicken won't work. I use FireFox to download my bank transactions and have it set to open Quicken with the qfx&nbsp;file. This worked perfectly before I updated Windows from version&nbsp;1703 to version 1803.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error I get when doing this is&nbsp;Error 1723:There is a problem with this Windows Installer package. A DLL required for the install to complete could not be run. Contact your support personnel or package vendor. ActionQuickenCustomAction_Uninstall_FirstCheck.entry:
 QCA_BeforeUninstallFirstCheck.library: C:\Program Files (X86)\Quicken\QCustomAction.dll</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have Quicken installed on my C drive. My C drive is for the OS. My D drive is for my applications and my G drive is for data, such as Quicken backup.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I first contacted Quicken to see how to fix the problem. I was told to uninstall Quicken and reinstall. I can't even uninstall it. I get the same error. I was then told that this is a Microsoft problem and Quicken support couldn't help me. I saw on a different
 post here with this same problem that I needed to take full control of the temp folder. I have full control but still have the problem. The only solution that I can see is to restore back to version 1703 and NEVER get the updates again. This did happen to
 me a few months ago when I was forced to update to version 1709. I had the same problems listed above and just restored back and found a post that showed how to turn off all updates. Somehow that recently failed because my computer notified me that it was
 updating to the latest version again.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have updated a laptop that only has one drive in it and everything is fine there. I am wondering if it is because I have several drives that I use for different things (i.e. C drive for OS only). Yes, I know when I install applications some automatically
 place files on the C drive, probably under appdata.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
At this point, I am at a loss as to what to do in order to get Quicken to work and still keep the update. Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW, I originally installed Windows 8 in 2015, which then updated to Windows 8.1 and got the free version&nbsp;of Windows 10 when it was available. I did not do a clean install. I just updated.<br />
</p>

            Hi, Foxdenvixen,
<br />
<br />Did Quicken suggest Using QcleanUI to Fix Installation Issues with Quicken for Windows
<br /><a href="https://www.quicken.com/support/using-qcleanui-uninstall-quicken" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.quicken.com/support/using-qcleanui-...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Use this fix to uninstall the application.
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17588/fix-problems-that-block-programs-from-being-installed-or-removed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17588/...</a>
<br />
<br />Have you tried going into a safe boot to uninstall Quicken?
<br />
<br />You might also launch Regedit which opens Windows Registry
<br />Use Edit &gt; Find &gt; Quicken
<br />Delete all references to Quicken
<br />You may then identify and delete the values associated with Quicken
<br />
<br />
<br />Note: Quicken is a non-Microsoft website. The page appears to be providing accurate, safe information. Watch out for ads on the site that may advertise products frequently classified as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Products). Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.

<p>Thank you for your quick reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used the QcleanUI and it seemed to uninstall the app from the C drive. It still shows installed on my D drive. I can access it. However, when I try to use the&nbsp;fix you linked to uninstall, it doesn't find it. I checked Control Panel &gt; Uninstall a Program
 &gt; and it is not listed anymore. I don't feel comfortable deleting registry keys for Quicken. I did look and most seem to be from the D drive installation. There are still a few that seem to be referencing the non-existent C drive installation. Examples are
 qfxfile&nbsp;&gt; Defaulticon&nbsp;&gt; Shell &gt; Open &gt; command on left side and points to Default C:\\Program Files (x86)\Quicken\qw.exe on the right side of the registry window. If I delete some registry items but not others because I don't know if it will mess up the D
 drive installation, how do I fix the problem?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I did try to download transactions again and don't get the 1723 error. It says that there is no installation of Quicken at all.</p>

<p>Yes, it isn't there. It is installed on the D drive (my app drive) but now I can't uninstall it from the Control Panel. I can take the folder and just delete it but I don't think that will work in removing ALL stuff related to Quicken so I can do a clean
 install again on my D drive. </p>
<p>
</p><p>To be quite honest, I have never had a problem with Windows updates breaking my computers in the past as much as has been&nbsp;happening to me lately with Windows 10 and it's versions after 1703.</p>

I'am using the .srt file for watching an english movie with Arabic subtitle. Opening the file to see if it is synchronized with the movie. But the text&nbsp; as i said, is&nbsp;weird.

            Perhaps&nbsp;because you do not have the font that would be necessary to view it - especially in "notepad".&nbsp; If you think you have whatever font/language pack would be necessary to view it - try it in something more sophisticated (even WordPad.)

<h2>            how do i remove passwords from faulty pc prior to returning it to the seller&#63;</h2>
                    I have to return a faulty computer with win 8.1.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had already set it up using my Microsoft account &amp; password.&nbsp;
<br />
I have been asked to remove any applicable passwords.&nbsp;&nbsp; I would also like to remove my e-mail accounts but am unsure of the best way to do this.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
I had nothing saved to the hard drive &amp; no downloads other than updates,&nbsp; I've cleared my history, browsing history &amp; disabled auto form fill etc.&nbsp; but do not know how to remove the passwords required on start up....&nbsp;

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You have several options the first option being the easiest.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>To reset your PC</strong></p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p><span>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, tap
<span>Settings</span>, and then tap <span>Change PC settings</span>.<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, click
<span>Settings</span>, and then click <span>Change PC settings</span>.)</span>
</p>
</li><li>
<p>Tap or click <span>Update and recovery</span>, and then tap or click
<span>Recovery</span>.</p>
</li><li>
<p>Under <span>Remove everything and reinstall Windows</span>, tap or click
<span>Get started</span>. </p>
</li><li>
<p>Follow the instructions on the screen.</p>
</li></ol>
Note
<ul>
<li>
<p>You'll be asked to choose whether you want to erase data quickly or thoroughly. If you choose to erase data quickly, some data might be recoverable using special software. If you choose to erase data thoroughly, this will take longer but it
 makes recovering data less likely.</p>
</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this works out for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Option&nbsp;#2</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Do a&nbsp;system restore and factory reset your computer.</p>
<p>( depending which brand of computer you have you may have either a restore disk or a separate partition on you computer that has a system recovery image)</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Susan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>That's not what they mean actually. What they're asking you to do is to clear passwords so that they can go to work on the machine without one popping up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So all you need to do is the following.</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Hit Windows key + R to open the Run command and then type: <strong>netplwiz </strong>
and click OK.</li><li>In the menu which opens, remove the checkmark from "<strong>Users must enter a username and password to use this computer</strong>".</li><li>Click Apply/OK.</li></ol>

    <title>Windows 10 Activation. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ericschlienger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Activation.</h2>
                    <p>I have an old Dell Optiplex FX160, solid state disk, no CD or DVD, running XP. I decided to try and upgrade it to Windows 10 for net support and sharing of a weather station. I set up a USB stick to do the install. At some point in the process I was asked
 to enter my product key. I had to abort the install when I discovered that the SSD wasn't big enough to hold the OS. It seemed that the easy way forward was to use WinToUSB to prepare a bootable USB drive. (The computer is only interfacing to the weather station).
 It works fine, except that I can't activate windows because the version of Win 10 I have was already activated during the install that failed when I was unable to make a large enough partition on the FX160.&nbsp; It seems that although I am running Win 10 on the
 same box, the bootable USB stick is the device that needs to be licensed. So, my question is how do I get my product key to be associated with the instance of Win 10 I am able to run on the old FX160? Microsoft lists the computer as being activated, but the
 Activation Troubleshooter from Settings simply tells me that I have to purchase the OS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<br />
<br />The key was never activated if you aborted the previous install.  You can insert it during install or skip it and activate afterwards in Activation Setings after you see how it runs.   You can also move a retail Product Key anywhere you want, reinstall as often as you want - just as long as it is only to one PC at a time.
<br />
<br />Use only the Media Creation Tool to create the media correctly:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Then follow these illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />This will help update you to what works best in modern Windows which uses entirely new tools and methods. 
<br />
<br />If this is the old XP PC then you won't need to worry about booting the media as an UEFI Device.  
<br />
<br />The key was never activated if you aborted the previous install.  You can insert it during install or skip it and activate afterwards in Activation Setings after you see how it runs.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg</p>
<p>I really appreciate your reply. I'm not certain how I activated the key, but Microsoft lists that computer and key as being associated and the key as being activated. Perhaps it was done when I used the media creation tool. I can't remember what I did, things
 seemed to be moving smoothly. It may have been associated with the fact that I was installing over top of XP thus requiring a full wipe as opposed to an upgrade.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything runs fine but Im told my version is not activated. Activation Settings simply tells me that my key is already in use, and as stated, this is consistent with the info in my Microsoft account. The Activation troubleshooter also says the key is in
 use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I move a retail Product Key? All I need is for Win 10 to recognize my key as valid. Basically I'd like to move it from where MS thinks it is to where it really is. (which are one and the same place)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks Again</p>
<p>Eric</p>

            Eric -
<br />
<br />Where did you buy the key?   If it wasn't from a major retailer or Microsoft then it could be fake or non-genuine like a Volume License Key that's only meant to be used by business.  But just attempting to install Windows on the same PC would not possibly use up the key.  If it's a retail key it can move anywhere you want.  If it's builder's retail OEM then it locks to the first motherboard it's installed upon. 
<br />
<br /> If Microsoft Support told you it's already in use then there's something wrong with that key and you should go back to the seller as they've committed a theft or are engaging in piracy which are crimes.  <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/cfr/report.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/cfr/r...</a>

    <title>Are you unable to purchase because of age restrictions&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> miss diggz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Are you unable to purchase because of age restrictions&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><em><strong>It says I’m underage.&nbsp;<br />
</strong></em>First the obvious question: are you underage? If you are, you can still gain access to T- and M-rated content on the Marketplace, but you will need your parents’ permission. They can set up your Online Safety settings to allow you access to content
 based on what they deem appropriate. Have them check out&nbsp;the Parent’s Guide&nbsp;for more information on these settings.</p>
<p><em><strong>I created the account when I was underage, but I’m not anymore.&nbsp;<br />
</strong></em>If since creating your Xbox Live account you have reached the age of maturity in your region (Happy Birthday!) then you can “promote” your account to a full adult account. The process is simple and should only take a couple minutes to complete.
 You will need to perform these actions on your console.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Navigate to the&nbsp;</span><strong>Settings Hub</strong><span>&nbsp;on the dashboard and select&nbsp;</span><span><strong>Account</strong>.</span>
</li><li><span>Navigate to the&nbsp;</span><strong>Your Information</strong><span>&nbsp;panel and select&nbsp;</span><span>Promote
<strong>Account</strong>.</span> </li><li><span>Select&nbsp;</span><strong>Yes</strong><span><strong>&nbsp;</strong>to connect to Xbox Live.</span>
</li><li><span>Review the prompt and select&nbsp;</span><strong>Continue</strong><span>.</span>
</li><li><span>Review and accept the Terms of Use.</span> </li><li><span>Check the boxes if you would like to receive info from Xbox.com and its partners.</span>
</li><li><span>Your account is now officially all grown up!</span> </li></ol>
<p><em><strong>The “Promote” option isn’t there.&nbsp;<br />
</strong></em>Either you are already promoted or you are not old enough to be promoted. &nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>But I’m not underage!&nbsp;<br />
</strong></em>Here’s a less obvious question: how old does Xbox Live&nbsp;think&nbsp;you are? When you created your account, you were asked to put in your birthday. If you are using a hotmail.com or live.com email address, it may have automatically added the year, but
 still asked you for the month and day. Once set, this is your birthday and cannot be changed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, if you set the birthdate wrong, your account may treat you as a child based on this information. If it is incorrect you will have to create a new account with the correct information or wait until your account reaches the appropriate age of maturity
 for your region and then promote your account.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>I don’t remember what birthdate I put in.&nbsp;<br />
</strong></em>At this time there is no way for us to provide you with this information. If you can’t remember what birthdate you put in and you are now getting age-restriction messages when trying to purchase content, you may have accidentally put in the wrong
 date. The only way to fix this experience is to create a new account with the correct birthdate.</p>

    <title>Programs automatically closing with no error message - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timtom22  say:</h3>
<h2>            Programs automatically closing with no error message</h2>
                    <p>I am using Windows XP - Intel Core 2 Quad CPU 2.83 GHz</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the last week I have started having problems with programs automatically closing without error messages appearing on the screen. There is nothing in the event log. Scans for malware and viruses showed nothing. Other then doing routine windows updates
 no new software was installed. The programs worked OK on March 6th. However, in the last week they are closing when I try to do a action. Quicken 2013 closes when I try to download transactions, directly to the program or as a file to apply later. Perfect
 Registry 2.0 closed after applying fixes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the programs did work correctly 2 weeks ago - the last time I ran them. I have reinstalled them with no luck. I have reinstalled Java, and checked the versions of Microsoft NET Framework.. They seem to be the latest. I use Norton 360 - it is up-to-date,
 it made no difference if I deactivated the firewall and antivirus protections.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I thought about removing and reinstalling all versions of Microsoft NET Framework. However, I thought it a good idea to get some advice before doing that.</p>

            <p>Thank you for the reply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had assumed that since the working file and a recovered backup file gave the same problems that it was not the data file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quicken support got me to create a new data file and it worked ok.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The backup file was made after the last enties had been made. Therefore, if the working file was corrupt, the backup I created would also be corrupt. I restored a backup file from two months ago. I was able to download all transactions with no problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The problem was the data file from March 6th.</p>

    <title>NVIDIA Dual Card &#40;Code 43&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> lloydboyette  say:</h3>
<h2>            NVIDIA Dual Card &#40;Code 43&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I am sure this topic has been beat into a pulp, however, after tirelessly searching through posts I have still not resolved this problem that I am having.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Setup:</p>
<p>Intel Core i7 running Windows 10 PRO version 1511 build 10586.29</p>
<p>Installed RAM 32GB</p>
<p>Video Cards: 1. NVIDIA 760 Running 2 monitors for gaming [main]</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;2. NVIDIA 570 Running 1 monitor for "other" [secondary]</p>
<p>
</p><p>The night before last I wiped the computer clean and did a fresh install of Windows 10 as an upgrade from my already paid for Windows 7 Ultimate. I installed Windows 7 and all necessary bare bones drivers such as graphics, chipset, SATA, USB and LAN. Everything
 was working fine with all three monitors. As soon as I finished the upgrade to Windows 10 the secondary card stopped working with the infamous "Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before anyone says this setup will not work let me say that before I did this clean install, I was running Windows 10 with all 3 monitors just fine and no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Solutions that I have implemented with no problem resolution...</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. R-Click and Disable / Re-Enable [failed]</p>
<p>2. in Device Manager~Uninstall 570, Scan for Hardware Changes and Re-Install [failed]</p>
<p>3. in Control Panel under programs~Uninstalled all NVIDIA Drivers and Reinstall latest [failed]</p>
<p>4. in Safe Mode using DDU from Guru3d.com, wiped NVIDIA off the hard drive and re-installed after verifying all NVIDIA files were deleted. [failed]</p>
<p>5. in Device Manager~ Update Driver Software from local software and picking from list [failed]</p>
<p>6. from shut down~ Swapped card positions. The 570 became the primary and worked just fine. The 760 picked up the same Code 43. Returned the computer back to its original state. Same Code 43 present [failed]</p>
<p>7. from shut down~ pulled the CMOS battery and wiped BIOS settings. Flashed the BIOS to the latest from ASUS. Reloaded optimal default settings and reset my memory settings back to DDR3 1600. Same Code 43 [failed]</p>
<p>8. Downloaded CPU-Z and verified voltages in both BIOS and CPU-Z. Everything is fine. [failed]</p>
<p>9. from Windows Logo Key+X and using Troubleshooting searched for fixes. Applied all recommended. Same Code 43 [failed]</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am at a loss here folks. I have gotten to like Windows 10, however, if this Code 43 isn't resolved somehow I am going to revert back to Windows 7 Ultimate. As I stated above.... before I did this clean in stall I was running Windows 10 with all 3 monitors
 and no issues. Now that I have reloaded everything Windows is giving me the middle finger on my third monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help, guidance or solutions would be much appreciated. Thanks for your time. :)</p>

            <p>Good evening Rob.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am an A+ Certified tech and have poured over the NVIDIA forums. ( I kinda figured the first response would be pointing away from Windows saying it was their fault ) I strongly believe that this is a Windows issue. I have ensured that both the latest and
 oldest available drivers have been installed and tried. Using DDU in safe mode I wiped out the NVIDIA drivers and tried the oldest available... Same CODE 43. Using the same DDU in safe mode I wiped out the NVIDIA drivers and reinstalled the latest available
 drivers.... Same CODE 43.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had run this configuration before with Windows 10 with no issues. In Windows 7 everything works fine. On my other hard drive running Windows Linux everything runs with no errors on all 3 monitors. ( It's not a dual boot ) As soon as I went from 7 Ultimate
 to 10 Pro I picked up the Code 43.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of those links you provided aren't helpful. We need to be exploring the Windows side of the house.</p>

            <p>Just to rule it out.... I went back and using the DDU each time did a clean install of the following drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>353.30 Installed normally. Same issue. 2nd card CODE 43</p>
<p>353.62 Kept downloading the 7/8 version even though I chose Windows 10 and would not install.</p>

<p>
</p><p>and now the latest</p>
<p>
</p><p>359.06 Installed normally. Same issue. 2nd card CODE 43</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't get it. I did go back and read more forum posts and implemented a solution I hadn't tried yet. Using the NVIDIA control panel I disabled&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">multi-GPU mode. It was in a post from

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
There may be a problem with multiple monitors in Windows 10 however I have</p>
<p>not seen one. If there is a Windows issue Nvidia Support would still be the best<br />
source of information. And most of these problems usually are the available <br />
drivers which are written by the OEM card/device maker.<br />
<br />
So I would check with Nvidia Support and their forums before trying Microsoft<br />
Higher Level Support which is not likely to be free for such an issue.<br />

            Hi  AlB117,
<br />
<br />Right click an empty part of your Taskbar, choose Taskbar settings
<br />
<br />On the resulting Settings page, click 'Turn System icons on or off'
<br />
<br />Is the Action Center icon turned off there?
<br />
<br />
<br />If that is not the issue:
<br />
<br />Option 1 on this page should work for you:

<p>No, because netflix, realized that party mode, basically let anyone without a netflix watch it as long as one person had an account.</p>

<p>I never utilized it so I'm not to sure...unfortunately a lot of my friends don't share movie tastes....live stream and /x/ were my preferred choice but hopefully it returns because it sounded like a great feature that could be great for a family separated...
 Can you say family movie night</p>

<p>Wow mega..didn't realize that...surprising since Netflix is pretty liberal with the number of machines you can have on one acct... I have 360, wii, wii u, PC, 3ds, iPad, and a tv all connected... I always thought that was way generous...maybe because they
 all started on same ip?</p>

<h2>            Oblivion don&#39;t load the DLC</h2>
                    <p>Hello.<br /><br />I installed Oblivion, as instructed here on my Xbox ONE in the Game of the Year Edition (German) installed:<br /><br /><a href="http://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/37009/~/how-do-i-install-the-elder-scrolls-iv%3A-oblivion-dlc-on-xbox-one%3F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/37009/~/how-do-i-install-the-elder-scrolls-iv%3A-oblivion-dlc-on-xbox-one%3F</a><br /><br />Also, I have emptied the cache and re-installed the game (Disc 1 and than 2) and yet I will not see the DLCs when I use Disc 1 to play. If I use disc 2, however, I have the DLC but no language Sound.<br /><br />What do I need to do to play Oblivion on my XBox ONE with DLCs and Addons?</p>
