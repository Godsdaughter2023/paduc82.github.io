    <title>SChannel Event &#35;36885 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hiballer  say:</h3>
<h2>            SChannel Event &#35;36885</h2>
                    My event viewer has a load of these warning events which have just started showing up after the last round of updates.&nbsp; The text is:<br />
<br />
"When asking for client authentication, this server sends a list of trusted certificate authorities to the client. The client uses this list to choose a client certificate that is trusted by the server. Currently, this server trusts so many certificate authorities
 that the list has grown too long. This list has thus been truncated. The administrator of this machine should review the certificate authorities trusted for client authentication and remove those that do not really need to be trusted."<br />
<br />
I've taken a look at the list and thinned it out somewhat.&nbsp; There are now 212 items in the list (started with over 350).&nbsp; I am still getting the warning.&nbsp; Is this indicative of some other problem, or is this "normal" now?<br />
<br />
Also, there is an "Export" feature which saves the list in tab or comma delineated TXT files, but I am unable to find an "Import" function just in case I delete something I shouldn't.&nbsp; I've taken a look (and printed out) the "must keep these certificates to
 make Windows run" list.&nbsp; So, what good does it do to Export the list?<br />

            <p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for reaching out to Microsoft Community!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Based on the description provided it looks like the Schannel event error is generated. However, to guide you in the right direction, I will need few more information about this issue to assist you further. Please help me&nbsp;answer these questions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span><span>1. </span></span></span><span>Which browser do you use?</span></p>
<p><span>2.</span><span><span><span> </span></span></span><span>Were there any changes made to the computer prior the issue?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Here are the steps </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Note: Schannel means<strong> secure channel.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Schannel uses TLS for security encryption. As long as the sites you visit do not use TLS.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Follow the steps if you use Internet Explorer:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>1.<span> </span></span></span><span>Open<strong> Internet Explorer.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span> </span></span></span><span>Click <strong>Tools</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span> </span></span></span><span>Click <strong>Internet Options.</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span> </span></span></span><span>Click <strong>Advanced</strong> tab.</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span> </span></span></span><span>Scroll down the list under <strong>
Security</strong>, <strong>uncheck</strong> all the <strong>Use TLS</strong> options.</span></p>
<p><span><span>6.<span> </span></span></span><span>Click <strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Now restart the computer and check if the issue still occurs.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, then I suggest that you optimize the internet explorer settings on the computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Follow the steps in the link below:</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>How to optimize Internet Explorer: </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/936213</span></a></span></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>If the above steps do not help you, then you may try resetting the internet explorer settings on the computer, you may download the Microsoft fix-it from the above link which automatically resets the browser settings to default settings on the
 computer</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Note:</strong> The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might reset security settings or privacy settings that you added to the list of Trusted Sites. The Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature might also reset parental control settings.
 We recommend that you note these sites before you use the Reset Internet Explorer Settings feature.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this information helps. If you have any queries related to Windows feel free to post here at Microsoft Community.</p>

            My browser is Firefox.&nbsp; I do NOT use IE for anything.<br />
<br />
In the Internet Options (under Control panel) all the "use TLS" checkboxes are already unchecked.<br />
<br />
I can clearly see that it is the SChannel that is generating the error, but the error message is telling me my "list" is too long.&nbsp; OK, I can understand that, but how "long" is "long"?&nbsp; 50 entries, 100 entries, 200 entries, what?<br />
<br />
Also, I seem to be able to Export all the certs, but there appears to be no way to Import them back again.<br />
<br />
EDIT:&nbsp; I have noti8ced that the Info entry in the System panel of the Event Viewer immediately preceding the SChannel error is the WinHTTP Web Proxy Discovery entering the running state.&nbsp; This happens every time there is an SChannel error.&nbsp; Could the WinHTTP
 Proxy Discovery be triggering the rrror?<br />

<br />
My third paragraph in the OP probably wasn't clear, but I did thin the list in accordance with that very page you linked to me.&nbsp; Nowhere in any documentation can I find out how MANY entries in the list constitutes a "lot", which is a subjective phrase meaning
 nothing unless there is a quantity given.<br />
<br />
The error states the list has been "truncated".&nbsp; Well, where was it "truncated"?&nbsp; At 50, 100, 150, what?&nbsp; Do you know?<br />

            <p>Hi Bill,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for the reply. As you get these errors continously, try these workaround and check:</p>
<p>Important this section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection,

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Navigate to the following path in the registry editor and change it's value from 1 to 0 and check.</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\SecurityProviders\SCHANNEL</p>
<p>Change the Event logging entry to 0.</p>

<br />
I can do that, and probably will, but that doesn't shut off the REASON for the error to keep popping up.&nbsp; It would be similar to disabling the oil pressure light on your automobile engine because it keeps lighting up and annoying you.&nbsp; Eventually, the reason
 it is lighting up will cause a failure.<br />
<br />
I hate to keep asking but does anyone know how many entries in the list will force it to be "truncated".&nbsp; I would really like to know this.<br />

            <p>I know this an old thread but I found it as I have the same issue.</p>
<p>Regarding Importing certificates, I found you can Import Certificates.</p>
<p>The easiest way is to right click on a Certificate Store such as Personal, and click All Tasks.</p>
<p>Import is an option in All Tasks (when a Certificate Store is selected).</p>

<h2>            Resident evil 5 xbox one achievements not unlocking</h2>
                    <p>I did the requirements for 2 achievements over a week ago I was online and they are just not unlocking. I've cleared storage, cleared cache, uninstalled&nbsp;profile the reinstalled and lots of other things but absolutely nothing is working. The achievements are 'They're ACTION figures' and 'Let's Get This Party Started!'. They are not achievements that I can obtain again. I have bought every single thing in the bonus features and all the figurines come up in my collection and all the characters come up in versus mode but no achievements. I am getting seriously pissed off now and just don't know how to unlock them.</p>

<h2>            Vender&#47;transferir jogos comprados na live</h2>
                    
<p>Procurei em alguns foruns e nao consegui uma resposta pra minha pergunta mais especificamente.</p>
<p>Comprei um DC2 faz uns 2 meses, e queria passar meu direito de download para um amigo pois vendi meu kinect pra ele.</p>
<p>Li que posso transferir a licença de um console para outro, mas fica sempre vinculado a uma conta. ok</p>
<p>Mas transferir a licença pro X dele e fizer o download com minha gametarg ele não vai conseguir jogar utilizando, DEPOIS, a gametarg dele?</p>
<p>Se não, significa que ninguém pode jogar o jogo baixado a não ser aquela pessoa que o comprou? ou seja, havendo outro perfil no console, este não poderá jogar? Seria tosco....</p>

<p>Consigo jogar na minha conta normal pois ele baixou no console.</p>
<p>MAS e se eu deletar um desse jogos baixados, pra liberar espaço no HD. e posteriormente tentar realizar o Download desse mesmo jogo, eu não conseguirei, pois o download esta vinculado a conta do dono anterior, correto?</p>

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will be purchasing mini PCs with MS Windows 10 Home and be deploying it to my clients.</p>
<p>It will be used only as media player.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I am from the Philippines.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You can definitely use Windows 10 Home if you will only use the basic features. You can refer to

<p>Prasanto,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, it is legal.&nbsp; You can see for yourself in the licence that you will find on every Windows 10 computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is where mine is - <em>C:\Windows\System32\en-GB\Licenses\OEM\Core\license.rtf</em> - so go to
<em>C:\Windows\System32 </em>then drill down through its language selections to get to your licence.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my version of the licence, the relevant para is 13d which specifies those versions that cannot be used for commercial purposes.&nbsp; The right to use other versions for commercial purposes is therefore an "implied right"&nbsp;in many jurisdictions but I have no
 idea about yours.&nbsp; If you require any further reassurance beyond your own study of the licence document then you will have to seek the advice of a legal professional.</p>

    <title>How to prevent windows from turning defrag and indexing back on after - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> davidblank2  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to prevent windows from turning defrag and indexing back on after windows update</h2>
                    I currently have 4 240Gb SSD's running in a raid 0 configuration. I have deragment/optimize on a schedule turned off as well as file indexing due to having SSD's. Windows does not trim these, it defrags them which eats away at my SSD life. When I had just
 one SSD it would trim them which took all of 2 seconds, but once I started using RAID it defrags. (takes longer 5-15 minutes) File indexing is also unnecessary and gets turned back on after every single update. How can override windows for re enabling this
 default behavior after every major update?&nbsp;

            hi David.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Type Optimize in Start Search, open Optimize Drives panel, highlight drive, then choose Change Settings, uncheck the boxes, click OK.  This should turn it off.
<br />
<br />I would not run RAID.  After ten years daily in forums I have seen nothing but problems with RAID.  Even the first letter of it's acronym is faulty because if one drive fails then almost every case I've seen has lost all of their data.  So there is no need for the risk with today's modern larger drives and SSD's, modern backup.
<br />
<br />If you do keep the RAID be sure to keep a real time backup to the Cloud which is fire and theft proof, in addition to any external backup.
<br />
<br /> I'll be standing by here to help as needed with any of the steps, and will continue to help until the problem is resolved.

This will not work, as this is exactly how I disabled it before, and how its currently disabled (this morning I remembered there was an update last week and went there to discover it Re enabled) every update turns it back on again. Is there a registry key Or
 group policy i can modify?
<p>
</p><p>Your concern for my data is noted but I learned long ago not to get attached to it and to back up to one of my larger Internal HDD's, not running in raid, And I have privacy concerns with cloud storage.

</p><p>Wont know till the next windows update. Guess that depends on weather windows modifys that section of the registry upon update. But if windows ends up reverting this, i may just be out of luck.

            TBH this is the first time I've seen this, since Drive Optimization usually carefully avoids defragging SSD's.  It must be some anomaly caused by the RAID.  
<br />
<br />Keep me posted.  I may escalate this via MVP channels based on what you report. 
<br />
<br /> If you want to report this to Microsoft use the Feedback Hub app in Start Menu where developers are tasked to process consumer feedback. They will not even see it here. This is a tech forums staffed mostly by volunteers trying to help others with your problems.
<br />
<br />If you want to post back a Share link from your Feedback here others who see this thread can vote it up and add to it. If you join Insider program, I can will also vote it up with my MVP badge and track the issue for you.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What is the make and model of the phone?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you connect a phone, you need to select the appropriate settings in it so that computer can access the data. Make sure you have set the proper settings so that computer identifies it as a storage device. You may contact the phone
 manufacturer for help with settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you using any phone software on the computer to read the device?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are not using any software, try to install the software provided by the phone manufacturer and check if you are able to access the files through it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let us know the results. If you have any further issues on the computer, please post your question regarding Windows and we will be happy to help you.</p>

<h2>            Annoying pop up box asking me what app I wanna use to open my programs</h2>
                    <p>Just recently, without any warning, my computer with OS Windows 8.1 now asks me with an annoying pop up box "what app do I wanna use to open this program?" I cannot open any of my .exe programs/applications. I am able to connect to the internet and my EBAY
 accounts , Microsoft account, etc. . It seems my user account controls have been changed(?) I also read somewhere that when installing a installer or uninstaller to your computer could change the user account controls. Can anyone verify this for me? Just about
 10 minutes before my computer went weirdo on me, I installed&nbsp; then uninstalled 2 different installer/uninstaller&nbsp; programs. I uninstalled them b/c when I trioed to install them on my computer, a box popped up saying they will not configure on my computer.
 So any program(.exe files) I try to open or run, it rtries to open with Notepad which I accidentally clicked by mistake in my fustration when the annoying box popped up. Please help!! Is there an easy fix I can do for this? I am not computer saavy &amp; dont wanna
 take my computer in to the repair shop. Am I right about the user profile controls being changed/compromised? And is this fixable for someone who is not computer saavy? I started to read a help page somewhere in the Microsoft guide, which was only one page
 scrolling down maybe 1&amp; a half more times. I got about 3 or 4 sentences into it&nbsp; &amp; then quit b/c of all the computer terms/lingo which I have no clue what the hell they're talking about. I am lost. Someone please find me &amp; help me get back to normal. Please
 &amp; thank you. </p>
<p>
</p><p>PS- I can open my pictures &amp; videos and get to my browser to go online, but my apps/programs or anything that is an .exe file I cannot access. That includes my windows restore&nbsp; &amp; my windows recovery. Also, whenever I right-click an item, the option of "run
 as an administrator" is missing.</p>

<p>Bill,</p>
<p>&nbsp; I cannot get these ways to work. To reinerate, I cannot access my windows recovery or restore. ALL of my .exe programs open with Notepad. Whenever I try to open one, the notepad box pops up with a bunch of jibberish.. bunches of letters &amp; numbers that
 dont make sense. furthermore, I cannot open command prompt b/c it too opens with notepad. What I reaslly want to open is my tweaking.com program "Repair windows", but it gives me the same damn notepad box w/ jibberish. I cannot run my Advanced Systemcare Ultimate
 10 from IOBIT which I use 3 times a day. I cannot use my IOBIT driver booster, malware scanner, smart defrag.. . all of which I use on a daily basis. My logicamera, ccleaner, flickDVD, IOBIT uninstaller, boost + many others I canot use or access And all of
 these programs or .exe files have the notepad thumbnail icon on my desktop and in the listings, which shouldn't be for any of them. Doesn't this sound like a "User Control" problem? I clicked on the link you sent for 5 ways to boot into safe mode, but they
 wont help me if I cannot accesss certain .exe files. I need to change the .exe files to open with their proper channels instead of notepad. How can i do this with out taking my computer to the repair shop? and i cannot sign into my administrators account.
 And when I right-click on anything to bring up the menu box, the option to "run as administrator" is not present &amp; missing.. .which also makes me believe it's an User Account control problem. When i right click to get the menu options of what i want to do,
 i can click on "open", and if it's a picture/image or video that's in my libraries, they open just fine. The pics open w/ windows picture viewer &amp; my videos open w/ vlc media player. but if i click "open" on ANY OR ALL applications/programs/files,etc. with
 the ending .exe, i get the notepad jibberish box. and furthermore, as long as i keep getting that damn notepad jibberish pop up box, i dont see what starting my computer in safe mode will help solve my problem if i could get my computer to boot in safe mode,
 which i cant. Please help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS- I went to my computer management screen, clicked down to local, then event viewer,then custom views, then windows logs, then on system and it says there are 39,338 "events"?!? some are neutral or some say "information".</p>
<p>then there are some with a red circle w/ an ! in the middle which says problem has something to do with "Service Control Manager". Then there are yellow triangle thumbnails that say "Warning" which pertain to "DNS Client Events". and then there's even worse
 a circle w/ a red "X" in the middle which say "Critical" which have something to do w/ "Driver Framework User Mode". Now I don't know what this all means but i get the feeling that i was right. it all goes back to User Control problems. And this all started
 minutes after I installed "Advanced Uninstaller" then uninstalled it b/c it said it was incompatible with my system. Do I need to take it to my repair shop? is sounds like it is malware of some kind. Hopefully it's not a virus. Please let me know what you
 think it is. </p>

<p>if you mean use the power button to shut down then wait a few seconds, then press it again to load up windows, then repeat 2 more times, then yes i tried it. No "Windows Recovery Environment" comes up. I have never even heard of that. but again, no. nothing
 like that came about. I tried restarting while holding the shift key. then when it rebooted, I held/pressed the shift key + F8 which took me to a blue screen&nbsp; where I clicked advanced options, then i clicked on restore &amp; then a blue screen saying my windows
 needs to be repaired. this had 3 options at the bottom. press enter to start repair. pressed it does notjhing. option 2 was to press enter for boot option. pressewd it did nothing but blink like the fiorstr option. option 3 was to press something else(i forgot
 which key) for some kind of settings?!? I forget the exact words and/or letters it said. pressed that &amp; it just restarted my windowes all over asgain normal boot up. And I'm back to&nbsp; square one. nothing has worked. And the ONLY way I am able to get into internet
 explorer or mozilla firefox and comnnect to the internet at all to send you these replies, is by clicking on "help links" which gives me a link to microsoft community which i am sending you these messages on. so it's even a chore just to get here to even send
 you my problems in text. I think i am just going to taske my computer to a repair shop. I i dont know what else i you can do to fix this. That blue screen that says i need to repair my windows is numaking me think i should just take it to a professional. I
 would repair my windows if i could access my tweaking.com windows repair application, but it's a .EXE file that gives me the notepad w/ jibberish pop up box. i think the problem is just too complicated for your solutions. I I sure as hell dont know what i
 can do except take it to the shop.</p>

</p><p>Really? This is what you gotta say to me? I've used these programs for years w/o a single problem or trouble. Then all of a sudden we(the general public and/or home computer user)</p>
<p>are supposed to believbe that this is what caused our computers to go ****??&nbsp; I mean, I know it's most likely due tro malware and/or a virus, but just&nbsp; say that. I can hamndle the truth. What I cannot handle is someone who's supposed to be an IT genius
 of some sorts who works for Microsoft telling me that these programs I am completely loyal to &amp; stand behind, suddenly are causing my computer to ****!! I mean, do they think they know everything? Or how to solve everything that goes wrong with the Windows
 OS? NEWS FLASH!! YOU DONT EVERYTHING!! Maybe they need to be pushed off of their pedestal &amp; join us common folk down here in the muck trying to stay afloat. Get over yourselves for ****'s sake. Even my computer w/ a virus &amp; malware is smarter than your Microsoftened

    <title>11&#47;11&#47;15 Windows 7 Professional Patch forces Lenovo X220 into - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danielkoblosh  say:</h3>
<h2>            11&#47;11&#47;15 Windows 7 Professional Patch forces Lenovo X220 into endless reboot loop</h2>
                    <p>This morning (11/11/15) I awoke my Lenovo X220 laptop running Window 7 Professional 64-bit and saw that a patch&nbsp;update had been installed overnight.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked on my profile&nbsp;icon, the screen cleared, then returned to the logon icon screen. There are three profiles to choose from: me, admin and my wife. None work. I click on any of them and it just comes back to the same screen. Will not progress to the
 desktop. Appears to be a reboot loop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rebooted many, many times. I removed the battery.&nbsp;I held every F key trying to get to the advanced setup. F1 on my machine gets me into BIOS. I clicked from "Quick" boot to "Analysis" but that just took longer to get through BIOS before coming to the same
 icon screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter which F key I hold (other than F1) the system continues to boot to windows but always stops at the login screen with the profile icons and then will not let me go further. The Lenovo has the little blue button that's supposed to fix the computer.
 Holding that button only gets me a Beep, then it continues booting to the Login Profile screen. No matter what, I cannot do anything to boot the machine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I crashed the machine by holding the power button it. That came back with "Windows was not shut down normally. Do you want to start in SAFE MODE, SAFE MODE with Networking or SAFE MODE with command window?" The screen did NOT offer the option to "REPAIR
 COMPUTER" to go to a previous install point. All three modes still bring me to the same Profile screen. Clicking on any of the icons just stays in the reboot loop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter what I do, it just reboots.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What did Microsoft do to my Win 7 Pro OS? It has worked flawlessly for years. Now Microsoft has bricked my laptop. This is really annoying.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>One thing's for sure. I will disable "Automatic Updates" from here on out -- if I can ever boot to my machine again. It's obvious I can't trust Microsoft even to "fix" a problem in their own OS.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>UPDATE: I just remembered that I had a Windows Phone plugged into the USB to charge the phone when the update took place. A STINKING WINDOWS PHONE!!!!! Not an Apple, not an Android. A WINDOWS PHONE that my work forced on me. (It stinks, by the way.) I fear
 that idiot piece of junk may have messed up the update install. </p>
<p>
</p><p>In any event, tonight I've been trying to recover the laptop. I made a Win7 64-bit recover CD from another Win7 machine and tried doing a system restore, but of course, there is no system restore point on the machine. Didn't make one, conveniently. Tried
 every repair offered by the Sys Restore CD to no avail. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The Lenovo X220 had a partition on the C drive for restoring an original install, which will lose all my programs of course, but I can't even get to the drive to do the install.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something really hosed this X220 Tablet. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If Microsoft thinks I'm ever going to trust their laptops after they destroyed one of mine, think again. So disappointed in Microsoft, as Bill Gates counts his billions.

                    <p>My Windows 10 File Explorer doesn't allow me to sort/arrange my photo files manually within the Pictures folder.&nbsp; Therefore, the resultant slide show is not in the order I wish.&nbsp; I could rename all those dozens of files for an alphabetical sort, but there

            The Product Key should be on a sticker somewhere on the case - on a laptop it's usually on the bottom. This is of course the WINDOWS Product key, not the product key to activate a trial version of Office if that's what you are wanting to do. Otherwise
 why do you need the Windows product key if Win 7 is already installed?

<h3> msuser80  say:</h3>
<h2>            SSTP will not start. Error 2.</h2>
                    
<p>I am needing help figuring out why the SSTP service on my lapyop will not start.</p>
<p>Error is as follows:</p>
<p>Windows could not start the SSTP service on the local computer.</p>
<p>Error 2: The system cannot find the file specified.</p>
<p>The dll that the service points to is in fact in the system32 directory and I even replaced with one from another exact same laptop that s working and I still get the error.</p>
<p>I have tried sfc /scannow and no errors&nbsp;were found.</p>
<p>All it says in the event log is that the service could not start becuase the specified module could not be found.</p>
<p>Please do not tell me to restore my computer as I can imagine that will work but someone out there probably has a solution. Thank you for any advice.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Morg,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting on Microsoft Community. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before assisting further, I would like to ask you a question:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Have you set the Region and Language according to the location you are residing at</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Set the <strong>Region &amp; Language</strong> settings to your location by following the steps below and check if the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Set the language by following the steps below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span>Type <strong>Settings </strong>in the search box next to <strong>Start </strong>
button, and press <strong>Enter.</strong></span></li><li><span>Select <strong>Time &amp; Language </strong>from the options shown in the window.</span></li><li><span>Click on<strong> Region &amp; Language </strong>from the left side panel, and check if the
<strong>Country or Region </strong>is set to <strong>United Kingdom</strong>.</span></li><li><span>If it is not set, select <strong>United Kingdom</strong> from the drop down bar, and check if the issues is resolved.</span></li><li><span>In the same page, click on <strong>Add a Language</strong> under Languages.</span></li><li><span>Select <strong>English</strong> from the options, and select <strong>English (United Kingdom)</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: </span></strong><span>Also set the <strong>time zone</strong> by following the steps below:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Type <strong>Settings </strong>in search bar next to
<strong>Start </strong>button.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In <strong>Date &amp; Time </strong>settings, under<strong> Time zone</strong> options choose your time zone.</span></li><li><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Restart </span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">your PC and check if the issue is resolved.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong><span>If the issue persist, run the <strong>
PowerShell </strong>commands by following the steps below and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Windows <strong>PowerShell </strong>is a task-based command-line shell and scripting language designed especially for system administration. Built on the
<strong>.NET Framework</strong>, Windows PowerShell helps IT professionals and power users control and automate the administration of the Windows operating system and applications that run on Windows.</span></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Open an Administrator command window by</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Right click </strong>on the taskbar and select <strong>task manager</strong>.</li><li>Click on<strong> More details </strong>located at the bottom of the task manager window.</li><li>Click <strong>File </strong>and select <strong>Run New Task</strong>. Make sure you have a check mark beside
<strong>Create this task with administrative privileges.</strong></li><li>Type <strong>CMD </strong></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Type the following commands in the CMD Prompt:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><strong>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>sfc /scannow</strong></p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: </strong>After running the above commands and it shows no remaining issues, run the below commands:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong><span>powershell<br />
Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers |Where-Object {$_.InstallLocation -like "*SystemApps*"} | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</span></strong></p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in"><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: </strong>Check to make sure the above command ran, shows a blue progress indicator and then returns to the prompt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>If you see a red error, then the command may have been typed or pasted incorrectly, or there may be a larger problem with Windows 10. Try again.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Step 5: </strong>Check the issue is resolved.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>If not, <strong>restart</strong> the PC. In this case try as a new <strong>Administrator user account</strong>.
</li></ol>

<h2>            Killer Instinct corrupt</h2>
                    
<p>Hi, I recently purchased the killer instinct complete collection. I ran into a few problems early on when 3 of the character packs failed to download. So I deleted the game to do a fresh install. The problem I have now is those same 3 character packs will
 not download and the core game killer instinct fails to install as well. I cleared all local game saves, and turned my Xbox all the way off. Nothing has worked. Searching the internet has not helped much either, most people say just uninstall and reinstall.Killer
 instinct wont even get to 1% it fails as soon as it starts.<br />
<br />
If anyone has and advice I would love to hear it! Thank you in advance for your help.</p>

<p>Thank you for your kind support but after 18+ hours I was capable of installing Win10 however there was NOTHING indicating it was looping or a bug presence or just frozen?! No % info neither! Even in DOS in 1991 &nbsp;I did not see such poorly designed software!</p>
<p>
</p><p>OK, now that it is installed and working with less problems than Win 8.1 horror story ... I have already created a USB Installation Media. I need to Format my H Disk and reinstall Win10, should I install win8.1 first and then Win10 or just Win10 from the
 Installation Media? And can I use this USB installation Media for other formatting times as well?</p>
<p>
</p><p>A very important question: My Notebook&nbsp;is built in 2007 and I got it from HP new in 2008, everything works very well still only for the Notebook screen and I have added an EXTernal Compaq monitor and I wonder if I format my PC I will be stuck with a blind
 Notebook screen and I will not be able to see and view the installation process! Am I right here? If so then I should forget to format my Notebook and work like this until it dies one day soon ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks and Best wishes,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sincerely</p>

<p>Thank you for your reply but I cannot do what you are suggesting because as I said earlier I don't have my laptop main screen anymore; it died after 7 years ... I have an external Compaq screen and formatting this pc would be the end!!! Should I go and start
 a new question? or may I ask here about DONOTSPY 10 regarding WIN10 Spying on us even when we have disabled all the dos???!!!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and regards</p>
<p>
</p><p>ps: Microsoft sent us all hotmail customers that it is not spying on our emails; not on our Skype Messages and not on our BING searches before WIN10 came and just after the US Justice Dept sued GOOGLE and now with Win10 we learn that WIN10 does just that!!!!

</p><p>Windows System File corruption is caused by some third party programs or if hard drive is corrupted. To fix this problem, use the following methods in the order in which they are listed. After each method, check if problem is fixed. If the problem is not

            Hello Gogo,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Based on the issue description, I understand that you want to know if resetting or refreshing the PC will restore all the apps which are currently available on your computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I will surely, try to answers all your questions and help you resolve this issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The apps that came with your PC as preinstalled or the apps which you installed from Windows Store will be reinstalled after you refresh the PC, but any apps you installed from other websites and DVDs will be removed. You'll find a list of the removed
 apps on your desktop after refreshing your PC.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Resetting your PC reinstalls Windows but deletes your files, settings, and apps—except for the apps that came with your PC. Restoring your PC is a way to undo recent system changes you've made.</div>

            <p>Thank you very much! So if I choose to "Remove everything and Reinstall windows" It would erase everything and install every application and programs that were installed &nbsp;previous to me setting up the computer (like a factory reset).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My hard drive is partitioned in two partitions (+ recovery), and when choosing the "Remove everything and reinstall windows" It lets me choose between wiping my (C:) drive (with windows) and leaving my (D:) drive intact, right?</p>

            <div>Hi Gogo,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
You are Welcome, thank you for replying with the query again.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p>Based on&nbsp;your reply,&nbsp;when you say&nbsp;"So if I choose to "Remove everything and Reinstall windows" It would erase everything and install every application and programs that were installed&nbsp;previous to me setting up the computer (like a factory reset)".&nbsp;I would
 like to inform you that&nbsp;if you <strong>R</strong><strong>eset </strong>the PC&nbsp;it will remove everything&nbsp;apart from the apps which came preinstalled with the computer Windows 8.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div><strong>Resetting Windows 8:</strong></div>
<div>If you upgraded your PC from Windows 8 to Windows 8.1 and your PC has a Windows 8 recovery partition, resetting your PC will restore Windows 8. You’ll need to upgrade to Windows 8.1 after the reset has finished.
<div><strong>Note: </strong>All of your personal files will be deleted and your settings will be reset. All apps that you installed will be removed. Only apps that came with your PC will be reinstalled.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><strong>System Refresh: </strong></p>
<p>Resetting your PC can take you back to square one if you encounter a problem, but that’s clearly a very heavy weight solution, something you’d only do as a last resort. But what if you could get the benefit of a reset – starting over with a fresh Windows
 install – while still keeping <em>your stuff</em> intact? This is where Refresh comes in handy. Refresh functionality is fundamentally still a reinstall of Windows, just like resetting your PC as described above, but your data, settings, and Metro style apps
 are preserved. We have a solution to help you with your desktop apps, too, which I’ll talk about a little later.</p>
<p>The coolest part about Refresh is there’s no need to first back up your data to an external hard drive and restore them afterwards.</p>
<strong>Note: </strong>Apps you installed from websites and DVDs will be removed. Apps that came with your PC and apps you installed from the Windows Store will be reinstalled. Windows puts a list of removed apps on your desktop after refreshing your PC.</div>
&nbsp;
<div>In your case, I suggest you to refresh the computer.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Hope this information helps, please reply for any further assistance on Windows.</div>

            Correct. Presumably the person who is sending you these attachments is using Outlook and Rich Text mail format. Get them to send emails to you in either HTML or plain text.

    <title>Can I use Windows 10 ISO to upgrade my Win 7 system&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alokep  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I use Windows 10 ISO to upgrade my Win 7 system&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Simple question: </p>
<p>Can I use the Win 10 ISO (using the Media Creation Tool from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10) to upgrade my Windows 7 PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not talking about a clean install etc etc.&nbsp; Just a simple upgrade in place that people normally do with the "Get Windows 10" GWXUX applet in the system tray.&nbsp; Can I use the ISO instead?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Background:</p>
<p>My Win 7 has a Intel gigabit nic built into the motherboard (Intel Ethernet Connection (2) I218-V).&nbsp; Despite updating drivers for it from my motherboard manufacturer and Intel, I get the following error through the "Get Windows 10"
</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Unfortunately this PC is unable to run Windows 10.&nbsp; There are no supported network devices".</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, apparently, I cannot (yet) use the "normal" method for upgrading and validating my Win 7 system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know Intel has Windows 10 drivers here https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/71305/Intel-Ethernet-Connection-I218-V</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, can I use the ISO from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10 to upgrade my PC?</p>
<p>Will this proceed to validate my install? or will it ask for a Windows 10 product serial #?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>Aloke Prasad</p>

            <p>I made the mistake of trying to upgrade from WIN 7 Pro by downloading the ISO and creating a bootable disk... I was shown to have had a genuine version and a reservation for upgrade. It asked me for my key which I attempted to provide and it will not take
 it. No "0's" allowed.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried to go back to&nbsp;7, during the process the partitions were hosed on my HD. I went ahead and let it install the 10 version and got everything working with a few manufacturer driver downloads. Now I have a working machine with all of my old files
 and apps lost, and a message to activate my copy. It will not take the product key I have. Trying to get support chat or may schedule a call. I would advise to think hard before going forward.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I love 10 so far,&nbsp; I did most of my critical files backed up to another machine, but have no idea how this will be resolved.

<p>

            <p>&nbsp;After not being able to enter a key I selected the skip this option. Yes, I had reserved my upgrade via the applet.
</p>
<p>I did have a chat support session after posting this last night and had a very satisfactory result. After giving all of the details to the agent, I was assured that since my reservation was in place and I had not made any hardware changes that my copy as
 I understand it would self register. I guess due to the huge numbers of upgrades occurring it might take a while for the validation servers to cycle through all of the requests.

<p>
</p><p>The question in my mind now is:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I proceed with this method (ISO) of upgrading now or wait until Microsoft is happy with my NIC driver?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What did your compatibility scan look like before you forced the upgrade?&nbsp; Did you have any compatibility issues identified in the "Get Windows 10" process?</p>

            <p>Yes, but you must use it from the desktop. &nbsp;DO NOT START THE COMPUTER WITH THE DVD. &nbsp;Start Windows and then insert the media. &nbsp;When the splash screen appears on the desktop, click Install Now. &nbsp;You will be upgraded and have your free Windows 10. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>I had to start it from the&nbsp;DVD as the partitions were corrupted and I was dead in the water with no os at all after the win7 restore options.</p>
<p>I hope this has a happy ending. I furnished my error code and again was told all would resolve.
</p>
<p>I had no issue with my laptop upgrade and it was started from the notification that my upgrade was ready. I have another PC waiting for the upgrade and I will wait for the notification.</p>
<p>&nbsp;If this upgrade becomes a ransom event I will be very upset and will not be using any Microsoft products I can aviod at all costs, and could see myself evangelizing to anyone I can.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I had a genuine certified copy and only used tools provided from Microsoft, I the consumer did nothing wrong. As long as it is made right I will continue to support and be pleased with my purchases.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The biggest confusion comes from the fact that I had a recorded key and OS labeled "genuine MS" and yet am unable to provide the exact same key or be provided with a key that will keep me running on the current install. I do not understand how these keys
 are not indexed and it seems reading other user experiences as a flaw in the customer experience chain.</p>

<p>Hi, thanks for visiting Answer Desk! I'm Aron S. </p>
<p>11:26 pm </p>
<p>Hi Aron, I have a problem and I'm hoping you may be able to help </p>
<p>11:27 pm </p>
<p>I manually downloaded the win10 iso and created a bootable disk. I attempted to upgrade and it failed.
</p>
<p>11:28 pm </p>
<p>Hello there! </p>
<p>11:28 pm </p>
<p>so I then tried to go back to win 7 and the partitions were corrupted.... I ended up installing the win10 again and got everything working after getting a few motherboard and network drivers... now it is not taking my activation key and I do not know what
 to do </p>
<p>11:29 pm </p>
<p>I see. </p>
<p>11:30 pm </p>
<p>Let me ask few question to check for the cause, would that be fine? </p>
<p>11:31 pm </p>
<p>the key I have has 0's and it says those are invalid. I am on the reservation list and had a genuine version, what do you suggest. Do you need my key?
</p>
<p>11:31 pm </p>
<p>sure no problem </p>
<p>11:31 pm </p>
<p>So basically when you replace your motherboard and other drivers that is the time your windows 10 installed?
</p>
<p>11:33 pm </p>
<p>no, no equipment replaced at all </p>
<p>11:33 pm </p>
<p>Oh I see </p>
<p>11:33 pm </p>
<p>win 10 did not have the network drivers , so I had to install those ... I had a usb network adapter that it did recognize
</p>
<p>11:33 pm </p>
<p>May I asked what path did you follow to install windows 10? </p>
<p>11:34 pm </p>
<p>first I had it attempt to refresh windows 7... that's when the failure occured
</p>
<p>11:34 pm </p>
<p>I thought it would be cleaner that way </p>
<p>11:35 pm </p>
<p>After that? </p>
<p>11:35 pm </p>
<p>then I allowed it to install 10 </p>
<p>11:36 pm </p>
<p>it went fine, but did not have network accesibility </p>
<p>11:36 pm </p>
<p>then it asked for my activation key </p>
<p>11:36 pm </p>
<p>so I tried to enter it </p>
<p>11:36 pm </p>
<p>but it would not take it, so I skipped and said do it later </p>
<p>11:36 pm </p>
<p>now everything is working great but I have a message asking me to activate ( which it seems I cant)
</p>
<p>11:37 pm </p>
<p>my laptop upgrade went very smoothly and no problems, that's whay I wanted to get my gaming box upgraded
</p>
<p>11:38 pm </p>
<p>I have another one, but I will absolutely wait for the notification saying its ready and avoid the ISO
</p>
<p>11:39 pm </p>
<p>When did you installed windows 10? </p>
<p>11:39 pm </p>
<p>about 2 hours ago </p>
<p>11:39 pm </p>
<p>on the gaming box I am on now, the laptop was 2 days ago </p>
<p>11:40 pm </p>
<p>but I had a prompt for the laptop </p>
<p>11:40 pm </p>
<p>the laptop never asked me for a key </p>
<p>11:41 pm </p>
<p>Let me see what I can do. </p>
<p>11:41 pm </p>
<p>thanks so much, this has been an all day affair... </p>
<p>11:41 pm </p>
<p>I see. </p>
<p>11:46 pm </p>
<p>Have you receive any error message? </p>
<p>11:46 pm </p>
<p>you mean the key message hex? </p>
<p>11:46 pm </p>
<p>When you try to activate </p>
<p>11:47 pm </p>
<p>I can get it </p>
<p>11:47 pm </p>
<p>Okay. </p>
<p>11:48 pm </p>
<p>Error code: 0xC004C003 </p>
<p>11:48 pm </p>
<p>I see. </p>
<p>11:48 pm </p>
<p>We are aware for this code. </p>
<p>11:48 pm </p>
<p>The reason why you this message is because of the demand of the windows 10. </p>
<p>11:49 pm </p>
<p>So we just need to wait for 24-48hours and your windows 10 will automatically activate.
</p>
<p>11:49 pm </p>
<p>:D </p>
<p>11:49 pm </p>
<p>that's great news Aron! :D </p>
<p>11:50 pm </p>
<p>you have restored my faith in Microsoft ! </p>
<p>11:50 pm </p>
<p><span>This error is just a delay due to high demands for Win 10, it will Automatically Activate after a few days or even a week.
</span></p>
<p>11:50 pm </p>
<p>thanks again. I really do like the new version </p>
<p>11:50 pm </p>
<p>:D </p>
<p>11:51 pm </p>
<p>Would there be anything else? </p>
<p>11:51 pm </p>
<p>hope the rest of your chats go as well ;) </p>
<p>11:51 pm </p>
<p>Here's the reference number for our conversation for today 12xxxxxxxx. </p>
<p>11:51 pm </p>
<p>got it </p>
<p>11:51 pm </p>
<p>And thank you! Hope so :) </p>
<p>11:51 pm </p>
<p>Enjoy windows 10 :D </p>
<p>11:52 pm </p>
<p>have a great rest of your day </p>

            <p>The upgrade applet did throw an error. I did not record it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I would strongly advise waiting for the notification that your upgrade is ready to avoid any unforeseen issues. It wasn't Microsoft's fault about the partition problem.. things happen. I am glad I did have my critical files backed up on my network, if I
 didn't this would have been a very sad self inflicted experience.</p>

            <p>No, originally I went to the upgrade site to start the upgrade. The first time I ran it as I said it said a very short "there was a problem" followed by a code. I tried it again and got the same problem. I then went to my other box and selected the option
 to upgrade more than one machine with the ISO. So I selected the proper version for my gaming box and downloaded the ISO (remember this is from my non upgraded box at this point). I created the bootable ISO on the same box, then inserted the bootable disk
 into my gaming box. It offered to upgrade, I tried again it still gave an error.</p>
<p>On the menu at the bottom left was an option to restore Windows 7. I selected restore windows 7. It started the restore and was hung up at some point.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Ok I reboot to be notified that no OS present. I booted then off of the ISO disk and selected Windows 10 again. It went forward. However my network connection were dead and no nic activity. I remembered I had the same issue when I first installed windows
 7 and had to get the drivers. The install went ahead and at some time did ask for the key. I attempted to put in my key but no0's were allowed and it said invalid character. I chose skip.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;Then it went through set up and upon login&nbsp;I plugged in the external&nbsp;USB adapter and gained network connectivity. I went to MSI to get drivers etc. and installed them. WIN10 did also grab the missing updates it needed for the upgrade and it worked perfectly.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You did everything right and getting "There was a problem" was a bummer.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Was this the system on which the "get Windows 10" applet had shown an error/incompatibility?&nbsp; If so, I'll learn from your experience and stay put until that applet is happy.&nbsp; Too bad you didn't record the error/incompatibility.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seeing ""Unfortunately this PC is unable to run Windows 10.&nbsp; There are no supported network devices" ought to be a reality check for me not to rush this.</p>

<h2>            Where did the Delete button go in Windows Explorer toolbar&#63;</h2>
                    Where did the Delete button go in Windows Explorer's toolbar in Win7? As an ex XP user (put the old clunker in the closet), I miss the delete button. Now, to delete a highlighted item in Windows Explorer, I have to right-click to delete.<br />
<br />
Is there a way to add Delete to WE?<br />

    <title>Apps not connecting to internet &#40;no homegroup, no active - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cliftonj  say:</h3>
<h2>            Apps not connecting to internet &#40;no homegroup, no active network&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I've seen this asked before my particular problem seems a little different. Firstly, everything seemed fine&nbsp;(I'm running Windows 8 Pro with Media Center) and at some point (I don't know when) it&nbsp;stopped working. I've done a system restore and that
 hasn't worked so here's a description of what I know so far...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>[Update: 13 March, 2013]</p>
<p>I was able to replicate (to some degree) the same problem on my laptop. Basically, I made some changes to my router making my laptop believe it was no longer on my home group and it asked if I wanted to leave the home group. When I clicked yes this changed
 my network profile to public and therefore I couldn't access anything like with my desktop. Now, the difference compared to my desktop is I was easily able to forget that network and rejoin it as a private network. This is hasn't been possible on my desktop.
 Anyway, here's what I'm seeing on my desktop...<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>My metro apps can't connect to the internet. For example, the Store tells me "Your PC isn't&nbsp;connected to the internet. To use the Store connect to the internet and try again". I get similar errors for any apps using&nbsp;Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.<br />
</li><li>My&nbsp;internet connection works just fine&nbsp;using an Ethernet cable and I also&nbsp;have no problem accessing the web through&nbsp;IE, Firefox, Chrome, etc. on the desktop<br />
</li><li>I can connect wirelessly but still no network, apps won't work, etc. Also, there's NO option to "Turn sharing on or off"<br />
</li><li>IE RT/Metro however&nbsp;displays "This page cannot be displayed"<br />
</li><li>When connected via Ethernet only internet Access on my&nbsp;desktop taskbar&nbsp;shows my connection as "Unidentified" and "No Internet Access"<br />
</li><li>Right-clicking "Ethernet" (as in 3 above)&nbsp;produces NO option to "Turn sharing on or off"<br />
</li><li>Network and Sharing Center says the following for my active networks&nbsp;"You are not currently connected to any networks".<br />
</li><li>I'm also unable to set up a new&nbsp;network<br />
</li><li>HomeGroup says "This computer can't connect to a homegroup" and "Before you create or join a homegroup, you must first connect to a network". I'm asked to "Connect to an existing network" despite having an internet connection (same issue as above - computer
 thinks I'm not connected to the internet even though I am)<br />
</li><li>Also, "Create a homegroup is disabled"</li><li>Status for my Ethernet device is showing IPv4 Connectivity (Internet) and IPv6 (No Internet access)<br />
</li><li>Troubleshooting Internet Connections, HomeGroup and Network Adapter&nbsp;shows the same result "Troubleshooting couldn't identify the problem"</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help&nbsp;is really appreciated. Thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards, Cliff</p>

            <p>Hi Arya,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's possible&nbsp;this happened&nbsp;while I was&nbsp;logged into another computer. I may have&nbsp;changed the&nbsp;network or sharing settings using my phone for internet access&nbsp;but I'm not completely&nbsp;sure about that. I really don't know why or how this happened. It could've
 been a Windows Update for all I know :s</p>
<p><br />
Regarding all four methods in your post...</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>1) The Modern UI Troubleshooter suggested some out of date adapter drivers. None these related to the wireless or network adapter though (webcam and usb bluetooth for example).</p>
<p><br />
2) Metro apps such as IE do not connect to the internet. Services like Facebook, Twitter, etc won't work either and show the same error or are "offline". I cannot access the store and am shown an error about NOT being connected to the internet. Also your article
 link&nbsp;suggests uninstalling and/or reinstalling apps but this isn't possible without an accessible/working Store app.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>1) The date was incorrect and has been updated. This hasn't changed anything though. Most of the service related&nbsp;modern UI apps still won't work.</p>
<p><br />
2) Resetting the Store didn't make a difference to the apps or network connection.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>SFC fixed&nbsp;a few&nbsp;corrupted files but this did not work either.</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Method 4:</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, the clean boot method&nbsp;did not work as well. I still don't have an identifiable&nbsp;network, home group, and the apps of course won't connect to Facebook, Twitter, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help and suggestions. Any&nbsp;others&nbsp;are really appreciated!</p>

            Well, it's two months later and I still haven't had any luck with this. I was hoping Microsoft would release a fix but I guess it's not widespread enough for them to do anything about it.
<br />
<br />
Anyway, I went as far as uninstalling my Antivirus software and unfortunately this didn't work either.<br />

            OK, I think I have the <b>answer</b> to this problem. Go into (My) Computer /Properties. Change the PC&nbsp;<b>workgroup</b>&nbsp;settings. When trying to do this it asks whether you want to change from company to home network. Say yes. This does the trick. (Sorry
 I cannot remember in detail because its late and I'm tired and fed up that it took so long to fix this.)

<h2>            Windows 10 Update</h2>
                    <p>the 8/3/16 Windows 10 Update has wrecked my computer.&nbsp; It has taken 2.5 hours just to get to the Community.&nbsp; If I go the search box on the lower left hand corner of the screen, and ask to open Internet Explorer to access my Internet Explorer I'm not allowed
 to open that browser.&nbsp; I need Internet Explorer to get to my Internet Carrier which is Time Warner Cable.&nbsp;My computer won't let me access my emails, because it does not recognize my Microsoft Administrator Account.&nbsp; It disappeared with the update.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My accounts with Microsoft have been an ongoing problem since the 7/14/16 update.&nbsp; I have three case numbers that were opened last Friday.&nbsp; The call for the&nbsp;first case 1349143925 got disconnected when the first person who answers was transferring the call
 to the tech support.&nbsp; When I called back and&nbsp;got the second case number 1349153174.&nbsp; When the transferred call to tech support said the wait time was 30 minutes and you can remain on the line or press 1 on your telephone I just held because I was afraid that
 the call would be dropped again.&nbsp; Rueben, who was a supervisor tried hard to fix things but could not.&nbsp; In put in a call back request.&nbsp; I was on the phone for 9 hours on Friday.&nbsp; I got a call back from a second tier support person, named Surjet Shokeen, and
 he gave the&nbsp;third case 1349180771.&nbsp; He made adjustments to my user account, all with Microsoft.&nbsp; I wanted to close the Outlook Mail account because it was causing a problem when I started or restarted my computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; He thought he was successful on Saturday
 when he changed my sign&nbsp;in to a local account.&nbsp; I asked if that change would allow me to use the Administrator account or picking up my emails through Windows&nbsp;Live.&nbsp; He didn't check to see if&nbsp;the local account sign&nbsp;account was a problem, said it was fixed,&nbsp;but
 Monday the same problem was back.&nbsp; I couldn't even pick&nbsp;up the information sent from The Community because&nbsp;my account was not recognized.&nbsp;&nbsp;He called me back on Monday, because I went into an email from the Community that was several days old.</p>
<p>I asked the Community to see if they could arrange for Surjeet to call me.&nbsp; He made a few changes, and things were slow as trying to squeeze honey out a bottle, but I could use the computer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Got the new Windows 10 Update last night. Like I said above, I can't&nbsp;open Internet Explorer.&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess this latest update for Windows 10 will&nbsp;not allow Microsoft customers to open that browser, which is another block on our rights.&nbsp; But I need Internet Explorer
 to get to my Internet Carrier which is Time Warner Cable.&nbsp; My computer won't let me access my emails, because it does not recognize my Microsoft Administrator Account!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Someone at Microsoft needs to help me fix this.&nbsp; I'll be happy to go back to Windows 7 when Mircosoft refunds the cost of Windows 10 for The Desktop and Laptop I bought on May 8, 2016.&nbsp; Both computers had Windows 10 preinstalled.&nbsp; I never did the upgrades
 to Windows 10.&nbsp; I thought it would be smarter to start with program installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hopefully, I'll be able to see your answer, if I can open my Microsoft email account.</p>
