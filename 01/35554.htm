    <title>Skype Notifications for Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> leaf2ns  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype Notifications for Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>When I get a new chat message, a number (indicating a new unread message) is supposed to pop up on my Skype icon on my desktop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, nothing has been popping up and the only way for me to see if I have a new chat message is by maximizing Skype and seeing which contacts have a number (indicating unread message) next to them. I have been missing many new messages because of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have Chat Notifications toggled off under Notification Settings, but this is because I do not want to have a preview of my messages pop up on my desktop. The unread number had been popping up over my Skype taskbar icon until recently even with this
 setting toggled off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to resolve this?</p>
<p>

                    Hello, <br />
I misplaced my product key for Microsoft Flight Simulator X standard edition and I rang Microsoft to get a new one. They gave me a new product key and told me if it did not work the first time I had to uninstall Microsoft Flight Simulator X and then enter it
 again. However after uninstalling FSX and installing it again it did not work. Now I can only play the game in trial mode for 30 minutes with no sound ! I am wondering if anyone can help me with this and it would be greatly appreciated .
<br />
Thank you.<br />

    <title>How to remove grayed-out VPN interface&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> berndbausch  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to remove grayed-out VPN interface&#63;</h2>
                    <p>On Windows 10, I use a program named Pulse, by Juniper, to set up VPNs. The problem: After disconnecting from a VPN, I can't create a new connection. The connection attempt just times out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I notice that the interface for the disconnected VPN still exists. In Device manager, it looks like this:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/60e2c43d-0453-47b6-88cf-eed9c1d38241" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/60e2c43d-0453-47b6-88cf-eed9c1d38241" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>It's adapter #6. My hope is that removing this interface allows me to make a new VPN connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you notice the interface is gray? I can right-click on it and select Uninstall, but the uninstall process never completes. I don't remember ever seeing an error or timeout message - it just goes on forever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is solved by a reboot, but I can't always afford the disruption (10 minutes or so, and I need to recreate all my windows).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Any suggestions how to get rid of this interface?</strong></p>
<p>

            Hi Bernd,<br />
<br />
<br />
There's a possibility that when you remove the VPN it won't remove completely and you need to restart your computer. That could be the reason why you're unable to create a new VPN. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
To help you with this issue, we suggest that you post your query to <em><strong><a href="https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Search/en-us/?query=remove+VPN&amp;ppud=4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">TechNet</a></strong></em> since this issue is more complex
 than what is typically answered in the Microsoft Answers forums.<br />
<br />

    <title>Laptop Overheating After Win 7 Install - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sam344  say:</h3>
<h2>            Laptop Overheating After Win 7 Install</h2>
                    I recently upgraded my Gateway laptop from Windows Vista to Windows 7. During the upgrade, I ran the compatibility program suggested by Windows, and the program assured me that my laptop could handle running Windows 7 without any issues.<br />
<br />
However, since the upgrade, my laptop overheats and shuts down fairly often. Now, I am not a gamer, and I am not running any hefty programs. But my laptop will overheat and shut down simply from using the Facebook application "Farmville." Before the upgrade
 - my laptop would only overheat if the vents were blocked and I was trying to run a hefty program (like The Sims 3). But now, it overheats simply from playing Farmville?!<br />
<br />
It's possible that the upgrade is not the issue - I really don't know. But logic tells me to blame the upgrade first, and go from there. So... what do you think I should do?<br />
<br />
Also, here is the system information for my laptop:<br />
<em><br />
System Manufacturer: Gateway<br />
System Model: T-1631<br />
BIOS: BIOS Version 90.03<br />
Processor: AMD Turion(tm) 64 X2 Mobil Technology TL-60 (2 CPUs), ~2.0GHz<br />
Memory: 3072MB RAM<br />
Page file: 1383MB used, 3474MB available<br />
DirectX Version: DirectX 11</em>

            Overheating can be caused by several factors, obviously you already mentioned the vent problem.&nbsp; I'm running a similar processor (Turion x2 TL-66) and it gets fairly warm in my HP Pavilion at times.&nbsp; Windows 7 and AMD's heat sensors seem to work well in
 my laptop, so I don't think that would be the problem.&nbsp; You might check to see if you're running balanced or high power.&nbsp; Balanced will usually keep the processor using the lower load range.&nbsp; It could also be that you have a heat sink/fan problem, which could
 be the thermal compound has failed, or it could also be that your graphics chip is over heating.&nbsp; Being my HP is out of warranty, I opened it up, and replaced the thermal compound and replaced the thermal pad on the gpu with a copper shim+thermal compound
 (I use Arctic Silver 5).&nbsp; After it cured, my temps are considerably better.&nbsp; You can download a good 'freeware' program called System Information for Windows which gives a detailed readout of under it's "Sensors" listing.&nbsp; That might give you a clue as to
 what is happening.&nbsp; The only other thing you might want to check right up front is whether or not you're using the latest drivers for your systems ACPI.&nbsp; One last thing to check is to make sure you've got the most recent Bios, because that has been known to
 be an issue that can cause the fan/cpu temperature monitoring to not work as it should.<br />
<br />
This may be 'overload' but hope something helps...it's frustrating when a system is running hotter than it should, plus it can really do some damage to the cpu and gpu.&nbsp; In addition, a good 'laptop cooling board' does a lot to reduce the heat.

            The laptop is currently running on "Power Saver" mode, and my sensors are reading at about 35 degrees Celsius. To be honest - I don't know what temperature they should be at, or what temp. is considered dangerous.<br />
<br />
Also - I would love to update my BIOS, but I don't know how. And because Gateway "does not recommended upgrading or downgrading," I can't get any information from their website (or tech support) about Win. 7 issues. Everything that comes up is targeted at Win.
 Vista, because that was the original operating system for the laptop. I can tell you that my BIOS version (90.03) matches the version that Gateway recommends for Win. Vista. But I don't know if that's good, bad, or doesn't matter, because I don't know what
 the most recent BIOS version is for Win. 7.<br />
<br />
And I do have a cooling board. I recently purchased this <a href="http://www.bestbuy.com/site/Targus+-+Laptop+Chill+Mat+-+Black/Gray/9427042.p?id=1218103734860&amp;skuId=9427042&amp;st=cooling pad&amp;cp=1&amp;lp=8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>your right to choose logic first, windows vista uses less power and resources than windows 7 does, after installing windows 7 your laptop is having to work even harder than before to perform the same tasks, my advice would be to take it in and get the cpu
 cooling fan replaced with a more powerful one, or indeed if you can do it your self. save the cost. the reason is the cpu is overheating, if you go into your BIOS and look at the cpu stats, you will see that its set to automaticly shut down once the cpu reaches
 a certain temp. to double check it is the cpu, is the base of the laptop very hot when it shuts down? how often can you hear the cooling fan turn on and is the air coming from the vents very hot? if so, the more you use it the more damage your doing to the
 cpu.</p>
<p>i only know this as im a proffessional pc builder and repairer and have had a few cases like this before. 99.9% of the time its the cpu. its the cpu that runs the full system.</p>
<p>if you have a vista disc, try reinstalling it on the laptop, then to make sure you dont lose your money for the windows 7 upgrade, install vista on a desktop, or if you got one already, just install the upgrade on the desktop. either way you wont lose out.
 and you'll save the laptop. hope this helps.</p>

<p>Gateways are nortorious for overheating. Their cooling systems are simply poorly-designed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That being said, if you are using a "power saver" mode, go into properties for that and make sure your fan is set to "active cooling", else your fan won't turn on. Windows 7 does not generate more heat or anything (it is actually more resource-friendly contrary
 to what Neo posted). This is just a settings issue in your power profile.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 media player wont list and play audio files by track number</h2>
                    THIS SUCKS!
<p>I have a large music collection in mp3 format (180gig) For years I've been able to organise my library as I wish...however I recently upgraded to windows 7, and although I figured out how to arrange My folders &amp; files to my satisfaction by Ignoring the library
 feature, which I've found to be totally annoying. Unfortunately though, when I Play the contents of an artists album folder in media player it re-arranges the music&nbsp; files into alphabetical order to play them. Even tho all the track icons in the folder are
 arranged by track no. I suspect that this is the wonderful marvelous fantastic library option kicking in again because it knows better than me how i like to hear my music, I found the show list and sort list options, but insanely, sort by track no or simply
 # is not an option !!! WHAT THE ____!!!!</p>

<p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can sort songs as per the track numbers in an album only if the track numbers are different.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the track numbers are same, then the next priority will be given to the title, which will sort the songs in alphabetical order.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the track numbers are same in the album, then I would suggest you to follow these steps change the track number
 and check if it helps:</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span><span>Open windows media player, and open the album.</span></span>
</li><li>
<span><span>Check if the track numbers are same.</span></span>
</li><li>
<span><span>If yes, then right click on the track number for each song and click on edit and change the numbers.</span></span>
</li><li>
<span><span>If the track number column is not listed, then right click on the title, click on choose columns.</span></span>
</li><li>
<span><span>Check if the track number have a check mark, if no then check that and click on ok.</span></span>

<h3> frustrationincarnate  say:</h3>
<h2>            Settings bouncing up and down</h2>
                    <p>As of today, whenever I go into Settings and open a page or expand an option that causes a scroll bar to appear, the page will jump to the bottom, then bounce back up, repeatably, non-stop. If the window is inactive, the jumping stops and I can scroll normally
 with the mouse wheel... Clicking on anything reactivates the window however, causing the jumping to resume.</p>
<p>
</p><p>ONLY happens in the Settings window; NOT happening in browsers, apps, or other navigation windows (such as Downloads, Program Files, etc).</p>
<p>
</p><p>No updates or changes have been made today or last night that I am aware of.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 64 bit Home,&nbsp;<span>HP Pavilion Desktop 590-Po066</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Edit: Sometimes the scrolling locks part way down the page, letting me scroll to that point &amp; back, but no further.</p>
<p>Using Tab to jump between options worked for a bit, but now gets bounced back up &amp; down as well.</p>

            Hi FrustrationIncarnate, thanks for your question. I'm Graeme, a Microsoft Community expert and fellow user.
<br />
<br />That's a bizarre problem. I'll give you some steps that might help.
<br />
<br />Firstly, see if updating your graphics drivers helps.
<br />Depending on your graphics card, you can visit the corresponding manufacturer's site here:
<br />
<br />AMD Radeon:
<br /><a href="https://www.amd.com/en/support" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amd.com/en/support</a>
<br />
<br />NVIDIA GeForce:
<br /><a href="https://www.geforce.com/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.geforce.com/drivers</a>
<br />
<br />Intel Graphics:
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>
<br />
<br />Then, see if the System File Checker can repair any corrupt Windows system files:
<br />- Click Start and type cmd.
<br />- Right-click Command Prompt and run it as administrator.
<br />- Type sfc /scannow
<br />- Press Enter.
<br />
<br />Also see if re-registering Windows default apps (including Settings) helps. You can find the instructions here:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.askvg.com/guide-how-to-reinstall-all-default-built-in-apps-in-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.askvg.com/guide-how-to-reinstall-al...</a>
<br />
<br />Please let me know how you go with these steps and I'll give you other things to try if the problem persists! Thanks!
<br />

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Try following and check after each step
<br />
<br />1. Try invoking Settings App from other Places and let me know whether Settings is working or not
<br />a. Windows Key+I invokes Settings App
<br />b. Click on the action center icon (in system tray) and then click All Settings
<br />
<br />2. Reinstall Setting app
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click Powershell (Admin) &gt; Copy the below and paste into Powershell &gt; Enter &gt; Reboot your computer
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -Name Windows.Immersivecontrolpanel | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />
<br />3. Re-register All apps (You will get many reds, ignore them)
<br />Type Powershell in Windows Start Search box &gt; Right click on Powershell &gt; Run As Administrator &gt; Paste the following command in the PowerShell window and press Enter
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
<br />Reboot your computer
<br />
<br />There are three other actions which you can undertake
<br />
<br />1. Restore from a system restore point to a point when things were working fine
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/...</a>
<br />
<br />2. If the issue has been caused due to recent Windows update - I would suggest that you uninstall the latest KB update  and hide it so that it doesn't install it automatically and wait for new update to come which will be installed automatically.
<br />
<br />To know which update got installed
<br />Windows Key+i to invoke Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Click View installed update history.  These KBs should be from the below list. Don't uninstall any other KB
<br />For 1809 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4464619</a>
<br />For 1803 - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4099479</a>
<br />Make note of KB and uninstall and block it.
<br />Uninstall
<br />Windows Key + R &gt; Type: appwiz.cpl &gt; Enter &gt; Click View installed updates &gt; Select the required updates, right click, uninstall.
<br />Block
<br />Microsoft has provided a tool Show/Hide Updates tool to block the update
<br />Download the tool from below link
<br /><a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />When you run this troubleshooter, it will search for available updates and list them
<br />Select the update which you want to hide. Click Next and follow on-screen directions
<br />
<br />3. Perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repair-install-windows-10-place-upgrade.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/16397-repai...</a>
<br />
<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

<p>Thank you,&nbsp;Vijay_Verma, for the very thorough reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>There has not been any updates for a few days and the error only started today.
</p>
<p>I have no restore point from earlier, as this is a fresh install, plus only the updates from a week ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cannot run powershell as admin, as a new issue has been revealed.<br />
When right-clicking in the Start Menu, the menu only appears for a split second, disappearing before I can click anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Invoking Settings in different ways fixes the problem for only a moment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I start clicking around in System/Display, all pages act normal. If I go Back from there, then into Personalization, every page begins jumping.</p>
<p>There doesn't seem to be much difference, besides time until the issue appears.<br />
</p>
<p>Invoking by right-clicking the Desktop and going straight to Personalization is the fastest to breaking.</p>
<p>More specifically, clicking any of the options on bottom of that page (Cortana, Lockscreen and Screensaver time outs) causes it immediately.<br />
The error occurs randomly in other pages/options, but this one is 100% reproducible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, this is a fresh install, so I would rather not reset everything. I have only just finished uninstalling all the bloatware and have barely installled anything besides Chrome and Avast. From your link:<br />
"In Windows 10, this feature no longer preserves user-acquired Windows apps."</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are all these&nbsp;AppxPackages? I am nervous about installing what sound to me like system files.</p>

<p>Today, the problem is gone!</p>
<p>I have not been able to recreate the bouncing issue at all this morning and the right-click menu appears as normal in Start Menu!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of last night,&nbsp;Graeme.P, clean boot and Safe Mode did nothing to help.<br />
Vijay_Verma, the right-click issue was also still present last night, so I could not try sfc scan.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There don't appear to have been any updates between then and now, but I have changed nothing myself in the meantime. Very strange, but I'm glad it is gone, nonetheless! Thank you both for trying to troubleshoot the issue for me :)</p>

            Hi Duane, I'm Graeme, an independent adviser here to help.
<br />
<br />If it's a clean boot you're trying to perform, you can follow the steps here:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/929135...</a>
<br />
<br />Let me know if you're experiencing any errors while trying this.
<br />
<br />If you're trying to reset your PC and it's giving you errors, you can perform a clean installation which will resolve the issue most effectively.
<br />
<br />Here's an article that explains in detail how to clean install:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/forum/insider_wintp-insider_install-insiderplat_pc/how-to-perform-a-clean-install-or-reinstall-of/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/for...</a>
<br />
<br />You'll need an 8GB or larger USB flash drive, and the media creation tool from this link:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15088/windows-10-create-installation-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/15088/...</a>
<br />
<br />On another PC, follow the steps in the article I linked and you'll be able to clean install Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you need further support! Thanks!

            Hi 
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Option 1:
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings (or press Windows key + i) &gt; click Update &amp; security
<br />
<br />Click Recovery then click Get Started under Reset this PC
<br />
<br />Since we are performing a clean install, I will be selecting the option Remove everything, if you don't want to do that, you can click Keep my files
<br />
<br />Reset offers two types of clean installs:
<br />
<br />Just remove my files - this option is quicker and recommended if you just want a fresh start and you plan to keep the computer.
<br />
<br />Remove files and clean the drive - if you plan to giveaway or resell your computer, this option ensures the computer is cleaned properly. Its takes a bit longer, but it is recommended if you plan to no longer use this computer.
<br />
<br />Since I will be using this computer, I will choose the first option.
<br />
<br />Click Reset to begin
<br />
<br />Windows 10 will restart
<br />
<br />Preparing to perform a reset
<br />
<br />Resetting - this might take some time depending on the amount of data
<br />
<br />Windows will check the drive for errors and fix them.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 performs a clean install again
<br />
<br />Out of Box Experience (OOBE)
<br />
<br />The Out of Box Experience assist with personlizing your Windows experience such as creating a user account, connect to a wireless network and adjust privacy settings.
<br />
<br />
<br />Choose your country, language, keyboard layout and time zone then click Next
<br />
<br />Read and accept the End User License Agreement
<br />
<br />If you want to customize your privacy settings, you can do so now. Please note, you can always do this after setup (Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy). For now, lets use Use Express settings
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows 10 restarts
<br />
<br />Setup your username, password and a hint then click Next
<br />
<br />There you have it, a clean installation of Windows
<br />
<br />Option 2:
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />
<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setu...</a>
<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />
<br />IF YOU ARE NOT SURE WHICH EDITION YOUR SYSTEM CAME WITH, CHOOSE WINDOWS 10 HOME.
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.
<br />

            Hi Duane.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />You can try the Reset:  <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-tip-reset-your-pc-completely/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.zdnet.com/article/windows-10-tip-re...</a>
<br />
<br />But that doesn't clear the hard drive to get it cleanest.  To do that following these illustrated steps in this link which compile the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media (if necessary on another PC) install the Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key here:  <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, skip the Product Key screen and choose your licensed version only if offered.  On second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

</p><p><span>The above issue might occur due to some of the system files missing or corrupted or if the computer is infected with virus/malware.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before we assist further, I would like to ask you a few questions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Is your computer connected to domain network?</span></li><li><span>Does the issue persists only on installing the updates?</span></li><li><span>How often this issue persists?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>I suggest you to try installing all the Windows updates and check. If the issue still persists then try running System Maintenance Troubleshooter and check:</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>b) Type <strong>troubleshooting </strong>in the search box and then press enter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>c) Select <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>. Click on view all and select
<strong>System Maintenance</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>d) Click next and follow the on-screen instructions.</span></span></p>

<h2>            Q Drive is not accessible</h2>
                    <p>I put a memory card in my HP laptop to look for pics on it. For some reason the Q drive is not allowing access. It's probably been 4 - 6 months since I've used it. Can anyone tell me how to get it back please?</p>
<p>Thanks, Micki</p>

<h2>            Function Keys</h2>
                    <p>Just wondering what the Fn key that has a light on it actually does.&nbsp; If I press the keys labelled F1, F2, etc., they do whatever is on the little graphic on each key.&nbsp; Depressing the Fn key and ensuring it's lit up makes the F1, F2, etc. keys behave strangely.&nbsp;
 So what is the Fn key for?</p>

<p>Hello Wendy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The function keys are pressed to allow you to manifest the alternative function of the F keys (namely F1, F2 up to F12). The alternative function of these keys differ between programs. Here is a link that will provide more information on

<p>Olá vou explicar melhor... minha primeira assinatura live foi através de compra no próprio xbox, cadastrei meu cartão de crédito e assinei por 1 ano, em maio desse ano ela expirou, enfim, comprei outra assinatura através de cartão com código em um revendedor
 que estava um pouco mais em conta (pois permite o parcelamento, coisa que direto no xbox não é possível) e não consigo inserir o código de resgate está dando erro Xbos-0x801650C8</p>

<p>Comigo tá acontecendo a mesma coisa. Aí eu vi que esse erro é porque eu ainda tenho xbox livre ativa. Então eu esperei vencer minha livre (24/6/2015). O problema é q já venceu e continua dando o mesmo erro. E eu continuo jogando online. mesmo minha live
 tendo acabado.</p>

<h2>            Sharing apps with family members&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Can apps be shared across different user accounts on the same pc? In particular, &nbsp;if I am a parent and download a paid app for a child - is it possible for them to share that with a sibling who uses a different user account to log in and with a different
 user profile?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If this is not possible at moment can you send request to Microsoft and app developers&nbsp;as this will help to make apps more affordable for families with many kids as we are able to&nbsp;use most traditional desktop apps this way where say one educational software
 can be used by different users with different user profiles to record their progress individually.&nbsp;

            Hi Astrogirl,<br />
<br />
Apps can be installed on multiple PCs and user accounts
<p>These days, people may use several PCs in the course of their daily lives, or share PCs with more than one person in their household. We want these customers to have access to a great Windows 8 experience on all of those PCs.</p>
<p>The licensing terms allow customers to install and use their apps on any user accounts on up to 5 PCs. Why only 5 PCs? Because we also believe in the value of the developer’s investments in their apps, and we want to protect that investment from abuse.
<br />
</p>
<p>The above is a small part from the article <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsstore/archive/2012/03/12/licensing-apps.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi everyone. I searched all around for someone else who may have had the same thing happening to me, but I've only found similar posts. The problem is never exactly the same as what I'm experiencing. I've tried all the steps xbox.com tells me to, and nothing
 is working. I've tested my internet and stuff to through the xbox live test thingy.</p>
<p>My xbox won't connect to live all the time. Sometimes it does, and sometimes it doesn't, but more often than not it doesn't, and when it does it's really really slow, and nothing loads...and eventually it ends up kicking me out anyways and tells me that
 there was a problem and that it can't connect to live at this time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've done everything I know to do, and i'm at my wits end. The internet on my laptop and my phone (which is the same wifi I use at home for xbox live) runs just fine, but not on my xbox. I'm about to throw the stupid thing out the window. Can someone please
 help me?</p>

<p>Hey there Tsuki,<br />
<br />
Thanks for all that information. Those error codes definitely look like there might be some communication issues between your console and your network.<br />
<br />
From the codes that you've linked it points to a UPnP error.<br />
<br />
For your router, &nbsp;you can follow these steps to enable UPnP (if it is enabled, try disabling it)<br />
<br />
[quote]</p>
<p><span><em><b>UPnP</b></em></span></p>
<ol>
<li>Open a web browser. </li><li>Log into the router by entering the default gateway (192.168.1.1)&nbsp;into the address bar of an internet browser.&nbsp;
</li><li>When prompted, enter in "admin" for the user name and "admin" for the password.&nbsp;<br />
*Note*&nbsp;If Cisco Connect was used to configure the router then the password will be your wireless password.
</li><li>Select Administration from the menu at the top. </li><li>Enable or disable UPnP depending on need. </li><li>Select Save Settings. </li></ol>
<p>[/quote]<br />
<br />
<br />
If you still run into the same disconnect issues, you may want to try a direct wired connection to your modem. That will help us isolate the issue further.</p>
<ul>
<li>The 12VDC you posted up for the modem is the power rating of the modem. If you can find the model number, that'd be great but if not that's okay too.
</li></ul>
<p><br />
<br />
Please let us know how that goes and we'll work from there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I appreciate your help, but before I waste both of our time changing the settings of my router...would it really be a router issue if my brother's xbox is having no problems? His works just fine and it's connected to the same network. The same wireless.
 I don't wanna go into the settings of my router and end up *** everything up and causing him problems to.
</p>
<p>It just doesn't make sense that it would be the router settings when his is having no trouble and mine is.</p>

            <p>Hey there Tsuki!<br /><br />Good call! Big props to you for pointing that out. It looks like we overlooked you saying that your brother's console is on this same router.<br /><br />That looks to be the issue here. Only a select few routers can support multiple consoles at the same time. When two consoles connect to the same router and that router doesn't support multiple consoles, it will give preference to one console over the other. It sounds like that's what's happening with you right now. Your router seems to be giving preference to your brother's console over your own console.<br /><br /><strong>I did some digging and found that your router (<a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/networking-hardware/02-routers/linksys/f/3079/t/489620.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Cisco Linksys E1000</a>) doesn't support multiple consoles.</strong> I know that's probably not the news you wanted to hear, but at least we're able to understand what's going on here.</p>

<p>I suppose that could be a reason...but it still doesn't make much sense to me because until this started happening about two weeks ago, prior to that, my brother and I could both be logged into Live and there was no issues. We've multiplayed with other friends
 online using our xboxes on the same router and there was never any issues. Suddenly now my router decides it doesn't like my xbox?</p>
<p>I guess I can try to log on after my brother goes to bed when he isn't on his xbox and see if it works.</p>

<p>Also, if it doesn't support multiple consoles, how come I can be on the internet on my laptop at the same time as he's on Live at this very moment? Or that my iphone and laptop are both connected to the wireless just fine while my brother is playing around
 on live and they're working just fine? I'm so confused. It just doesn't make sense.</p>

<h2>            Right mouse click in laptop not working but USB mouse is ok.</h2>
                    <p>I updated my laptop from Windows 7 to Windows 10 about 3 weeks ago. &nbsp;The laptop mouse and an external cordless USB mouse have worked fine until a few days ago. &nbsp;Now the right click on the laptop mouse is not responding: &nbsp;no context menus on file explorer
 or other programmes - no right-click reaction in my third party picture editor where left and right clicks should paint different colours.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yet the external mouse works just fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've checked for driver updates and got the message that the mouse driver is up to date. &nbsp;I've run the "Control Panel&gt;Fix Problems" and "Control Panel&gt;Run Maintenance Tasks" without any problems being found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly: &nbsp;I tried Control Panel to switch primary and secondary mouse buttons. &nbsp;This worked as intended for the external mouse, but had no effect on the laptop mouse - i.e. the left button was still the primary ("Select") button, and right button still
 did nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suggestions???</p>

            <p>Thank you so much Kiran.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It took me a little while to find the time to work through your suggestions. &nbsp;I narrowed the problem to one service "<em>SynTPEnh</em>" and one startup "<em>Synaptics Touchpad</em>". &nbsp;I gather these are the programmes related to the laptop mouse and there
 does not seem to be a Windows 10 update yet. &nbsp;So I've disabled both and haven't noticed any loss of functionality (yet): &nbsp;my right click now works as it should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really appreciate your help in getting me sorted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards, Jim</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 Touch Screen firmware code 14 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> compros  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 Touch Screen firmware code 14</h2>
                    I have a Surface Pro 3 and looks like the Firmware for the touch screen has either a code 10 or code 14.&nbsp; I have done the update from 8.1 to Windows 10.&nbsp; Everything worked with 8.1 and originally with windows 10.&nbsp; When I determined the code 14 I followed
 many threads and suggestions in including calling Microsoft (and being told it would cost me to talk to someone).&nbsp; When I finally get someone one the phone the answer is a factory reset (That I already have done prior to talking to them).&nbsp; So then the answer
 was then you will need to do a "repair exchange" but due to the unit being out of warranty it will cost over $400 to exchange the
unit!@!#$$#@!&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; This is a firmware issue or driver issue.&nbsp; I have seen all the threads.&nbsp; This will be my 4th Surface and if this is the answer that Microsoft can provide for Microsoft hardware/software I will move to
 another companies hardware for better support.
