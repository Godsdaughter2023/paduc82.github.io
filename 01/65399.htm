            <p>The Xbox 360 media player had to make some cuts to fit in the Xbox 360 system memory. For MP4 video files, multiple audio streams (and selection thereof) is not supported. The Xbox 360 will always play the first audio stream of a media file, with no way to change the audio stream.&nbsp;</p><p>You might have to remove the English audio stream from the file or remux it, so the Spanish language track is the first in the file.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I figured it out, at least my issue.&nbsp; I was logged in as a non Microsoft account (one that wasn't the one tied to the store).&nbsp; I connected the Microsoft store to my account (domain account), and had this issue.&nbsp; I added my Microsoft account (*** Email address is removed for privacy ***)
 as a user to the PC and logged in with that.&nbsp; I logged off and then back on as my domain account, and it worked fine.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Cannot restore previous OS due to user account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gregosnz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot restore previous OS due to user account</h2>
                    Want to roll back from 10 to 7, the error is Remove New Accounts<br />
the account it references it the currently logged in account and there are no other user accounts on the computer.<br />
there has been no new user accounts created, only the upgraded one exists and that is the one it wants me to remove.<br />
It has the same folder name as the original W7 account in the win.old folder (NB it has spaces and a &amp; sign in username and folder name, but on both the same, if thats an issue)<br />
I tried this restore function from the troubleshooting boot mode aswell with similar result (error but no details).<br />
How can I delete this account when it is the only account on the pc, and without losing files and settings??<br />
Better if I can just resolve this issue rather than deleting the account though.

            <p>Thanks for the FORM response :( NOT</p>
<p><br />
If you had read my questions you will see the 2 main methods to rollback have failed multiple times and I have outlined in further detail the error message relating to the "new" user account, which you completely fail to even address.<br />
<br />
Your links would have been useful if I didnt know how to initiate the rollback at all, the only thing mildly helpful was the mention of another rollback option... but the article while mentioning it made no attempt to explain how to access it.<br />
<br />
<del>I will try the 3rd rollback method, “<strong>Time to display list if Operating Systems</strong>” posted here http://anoopcnair.com/2015/02/09/windows-10-rollback-option-missing-windows-8-1-machines/ and see if I can get it to work.
</del>didn't work so as per usual gotta fly by my seat<br />
<br />
However I feel that the failure will still exist due to the "new" user profile.<br />
Will have a look next time I'm in front of the machine.<br />

<p>Hi David, <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It would be helpful if you can provide us the list of the KB updates that failed. try to perform DISM scan followed by SFC and see about any error reports. The commands normally fixes misbehavior in Windows Update, so it is worth a try. Ensure to perform DISM
 first before SFC, just as according to this article: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If this would not work, please followup with the KB numbers in concern. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Best regards. </p>

<p>In the three months that I've owned my XBox One, I've been plagued with frequent disconnects from XBox Live.&nbsp; I haven't yet played any network-based games, so I mostly only see this in Netflix, but it has happened with other network apps as well.<br />
<br />
It goes like this: I'll be watching Netflix on the XB1 for a while.&nbsp; Then Netflix will start buffering and stop at 25%.&nbsp; Eventually it will time out and tell me there's a problem and to try later.&nbsp; If I go to the XB1 home screen at this point, it tells me I'm
 no longer logged in to XBox Live.&nbsp; If I run the network test, it tells me it can't obtain an IP address from the router.&nbsp; If I restart the XB1 or the router and rerun the network test, it says everything is fine and I can once again watch Netflix, for about
 5-10 minutes, and then it disconnects again.&nbsp; Other devices on the network all work fine and the router shows no signs of trouble.<br />
<br />
This doesn't happen every time.&nbsp; Sometimes I can watch Netflix for hours with no problems.&nbsp; Once it does start happening, though, it will keep failing until I give up and walk away for several hours.&nbsp; The failures happen far more often during the day on weekends.&nbsp;
 Usually the XBox Live status page reports some problem with some app or another, but no system-wide problems.<br />
<br />
My network environment is the exact same as I had used with my XBox 360, and it generally behaved well.&nbsp; (I did, however, update the list of forwarded ports and point them to the XB1 instead of the XB360.)&nbsp; Port forwarding works for other computers on the same
 network (different ports, of course), so I'm confident that I have it configured correctly.<br />
<br />
I have several friends debating which system to buy for the upcoming Battlefront game; I can't in good conscience recommend the XB1 while these problems persist.<br />
<br />
Data:<br />
<br />
Country/State: <strong>USA, Georgia</strong><br />
Modem: <strong>Motorola Surfboard SB6121</strong><br />
Router: Buffalo <strong>WZR-300HP</strong><br />
Other XBoxs: <strong>1 XB360</strong>, unused for months.<br />
Wireless/wired: <strong>Wireless</strong> (Mixed mode up to <strong>N</strong>, full bars of strength)<br />
Is UPnP Enabled?&nbsp; <strong>Hell no</strong><br />
NAT error?&nbsp; <strong>No errors</strong>.&nbsp; (NAT type open)<br />
ISP: <strong>Charter Cable</strong><br />
<br />
Error codes: After the connection fails and I run the network test, it says it can't obtain an IP address from the router.&nbsp; This makes no sense - I have verified that the XB1 does have an IP address with plenty of time left on the lease.&nbsp; I have played with
 variations on this - static IP address, revoking the lease and retrying, etc., but nothing stops the connection from failing again in 10 minutes.&nbsp; (Normally I set the XB1 to a "reserved" IP address through DHCP.)&nbsp; I believe that this error is a red herring
 - I don't think it's related to the initial problem, but shows a weakness in the recovery process.<br />
<br />
Things I've tried:&nbsp; Rebooting router/modem/XB1.&nbsp; Revoking and reissuing DHCP lease.&nbsp; Static local IP address.&nbsp; Confirmed port-forwarding.&nbsp; Enabling UPnP.&nbsp; Screaming.</p>

<p>This problem has disappeared for me. &nbsp;I think I solved it with a settings change on my router, but since it was always an intermittent problem, it's impossible to be sure.</p>
<p>The culprit, I believe, was a service on the Buffalo routers (and other DD-WRT routers) called "DNSMasq". &nbsp;DNSMasq, from what I've read, is both a DHCP server and a DNS cache. &nbsp;I don't know why it would be a problem, but I ran across a few posts with familiar-sounding
 symptoms interacting with Xbox Live. &nbsp;Since I turned it off, it has been smooth sailing for me.</p>
<p>On my router, it's necessary to turn it off in two places.</p>
<p>1. Setup -&gt; Basic Setup -&gt; Network Address Server Settings (DHCP). &nbsp;Uncheck "Use DNSMasq for DHCP" and uncheck "Use DNSMasq for DNS".</p>
<p>2. Services -&gt; Services -&gt; DNSMasq. &nbsp;Select the "disable" radio button.</p>
<p>Then save, apply, reboot, the usual.</p>
<p>Hopefully this will save some of the rest of you some pain. &nbsp;Happy zombie hunting, or whatever y'all are into!</p>

    <title>Reverse a sync between laptop and external hard drive&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cintibonnie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reverse a sync between laptop and external hard drive&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I spent significant time recently organizing my Picture file. &nbsp;The new structure is much cleaner and eliminated thousands of duplicates. &nbsp;My intent was to attach the external drive, delete the old Picture structure and then backup the new one. &nbsp;I don't know
 how (I didn't select Sync) but all of the old material from the external drive was transferred onto my laptop hard drive. &nbsp;While I did not lose any photos, I regained thousands that I did not want and now have overlapping files. &nbsp;I considered a System Restore
 but my understanding is that would only restore program files and would do nothing to take the Picture files back to the way I wanted them. &nbsp;Do I have any options other than going thru and repeating all of my earlier work? &nbsp;Thanks.</p>

            <p>With a little bit of scripting it is possible to do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a comprehensive list of all files that exist on the external disk.</li><li>Grab the first name in this list and delete if from the corresponding place on the internal disk.</li><li>Same for the next file.</li><li>etc.</li></ol>
<p>. . . if this is what you want! To make the process robust one would do this in two passes:</p>
<p>Pass 1: Create a list of files that would be deleted.</p>
<p>Pass 2: Delete them if approval is given.</p>

            <p>Please excuse me BUT indicating that I need to check with Logitech is not an answer. &nbsp;Telling me that Windows 10 will have drivers is not a NOW solution. &nbsp;What I think you are telling me is that you don't know and there aren't any compatible webcams you
 know of that will accommodate the solution for me NOW. &nbsp;Right? &nbsp;No, to answer your question, you did not give me an answer and it wasn't helpful at all. &nbsp;Why oh WHY can't developers be on target with companies that DO offer webcams that work with your upgraded
 Windows platform. &nbsp;VERY pitiful indeed.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Microsoft does not write the drivers for 3rd party peripherals, the device makers<br />
such as Logitech do that.<br />
<br />
Did you check the links I posted? Logitech has camera's that are Windows 10<br />
compatible now.<br />
<br />
If you check the other links you may find others that are Windows 10 compatible<br />
that are available now.<br />

    <title>Green Lantern&#58; The Wheel of Reincarnation - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sheriff knight  say:</h3>
<h2>            Green Lantern&#58; The Wheel of Reincarnation</h2>
                    
<p>The mystery of the lantern dates back to ancient times. In the cycle of reincarnation, It was used to describe both the progression of the spirit and heavenly occurrences.
<br />
The lantern festival symbolized the progression of the spirit for hundreds of years, in order to bring guidance and peace to the spirits who had passed in the past year. But the lantern also symbolized more than a light in the darkness of the world. The progress
 of the flow of energy in wheel, was described as a thousand year cycle. This describes the different forms of energy that made up the wheel.<br />
Each lantern describes a focus of energy. That energy focus was not just a single armor suit, but they mystery of the creation of that lantern as well. Many armor forms where created to contain the shadows of the past, by the use of the wheel of reincarnation.
 In myth it was suggested that the armor design was created within a cycle its self, and was described as a lantern its self, in order to conceal its existence. But it was also created with an intended weakness, known only to the person who created it.<br />
In order to create such a lantern, required a great amount of energy, a connection to the heavens. The ring pattern of the armor is secret, but It is clear that the single false ring was not known to any but the armorer. That ring was secretly upon the finger
 to the one meant to wield the energy contained within the armor, and yet its energy was also a mystery. It may be that with the creation of each armor suit, only the wearer knew that it was meant for them alone.<br />
The connection to ancient armor forms is clear, but the concept of the lantern as an energy source to guide the spirit and protect, is significant. Even though the armor suits that where created all held a purpose, the connection to the missing ring takes on
 new meaning. The different focuses of that energy, or chi, where often considered indistinguishable from those who wielded it. Though a clear connection to martial arts exists through the consideration of the flow of universal energy or chi in the natural
 world, It often had significance as a connection in spirit in nature.<br />
The lantern was a mystery, and at the same time its significance reaches through many cultures and history. A description of both the progression of the spirit, and a way to describe the heavenly bodies in ancient times. The study of the different energy forms
 was the focus of different schools of thought in martial skill, this was often described as the flow of the river in relation to time. This idea of a spiritual connection crosses many cultures, so a greater question is how is the lantern formed to begin with?
 I think the answer is not only the creation of spirit armor, but the connection to the wheel of reincarnation its self.</p>

            <p>I too have a similar issue, probably connected to an email change on my account. Windows 10 complains that there is an issue, click here to fix it, then "oops there is a problem, sign in to account.live.com" , yet everything seems fine when I do.</p>

<p>As a non-expert one doesn't have a clue what to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here the troubleshooter fails: at least it should tell the user where to look, what to do.</p>
<p>That's to say - that is<strong> my </strong>idea.</p>
<p>
</p><p>at the end the troubleshooter reports this.</p>

</p><p>I want to install a program (Partek Genomics Suite). To get a license for this program I had to give the people of PARTEK my Hoste Name, Host Ids and Operating System. They provided me with a license. But when I try to install it, I notice that the Host

<p>

    <title>Customer Service Call - &#91;Mod removed&#93; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> i3lacklight  say:</h3>
<h2>            Customer Service Call - &#91;Mod removed&#93;</h2>
                    
<p>Customer Support: At this time I was released from your unhelpful support line that led me on thinking he was going to resolve my issue. He stated sorry for the I convenience and would send me a gold token, I even received an email stating such, and multiple
 "Support Codes" from automated #837-401. I received no resolution to my problem. Just irritation being told I was going to get help for 53minutes of my contracted cellphone time and per the last two minutes being told "your out of luck". I was at a loss for
 words. Up front I would be more reasonable, but after quote unquote resolving my issue then to cover himself, opened another trouble ticket [Mod removed] on my wife's account, which I was speaking on behalf for, stated that he had to "educate me" and it was
 resolved. No! It was not resolved. So first telling me this, now belittling your customers. I will leave it at that. So, what changed through the duration of the call for him to completely withdrawal any support he promised and with no explanation other than
 they were "trials"? According to step 2 of Microsoft's gold membership troubleshooting page it states there is no limit on trial subscriptions for non-gold accounts to be renewed. My issue is that I redeemed 2 separate 14day trials of xbox gold on 2 separate
 accounts that were expired. The QR code said successful so I moved on and I logged into my wife's account and did the same with her trial. Loaded up my game and tried to play online and got redirected to subscriptions. So the codes took but never actually
 gave me the time. Following, I tried to manually enter the codes and it stated this code has already been used. Is it possible I got bad customer assistance and that I can actually receive help with issue? I'm not asking for 1 month handouts but just the 2
 separate 14day trials that came with my purchases so my wife and I can enjoy our new console. On Aug 22, 2014, at 9:34 PM, Xbox Customer Support wrote: Hi Jon Thanks for your recent contact with Xbox Support. Following our conversation, you may receive an

<p>Sorry to say this but you would need to phone support again to sort this out,there's nothing anyone on the forums can do as we are mainly just regular xbox users &amp; don't have access to any converstations you have had with phone support.</p>
<p>Trial codes do expire &amp; it will tell you when on the back of the card.</p>
<p>If the codes you entered had expired then there's nothing you can do really,you wont be entitled to another 2 trials unless you get them with another game</p>

<p>Apologies for the reference numbers I see the mods have already removed them, I didn't realize. &nbsp;The only reason I felt the need to have them in mention is for maybe someone important in customer service to look it up. &nbsp;Badger mentioned it's mostly users
 on here helping one another (which is great) but a silly ref# wouldn't mean anything to us users anyways, &nbsp;I would just assume someone from "Microsoft Xbox" also cares enough about customers to view their forums... &nbsp; I got the two codes within XboxOne console
 purchases (kinect bundle version) and when I used them it even said "was successful" so obviously they worked cause now they say "already been used" it just never actually gave me ...... &nbsp;</p>
<p>My point now is more aimed at: How would you feel as someone who just dropped $500 on a next gen console, you call customer support and are on the phone for almost an hour for something as trivial to them as a "gold token" (which is free! if I wanna sync
 my credit card to my account, not happening) ?? &nbsp;You get promised resolution as he does his job creating small talk to break the dead silence. &nbsp;Constantly checking your text msg and email for security/privacy confirmation awaiting that relief. Then! After
 53min he tells you to "take the codes to the retailer". &nbsp; Knowing that the sweet grey grandma that works in the electronics dept won't have a clue what I'm talking about, &nbsp;then flat out tells me then "your just outta luck!" &nbsp;From my customer service experience
 you could word that differently but would never blow off a customer like that... Then without telling the caller, open a second trouble ticket under another account that's not even his! (my wife) &nbsp;and say in the notes had to "educate him and is resolved",
 what exactly got resolved other than your subpar service got to hang up the phone call... &nbsp;So back to my question as a user, what you do after being belittled by a helpdesk clerk that took your time and couldn't help you?? &nbsp;Easy answer here is suck it up and
 carry on, but I think if he couldn't help me he would have told me in the first place versus all wasted time and confirmations, etc.

<p>Hi i3lacklight,</p>
<p>There is an ongoing issue with Trial xbox live gold codes as of the moment.</p>
<p>Support have informed me that they are working on a resolution.</p>
<p>I'm waiting to hear from them as well so sit back and enjoy the console offline for the moment.</p>
<p>I'll keep you posted once they can confirm its been resolved.</p>

<p>As Onyx stated, some trial codes are game specific. It is possible that you really have no problem at all with the codes. Try the game that the codes came with. You may have online abilities with those games, however it may be limited as some trials do not
 unlock everything. This may also be why phone support had problems helping you.</p>

<p>October: &nbsp;I did some digging and found out others are having the issue will the trials as well. But as I said before if it's a known issue then this rep just completely led me on.... &nbsp;Since so many are having issues, I doubt anything will come of it, but
 I've also read people got reimburst for less than what happened to me they just made a bigger scene about it. &nbsp;So should I just be one of those *** off, yelling, and cussing customers for them to do something??
</p>
<p>Outsider/Onyx: &nbsp;Game specific? &nbsp;I would try the code with that game, but wait it came with the console! Should I return my console and be like, "the trial doesn't work". &nbsp;Unless stated otherwise, A gold trial membership should be &nbsp;just that "gold" and allow
 online play across the board. &nbsp; I work in the IT field and actually have a Microsoft &nbsp;MCIP Certification, so unless they have some kinda Active Directory setup to delegate permissions (which they don't) the codes are just inserts with dead codes. &nbsp;</p>

<p>I just re-read your original post and have another question. Why did your accounts expire? It may well be a billing issue as I doubt the code would work if there was money still owed on the accounts. You may want to review the billing area of your account
 to see if it shows a balance owed. </p>

            Try to make a recovery drive using another PC with Windows 8, if you can. Make sure it is the same bitnees as your own PC: 32-bit or 64-bit. Maybe this will get you out of your impasse.

            I ran into the same issue.
<div><br />
<div>After the first crash I couldn't boot but Automatic Repair fixed it. This happened a few times so I suspected HDD bad sectors. I ran chkdsk /f /r to make sure, but when I returned to my computer it was stuck in the Automatic Repair loop. (Another chkdsk
 run through the Recovery Command Prompt tells me the HDD is fine.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>Automatic Repair no longer fixes the issue, it's stuck in infinite loop. I checked the SrtTrail.txt log file and there are no errors. I can't Refresh the PC either, though it doesn't tell me why.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I upgraded from Windows 7 and never had these issues before Windows 8.</div>

            I have a recovery USB and though it let me to run the Recovery Command Prompt (to save my files and to run chkdsk) it also can't fix the issue through Automatic Repair or Refresh. So I doubt it helps, though it's worth a try.

            <p>Try going to advanced boot options and choose safe boot. See if it takes you to the login screen and breaks out of the loop. I had a similar issue with Windows 2012 and just resolved it this way.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
BitLocker is a professional&nbsp;level encryption program and should not be used unless one really understands that it is&nbsp;secure and can not be broken by any&nbsp;usual or inexpensive methods IF AT ALL. Only those with superior backup strategies should even consider
 its use.<br />

BitLocker is more frequently used and supported by those&nbsp;in the TechNet IT Pro Forums.<br />

    <title>Xbox Marketplace The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt Complete Edition wrong - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> faizmakako  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Marketplace The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt Complete Edition wrong pricing for black Friday sale</h2>
                    <p>I have been I touch with Xbox One support for 2 hours and have highlighted the issue with case no.&nbsp;1364089783. Basically I have highlighted and taken my time to inform that the price consumer being charged is wrong based on black Friday sales for The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt Complete Edition. As published by Major Nelson site. <a href="https://majornelson.com/2016/11/18/black-friday-xbox-digital-game-deals-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://majornelson.com/2016/11/18/black-friday-xbox-digital-game-deals-and-more/</a>. The game is on sale for 40% off for non gold members and 50% off for gold members. As on time of this posting, consumers are being misled and wrongly charged for the game.
