<p>
</p><p>Had that basic same scenario here for a while, figured out some partial work arounds that helped, &nbsp;but eventually what seemed to stop the disconnecting was manually&nbsp;setting matching DNS in the adapter, the wifi access point &amp; the router/modem.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used OpenDNS.com &amp; had a mix of opendns and google in my router/modem... then the instant all matched everywhere the problem quit.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe just a fluke and Microsoft update fixed it - but sure happened at same time I changed the dns.

<h2>            KB2310138, KB3197868, KB890830 Problems&#58; Interferes with Internet Access Using IE and Firefox</h2>
                    One of these 3 updates installed on 11/10/16 seems to interfere with accessing websites in Firefox browser and the IE browser.&nbsp; I don't know which one.&nbsp; Going back to a restore point before these 3 installations on 11/11/16&nbsp; eliminated the problem.&nbsp; However,
 the automatic update system reinstalled them causing the problem again.&nbsp; So, again, I went back to a restore point before the initial install of these 3 updates and the problem was again resolved.&nbsp; I have also stopped automatic updates.&nbsp; Which update is the
 problem and how can it be resolved?

<p>I am having a similar issue -- I installed the latest updates and Security Center stopped working and could not be restarted. &nbsp;I had to go back to the restore point prior to the updates and everything is working fine. &nbsp;I don't know which of the updates it
 is, but since all the others refer to Microsoft Office products, I'm assuming it's the Quality Roll-up for Windows 7 x64 systems update (KB3197868). &nbsp;None of the troubleshooters could find a problem and yet I could not get the Security Center to start. &nbsp;All
 my other anti-virus, and network drivers etc. are up to date.</p>

            <p>Since KB3197868 automatically installed without a problem on my Win 7 (64bit), I was facing a major problem with Firefox and Internet Explorer. Firefox became slow, often was not responding, on Facebook I often got a unresponsive script. In the searchbar
 of Amazon I had the problem that the letters I was typing didn’t show up and it sort of freezed. Similiar problem in Internet Explorer with the Google Search. Couldn’t find anyone who is facing the same problem exept you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this problem gets more attention. It took me hours to find the cause for that. Before I found the cause I had started Firefox without add-ons, still same problem. Reseting Firefox (sorry, don’t know if this is the right english word for that), still
 same problem. Even installing Firefox again, same problem. Since I deinstalled the KB3197868 everything in Firefox and Internet Explorer works fine again.

<p>As I stated above I actually ended up going back to a restore point set prior to the last set of updates. &nbsp;When the updates came back down I installed everything else other than KB3197868 and everything is working fine. &nbsp;I'm not having any issues with Security
 Center and checking throughout the day today everything seems to be working as before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whatever is "rolled up" in KB3197868 is causing an issue with several users, some internationally. &nbsp;Do a Google search for "KB3197868" -- you'll find the same search issues and other issues are occurring after KB3197868's install. &nbsp;It's not just you and
 me.</p>

</p><p>What will going to do next is to try to isolate if this is a software conflict. Update your Windows and follow the article on how to
<em><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">clean boot</a></strong></em> and try to connect to the internet. There's an OS selection box on the top of the page, just choose your OS and follow the instruction.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><em>NOTE: Use a mobile device or a separate working PC with an internet connection to follow the instruction after updating your PC.</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the concern doesn't manifest on this mode then it's either an add-ons or a third party software is causing this. If in case you found which software is causing this and you're using the software, we suggest that you suspend the update or keep the software
 disabled as it's not compatible with the update.</p>

<h2>            Cant seem to get Windows update to work in Windows 10</h2>
                    I visited a porno site called You Porn, I was just trying to scroll down the page but clicked on one of the videos by accident. As soon as I did it said something like it couldn't play the video because of some kind of video driver problem. I immediately
 tried to do a virus scan and it appeared to start but then it stopped and said it couldn't perform the operation. I tried to download Windows defender updates and that didn't work either. So I just did a system restore to a week earlier which seemed to fix
 the computer. But a week later I was surfing Yahoo and reading the news images and It said something about a video driver problem again. Then my screen reduced in size and my icons became bigger. I had to do another system restore to an even earlier date.
 Now my screen is back to normal but when I try to check for Windows updates it says it's downloading the first update for Windows Defender but it just sits on 0% and doesn't appear to be doing anything. I don't think my windows updat

    <title>Email&#47;Calendar Sync Problem with Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> flakstones  say:</h3>
<h2>            Email&#47;Calendar Sync Problem with Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have a new Surface Pro 4, and I access emails (personal and work) and work calendar through &nbsp;Windows 10's internal Mail and Calendar app. &nbsp;I have multiple email accounts in Window Mail, a work one through an Exchange server, several AT&amp;T/Yahoo accounts,
 and a few Gmail accounts. &nbsp;All of them worked fine for a month ... until some time on Friday (Jan. 13). &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since then, when I open the Windows Mail app, all of the accounts show on the left-hand side of the screen (I have that format option chosen), but: &nbsp;(a) my Work email account is empty of all Inbox messages; (b) my Work calendar is no longer synced; (c) one
 of my AT&amp;T/Yahoo accounts shows messages, including an unread one from the 13th, but nothing I do with that account makes any difference (e.g.- I can delete email messages, but they come right back when I re-open Windows Mail); (d) the other email accounts
 won't show any messages at all (though several show on the left that I have unread messages); (e) when I try to Manage Accounts through the Settings key in Windows Mail, no accounts are shown (though I can get into the Accounts to look at settings by right-clicking
 on the account names on the left-hand side or through the email tab of the main Windows 10 settings tab); (f) at times, new emails show up on the notifications; (g) the number of pending unread new emails is shown on the Mail tab on the taskbar (which I added);
 (h) the New Mail button doesn't work on the left-hand side under any account; and (i) sometimes when I start Windows Mail, no accounts at all show on the left-hand side.<br />
<br />
I've done a lot of online reading to learn various potential fixes. &nbsp;Among other things, (i) &nbsp;I've run the Sync function repeatedly on each mail and calendar account, (ii) checked all of the email and calendar settings in the Windows Mail and they are the same
 as always (with most providing for immediate or at least hourly download, and showing all or last-few-month's messages), (iii) confirmed that the privacy settings in Windows 10 allow for the syncing, (iv) tried changing the sync type/frequency, etc. to get
 the syncing to re-start (a fix that worked on an old Windows 8.1 device), (v) tried to delete an email account to re-set again later to get syncing to restart (another 8.1 fix) but the deletion doesn't "take" (the account remains on the left-hand side, even
 after restart, but now right-clicking won't even work, (vi) confirmed that the email accounts still remain in the email accounts portion of the main Windows 10 settings; (vii) ran the Windows app troubleshooter, which said Windows Store cache may be damaged,
 but "not fixed" (and I even unsuccessfully tried some fixes for that as well), (viii) tried to utilize different formatting options for Windows Mail, (ix) I tried opening Windows Mail both on the taskbar in Windows mode and as a tile in tablet mode; (x) ran
 a few different anti-virus/malware programs; (xi) disabled anti-virus/malware programs to see if they were conflicting; (xii) confirmed that all Windows updates (including Mail updates) had been installed; (xiii) did a Safe Boot and ran anti-virus/malware
 again; and (xiv) did a clean boot. &nbsp;None of these steps fixed the problem. &nbsp;I did not take any steps at this point that would involve loss of all of my data (e.g.- re-install Windows 10). &nbsp;<br />
<br />
To be clear, I did not add any new programs or apps to my Surface during the time period in question, and there doesn't appear to have been any Windows updates during that period either (though there was one after the problem arose). &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Does anyone have suggestions or thoughts on the likely source of the problem and/or possible solutions? &nbsp; If so, please let me know.&nbsp; Thank you.</p>

            <p>I just wanted to provide an update, since at least a few people appeared to have a similar problem. &nbsp;I have fixed the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Under the Windows 10 settings, you can click the System button, and one of the choices is Apps &amp; Features. &nbsp;Click on it, and then scroll down to Mail &amp; Calendar. &nbsp;Click on Advanced Options, and there will then be a button for Reset. &nbsp;When you click on it,
 it warns you that it may cause loss of data and/or preferences (or something like that), so I had refrained from choosing that approach beforehand (since I was trying to find a fix without loss of old emails). &nbsp;I decided to go forward with this approach since
 I had not gotten any response to my inquiry (and, by the way, a subsequent System Restore to a point before the problem arose didn't work either). &nbsp;The Reset of the Mail &amp; Calendar app worked, and I didn't lose any of my emails (past ones or the ones since
 the problem arose). &nbsp;Your mileage may vary, but I thought it was worthwhile to mention what worked for me at least for my emails (my Calendar still doesn't work, but I'll play around with that further). &nbsp;</p>

            <p>It looks like I spoke too soon. &nbsp;The resetting of the Mail &amp; Calendar app updated all of my emails to the exact time of the re-setting, but there is no syncing of emails after that point. &nbsp;In other words, it caught up with the last 5 days or so of emails,
 but won't sync after that point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks like an uninstall and re-install of the Mail &amp; Calendar app is on the horizon. &nbsp;In that case, is there any way to copy the old email files, etc. (i.e.- are they saved in a file somewhere?)? &nbsp; I don't want to have to re-sync everything again if I
 can avoid it. &nbsp;I have lots of subfolders on my email accounts, especially the work account, and separate syncing of each and every subfolder is required in the Mail &amp; Calendar app in Windows 10 (unlike my prior experience with Windows 8.1's mail app).</p>

            <p>Thank you for the response, Haileeey. &nbsp;After some more review, the back-up doesn't work that way with Windows 8.1. &nbsp;I did find the Windows 10 back-up method as part of that process, though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was going to re-install Windows Mail &amp; Calendar this weekend, but the tablet won't allow me to do it. &nbsp;The "uninstall" button is greyed-out when in Apps &amp; Features, and I also tried a Windows Powershell approach (which was discussed in various online sources,
 including here) but it wouldn't work either. &nbsp;I think that Windows 10 is now programmed to prevent people from deleting Mail &amp; Calendar (i.e.- lots of dummies will accidentally do so). &nbsp;I think I saw some more online sources on that point, and I'll have to
 do some more research.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been a loyal Microsoft customer since the early MS/DOS days, and I was planning to have my whole company move to Surface Pro 4 tablets, but this email/calendar problem and the inability to resolve the problem despite a wide variety of approaches is
 making me re-think that move (and it's hard for me to recommend the new Surfaces to others, either). &nbsp;</p>

            Yeah, Win10 doesn't offer an option to uninstall certain native apps. I saw 3rd party programs to uninstall Windows 10 apps but it's on your own discretion: http://www.intowindows.com/3-programs-to-uninstall-windows-10-apps/

            <p>I am currently trying my level best to get this issue escalated, anyone else facing this issue should join the thread.&nbsp; We faced this issue last September and developers fixed it.&nbsp; It reared its head again on the 6th May 2015.&nbsp; Some users may not be aware
 of this issue yet.&nbsp; Those who do not frequent their event viewer will not know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is not a hardware issue, not a windows update issue, we have all checked these options, system restore&nbsp;does not resolve the failing url.&nbsp; Members with brand new pcs and laptops have this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Removing recent updates is not a resolve, it does not make the error vanish.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is a serious malfunctioning url - we genuinely deserve support.&nbsp;</p>

 remains unanswered at present.</p>

            <p>Yes I fully understand your frustration, I have four Laptops all doing this and like you, it started on the 6th May 2015.&nbsp; Some users never check their event logs and therefore will be unaware this issue exists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, rest assured, I have reported this issue to Microsoft and so far I have got as far as Level 3 Technical Support and I have been informed that this issue has been escalated and a full investigation is being carried out to try and establish why this
 url is malfunctioning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I have any further news, I will post back.&nbsp; There are temporary fixes you can carry out on your system to prevent tis issue occurring, if you require the full details just post back.&nbsp; Personally I prefer not to tamper with things and await the correct
 fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We had the exact same issue in September 2014 and it was fixed within 3 days, this time it is taking much longer but Microsoft are busy working on the release of Windows 10 so I guess we have to be patient.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind Regards&nbsp;</p>

<p>I just knew this would happen.&nbsp; I worked closely with Microsoft Level 3 support for six weeks from May onwards trying to get them to fix this issue.&nbsp; They assured me they were acknowledging this as a serious issue.&nbsp; After six weeks they recommended I wait
 for Windows 10 and all would be well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I refused the upgrade, I knew it would not resolve, all versions of Windows connect to the Microsoft server and they did acknowledge it was a server issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am going to get back to them know and suggest that once again they look for a fix.</p>

            <p>A new resolution to the issue without changing the url in the registry or touching anything we shouldn't really:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click on time and date at bottom right of screen.</p>
<p>select Internet time</p>
<p>change the server in the drop down list from windows time to nist.gov.&nbsp;&nbsp; Update the time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your system should now be error free:&nbsp; I have tested this by refreshing all hardware devices etc.&nbsp; all OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The nist.gov time server is obviously correct to the millisecond and the window time server is not!&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I have been running windows successfully on the correct time server and the correct url in the registry since 2nd October when Microsoft assured me the timing error had been fixed.</p>
<p>I agree it appeared it had and my systems were working flawlessly and I finally accepted after six months of begging, they had finally answered my requests.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; at 1am on 29th October during maintenance I note that on all 3 operating systems I have, the 131 event ID returned.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried changing the time server to nist.gov - doesn't work for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I find it hard to believe that Microsoft fixed this on 2nd October and then a few days after 'daylight saving'&nbsp;&nbsp; it&nbsp;suddenly re-appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have reverted back to the alternate url in the registry and all is well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I for one will never change my systems back to the correct url, I cannot trust Microsoft anymore with their open ended promises and this merely racks havoc with my systems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am sure all of you will note the Event ID 131 has returned.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You fix something (2ndOctober)&nbsp; and following daylight saving it re-appears on 29th October.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Error message &#34;Display driver igfx stopped responding and has - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bjp24  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error message &#34;Display driver igfx stopped responding and has successfully recovered&#34; occurs when plugging in HDMI cable to a Samsung tv</h2>
                    When I attempt to plug in an HDMI cable from my Dell Laptop to my Samsung TV, the laptop screen goes black, and if I leave the HDMI cable plugged in, the computer turns blue screen and shuts down. If I remove the HDMI cable within a few seconds time, the
 laptop recovers and displays the message: "Display driver igfx stopped responding and has successfully recovered." Everything is updated as much as possible on my laptop, including drivers.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The TV does notice HDMI is plugged in, but says to check the connection, power supply, or source, all of which are fine. The TV does not show anything from the laptop at any time, until the blue screen shows up right before the laptop shuts down.&nbsp;<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Laptop data:</div>
<div>Windows Vista Home Premium</div>
<div>Intel(R) Core(TM)2 Duo CPU&nbsp;</div>
<div>3.0 GB RAM</div>
<div>32-bit Operating System</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Samsung TV data:</div>
<div>UN46D4300</div>
<div>Samsung Smart TV</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help to get my HDMI connection between my tv and laptop working would be greatly appreciated.</div>

<h2>            System randomly stutters</h2>
                    Hello, this is my first thread here, so don't get too mad at me if I post it in the wrong place, or other likely newbish errors! ;)
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have a little problem going here, my computer sometimes drops in performance drastically for about 10 seconds, then comes back to normal. I'm not sure what's the cause, but my first guess is some problem with the system interrupts. The best scenario
 here is the following:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm playing any sort of medium-high requirements game, such as Skyrim, Battlefield 3, etc. at some settings that give me 60fps on the edge of my quality possibilities. The game may run smoothly for minutes, hours, even for a whole day, but sometimes my
 FPS drop to 10-20, so I open the task manager and find this "System interrupts" process eating about 30% of the CPU.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've read other people's problems and most of them get solved by updating drivers, restoring some terrible registry modification or even cleaning malware. My drivers are up to date, I'm certain the registry remains untouched and there's no malware to be
 seen. This also happened quite often during my previous installation, so I'm starting to think it's some sort of hardware issue.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Can someone shed some light here? Thanks in advance</div>
                </div>

<p><span>Hi Hector,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As you have mentioned, this issue could be due to the outdated drivers, virus or malicious software infection, unnecessary conflicts from the other programs or faulty hardware on the computer. I would like to ask a
 few questions regarding this issue:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does this happen only when you play the games on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>How did you update the drivers for all the devices on your computer? Did you install it from the computer or device manufacturer websites?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Do you have any third party security program installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you install all the pending updates for the operating system via Windows Updates?</span></p>
<p><span><span>5)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What were the recent changes that you have made to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if that help.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><i><span>Method 1: Run the System Maintenance Troubleshooter</span></i></b></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>The “<b><i>System Maintenance</i></b>” Troubleshooter is an automated tool which checks for the common maintenance tasks on Windows. Try using the System Maintenance troubleshooter to automatically
 find and fix problems affecting the performance of the system. Follow these steps to run the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press “Windows Logo” + “W” keys from the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type “<b><i>Troubleshooting</i></b>” in the search bar and press “Enter”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the “<b><i>Troubleshooting</i></b>” window, click on “<b><i>View All</i></b>” on the left pane.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>Click on “<b><i>System Maintenance</i></b>”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on “<b><i>Advanced</i></b>” and then click on “<b><i>Run as Administrator</i></b>”.</span></p>
<p><span><span>f)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click “<b><i>Next</i></b>” and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the troubleshooting process.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may check the troubleshooting report and let’s know the details. You may also try the suggestions given by the troubleshooter and check if that helps.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><i><span>Method 2: Update the Drivers via Windows Update and from the Computer/Device Manufacturer’s website</span></i></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><i><span>Step 1: </span>
</i></b><b><i><span>Check the Windows updates for any latest driver updates.</span></i></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check in Windows updates if any driver updates are available. If so, install the same and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt">
<span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Press “Windows Logo” + “W” keys from the keyboard.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt">
<span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Type “<b><i>Updates</i></b>” in the search bar and click on the icon “<b><i>Windows Update</i></b>” from the search results.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt">
<span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the “<b><i>Windows Update</i></b>” window, click on the link: “<b><i>Check for updates</i></b>” from the left hand side of the window to receive a fresh list of updates.</span></p>
<p style="margin-left: 36pt">
<span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If the updates are available, then install all the updates listed there.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If Windows Update does not offer the latest Windows 8 driver, then try the next step.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><i><span>Step 2: Update Driver Software from the Computer/Device Manufacturer’s website:</span></i></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Go to the Computer/Device Manufacturer’s website and search for the latest Windows 8 compatible drivers for all the devices on the computer. If available, then you should download and install them
 on the computer and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue still persists, then let’s make sure that the computer is free from any virus or other malicious software. Let’s perform a complete security scan using Microsoft Safety Scanner in Safe
 Mode with Networking.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><i><span>Method 3: Boot the computer in Safe Mode with Networking and perform a scan using Microsoft Safety Scanner</span></i></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><i><span>Step 1: Boot the computer in Safe Mode with Networking</span></i></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In Windows, we can start the computer in different advanced troubleshooting modes to find and fix problems on the PC. One of such troubleshooting mode is Safe Mode with Networking. Here we start Windows with a minimal
 set of drivers and services, including the network drivers. Please refer to the steps in this article to boot the computer in safe mode with networking:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/windows-startup-settings-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><i><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)</span></i></b></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After booting the computer in Safe Mode with Networking, you may check if you still get the same error pop-up as mentioned in your query and let’s know the result. You can also download Microsoft Safety Scanner
 from the link given below and then perform a complete security scan.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><i><span>Download Microsoft Safety Scanner</span></i></b></a></span></p>
<p><b><i><span>&nbsp;</span></i></b></p>
<p><b><i><span>Important: When running a scan using an anti-virus program, any data files that are infected may be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.</span></i></b></p>

<p>Thanks for the quick answer. I'll try to be as accurate as possible:</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Does this happen only when you play the games on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>I'm not sure, but I think the CPU gets hogged too even while browsing files. It only stutters when the CPU load is heavy though.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>How did you update the drivers for all the devices on your computer? Did you install it from the computer or device manufacturer websites?</span></p>
<p><span>Most of them were updated though the respective manufacturer's website. None were installed from physical devices, such as USB drives, CDs or DVDs.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Do you have any third party security program installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>Not currently, but I'm getting kaspersky's tools right now to check for malware. Should I install any commercial antivirus software?</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Did you install all the pending updates for the operating system via Windows Updates?</span></p>
<p><span>I didn't install the optional ones, however all the default updates are installed and the system is up to date (as far as I can tell).</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span><span>5)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>What were the recent changes that you have made to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p>Since I upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 8. This could be months, or even a year ago. I went back to W7 some time ago but reinstalled W8 quickly.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><i><span>Method 1: Run the System Maintenance Troubleshooter</span></i></b></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>"Troubleshooting was completed - No changes or updates were necessary"</p>

<p><b><i><span>Step 1: </span></i></b><b><i><span>Check the Windows updates for any latest driver updates.</span></i></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>No important updates were found here. This shouldn't even matter since this problem has been going for months</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><i><span>Step 2: Update Driver Software from the Computer/Device Manufacturer’s website:</span></i></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>This made me remember that my storage is composed of an SSD and 2 RAID 0 arrays built at hardware level, maybe there's some sort of incompatibility between hardware-level RAID and Windows 8?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Or maybe this gets fixed with Windows 8.1... But I don't really want to update until it gets fixed and stable.</p>

<h2>            Windows move about on multiple monitor wake up</h2>
                    <p>There are loads of threads on this around the internet but surely, surely after all this time there has to be an answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get my three screens set up how I like, outlook on the left, InDesign in the middle, skype etc on the right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go and make a cup of tea, screens turn off as per power settings, return, turn back on, InDesign and outlook now on the left, skype in the middle and nothing on the right, or some other random set up I did not specify.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If MS are not interested in this problem, is there not a third party app which will 100% make sure my apps are where I left them?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think what happens is the screens turn off a split second difference between them causing this issue. However its not an issue in macOS so I have to assume its fixable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please!</p>

<p>Hi Gareth,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is most likely with the graphics driver. Whenever a single monitor from a multiple display setup in Windows, it will attempt to move everything from that screen onto the remaining screens. Usually, this issue should not occur when suspending, hibernating,
 or shutting down. Having said that, we suggest that you update the graphics driver by following the steps on this link:
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Update drivers in Windows 10</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In case that the issue persists after following the steps on the link above, we suggest that you update the graphics driver by going to the chipset manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<p>Hi thank you for replying but this is windows 10, whats the chances I can even run anything here without it being the latest version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the latest version of nvidia drivers. However I think iut should be windows controlling its apps, not graphics drivers, sorry it just feels like a cop out. Why is a preference not saved for my window locations in windows?</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I hook up another monitor to my mac, it remembers that last time I had mail app on that screen and moves just the app over to it when connected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Perhaps windows should implement something similar because its 2017 and these stupid issues should not persist. Or at the very least talk to the only two makers of graphics chips and work something out.</p>

<p><strong><em>I think what happens is the screens turn off a split second difference between them causing this issue.
</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>In that case try using Hibernate.&nbsp; Then it is up to the OS to preserve the machine state before quiescing. &nbsp; However, then the problem will be making the physical state of the machine come back before you do a Resume.&nbsp; In the case of a monitor which was
 acquired wirelessly that may be impossible.&nbsp; So if you are using a multi-monitor configuration I think you need to get used to occasionally throwing windows back to the general location of where you want them, e.g. using Win+Shift+CursorLeft.&nbsp; At least then
 they seem to remember the original size and shape.&nbsp; For example, I have exactly the same problem with my HDMI monitor (Second Screen Only) that gets lost somehow by Sleep.&nbsp; Then all the windows get placed on the (Portrait oriented) tablet and may or may not
 need to be thrown back.&nbsp; However, switching back to Second Screen Only again (e.g. using Win+P, End, Enter) remarkably often does restore the windows exactly where they were.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what happens in your case if you temporarily switch your display configuration to Second Screen Only?&nbsp; Is the third monitor part of that description?&nbsp; Then maybe you would be able to preserve the position of more of your windows.&nbsp; Doing Extend from Second
 Screen Only may or may not make things appear again on the primary monitor.&nbsp; But I imagine it can depend on the application involved.&nbsp; Notepad windows seem to stay put for example.&nbsp; But that can cause confusion if you forget about a previous state with a different
 display configuration.&nbsp; E.g. if you don't have the monitor to use again you would need to use keyboard tricks to get off-screen windows back to somewhere visible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I would like to see is an enhancement to the Task view UI (Win-Tab or swipe from the left) which would allow us to throw windows to other monitors, e.g. not just limit its throwing to different Desktops on the same monitor.&nbsp; Or how about being allowed
 to drag a window thumbnail to a different monitor?&nbsp; Have you tried that and been disappointed by the result too? &nbsp; ; }</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>HTH</p>

    <title>Skype account cannot be restored - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ya4  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype account cannot be restored</h2>
                    1. I signed up for Skype in 2003 with a then-skype username.&nbsp;<br />
2. I had a paid SkypeIn number on it ($34 per year).&nbsp;<br />
3. I kept using it until someone broke in it and stole it a year ago.&nbsp;<br />
4. On all of my multiple attempts to restore access, the system kept replying "Skype name not found" (at the same time displaying my own userpic!)<br />
5. My attempt to upgrade the primary email to a MSFT Live account resulted in a duplicate account with no access my my original name and details.<br />
<br />
I almost gave up... until but!<br />
<br />
5. Skype Notifications email began pestering me three times a day (!!) with email calling on me to renew my SkypeIn number subscription for the username that apparently does not exist. NB ! It informed me it is unable to charge my card for a next year b/c this
 card recently expired (thank heavens!)<br />
<br />
Needless to say, the automated system still says my Skype name does not exist and still tries to charge me for non extant name. And needless to say, I am very angry now.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Does anyone know how to contact for once a human CustSupp rep or should I just go and sue them in a local court for monetary loss and GDPR breach (and talk to a rep in court)?&nbsp;<br />

            <p>No one has responded to my 2nd response post</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not referring to icons. &nbsp;I am talking about page size and font size. &nbsp;Using either edge, chrome or firefox the browser page size just randomly changes, time after time, it goes from 100% to 140% or from 100% to 50% and I change it back to 100% and then
 seconds or minutes later it changes again. &nbsp;It just happens over and over again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using gmail the page size and font size just randomly changes. &nbsp;I have many years of using Microsoft OS and after 20 years I have never experienced this problem. &nbsp;Using each of the browsers for email the page size and font size just changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using office 10, specifically Word, the page size and font just changes randomly over and over again. &nbsp;i am graduate school at Luther Rice University Online and I use blackboard and the same thing happens in Blackboard. &nbsp;The page size and font size just
 changes over and over again. &nbsp;It is so bad I am thinking about going back to windows 7, because I didn't have these issues. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think there has to be more people than me that is experiencing this problem. &nbsp;As I stated in my initial email, On my first 3 computers, two laptops and a desktop, my upgrade to windows 10 was fine and they are still working fine, but the later upgrade
 from windows 8.1 to windows 10, done three times, it happens over and over again. &nbsp;There is something in the code, something changed after the initial upgrades, 2 or 3 months later. &nbsp;Something changed.</p>

<h2>            Readyboost</h2>
                    <p>I have a new PC with 16 GB RAM and I am considering using a USB pendrive for ReadyBoost.</p>
<p>Should I expect a performance improvement in using ReadyBoost with Windows 10?</p>
<p>Where can I locate the requirement for the pendrive to be used for ReadyBoost?</p>
<p>Regards</p>

            <p><span><span>Hi,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I&nbsp;will assist you with this.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>ReadyBoost can speed up your computer by using storage space on most USB flash drives and flash memory cards.
</p>
<p><span>ReadyBoost uses the Superfetch service that should be enabled and set to "Running" and "Automatic".</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>For ReadyBoost to effectively speed up your computer, the flash drive or memory card should have at least 1 gigabyte (GB) of available space. If your drive or card doesn't have enough available space for ReadyBoost , you'll see a message telling you to free
 some space on it. For best results, use a flash drive or flash memory card with at least double the amount of available space as the amount of memory (RAM) in your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to try the following steps and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. Plug the flash drive into a USB port on your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>2. In the <strong>AutoPlay</strong> dialog box, choose Speed Up My System.</span></p>
<p><span>3. The flash drive’s <strong>Properties</strong> dialog box appears with the
<strong>ReadyBoost</strong> tab upfront.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click on <strong>ReadyBoost </strong>tab.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Choose the <strong>Use This Device option.</strong></span></p>
<p><span>6. Click <strong>OK.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information was helpful and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to assist.

            You have 16GB of RAM; Readyboost will not provide any performance benefit. Readyboost was designed to aid systems with limited memory. If you have an SSD in your PC, it will not be possible to enable Readyboost.

<h2>            Windows Easy Transfer - Not enough space on disk</h2>
                    <p>I thought I was being efficient with my C: disk space when I created a 19G partition for Win 7 64-bit to install.&nbsp; Installation went fine.&nbsp; But now I get an error when I attempt to use the Windows Easy Transfer to move files and settings back to the C: drive.&nbsp;
 I am getting "There isn't enough disk space available to transfer your files and settings".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to extend the 19G partition using command line and diskpart, but obviously I don't understand this partition/volume thing.&nbsp; I have 908G free on the C: drive.&nbsp; Why doesn't Windows Easy Transfer let me do it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can you walk me through how to get Windows Easy Transfer to use the available space?&nbsp; I did try creating and formatting a volume with the free space and that didn't work either.&nbsp; (Not shown in screen shot.)</p>

            <p>I resolved my problem and will document the response in the event someone else reads this thread.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not being partition savvy I was really afraid to "delete partition" given the warning message.&nbsp; Once I logically thought through what would happen I DID select to delete the partition.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleting the partition made the partition itself no longer accessible, but it didn't make the space unallocatable.&nbsp; Once the partition was deleted it was labeled "unallocated" in the Computer Management-&gt;Disk Management GUI.&nbsp; At that point I could right
 click on the C: drive partition and choose to extend it.</p>

 but I don’t see the icon on the taskbar</span></strong></em></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Can I reserve even if I didn’t get a notification? </strong></p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Yes. You can reserve your upgrade at any time on any compatible PC by clicking on the Get Windows&nbsp;10 app or the Windows Update control panel.</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-faq</span></a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This update is not required to get Windows 10, you can still get it even though you don't get the notification. Just download it on July 29th 2015 when it becomes available. You will have one year to do so. The Reserve app is just a reminder/notification
 for its availability.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How can I cancel my reservation? I don't want to upgrade to Windows 10 at all.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the Reservation app in the notification area (double click it) </p>
<p>Click the&nbsp;Hamburger menu&nbsp;in the upper left corner, then select View Confirmation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the lower left, click Cancel reservation and then confirm (twice).&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Can I change the email address used to reserve the free upgrade?</strong></p>
<p>You have to cancel the reservation and reserve Windows 10 again if you want it to a different email address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To cancel reservation follow the below steps:<br />
•Click/tap on the Get Windows 10 app icon on the taskbar notification area. <br />
•Click/tap on the "hamburger" style menu button at the top left corner in the Get Windows 10 app.<br />
•Click/tap on View confirmation under Getting the upgrade.<br />
•Click/tap on the Cancel reservation link.<br />
•Click/tap on Cancel reservation to confirm.<br />
•Click/tap on Close.</p>
<p>This will cancel the reservation, now go ahead and reserve it with the new email.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Can I uninstall the Reservation completely from my computer?</strong></p>
<p>Click Start (or press Windows key + S for Windows 8.1 users)</p>
<p>Type: <em>view installed updates</em></p>
<p>Hit Enter on your keyboard </p>
<p>
</p><p>Look through the list for the <strong>KB3035583 </strong>and <strong>KB2976978</strong>&nbsp;update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Right click each update and click Uninstall. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><em>Other reasons why you might not be seeing it:</em></strong></p>
<p>Why don’t I have the <em>Get Windows&nbsp;10</em>&nbsp;app? </p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>If you don’t see the <em>Get Windows&nbsp;10</em> &nbsp;app on your PC, it might be because:</p>
<ol>
<li>Your device isn’t up-to-date with at least Windows&nbsp;7 SP1 or Windows&nbsp;8.1 Update.</li><li>Windows Update is turned off or is not set to received updates automatically.</li><li>You’ve blocked or uninstalled the necessary Windows Update functionality.</li><li>Your device is not running genuine Windows.</li><li>Your Windows License is from a MSDN or TechNet subscription. If it is, you will be able to get Windows 10 through your subscription if it is still active.</li><li>Your computer is part of a Windows Domain</li><li>Microsoft has not determined your device capable of running Windows 10 even though it meets the minimum system requirements.</li><li>You are running a volume license client: Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Enterprise, Windows 8.1 Pro, Windows 8.1 Enterprise
<strong>(only retail store bought or preinstalled OEM licenses) get the upgrade offer.
</strong></li></ol>
<p>Running Windows Update and installing any available updates will fix the first three issues. Need more help? Go to our

<p>PCs that we determine cannot run Windows&nbsp;10 will not see the <em>Get Windows&nbsp;10</em> &nbsp;app before July 29, 2015. After July 29, 2015, we’ll enable the icon in the system tray. This is to help ensure that you can easily check your PC’s compatibility if you
 choose.</p>

</p><p>If your device is managed as part of a school or business network, please check with your IT administrator about upgrading to Windows&nbsp;10.</p>

<h2>            Networking two computers to access QuickBooks through a modem</h2>
                    I am trying to set up two computers to access QuickBooks through a modem (Network), but my parent computer won't let me change the permissions to allow the other computer to access the files.&nbsp; I can see the file on the other computer, but when I try and
 open it, I get the message, access denied.<br />
<br />
But when I go to the parent computer and look in the Advanced Sharing tab, it says that I have given full control to "everyone".&nbsp; What am I missing?<br />
<br />
any suggestions you can offer would be most helpful.<br />

<h2>            What happens if File History backup drive is defective</h2>
                    <p>Today an IT guy told me that Windows 10 file history is not a safe way to backup data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He claimed that in case the File History backup drive fails, one might not notice. If then data really gets lost on the system drives, one could realize too late that there is no working backup of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is that true? Will Windows 10 not warn about a broken File History backup drive?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, what then is a cost-effective method of&nbsp; securing oneself against an unnoticed backup drive fail?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>He recommended buying a new portable backup drive every two years, which seemed pretty odd to me.</p>

            Hi Jan, I think he was trying to sell you a new Drive . . .
<br />
<br />File History is a safe way of holding previous versions of your files.
<br />
<br />If the drive that file history is failing, you will get a warning from Windows, not file History.
<br />
<br />Windows does this automatically with all drives, including the new drive he was trying to sell you.
<br />
<br />As for buying a new drive every 2 years - nowadays you get a lot longer than that from a drive.
<br />
<br />All modern drives contain a function called SMART and if the drive is failing, you  will be warned that SMART reports an imminent drive failure
<br />
<br />If you ever want to test your drives SMART:
<br />
<br />Open Command Prompt and run this command, then hit Enter
<br />
<br />wmic diskdrive get status
<br />
<br />All healthy drives will return OK if they are healthy . . .
