    <title>State of Decay 2 Title Screen Freezes - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            State of Decay 2 Title Screen Freezes</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've recently purchased State of Decay 2 as recommended by a friend.</p>
<p>I've tried to launch the game, which was fine until the "press any key to continue" screen, as once I click a key,</p>
<p>The background freezes, and SoD2's CPU usage drops to 0%. The process is still running, as the music continues to play, and it stays like this until I close the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once in around every 10 tries, the Title Screen loads, but when I attempt to click anything on the screen, it freezes completely, and behaves exactly like described above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>System Specs:</p>
<p>GTX 750Ti</p>
<p>AMD Athlon II x3 420e Processor</p>
<p>8GB RAM</p>
<p>Game is loaded on a HDD</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd really appreciate a fix to this, as I'd like to play this with my friend before he leaves on a holiday in a couple days.</p>

            I've reinstalled and updated the Microsoft Store, SoD2 itself and my graphics drivers, and have 'reset' it a number of times.

            The PerfStringBackup.ini file is just a long text file with information that is used to display stuff in the Performance Monitor tool (perfmon.exe).<br />
<br />
Assuming XP is installed on your C drive, the file should be here:<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32<br />
<br />
If yours is missing, there is a copy on my SkyDrive you can download.<br />
<br />
The Performance Monitor will not improve your performance.&nbsp; It may help you spot bottlenecks in your system from which you can make adjustments to improve performance, but I would really be desperate to use it for performance issues, but then I don't nave much
 experience using it either.&nbsp; It is just a monitoring tool - you can't adjust anything with it.<br />
<br />
I uploaded a copy of the XP Pro SP3 file you need to my SkyDrive (everybody has a SkyDrive for sharing files).<br />
<br />
You can download it and when you do, put a copy of the file in these folders (assuming Windows is installed on your C drive):<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32<br />
<br />
Here is the link to my SkyDrive and you can look for the file you need there:<br />
<br />
<a href="https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=6a7e789cab1d6f39&amp;id=6A7E789CAB1D6F39!311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://skydrive.live.com/?cid=6a7e789cab1d6f39&amp;id=6A7E789CAB1D6F39!311</a><br />
<br />
When you see the files available for download, you may not see the file extension (.exe, .dll, .cpl, .sys, .zip, etc.), but when you download them they will have the correct extension.
<br />
<br />
When you download the file (especially if you use Internet Explorer), when you get a chance to save the file, your browser may not save the file with an extension (like .exe, .dll, .cpl, .sys, .zip, etc.) so you will have to manually add the proper extension
 to the file when you download the file before you save it.<br />
<br />
You can download the file with no extension and then rename the file to add the proper extension.&nbsp; You don't want to try to use a file called
<b>PerfStringBackup </b>when the file name really needs to be called <b>PerfStringBackup.ini</b> (if the downloaded file has no extension you will have to change the name of the file to add the proper extension to get it to work.<br />
<br />
You then need to put the downloaded files in the correct folders on your system.<br />
<br />
Then to load up the Performance Monitor counters from the PerfStringBackup.ini file, click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
<b>lodctr&nbsp; /R:PerfStringBackup.ini<br />
<br />
</b>Click OK, the screen will flash and you'll be all set to add counters into Performance Monitor.<br />
<br />

<p>Since I wrote this ... I have figured out that &nbsp;&nbsp; perfstringbackup&nbsp;&nbsp; shouldn't be a worry .... yet there still is no .ini extension or author so, I remain concerned.&nbsp; Is there a danger without the .ini extension?? Is there a danger without an identified

            Hi Praveen, 
<br />
<br />So it’ll connect to the mobile hot spot, but not your WiFi? That tells us the wireless adapter is working fine, but the problem is lies with the wireless network. 
<br />
<br />Is this your home network? Have you rebooted both your laptop and the wireless router/modem? 
<br />
<br />I would also go into settings - network &amp; internet - WiFi - manage known networks, remove your wireless network, and re-add. 
<br />
<br />Let’s try these things and let me know! We’ll get this figured out!
<br />- C

<br />
<br />Following is the content of the Help which you should try
<br />
<br />Things to try first
<br />Run the Network troubleshooter followed by networking commands
<br />Update the network adapter driver
<br />Roll back the network adapter driver
<br />Temporarily turn off firewalls

<br />    Right click the adapter that is connected to the internet and click Properties
<br />    Go to the Sharing tab
<br />    Uncheck "Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection". If it is already unchecked, skip this step.
<br />    Click OK
<br />    Again, open Properties &gt; Sharing for the same adapter.
<br />    Check "Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection"
<br />    (If you get a popup that says "Internet Connection Sharing is currently enabled...", click OK.)
<br />    Under "Home networking connection:", select the mobile hotspot adapter
<br />    Click OK
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand Network adapters
<br />Right click then uninstall all virtual adapters
<br />
<br />Open Start then type: regedit
<br />Right click Regedit then click Run as administrator
<br />Navigate to the following registry key:
<br />
<br />HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\WlanSvc\Parameters\HostedNetworkSettings\
<br />
<br />Delete the following key: 
<br />HostedNetworkSettings
<br />
<br />Restart then try again.
<br />
<br />Run the Network adapter troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />Scroll down, select Network adapters
<br />Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />When complete, restart to see if it works.
<br />
<br />If not, you can try updating both your Network adapter drivers or uninstall them.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X
<br />Click Device Manager
<br />Expand network adapters
<br />Right click your adapter, click uninstall
<br />
<br />Exit Device Manager then restart
<br />
<br />Windows 10 will re-detect them and reinstall them.

                    Upgraded to windows 8 from 7. PC has worked well for 3 months. Last time I turned pc on it would not boot.
<div>after several attempts "Preparing Automatic Repair" screen appeared but never advanced. &nbsp;The screen with 4 Box windows logo</div>
<div>with circle of dots rotating just above Preparing Automatic Repair , waited for several hours but never changed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>{1}- I inserted my Windows 8 Repair Disk {Bios set to boot from cd\dvd). &nbsp;Note in this step I<b> DID NOT</b> select Boot from cd\dvd.</div>
<div>This is when the Error message appears: <b>&nbsp;pc needs to be repaired: File:\windows\system32\winload.exe Error code: Oxc000000I</b></div>
<div>and you will need to use recovery tools.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Three choices are given: 1; Enter to try agai, 2; F8 for startup options, 2: F9 to use different operatin system.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Entering any of the three choices just recycled the screen with the same information.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>{2}- Windows 8 Repair Disc Inserted; this time I&nbsp;<b>SELECTED Boot from cd\dvd &nbsp;</b></div>
<div>pc initiates loading from cd[dvd, 4 Box windows logo appears on screen</div>
<div>Reads from cd\dvd for about 3-4 minutes. &nbsp;Then circle of rotating dots appear on screen below 4 box logo.</div>
<div>at this point the HDD led starts blinking, System remains in this state. I never get to see the repair options. I have waited for hours at a time.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The same results as step 2 above occur when I try using the windows 8 install disk.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I would appreciate any help as to how I can get to the repair, troubleshhot or advanced options that are supposd to be availabe.</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unfortunate that the problem exists.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Seems an issue within BIOS settings, it would be correct to check with the&nbsp;PC manufacturer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They might have more insight on this .&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            Hi DorothyWrightzr,
<br />
<br />My name is Pedro. I'm an Independent Advisor trying to help.
<br />
<br />Which files are been installed?
<br />
<br />Are you saying that Skype reinstalls itself each time you try to open it?
<br />
<br />In the meantime please give a try to this.
<br />
<br />Hit Windows key + X and Select Apps and Features.
<br />
<br />Search for the Skype App &gt; Select it &gt; Select Advanced Options &gt; Terminate and Reset &gt; Restart the computer and see if the same thing happens.
<br />
<br />If that option is not available for you.
<br />
<br />Quit Skype.
<br />
<br />Press windows key + R
<br />
<br />Type %appdata%/Microsoft
<br />
<br />Rename your "Skype for Desktop" folder to Skypefordesktop_old
<br />
<br />Open Skype and sign back into your account.
<br />
<br />Check if you're still having the issue.
<br />
<br />Regards.

    <title>How to Remove Windows Update Ghost Folder - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wmcole  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to Remove Windows Update Ghost Folder</h2>
                    <p>After a major Windows Update that created a "Windows.old" folder, a "Windows.old(1)" folder appeared on the C:\ root.&nbsp; Attempts to delete it yield:</p>
<p>"Could not find this item.&nbsp; This is no longer located in C:\. Verify the item's location an try again."</p>
<p>
</p><p>The folder contains eight 0-sized sub-folders, all of which I can access properties, take ownership, change permissions UNTIL I get to the last file in the chain, "C:\Windows.old(1)\Users\&lt;MyUserName&gt;\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.Cortana_cw5n1h2txyewy\LocalState".&nbsp;
 On this last folder, the Properties Security tab says "The requested security information is either unavailable or can't be displayed."</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>chkdsk C:\ /R does not help.</li><li>FileAssasin does not help (it can't deal with ghost directories, only files).</li><li>Copying "C:\Windows.old\Users\&lt;MyUserName&gt;\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.Windows.Cortana_cw5n1h2txyewy\LocalState" to the corresponding Windows.old(1) location allows me to delete the copied version (which apparently can't replace the ghost "LocalState")
 but nothing else in the Windows.old(1) directory chain.</li><li>Windows.old(1) does not appear in the registry (according to regedit).</li></ol>
<p>This appears to be an error in the MFT or whatever NTFS mechanism is used to store filename : vector correspondence.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, how do I fix the index to eliminate the false entry for a non-existent directory chain?</p>
<p>

<p>SOLVED (finally)!</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I looked at Properties-&gt;Security tab for each folder starting at Windows.old(1). Either at "Users" or "...Users\&lt;MyUserName&gt; I spotted one of those long strings like is found in the user section of the registry with a "?" next to it.&nbsp; AFAIK, that
 means "unknown group or user name".&nbsp; So I deleted it from permissions at that sub-folder level.&nbsp; The deleted security principle did not appear anywhere else in the chain down to "LocalSate..".&nbsp; But as usual, "LocalState.." showed "X The requested security
 information is either unavailable or can't be displayed." in the Properties-&gt;Security tab.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>File Explorer would not allow me to open the "LocalState.." folder.&nbsp; Just for grins I tried to open it in a third-party file explorer which showed the folder as empty.&nbsp; I then copied a small .jpg file to LocalState..&nbsp; It seemed to succeed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In Windows File Explorer I found that now, inside C:\Windows.old(1)\...Microsoft.Windows.Cortana_cw5n1h2txyewy\ there appeared two folders, "LocalState" and "LocalState..", both of which I could open, but both of which were empty.&nbsp; So I selected Windows.old(1)
 in File Explorer and right-click delete - Voila!&nbsp; It went away.&nbsp; After a reboot it is still gone so it appears the problem is solved.</p>

<h2>            Infinite Preparing Windows Loop.</h2>
                    For the past week I've been unable to install any windows updates, they seem to be stuck at 0% downloading when I open it in the desktop environment. I decided to download the update from microsoft's website and manually install it. After installing it,
 it prompted for a restart and I restarted my computer. For the past 14 hours my ASUS Laptop has been stuck in "Preparing Windows, do not turn off your computer". I've tried shutting it down by holding the power button and turning it on again only for it to
 resume "Preparing Windows" with no end in sight. I tried opening BIOS to see if I could boot in safe mode, which didn't work out and I'm unsure if I can ever get into my desktop environment without paying a professional tech support to fix my problem. I'm
 a student.

            Hi Jonathan, have you tried all the options in the Windows Recovery Environment?
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down
<br />
<br />Do this twice
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc.
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . .
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

<p>SPOILERS</p>
<p>... SHORT!</p>
<p>I ended my game with over 6000 war assets and galactic readiness at 100%. That being done the game was barely over 30 hours. Plus! Part of that was the stupid endings slow walking segments. &nbsp;All the "side quests" were nothing but planet scanning,
 making most of the game busy work, scanning and running around the citadel. And it turns out the only way to get these "missions" was to become a creepy eaves dropper. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I like the multiplayer but if they had to gut the game and cut it in half to put it in I wish they would have skipped it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I finished all those eaves dropper side quests in like an hour so those didn't take up near the amount of time you are alluding too. &nbsp;And 30 hours for single player is hardly short. &nbsp;Most games give you 10 &nbsp;to 15 hours if you are lucky. &nbsp;This one gave you
 twice that. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Mass Effect 3 is definitely shorter than the previous instalments. You only have one hub world now compared to the multiple in ME2.. which is the Citadel. The Citadel is a lot smaller. That cripples exploration. You can't have conversations with NPCs on
 the Citadel anymore, you can only overhear them. I feel like there's less side missions, and these side missions aren't as fleshed out as some in ME2. In fact most of the side missions in ME3 are just fetch quests. Get something by scanning a planet and then
 bring it back to someone. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The main storyline is great, but ME3 definitely watered down basically all of the other aspects of their game where a lot of time was spent completing in the previous instalments.

<p>The Citadel in ME2 had a lot of negative space, sure, but it offered a better atmosphere. It still was a larger Citadel, same with the Citadel in ME1. ME3 watered it down to fit all the relevant content in smaller places - but it just seemed like a time
 shortcut rather than a strategic game decision. The Citadel in ME3 just feels lifeless in comparison to the previous Citadels.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Also it was kind of irksome to me that after the Cerberus attack on the Citadel, the Citadel returns to it's exact same state with a few broken glass shards on the ground and bullet holes in the wall. There's no change in the NPCs or anything really. Geez.</p>

<p>Why was there no quests for re-taking Omega or Illium? I mean thats just a wasted potential right there. Especially with the Aria "quest" about helping her gather forces so she could get Omega back. I mean sure, ME3 is a war story and thats cool and everything
 but I feel like the game was linear with the illusion of exploration and choice. Even if the Citadel&nbsp; had more walking room in ME3, it definately lacked in personality. Almost no one is available for conversations and each area is separated by load times.
 At least in ME2 I could take the stairs to avoid the loading screens.</p>

<p>ME1 Citadel trumps them all. &nbsp;You could probably take all the places you can go in it and fit it into either ME 2 or ME 3s but it was just much nicer and way more open. Clerks you can actually talk with was a +. &nbsp;Heck, the rapid transport was actually necessary
 it was so big. &nbsp;There were plenty of side missions where you would actually have to do something to finish it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I read where they "listen to fan feedback" and I'm starting to think they might listen a bit too much:</p>
<p>People don't like the maco? &nbsp;Take out the maco! &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now they don't like the Hammerhead? &nbsp;Take it out too!</p>
<p>People don't like planet scanning? &nbsp;Shortin it to something silly but don't take it out cuz, well, we allready have the code for it... &nbsp;</p>
<p>Too much running on the Citadel? &nbsp;Let's make it super small with a lot of stairs! &nbsp;</p>
<p>People want more Citadel? &nbsp;Give them a lot of back and forth on a middle of the road version. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Hacking and bypassing is tedious? &nbsp;Let them watch Shep just stand there and wave for a bit! &nbsp;</p>
<p>Too many guns to choose from with only one in each class that's any good? &nbsp;Let's only give them 3 to choose from and make them have clips, which makes them better!?</p>
<p>Want customizable weapons again? Let's make em weigh a ton so their powers are affected and they'll only carry one or two at time! &nbsp;</p>
<p>Too much talking? &nbsp;Let's have them "listen" for "side quests"!</p>
<p>Too many squad members too pick from? &nbsp;Let's take some out!</p>
<p>No one complained about Pull or Throw? &nbsp;Who cares, let's take them out too!</p>
<p>Eh, it's fun enough, I'll be playing it a few more times with a few more imports, just don't like to see it go down hill, ahem, endings, I'm looking at you! &nbsp;:)</p>

<p>[/quote]The citadel in Me 2 was smaller, the citadel in ME 1 could be bigger, I'm not sure, ME1 felt bigger because you could walk to almost every area of it without using an elevator as a shortcut. ME 3 feels smaller because each area is isolated form the
 other. There is one floor you can look down and see the commons from though. Actually I think ME 1 was bigger when you add in the council chambers which you could walk around.</p>

<h2>            Skype Bug&#58; Kinect mic nonfunctional for Skype only.</h2>
                    <p>Since the update to Skype on my Preview-enrolled Xbox One, the Kinect microphone does not work with the app. I have the permissions set correctly—Skype is allowed to access my mic in the Settings page—and the Kinect mic works in all other situation, including game chat and voice commands.</p><p><br /></p>



<p>But now when&nbsp;making Skype calls only the video works. No one receives my audio, and occasionally&nbsp;I&nbsp;get an error message saying that my mic isn't working. But it is, just not for Skype, despite all the right settings as I said.</p>

<h3> celestyna  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dialog Box does not appear when a CD&#47;DVD&#47;New Progam is put into the Drive &#40;F&#41; slot windows does not reconize it. After 1st appempt to repair.</h2>
                    I wrote in about this problem earlier and followed these instructions,&nbsp;listed below them are my findings and results.<br />
&nbsp;
<p><span style="font-weight: bold">Step 1:</span><span> Firstly, run the fixit available in the link below<br />
&nbsp;<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Your CD drive or DVD drive is missing or is not recognized by Windows or other programs<br />
</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314060" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314060</span></a><span>
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Check if that helps<br />
<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Step 2: Ensure Shell Hardware Detection service is set to automatic</span><span>
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">and started. To do this, follow these steps:<br />
</span><span>1.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Click on Start-Run, type
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">services.msc</span><span>, the click on OK.
<br />
</span><span>2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>When the Services window loads, navigate to the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">"</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Shell Hardware Detection service
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">"</span><span> the double click on it to open it,<br />
</span><span>3.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Make sure the "</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Startup Type" says "Automatic</span><span>"
 and </span><span style="font-weight: bold">started</span><span>. If it doesn't, use the drop down menu to change it.<br />
</span><span>4.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>If it already says: "Automatic", then click on the
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">"Recovery"</span><span> tab at the top, and change the "First Failure" line to "Restart the Service", then click on
 "</span><span style="font-weight: bold">apply", then OK.<br />
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">Step 3: Ensure that CD-ROM AutoRun is not disabled in registry<br />
</span><span>Press </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold">WIN key + R</span><span> key on the keyboard to open run box, type in
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">regedit
</span><span>and press enter<br />
Navigate to the following registry location <br />
</span><span style="font-weight: bold">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: bold">HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\CDRom<br />
</span><span>Locate the </span>
<span style="font-weight: bold">AutoRun</span><span> registry value in the right pane, and check that the value data for AutoRun is set as 1 (one), which
 is enabled. If it is 0 (zero), which mean disabled CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive AutoRun process, re-enable the AutoRun by changing the value to 1.<br />
<br />
<br />
Step 1 was done.<br />
Step 2 The Shell Hardware&nbsp;Detection Service was disabled which I changed to Automatic and Started is showing.<br />
Step 3 HKEY... AutoRun was already&nbsp;set at 1, The Default listed directly above it does not have a setting assigned to it.<br />
Restarted the computer rechecked settings they stayed the same.<br />
The dialog box does not appear but if I start Media Center I can play it.<br />
Control Panel AutoPlay is checked, &amp; various Default settings were used, it still doesn't work. One change I did notice if I insert CD, go to computer&gt; right&nbsp;the&nbsp;(F:) Drive I now have a
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Play</span> option which was not there before these changes, when I click Play the iTunes screen appears and I can play the CD there. Anybody have plan B?

            Thank You for looking at my question. In the past on my computer,&nbsp;and other people&nbsp;using Vista, when something was put into the (F:) Drive a CD for example a pop up window would appear on their desktop giving you several options as to how you wanted to
 play it. I've tried&nbsp;all the&nbsp;option settings (Ask me everytime) for example&nbsp;in AutoPlay and the AutoPlay box is ckecked (on), yet when&nbsp;I put it (CD&lt; DVD&lt; New Program)&nbsp;in nothing happens.&nbsp;The media will play in I manually go to Media Center, locate it then play
 it.&nbsp;In order to install a new program I must use the command prompt.&nbsp;Vista Home Premium / HP Pavilion Elite m9040.<br />
Have a Great Day

<p><span>Hi Celestyna,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Is your CD\DVD recognized in windows explorer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you try playing different CDs\DVDs?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> Firstly, run the fixit available in the link below</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Your CD drive or DVD drive is missing or is not recognized by Windows or other programs</span></strong></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314060" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314060</a>
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check if that helps</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: Ensure
<strong><span>Shell Hardware Detection service
</span></strong>is set to automatic</span></strong><span>
<strong>and started<span>. To do this, follow these steps:</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click on Start-Run, type
<strong>services.msc</strong>, the click on OK. </span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>When the Services window loads, navigate to the
<strong>"<strong><span>Shell Hardware Detection service
</span></strong>"</strong> the double click on it to open it,</span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Make sure the "<strong>Startup Type" says "Automatic</strong>" and
<strong>started</strong>. If it doesn't, use the drop down menu to change it.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>If it already says: "Automatic", then click on the
<strong>"Recovery"</strong> tab at the top, and change the "First Failure" line to "Restart the Service", then click on "<strong>apply", then OK.</strong></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3: Ensure
<strong><span>that CD-ROM AutoRun is not disabled in registry</span></strong></span></strong></p>
<p><span>Press <strong>
WIN key + R</strong> key on the keyboard to open run box, type in <strong>
regedit </strong>and press enter</span></p>
<p><span>Navigate to the following registry location
</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\System\CurrentControlSet\Services\CDRom</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Locate the <strong>
<span>AutoRun</span></strong> registry value in the right pane, and check that the value data for AutoRun is set as 1 (one), which is enabled. If it is 0 (zero), which mean disabled CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive AutoRun
 process, re-enable the AutoRun by changing the value to 1.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important: -</span></strong><span> This section, method,
 or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you
 modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the following article number to view the article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:

<p>Hi Celestyna,</p>
<p>There are several reasons for this problem. AutoPlay might be restricted by Group Policy, it could be canceled by a program that is running, or the service that AutoPlay needs to start might not be running.</p>
<p>Here are some things to try:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Ask your network administrator if AutoPlay is restricted by <strong>Group Policy</strong>, and if so, what to do instead.<br />
•&nbsp;Close other programs that might be interfering.<br />
•&nbsp;Follow these steps:<br />
1.&nbsp;Click the <strong>Start</strong> button, click <strong>All Programs</strong>, click
<strong>Accessories</strong>, and then right-click <strong>Command Prompt</strong>.
<br />
2.&nbsp;Click <strong>Run as administrator</strong>.<br />
3.&nbsp;At the command prompt, type <strong>net</strong> <strong>start</strong> <strong>
shellhwdetection</strong>, and then press <strong>ENTER</strong>.<br />
4.&nbsp;Restart your computer.<br />
<br />

<p>Hi Halima,</p>
<p>I don't understand Group Policy but I'm the only user and administrator so I don't think that is an issue.</p>
<p>At the command prompt I did as you said and the reply was "The requested service has already been started.</p>
<p>When you say close other programs that might be interfering, I don't know where to start, the only ones running are the start up programs.</p>
<p>Kaspersky 2010 Internet Security is always scanning, I will call them later Could that be the problem?</p>
<p>What services that AutoPlay needs to run, can I check for to see if that is the issue?</p>
<p>Thank You</p>

            <p>I had this same problem (no dialog box after inserting a music CD, movie DVD, blank CD or DVD). I tried all ideas posted here in 2010 without success. Here's what fully worked for me (Windows XP, but likely works for other versions):</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> For music CD, movie DVD, and other content--Start, My Computer, right-click CD Drive, Properties, AutoPlay tab,
<strong>select action to perform for each option,</strong> click Apply for each one, end with OK.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> For blank CD--Start, My Computer, right-click CD Drive, Properties, Recording tab,
<strong>Enable CD recording,</strong> other options as desired, Apply, close with OK.</p>

    <title>There is something seriously wrong with my computer... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> coal48  say:</h3>
<h2>            There is something seriously wrong with my computer...</h2>
                    Windows Update has been asking me to do the same 2 updates for maybe about a month now, I thought that maybe it's the updates themselves that are glitched or something and I hid them.<br />
<br />
but now, AMD Radeon Settings is starting to tell me to make the same update again. The current version being 15.30 etc. to 16.15 etc. When I make the update, everything is successful and it tells me to reboot, after I do, it tells me my version is 15.30 again
 and that I must update to 16.15<br />
<br />
It's like my computer forgets everything everytime It opens up but then again, my desktop hasn't lost anything I've been putting on it.<br />
<br />
I remember at school, computer being programmed to not save anything but I didn't configure my PC to do that, there's no way I could have done it accidently either, is it a hardware problem?<br />
<br />
How do I fix this? Please Help!

<p><span>Sometimes icon files get corrupted.<span>&nbsp;
</span>There is an easy way to rebuild your icon cache (you will not lose any data or icons with this process).</span></p>
<p><span>First off, you need to make sure system files are not hidden:
</span></p>
<p><span>1. Click the
<strong>Start</strong> button, <strong>Control Panel</strong>, <strong>
Appearance and Personalization</strong>, and <strong>Folder Options</strong>.
</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click the
<strong>View</strong> tab.</span></p>
<p><span>3. Under Advanced settings, make sure
<strong>Show hidden files and folders </strong>is enabled, and then click uncheck the options
<strong>Hide extension for known file types</strong> and <strong>
Hide protected operating system files (recommended)</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>4. Click on
<strong>Apply</strong> and <strong>OK</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Now we can rebuild the icon cache:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right-click
<strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>Open Windows Explorer</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Navigate to
<strong>C:\Users\<em>username</em>\AppData\Local folder</strong>.<strong>
</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Delete the hidden
<strong>IconCache.db</strong> file.</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Close all windows and restart your computer.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this helps,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>So, when I click to "forget network" and reconnect it again, a can see in network list my network for a second or two, while it shows message "Identification..." and then it disappears:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4b88cb99-b356-466c-b890-5b72fcf0fa40" /><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>And one more. I can't even see my network at "Network list manager policies" in secpol.msc:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/028dfef6-f829-4725-82bd-db9e25122fca" /><br />
</p>
<p>There are sever items in list, but not my current network:</p>
<p>Unidentified networks</p>
<p>All networks</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Creating a new local user account is not working - still the same issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've collected more information about it:</p>
<p>1. other computers have access to local network if the are using this access point</p>
<p>2. my computer have access to local network if I'm using a diffrent type of access point (other network)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I think this is some trouble with the settings for this wifi connection, but attempt to "forget network" and reconnect still give nothing to me =(</p>

<h3> leonhyrule  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do you set duel monitor fixed desktop wallpapers&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have two monitors, I want each monitor to show two separate pictures, and only those two separate pictures, as in, picture A for monitor A, and picture B for monitor B. But when I set two pictures, it enabled slide show, causing them to switch and sometimes
 setting random pictures from random files stored in other areas.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want Picture A to appear on Monitor A and stay there, not move to the other monitor or be changed to something random. I have tried disabling slideshow, but unless I pick one picture for the two monitors, exiting the window once changed from slide show
 simply returns the setting back to slide show.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, How can I fix picture A to monitor A, and picture B to monitor B?</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate if you could walk me through how&nbsp;and from which location you're trying to set the Background wallpaper for&nbsp;Dual Monitor. Before you do that, try with the below steps and check if it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>* Open<strong> ThisPC</strong>,</p>
<p>* Navigate to <span><strong>C:\Windows\Web\Wallpaper\Windows</strong></span></p>
<p><span>* Now Copy and paste the two wallpapers into the
</span><span>Windows folder, </span><span>which you want to set for dual monitors.</span></p>
<p>* Then select the two image at the same time, right-click and select <strong>Set as desktop background.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you do this, you can able to see two different wallpaper on desktop screens. Check and let me know if it works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted if you require further assistance.</p>

    <title>How do I fix the extremely quiet audio on windows 8&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> simonepham  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I fix the extremely quiet audio on windows 8&#63;</h2>
                    The sound on my laptop suddenly went very quiet recently. I raised the sound to 100% on everything I could and every video or song I played and I still can never get the sound to be as loud as it used to be. I ran the problem through the troubleshooter
 and I was told the fix would need to reinstall the driver for Intel(R) Display Audio. I applied the fix but it said the problem was not resolved and I don't know what else to do. Any suggestions?

            <p>If the problem just started suddenly, then it's easy to "undo" whatever the problem is.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows has a number of recovery features to get up and running quickly after a problem occurs. Some of these recovery features are more advanced than others, to be sure to read the impacts carefully.</p>
<hr />
<ul>
<li><strong>Option One: System Restore</strong> (Safest, try this first)<br />
If the problem just began recently, you can restore Windows back to an earlier point in time, called a restore point. System Restore doesn’t change your personal files. It only takes a couple minutes, and you can undo the process or try another date if it doesn't
 fix the problem on the first try. When you aren't sure where to go, this is by far the safest, fastest, and easiest option to try first.</li></ul>
<ol>
<ol>
<li>Press <strong><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fskeene.net%2fanswers%2fwin8.jpg" />+R</strong> to show the Run box, type
<strong>RSTRUI </strong>and click OK.</li><li>Choose a date when the computer was working correctly, and click Next to restore the system files from that date.</li><li>Check to see if the problem is fixed. If not, you can go back to step 1 to either undo the restore, or try another date.</li></ol>

<p>I just bought Assassin's Creed Brotherhood and it played fine yesterday. Turn on my XBOX today and it says play DVD. Put some other games in and they read fine. its just AC: Brotherhood. The disc is in good condition, no scratches or anything.&nbsp;What do I

<p>Try clearing your systems cache, maybe theres something with that game that has currupted temporary files. If that doesnt work, try installing it on your other xbox onto a flash drive then transfer the flash drive and data to you're xbox and see if it reads
 it then.</p>

<p>This problem sounds like you have burnt out or dirty laser, &nbsp;a <span>hardware failure or defective hardrive</span>. but to determine this, let's try a few quick and easy fixes, before you should request repairs. First off&nbsp;Try doing a dashboard refresh,
<strong>Press Guide Button &gt; Hold RT &gt; Press Y</strong>. If this does not work then, If your console is laying on
<p>sometimes your laser might just be having problem reading the disc if it is on its side, ( not sure why this is), if none of the above or any other player/support staff solutions have worked, then you will need to contact
<strong>Microsoft Support</strong> and request a <strong>console repair</strong>. Hopefully you still have warranty :) good luck and hope this helps!</p>

<p>This does sound like a failing optical drive as ONELONGGAMERTAG had suggested. &nbsp;You can try using an optical drive cleaning disc (MSRP ~$10) to clean off and recalibrate the laser. &nbsp;If that does not work it would be best to contact support and request a
 repair.</p>

            Hi Richlies,<br />
<br />
From the issue description I am sorry to hear that you are having issues after upgrading to Windows 8. I will help you with this issue.<br />
<br />
I would like to know more information about the issue, so that we could help you better.<br />
<br />
1) What is the exact/complete error message you are receiving?<br />
<div><strong>For the issue related to App:</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Step 1: Update graphics card drivers</strong><br />
I would suggest you to update the Graphics card from the manufacturer's website and check if it helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2: Install the drivers in compatibility mode</strong><br />
I would also suggest you to install the graphics card drivers in Windows 7 compatibility mode as driver hangs during install can be caused by a corrupt driver download. Download the driver and try the install again. You may also try installing the driver in
 compatibility mode.</div>
<div><strong>Make older programs compatible with this version of Windows</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/older-programs-compatible-version-windows</strong></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 3: Try increasing the resolution to 1366*768 and try opening App.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>For the issue related to Internet Explorer:</strong></div>
<div>I would suggest you to check to ensure that the Internet Explorer is turned on in Windows Features on or off.</div>
<div><strong>Turn Windows features on or off</strong></div>
<div><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/turn-windows-features-on-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/turn-windows-features-on-off</strong></a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I hope it helps. If you have any issues in future please let us know. We will be happy to help you.</div>

<p>Do not have option to increase screen resolution, Asus have informed me that the particular machine I have and windows 8 just&nbsp;aren't &nbsp;compatible although the machine does meet minimum requirements.</p>

<h2>            the boot configuration data for your PC is missing 0xc0000225 on windows 8.1 embedded pro</h2>
                    <p>I have read up about ithis error and have found out that it can be caused by a hardware or software change so i tried remembering what i had sone before turning my PC off the last time and found out that i had done 2 things that might have caused this, first
 is that i had used AOMEI partition wizard to increase the size of C drive next (no error) and the more probable one is that i ran a system cleanup with the cleanup wizard of C drive and chose to delete the old windows files (probably where the bootloader was
 located). But even if i do know the cause the problem is that i had installed a free windows copy thay i got from dream spark from a pendrive that i later wiped! So the problem comes here because all the solutions posted here have to include using the windows
 disk, is there any other way to fix this like downloading only the bootloader and adding it to C drive or something of the kind, help is appreciated!</p>
