            I've been using a free program called Qustodio since the days of Windows 7 and am pretty happy with it. Considering that it's free, it's features simply blow the wind out of paid apps (and I've used quite a few in the past). Light weight and easy to use,
 there are a few cool features too like the extensive reporting feature that let's me view the data for the past 30 days. I can also watch the profile pictures of accounts on Facebook that my son chats with. You can download it from www.qustodio.com.<br />

            <div>I am experiencing similar problems. &nbsp;I have gone through the family safety setup from top to bottom, both online and local. &nbsp; For the record, FS is switched on. &nbsp;Time limits that I have setup appear to only have intermittent control on his account access.
 &nbsp;For example, one day the time controls worked - my son would get locked out when time expired, yet on another day he was allowed (by windows) to continue being logged in indefinitely. &nbsp;Also, all of the PC time my son is actually using is not getting logged.
 &nbsp;I have run all the latest updates and rebooted in hopes that any recent fixes may have been installed, but this feature appears to be buggy, and ultimately useless. &nbsp;MS, you need to test this more and issue a fix. &nbsp;We are using Dell Alienware.</div>

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>I am experiencing the same issue. It started a few days or weeks ago. Before that, it was working fine.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I did some investigation and it turns out that the parental control does not start when my son logs in. For example he logs at 5pm but the parental control does not start counting time. Indeed, looking in "Events Viewer", there is no information message.</div>
<div>Then, when I start looking in "control panel" in the "parent control" section, the parental control suddently starts and displays the starting message. Indeed, looking in "Events Viewer", there is now an information message saying that user XYZ has started
 using the computer. Only then it starts counting time.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Again: the issue started a few days ago, before it was ok.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Maybe this was caused by some bad mix of the "old" parental control (such as information in the familysafety.live.com panel) and the new one ?</div>
<div><br />
<div>More precisely:</div>
<div>1) when I click, from "control parental" in the button "manage parental control from website", it returns an error "service is currently not started"</div>
<div>2) when I log into familysafety.live.com, this computer is not listed (whereas my other computer, a brand new win8 computer without legacy parental control, is listed)</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />

            <p>I experience as well similar issues.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;3 symptoms:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Parental control has worked but since x weeks it is not working anymore</p>
<p>2. when I click, from "control parental" in the button "manage parental control from website", it returns an error "service is currently not started"</p>
<p>3. The laptop does not appear in the list of&nbsp;monitored machine on the web site (I removed it in an attempt to fix the problem, but cannot add it back)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I suspect a corruption from the&nbsp;"old" Live Family Safety as my PC is an Windows 7 upgrade to Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated!</p>

            <p>Win 7 parental controls works fine, but win 8 does not. I block my son for a day or two using curfew, yet he logs in just the same. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. There is no SAVE or OK button when I change the curfew or time limits. The UI
 for time limits is confusing since it says "name can use the computer all day" or "name can only use it for the time I specify".&nbsp; It sounds like "name can use the computer all day" overrides the curfew, which would be very bad.&nbsp; I set the time limits to zero,
 just to be sure, but it still has no effect. It may be that if my son is already logged in, it has no effect.

<div>This thread is not so old, just Dec'2012 and there do not seem to be such a quick response and no solution so far... So I don't see what it should be ignored.</div>

<h3> johneamesb  say:</h3>
<h2>            Adobe Acrobat on Windows 7</h2>
                    <p>I still have Adobe Acrobat 7.0 Standard on the PC with Windows 7 which was running fine - until about the 10th Aug.! Now it no longer works, even if I re-install, etc. Is there a solution to allow Adobe Acrobat to function again - without having to buy a
 new version having bought an earlier version in good faith that it would last for a long time?(!) It would seem to be an issue of compatibility with Windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It seems as if an automatic 'upgrade' that Microsoft initiated about the 10th Aug. has, in fact, successfully "downgraded" what I can do with my PC ...</p>
<p>
</p><p>All help/advice appreciated!</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h2>            I cannot get my MICROSOFT LifeCam VX-1000 to work in Windows 7.</h2>
                    I have recently purchased a microsoft LifeCam VX-1000 webcam, Windows 7 Ultimate (64bit)&nbsp;and I want to use Messenger - can you seee a theme here? They are all microsoft products. So why doesn't my webcam&nbsp;work? It woks in XP (32bit)! I've tried all the
 suggestions in the help file to no avail. When I run the LifeCam software, all I get is an initialization error. It's so frustrating. The audio works in Messenger, but no video. It's plugged into a fast USB port. My computer is very high spec (8gig ram, Quad
 core, Nvidia GTX 285 VC etc.).

            I see the theme. You are attempting to use an installation CD which was produced way before Windows 7 was released.<br />
<br />
Go to the Microsoft hardware website, download and run the appropriate Windows 7 drivers, and see how you get along..

<p>Hi, Mike. I had already done that and it made no difference. Today I&nbsp;spent three hours scouring the Internet trying to find a solution, and it seems it is a common problem with the VX-1000. Couldn't find a solution though except to re-format my computer
 which seemed totally rediculous.</p>

            Hi, yes, that's exactly what&nbsp;I did. The file is 'LifeCam3.0.exe' and is for 32bit and 64bit W7. I still have no success with it. Is there anything else I could try?<br />
<br />
Something else happend that may shed some light on it. I plugged in my Panasonic movie camera via my firewire socket, but&nbsp;I&nbsp;couldn't get&nbsp;that to&nbsp;work either. I could control the camera&nbsp;using Adobe Premiere i.e. play, forward, rewind etc. but I couldn't see
 or get any footage from it. It may not be related, but it's weird i have two camera related issues here.<br />

<p><span><span><span>Hi Fellner,</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>Thank you for posting your question on Windows Vista Forums.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>The error message 0x8007371C refers to the inconsistency in the Windows Vista system files.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I recommend you to run System File Checker tool on the machine to ensure that there are no corrupt system files. You
 can follow the 1 part of the following article:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/936212" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/936212</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>I will also recommend you to try to perform a clean boot on the machine and check if that helps. You can follow the
 given article:</span></span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/331796</span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>If SFC S</span><span>can find errors and cannot repair them, you may have to repair
 them manually by running a repair for Windows Vista.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>NOTE:</span></span></strong><span> To perform
 an update or the “in-place Upgrade” you must roll back to whatever service pack is on the installation DVD i.e. if you have no Service Pack on the DVD, and then there shouldn't be any SP on the machine before trying these steps.&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To upgrade the current Windows operating system on your computer to Windows Vista, follow these steps:
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>1.</span></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span><span>Start the computer and make sure that the current version of Windows has started.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>2.</span></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span><span>Insert the Windows Vista DVD into the DVD drive and then close the drive tray. Wait a moment for the Setup program to start automatically.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>3.</span></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span><span>If the Setup program does not start automatically, follow these steps:
<br />
Click Start and then click Run.<br />
Type Drive:\setup.exe and then click OK. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: Drive is the drive letter of the computer’s DVD drive.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>4.</span></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span><span>When the Setup program starts and the Install now screen appears, click Install now.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note: When you receive with the Get important updates for installation message, click on Go Online.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5.</span></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span><span>Click Upgrade when the "Which type of installation do you want?" screen appears.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>6.</span></span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span><span>Follow the instructions to install Windows Vista.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>Once done, try to perform a Windows Update and check if the issue is fixed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope the information will help. Please post back and let us know.<br />
<br />
Thanks &amp; Regards</span></p>

<h3> jakoe1960  say:</h3>
<h2>            3 day old laptop cannot be updated, is it safe to use&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Was just gifted a new Dell Inspiron 3180 with 32 gb emmc.&nbsp; I removed all the programs I could, but I cannot update Windows 10.&nbsp; Two calls to Dell and basically my options are: 1) disable updates, and 2) reinstall latest version of Windows 10 via a flash
 drive for updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My concern with not updating at all is not having security if I do on-line banking or something?&nbsp; Will I need to be reinstalling Windows 10 in order to update the laptop every time there is an update?&nbsp; I really don't want to have to be setting up my computer
 every week or something?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just ordered a 64 gb thumb drive for this laptop, but apparently that won't help?</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what am I supposed to do?&nbsp; Learn Linux?</p>

<p>There is just not enough space on this 32 GB (27.5 GB used) emmc drive to perform an update.&nbsp; This has been confirmed with Dell.&nbsp; The update requires much more space than I have available and I only have Chrome browser and printer software installed.&nbsp; I
 have already removed all other non-essential programs that came installed with the PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1:&nbsp; Doesn't work, not enough space.&nbsp; Tried this a day ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2?:&nbsp; You're kidding, right?&nbsp; I'm a lay person, not a computer technician.&nbsp; No way I'm doing this, especially after reading the comments.&nbsp; I'll play with some Linux distribution before I go through all this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 3?:&nbsp; Seems similar to reinstalling Windows. WILL I NEED TO DO THIS WITH EVERY UPDATE?&nbsp; I wouldn't mind if it were a couple times a year, but just not worth fooling around with this for every update.&nbsp; Would I be doing this daily?&nbsp; Weekly?&nbsp; Monthly?&nbsp;
 Some Windows 10 updates appeared to install ok, but this "cumulative" one is huge.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am assuming that it is not safe to use this pc without updates?</p>

            Hi Jakoe1960
<br />
<br />You would be amazed how many users with 32GB of internal storage ask the exact same question . . . 
<br />
<br />You will never be able to update that device, is it safe to use, yes, if you use a 3rd party security solution
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD (29.1GB usable) is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />Your best option is to return that device and get one with minimum 100GB storage

<h2>            Windows Update Asks me to Uninstall my Security Software...&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>See the attached image for reference. Symantec Endpoint is mandatory for all computers on my workplace's network, including private laptops, and I'd have to uninstall it and reinstall right away to accommodate this upgrade. Should Windows be asking me to
 do this? It is Windows and not some clever malware, right? Why is this clash happening, if it's legit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>The installation of Windows 10 requires that you uninstall any and all third party security software to avoid potential conflicts or other problems during installation. Once Windows 10 is installed you can then reinstall it.</p>

</p><p>Hope this helps and if you need any further assistance post and we will be glad to help you.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are getting the error message "microsoft visualC++ debug library Run-Time Check Failure".</p>
<p>
</p><p>This could be due to some issues with the Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Package on the computer. So, let us first try uninstalling and reinstalling the Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Package on the computer and check if that resolves the issue. Please refer
 to the article given below to uninstall this package from the computer: </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">Add or Remove Programs</span></a></em></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once after uninstalling it, you may try reinstall it and check if that resolves the issue. Please download this package from either of these link:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>For 32 bit Operating System: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=a7b7a05e-6de6-4d3a-a423-37bf0912db84" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>If the issue still persists after installing above package, the issue should be a software problem. I suggest you take a clean boot check whether it is a software conflict issue. If not, it is still recommended to address the problem with
 manufacturer support. Thank you for your understanding. </span></span></span></p>

            Hi Bill
<br />
<br />It depends, what is the Make and exact Model No. of your system - that will be printed on a sticker on the bottom casing?
<br />
<br />For example on Asus motherboard systems, the solution involves booting into BIOS
<br />
<br />Then go to Advanced Mode Menu - Boot - Secure Boot, change 'OS type' to 'Other OS'

<h2>            My computer experiences intermittent freezes - CPU usage spikes in task manager but can&#39;t tell what makes it spike. My internet connection closes, mouse freezes, keyboard freezes.</h2>
                    I have closed down unnecessary processes to no avail. I have removed all non essential programs from startup. No virus'.
<br />
<br />
Once when this happened I went to start &gt; connect to &gt; show all connections and disabled wireless LAN connection, then enabled and repaired and it stopped the freeze. When it happened again, I tried the same (2x) and computer shut itself down. When error report
 was sent it took me to a page that said problem was with a driver. I have reinstalled wireless (3x). I know very little about hardware. Can anyone point me in the right direction?

    <title>update KB2965788 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kathy&#35;  say:</h3>
<h2>            update KB2965788</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;I am using Windows 7 Home version. My understanding of ms is very basic &amp; I don't understand the system for allocating KB numbers. I installed important update KB2965788 on 8.11.15 along with a batch of other updates but this one failed - Error code 80070308.
 I have tried, unsuccessfully, to find a description. I also went to the download center to find the failed update, with a view to downloading &amp; trying again to install it but it didn't seem to be there although there were earlier downloads in 2014 &amp; 2015 with
 the same KB number. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I have automatic updating turned on and have always used it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, my questions are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 What is error code 80070308? </p>
<p>2 Why does the same KB number appear to refer to more than one update?</p>
<p>3 Why can I not find the failed 8.11.15 download in the download center? I imagine that it is not identical to what seem to be earlier&nbsp; downloads with the same KB number.
</p>
<p>4 Were can I find the failed download </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry, but I really am confused.</p>

    <title>Window 10 upgrade unable to free up sufficient memory - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> richardsaunders3  say:</h3>
<h2>            Window 10 upgrade unable to free up sufficient memory</h2>
                    <p>I have an Acer Aspire ES13 which has 29.1GB of memory. Of this 17.1GB is system and reserved, 3.80GB is apps, Temp files 3.29GB and other 2.39GB.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Aside from the issue as to why Microsoft has to produce an upgrade requiring 8gb and manufacturers manage to produce and sell products which do have sufficient memory to cope with the software installed can someone please explain a simple process for installing
 this update. I have removed every app and file that I think I can safely remove but cannot interrogate the temp and other locations. I do have an external drive with over 200GB of free space if that can be used in any way</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance</p>

Options for freeing up space:
Windows over time will accumulate data outside of the normal types of data we store. This can include things like copies of Windows Updates, memory dump files used to diagnose and troubleshoot error messages, temporary internet files for web pages we often visit and Windows Upgrade files, commonly used to assist with installing updates for Windows. Sometimes we don't need this type of information and removing it can free up precious disk space inaddition to improving overall system performace.
Having enough disk space is especially important if you are performing task such as upgrading to the new Windows 10. It is one of the the first things Windows setup checks before it starts copying files. Large programs too will often require that you have enough disk space available.
Lets start.
Launch Disk Cleanup, the quickest way is this:
Press Windows key + R then type: cleanmgr.exe
Then hit Enter
Windows 10 &gt; Start &gt; All Apps &gt; Windows Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; Disk Cleanup
Once Disk cleanup opens, select the drive where Windows is installed if its not already.
Windows will scan your hard disk for files it can clean up.
Note some of these files too can include older installations of Windows. For example, if you upgraded from a previous version of Windows 10, a copy will be kept at the root of the hard disk in a folder called Windows.old. Please becareful though, this folder can actually be useful if you need to go back to your previous version of Windows for whatever reason. So be mindful before deleting it. Removing it though can significantly free up disk space.
After Disk Cleanup is finished scanning, you will see the Disk Cleanup window. This window provides a list of areas of the system you can clean up safely. Before we start cleaning up the system, you will notice appears on the window called Clean up system files. Clean it and the Disk Cleanup will run a thorough check of the system again to include every file that can be removed.
Location/Type 	Description 	Safe to Delete
Downloaded Program Files 	Downloaded Program Files are ActiveX controls and Java applets downloaded automatically from the Internet when you view certain pages. They are temporarily stored in the Downloaded Program Files folder on your hard disk. 	YES
Temporary Internet Files 	The Temporary Internet Files folder contains webpages stored on your hard disk for quick viewing. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. Personally, I suggest you keep this if you are on a slow connection and need the basic elements of web pages you often visit to load faster. 	Keep It
Offline Webpages 	Offline pages are webpages that are stored on your computer so you can view them without being connected to the Internet. If you delete these pages now, you can still view your favorites offline later by synchronizing them. Your personalized settings for webpages will be left intact. I also recommend you leave this alone since you might be on a slow connection and need quick access to a webpage with some specific content. 	Keep It
Recycle Bin 	The Recycle Bin contains files you have deleted from your computer. These files are not permanently removed until you empty the Recycle Bin. Sometimes you might inadvertently delete a file that you didn’t intend to delete permanently, so before you empty the contents of the Recycle Bin, do a thorough check before. 	YES
Temporary files 	Programs sometimes store temporary information in the TEMP folder. Before a program closes., it usually deletes this information. You can safely delete files that have not been modified in over a week. You can view the contents of the temp directory and see if there is anything in there you might need. Open the Run Command (Windows key + R), type in %temp% &gt; hit OK. Sometimes program installers for common applets are stored there that you can use to reinstall such as Adobe Flash for instance if you don’t want to redownload it every time. 	YES
Thumbnails 	Windows keeps a copy of all your picture, video, and document thumbnails so they can be displayed quickly when you open a folder. If you delete these thumbnails, they will be automatically recreated as needed. I don’t see any problems deleting it if its gonna be recreated, but deleting it sometimes can correct problems with previews of photos and videos. 	YES
Debug Dump Files 	When your computer experiences a system hang because of a poorly written application or device driver, Windows intelligently creates a log of what happened. This log can be used along with other logs such as System error memory dump files to help diagnose the problem when sent to Microsoft or the developer for review. 	Keep It
System error memory dump files 	Similar to the Debug Dump files, memory error dumps happen when poorly written drivers or applications crash. It is very handy for utilities built into Windows such as Troubleshooters which help in diagnosing problems that occur in Windows. 	Keep It
 The most common locations are Temporary files, Temporary Internet Files, Recycle Bin to name a few. Other not so common locations include the Thumbnail Cache which stores previews of your images allowing you load them faster when you open the Pictures Library or Windows Live Photo Gallery. This I do not recommend you delete for obvious purposes. Lets dig a little deeper. Disk Cleanup provides a list of areas where you can free up disk space and gain additional speed in some cases.
In addition to these common locations, Windows will also store information related to Error reporting and solution checking, leave these for diagnosis that can help resolve issues with applications or devices. Also, if you do an upgrade from previous version of Windows 10 or clean install, Windows 10 might store information related to servicing which are logs used to assist the installation of the operating system. Once you have checked these locations for clean up, click the OK button and these locations will be cleaned out.
As I noted earlier, the Windows.old folder is basically a backup of your old installation of Windows, which you can use to reinstall Windows if you decide to return to your previous installation. Also, its used as a last resort in case you didn’t backup your files and need to recover personal files and settings. The Windows.old folder can use up a considerable amount of your hard disk space. Its normally stored at the root of your hard disk where Windows 10 is installed. Before you delete it, make sure you check through the directories and ensure that everything migrated successfully to your current version of Windows.
http://notebooks.com/2010/11/09/how-to-recover-documents-music-and-email-after-upgrading-with-the-windows-old-folder/
Once you have determined what to remove, click OK then click the Delete Files button to begin.
Click Yes if you are ok with the action that will be taken.
System Restore – System Restore keeps a large collection of System Restore Points in addition to storing them in your System Images of Windows 10. A friend had recently upgraded to Windows 10 and he asked me why he was low on hard disk space. He had a 320 GB drive and only had about 70 GBs of free disk space left after doing a disk cleanup. It was then I discovered that System Protection had been configured to use about 200 GBs of  disk space to keep System Restore Points.
Configuring System Protection settings
To configure System Protection, click Start, type: System Protection, hit Enter. Under Protection Settings, click the Configure button. A dialog will appear with various settings for configuring Restoration and Disk space usage. Under the Disk space usage tab, you will see the current amount of space in use by System Restore while the Max usage displays the amount allocated. 
Use the Max usage knob to configure how much disk space you want to allocate to System Protection. In the above screenshot, you will see that I am using 21.05 GBs for Restore Points, while I have allocated 22.36 GBs of disk space for System Protection. You also have the option of deleting all Restore Points which stores System settings and previous versions of files. I suggest you leave this, since you will be able to individually restore changes to files you are working on. So for instance, if you edited an image and would like to restore it to a previous version or original version of the file. 
Archive Large Files to an External Hard Disk
Storing large files on your local drive that you are not using doesn’t really make much sense these days. Moving infrequently used multimedia, like photos and videos, to an external drive can free up significant amounts of disk space.  Because of my Internet limitations, I still need to keep my music locally, so that means my iTunes library probably consumes the most space on my Surface Pro.
Archiving files to an external drive is easy. Before you do that though, you need to invest in an external drive. It’s fairly easy to find one that is really cheap with lots of space.  Once you have one, I recommend you check out our guide on how to partition a hard drive for macOS Time Machine and Windows 10 Backups.
There are several backup methods you can use, but I always go with the manual method, which involves copying files from your personal folder to a backup folder on your external drive. Select the files or folders then performing a drag and drop action using the right mouse button to your external drive. When the context menu appears, click Move here.

            Hi Richard, I would wait for a couple of weeks - there is another huge upgrade about to arrive (version 1803) . . .
<br />
<br />I understand your frustration with these once a year 8GB upgrades, not to mention the monthly updates, you would be amazed how many users ask the exact same question every day here on Community . . . 
<br />
<br />Honestly, there is only one answer - backup your data and perform a clean install of Windows 10 - I know this is not the answer you are looking for, but it is the only and best Answer. You will then have enough space for the next 2 years of Windows 10 updates and your system will be faster . .. 
<br />
<br />Any device with a 32 GB SSD is not good enough to run Windows 10, regardless of the system specs put out by Microsoft. 
<br />
<br />I honestly don't know why the manufacturers produced these devices. 
<br />
<br />The Windows 10 folder with a couple of updates will very quickly eat up 20 - 25GB of your hard drive, mine is currently 23GB 
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything ! 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool 
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS: 
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

<br />I am Sumit, an Independent advisor and a Microsoft MVP here to help.
<br />First of all, eliminate all useless files on C:/ by using Disk Cleanup.
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3012-open-use-disk-cleanup-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3012-open-u...</a>
<br />Make sure you have checked System files option after the first scan.
<br />Also, 
<br />Treesize should tell you which files and folders are taking up the space.
<br /><a href="https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.jam-software.com/treesize_free/</a>
<br />It is worth checking the Users folder and its subfolders with it.
<br />Please let us know if you need any assistance.

<h2>            TCP&#47;IP v4 DNS keeps resetting &#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I want my TCP/IPv4 properties to be set to automatically get DNS. However when I check the box it works for so long and then resets and enters addresses in the DNS address boxes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How can I clear out these addresses and get it to "stick" on automatic ?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

 stored there and so they hopefullly will not be able to return and you will only get them automatically.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>

            When I try windows7 it does not boot the setup at all. I have also tried Ubuntu13.04 which supports UEFI, Android x86 also supports UEFI. For Ubuntu when it boots it just shows a blank screen for a really long time. Not only that, My windows8 also works
 in CSM. That is the main concern windows8 is not supposed to work in CSM and UEFI. When I change to CSM it tells me to enter a code to change the os mode to CSM. Any other person gets that? I have contacted Insyde but they have not replied yet

<h2>            Windows 10 &#40;Shell Experience Host&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I notice that windows shell experience host starts to use a lot of memory all of the sudden (up to 500 MB).</p>
<p>When that happens start menu refuses to open. If I wait about minute it opens up and memory use of shell experience drops down to 50-70 MB. So I can conclude that there is definitely some connection but I can't understand what is causing this behavior.</p>

<p>Hi Nikita,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We understand that you're having issues with opening start menu as the<strong> Windows Shell Experience Host</strong> process is using too much memory. To isolate this, we suggest that you perform a clean boot using the steps
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>. This is recommended because there is a possibility that there is a third party application with high CPU usage that is trying to use this process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clean boot is performed so you can start Windows with minimal set of drivers and startup programs and to let you identify what other process on your computer is taking too much memory.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: Please go through the section: <strong>How to reset the computer to start as usual</strong> after troubleshooting with clean boot of the KB article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us updated on the status of the issue. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10&#58; Won&#39;t Boot &#40;Display&#41; after NVidia update 2015-08-08</h2>
                    <p>Ok, so I've successfully upgraded 1 laptop and win10 is working GREAT!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I went to update my older <strong>Alienware Mx11 R1</strong> and it's a different story. &nbsp;I downloaded the update from windows 7 64bit Pro, to Win10 upgrade. The upgrade went perfectly fine and I was able to use the laptop for a full day. Then, I recieved
 a forced update from windows and rebooted and problems began. It looks like windows pushed an nvidia graphics driver. After the update I just boot right into a black screen with only my mouse visible. After trying to boot into safe mode, with no success. I
 did a restore point and still no go. My specs are below.<br />
</p>
<p>Specs:</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><span>Processor</span></td>
<td><span>1.3 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo SU7300 ULV</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Memory</span></td>
<td><span>4GB; 1,066MHz DDR3</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Hard drive</span></td>
<td><span>SSD</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Chipset</span></td>
<td><span>Mobile Intel GM45 Express</span></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><span>Graphics</span></td>
<td><span><em><strong>Nvidia GeForce GT 335M</strong></em> + Intel GMA 4500MHD</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

</p><p>What I did do, was successfully go into my BIOS settings and disabled my NVidia Graphics card. This forced my Intel graphics to be the main video driver. I was able to boot fine and log into Win10. But, each time I try to use change the NVidia drivers and
 re-enabled the card in the bios it just fails to boot into windows (display). So I have to adjust my settings in my Bios to leave the graphics card off. What gives with the faulty NVidia driver? I need to be able to BLOCK updates as necessary, otherwise I
 can't use my laptop the way I need to. &nbsp;I've read a lot of people with this same/similar problem,
<strong>im lucky enough to have a BIOS switch to disable the NVidia driver so im somewhat functional. So if anyone on the M11x R1 is reading this, its a "half" fix,
</strong>but not a TRUE fix. Even if I downgrade the drivers, the system will boot FINE. But, the minute the forced update takes hold, I go right into a black boot screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This whole Force updated seems like a great idea, except it's not that great.</p>

<p>This problem has been going on, from what I can tell, for the last year. Yet, Microsoft is still pushing this broken update on Windows 10. After a year, you'd think there would be a fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nope!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just denials and misdirection!</p>
<p>
</p><p>How about a real solution rather than some canned reply?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or how about we all decide with our wallets and just switch to Linux?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows 10 machine was working fine until this update. And now it's completely useless. You have to have the reflexes of a squirrel to catch it before it FORCES THE UPDATE without your control and REBOOTS again without any control from the user. Of course,
 you guys also make it way harder to boot into safe mode. And then when you CAN get into safe mode, it's pretty much useless for this purpose other than to remove the broken driver and then reboot, only to have Windows 10 FORCE THE UPDATE AGAIN AND BREAK ITSELF.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Soo.. It's been a year. How about instead of telling us to put a band-aid on it, y'all do you're f'n jobs and fix this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Heh..</p>

    <title>Windows 10 activation in a virtual machine - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> samthompson62  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 activation in a virtual machine</h2>
                    <p>I'm normally a Linux user, but there are a few things that I occasionally need which won't run under Wine. To this end, I purchased a license of Win7Pro a couple of years ago, and installed it in a virtualbox VM. This worked for a couple of years very well.
 I'd occasionally change the specs of the VM (more resources when running Autodesk inventor, fewer when running something less intensive etc), and it didn't have an issue with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the update to Win10 I've found that I'm a little bit stuffed - having changed the specs on the VM for some CAD work, Win10 has decided it's not activated, but won't let me reactivate it. The errors I receive are vaied, but none of them are listed on
 the activation help pages, I have no Win10Pro key (only a Win7Pro key, which Win10 rejects), and telephone activation doesn't seem to work either. I'm a little cheesed off having shelled out $$ for useless software which is less functional than cracked versions
 I could have downloaded for nothing...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any way I can reactivate my Win10, or will I be forced to reinstall Win7 and be stuck with it?</p>

            <p>Depends what you changed. Windows 10 is activated using a digital licence against the hardware. (no different for a host or virtual machine) If the key for Windows 7 Pro was a boxed retail product then you may be able to get it re-activated by calling support,
 or type support in search and select the top result.</p>
<p>If you increased the memory or size of the hard drive then windows should not lose activation. If you essentially changed the motherboard then that is seen as a new machine and requires a new licence.</p>
<p>If you are using a MS account to sign-in have you used the Activation Troubleshooter.?</p>

            I think perhaps the issue is changing the GPU and number of processors? When running something like Autodesk I might provision 12 Xeon cores and a decent chunk of a Quadro, while for lighter tasks I'd give it maybe two cores and skip hardware accelerated
 graphics completely - I assume these are the hardware changes which cause deactivation to occur. I never signed in to any microsoft account - at the time the drawbacks appeared to outweigh the benefits, and the Activation Troubleshooter just tells me to purchase
 a Win10 license...

            When I first installed Win7, I had to use telephone activation, but it worked. Now when I try to use telephone activation the computer itself won't accept the key and tells me to go purchase one. I had assumed that activation via chat support would yield
 the same results; is it likely to?
