<h2>            Problem installing app from Windows Store in Windows 10</h2>
                    I had a problem with the Microsoft Solitaire Collection app and did an uninstall. &nbsp;Now I'm trying to install it again from the Windows Store and when I click on INSTALL it shows WORKING with little dots going around in a circle but nothing happens even
 after a couple hours. &nbsp;I have high speed internet so I don't understand what's wrong.

<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To resolve this problem, use the inbox Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool. Then, install the Windows update or service pack again.</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Open an elevated command prompt. To do this, swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap Search. Or, if you are using a mouse, point to the lower-right corner of the screen, and then
 click Search. Type Command Prompt in the Search box, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as administrator. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow.</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Type the following command, and then press Enter.<br />
It may take several minutes for the command operation to be completed.</span></span></li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Important</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that
 are required to fix corruptions. However, if your Windows Update client is already broken, use a running Windows installation as the repair source, or use a Windows side-by-side folder from a network share or from a removable media, such as the Windows DVD,
 as the source of the files. To do this, run the following command instead: </span>
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth /Source:</span><var><span>C:\RepairSource\Windows</span></var><span>
 /LimitAccess</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Note</span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Replace the
</span><var><span>C:\RepairSource\Windows</span></var><span> placeholder with the location of your repair source. For more information about using the DISM tool to repair Windows, reference

<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Close the command prompt, and then run
</span><strong><span>Windows Update</span></strong><span> again.</span></span></li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>DISM creates a log file (%windir%/Logs/CBS/CBS.log) that captures any issues that the tool found or fixed. %windir% is the folder in which Windows is installed.
 For example, the %windir% folder is C:\Windows.</span></span></p>

            <p>thanks for assistance but the problem is still available. I even discovered another combos like when I press ( U + 1 Numpad + 2 Numpad )= Y as an output , if I press (W +1 numpad + 2 NUmpad) = F1 and (W+7 NP + 8 NP) = tab.
</p>
<p>what i did till now trying to solve the problem:</p>
<p>1- change keyboard from US to UK&nbsp;</p>
<p>2- try external usb keyboard</p>
<p>3- change windows language&nbsp;</p>
<p>4- windows defender full scan to make sure no viruses (PC clean )</p>
<p>5- Install windows 7 asus keyboard driver with compatibilty mode</p>
<p>6- Un-install old driver and install win 10 driver</p>
<p>7- Method 1 given above&nbsp;</p>
<p>8-searched in different support forums asus ,tomhardware,etc for people with same problem but didn't find.</p>
<p>I think am the only one in the world having this annoying problem:/<br />

<p>Same problem here.</p>
<p>We need to make Microsoft and the Forza people aware of this if they are not already. If not nothing will ever be fixed.</p>
<p>Unless they already know and they just dont care because they are getting $43 dollars either way.

<h3> maxtrek117  say:</h3>
<h2>            Mark IV Armour Halo 4 Legendary Reward Bug</h2>
                    
<p>I finished the Halo 4 campaign on Legendary solo recently, but did not receive the rewarded armour, nor did I get any notification of my reward. I did however, get an achievement for completing the campaign on legendary and I have checked my Statistics +
 Halo WayPoint which both show I have finished all campaign missions on legendary solo. So I'm wondering where my reward is.</p>
<p>And yes I was online while I completed each mission.</p>
<p>My gamer tag is MaxTrek117</p>

<p>To be awarded the Mark VI and Legendary Visor you must complete the "Legend" commendation (Service Record -&gt; Player -&gt; Campaign -&gt; Then you have a list of missions needed to complete for the commendation). To do this, all missions must be completed on legendary.
 Unfortunately the system that records completion is buggy and you must be connected to Xbox live the entire time throughout the mission. Missions must be done from start to end. I've had more success in doing missions in a single run from the start ( as in,
 don't save and quit until you finish the mission for the commendation you are missing).</p>
<p>Your best shot is redoing missions that dont appear to be complete.</p>

    <title>x64 Compatable Driver for USB IRDA Device - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> numbersix  say:</h3>
<h2>            x64 Compatable Driver for USB IRDA Device</h2>
                    Recently moved from XP x64 to Windows 7 x64. I use a Polar IR721 USB IRDA device, which worked fine under XP. Unfortunatly I have had no success convicing Windows 7 that the IRDA device is connected, it registers as an Unknown Device and when I try and
 update the driver (from the XP/Vista compatible drivers I have) the process fails.<br />
I have tried searching the internet for a suitable driver but have found nothing that works. Does anyone know of a suitable driver or possable workaround to get the IRDA device to be recognised?<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

            Thanks for the reply.<br />
In the end I found this article on the Polar site which helped a great deal.<br />
<br />
http://www.polar.fi/en/support/faqs?product=&amp;category=Software&amp;documenttitle=Installing+Polar+IrDA+2.0+Adapter+to+Windows+Vista&amp;document=/gip/PKBStoGIP.nsf/web_cat/C225742500419A8AC22572EC00263427<br />
<br />
I entered Device Manager (from the control panel) and selected Scan for Hardware Changes. In the option box which appeared (after the system failed to identify the IRDA device) I chose the option to scan the internet for a suitable driver. To my delight Windows
 found one which works and downloaded it, so I now have my IR device working again.<br />

    <title>&#34;Battery charging&#34; and &#34;battery charge is low&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hukuzunov  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Battery charging&#34; and &#34;battery charge is low&#34; Notifications in Windows 10 at 50&#37; battery charge - how to get rid of them&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I run a 64 bit Windows 10 Home, Version 1511, OS Build 10586.318 on a 128 GB Cintiq Companion 2.<br />
My problem is the following: <br />
I do not wish to receive the "battery charging" and the "battery charge is low" notifications that&nbsp;pop up in the lower right corner of the screen. As you can see on the picture below, I switched "Low battery notification" toggle to "off" for both the ''on battery''
 and the&nbsp;"plugged in" regimes.&nbsp;<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1276912e-82df-468a-891f-4028eb290f7a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/1276912e-82df-468a-891f-4028eb290f7a" /><br />
</a>And, as expected, after that I did't receive the "battery charge is low" notification any more, speaking when the battery is at 10% - the specified low battery level. Nevertheless I do receive the "battery charge is low" notification every time my battery
 isn't charging and hits the 50% mark.</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4d33c7ee-00cf-4081-aeab-17147d1154ae" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4d33c7ee-00cf-4081-aeab-17147d1154ae" /></a><br />
<span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Another notification I get whenever my battery level hits 50%, but is plugged in and charging is the ''battery charging" pop up.<br />
I do not wish to be notified that my battery is charging, I am the one who plugged in the power cord, so I am aware of it&nbsp;and having to swipe these two notifications away several times a day is annoying.&nbsp;</span><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8c98983c-5acc-4875-ac41-408bb8ad8305" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/8c98983c-5acc-4875-ac41-408bb8ad8305" /><br />
</a></p>
<p>If anybody knows, where I can control these two notifications from, I would greatly appreciate an answer. Does anybody else experience these notifications ? I searched the internet on this topic several times and I'm starting to wonder, if I'm the only one
 getting the pop ups.<br />
<br />
Cheers!</p>

<p><span>Many of the games providers run use and install an application called Punkbuster on their servers.&nbsp; Full information here: http://www.punkbuster.com/</span></p>
<p><span>This application actively monitors users online and those found to be using codes, hacks or anything not part of the original programming released by the game manufacturer, the person now caught cheating is kicked from the game
 and receive various lengths of short term bans for first time offenders to permanent bans if they fail to heed the warnings that cheating is not acceptable.</span></p>
<p><span>Why then do we as Xbox Gold members have to endure cheaters in out games?&nbsp; Surely Microsoft has its own version of Punkbuster that it could and I feel should role out to all Xbox consoles to stop those that need to cheat to
 win from ruining the game, our Xbox Gold experience with their selfish acts?</span></p>
<p><span>I am positively on my last multiplayer game purchase and my last Gold membership until I see a more proactive role on Microsofts part to protect my gaming experience from being totally ruined by a selfish minority.</span></p>

<p>It is no different for Sony as well. So it isnt just an "MS" &nbsp;thing.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>And a punkbuster type program on MS's side would never work. Mainly because every game is different, and that would mean for the progrm to work, the the Devs would have to give MS access to their codings.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Now, MS and/or Sony could always stand up and tell the devs to include some kind of punkbuster type program with their games. BUT, once support goes away for that game, the modders will have busted the punkbuster.

<p>It most likely got minimized to the System Tray in the lower right Taskbar. The minimized WSR, Windows Speech Recognition icon looks like this:</p>

<h2>            TES VI&#58; Hammerfell</h2>
                    
<p>Please read the introduction before advancing, thank you.<br />
<br />
<em><strong>Hi all, I've created an idea for an Elder Scrolls game based in Hammerfell, it's still largely a Work In Progress (WIP), but I'll keep expanding it. I'm looking for critisism and praise on the pros and cons of my idea.
 If you do take the time to read this, THANK YOU very much, all support is welcome, but if no-one likes it then hey, I took a shot.</strong></em><br />
<em><strong>Well Copy+Paste from Word.. here I go</strong></em></p>
<p>This is also a copy+paste from TES forums, it was locked for (I quote) "posting an idea".<br />
<br />
<strong>Edit1: Fixed Spelling Mistakes</strong><br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Zehq’s TES: Hammerfell idea’s</strong></p>
<p>Hi, so I’ve come up with a few ideas about an Elder Scrolls game based in Hammerfell. Now, considering Skyrim came out a year ago, I’m going ahead and presuming it would be the next game and would take place just 40 odd years after the Dragon Age.<br />
I’m going to take a plot items into effect.<br />
- Dragons are still around, but their numbers have been reduced drastically<br />
- The Thalmor are making advances on Hammerfell again and would be the main plot point of the game<br />
- The Redguard’s control the entirety of Hammerfell, aside from the Orc’s in the Dragontail mountains<br />
- The Thalmor have just starting making advances into Hammerfell*<br />
*how the game starts as well</p>
<p><strong>Starting off in Hammerfell</strong></p>
<p>So, the game will start out as you registering in a local inn in the city of Rihad, the southern-most city in the Hammerfell province and an obvious starting point for the Thalmor to attack. As they originally wanted to gain Southern Hammerfell as part of
 the Dominion’s territories, it would seem logical to start their invasion here.<br />
Now you pick your character and such and after a while bells will ring and the city will plunge into chaos, the Rihad will gather a pitiful defence force and the citizens start to flee into the surrounding desert accompanied by a small guard who will, eventually,
 die trying to save everyone.<br />
<br />
As you escape you notice Rihad’s walls being breached by cannons and offshore fire from Thalmor ships. You’ll be forced into a sort of scripted event where you can acquire a Longbow and Iron Arrows, defending the main gate and can grab a choice of melee weapons,
 but you already have a few Destruction spells available depending on your race. A very small Thalmor force charges through the main gates and attack, you will have to defend it with your newly-found weapons/magic but the Redguard’s will help you tremendously
 in your battle, however they are forced to abandon the city.<br />
<br />
As you leave you will be fighting the occasional Thalmor raiding party, and weak wildlife such as coyotes or the Alik’r version of Dingos (&nbsp;). You flee to Chase River bridge crossing, where you are forced to run across to bridge and jump into “evacuation carriages”
 where it will take you to the near city, which will be Taneth. The Chase River crossing will be destroyed and access to Rihad will be off limits… unless you have a death wish.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>What is survival and combats role in “Hammerfell”?</strong></p>
<p>Well, as I’ve previously said in my MUCH shorter description, that I disliked the role of disease and weather in Skyrim, among other things such as balance of the combat triangle (Melee, Archery, and Magicks).<br />
In Skyrim, I’ve liked the concept of disease, but it’s played out poorly and rarely happens, overall, I’ve been affected by ONE disease in all my 300 hours of Skyrim. It should’ve been that if you’re bitten by, say, a spider, you should suffer venomous consequences.
 If you walk blindly into a blizzard you should be affected by frostbite and suffer from say, “No sprinting, all combat suffers from a 60% mobility loss, no power attacks and 80% damage loss”. Harsh consequences you say? Well then why the hell did you run into
 a blizzard wearing rags?<br />
In Hammerfell, I don’t want snow here at all, aside from say at the eastern-most point at the West Reach Mountains bordering Hammerfell and Skyrim/Cyrodiil. So, the weather will be the harsh desert heat, sandstorms, flash floods, and more.<br />
<br />
<strong>Clothes, weight, sleep, food and</strong>&nbsp;water will all be major factors in surviving the desert. You must wear the required attire, armour will be fine, but it will require a ton of waterskins, whereas if you wore “desert clothing” (for
 a lack of an official name, it’ll be just called “desert clothing” for now, simply imagine a simply white ‘dress’ worn by men and women that consists of four “armour slots”, head, body, hands and feet. White would be an obvious first choice in the desert)
 you would require drastically less waterskins than previously needed.<br />
<br />
The<strong>&nbsp;time of day&nbsp;</strong>would also be important in the desert, while night time being the coolest, so clothing and water wouldn’t be as necessary, creatures would come out and attack constantly, whereas the safest time being early morning
 or afternoon. The middle of the day would be the hottest, and almost all animals wouldn’t be out aside from creatures such as “Kalik’r Saed” (just made it up, means Giant Worm in the common tongue, it’s virtually a giant worm that tunnels through the sand
 and attacks at will, very powerful, your best defence would be to run for your life) and Fire Elementals (go figure).<br />
<br />
With&nbsp;<strong>weight</strong>, I’d like it to be more realistic, (however this would only be optional, but you get an achievement for completing the game on all of the hardest difficulty settings on Xbox and PlayStation) you could pretty much only
 carry what you could if it was real life.<br />
<br />
<strong>Item limit</strong>… something I thought about… well you obviously can’t hold 40 items in your hand even if they weigh 1kg and your weight limit is say… 50kg? So I thought about it and came to a conclusion.&nbsp;<strong>Item slots
 and item limits</strong>. They’d be for different items, certain items can be held in pouches, others, such as waterskins, need specific holders. If you wore solid heavy armour you could only hold one or two at your belt at maximum (without perks), whereas
 if you wore desert clothing it would be built to survive the desert heat and could hold up to 16 waterskins, however that is without a sword sheath, shield or any equipment really. A shield would be worn on your back so that’d completely remove all waterskin
 “slots” on your back. If you had to wear a slot it’d require a sheath, meaning it’d only take away ONE slot. If you had multiple sheaths it’d take one slot each.<br />
<br />
<strong>Food, water and sleep</strong>… something that’ll be challenging to do to still make the game fun, but survival based as well. So, I thought, why not make it that food isn’t as necessary but make water very much so, and sleep… well only
 4 or 5 hours a day/night should do, and if you don’t, your screen will start to shake and blurred until you collapse on the spot and then it sleeps for you, if you die in your “sleep”, if you don’t, you don’t, but vultures will always gather around you if
 you collapse in the desert, attracting desert lions, bandits, looters and more.<br />
<br />
I’m going to start a&nbsp;<strong>new paragraph for water</strong>, because it’s going to play a minor/major role in “survival” (survival, could be a skill, I’ll talk about that later), waterskins will carry a ton of water but there will be different
 types of waterskins. As they are obviously made from “skin” (in actual fact, an animal’s bladder), I thought that as you gain power you can kill more powerful things such as Kalik’r Saed’s and harvest them for their bladder as well (ie. a 1/10 chance to ‘drop’
 a bladder when you kill it with magic, a 1/5 chance with archery and 1/100 with melee. Obviously an example…). A cow waterskin will hold the least water for the least weight, but still takes up the same “waterskin slots” as a dragon waterskin, which weighs
 more and carry’s a ton more water, but takes up the same waterskin slot as a cows waterskin. Waterskin’s come in different sizes as well, if you want a large waterskin, it would require the shield slot, and if you want a small 1L waterskin it would require
 a single slot or a “sword sheath” slot, etc., etc.</p>

<p><strong>(link removed)</strong></p>

<p><strong>The Combat Triangle and Balance</strong></p>
<p>So, in Skyrim, melee DOMINATED the combat triangle, if you used melee you could win every fight with ease, if you used magic or archery it’d be good at first but as you levelled up the creatures and people would get harder to fight until they all meant nothing
 except melee. I’ve thought about this and came to a few conclusions on the levels of creatures and how Hammerfell would be played out.<br />
<br />
<strong>Creatures, animals and levels, how they’ll work out:</strong><br />
I’ll be blunt here; the fact is, as you level up, creatures will NOT level up alongside you except essential characters (eg. Bosses and followers only, not dragons and bandits, etc.). To some of you, this will prove quite a shock as this has been in (all?)
 TES games, so just hear me out.<br />
<br />
So, I’ve&nbsp;<strong>never liked that as you level up, creatures level up as well</strong>, it was a ruining aspect for me, I mean c’mon, how is that because I decided to crouch, that a bandit for some strange reason can now OHK me and take huge amounts
 of damage, when just before my firebolt could decimate the same character? Well it goes both ways, why is it, that when I’m a level 1 with no skills whatsoever, that I can slay a dragon or the hardest creature in the game with ease?<br />
<br />
<strong>My solution</strong>&nbsp;would be that each creature has its own specific level that doesn’t change. Straight after I escape from Rihad and I get attacked by a Kalik’r Saed, I should NOT be able to kill it because it’s a level 70 creature
 (say there’s 80 levels in the game, another thing I’ll discuss soon enough), I should have to run, the same goes for a dragon and even a level 13 bandit should be hard to kill when you’re level 1. However once you pass their level or even beforehand, they
 can acquire armour and advanced weapons, such as if level 13 bandit finds a full plate set of Orcish armour, he’d be MUCH stronger than if he was wearing iron.<br />
<br />
<strong>Combat levels and Total levels:</strong><br />
Something I’ve gotten some inspiration from “RuneScape”. Well basically, you have two levelling systems now, “combat level” and “total level”. Creatures acquiring armour and difficulty and such will be governed by “combat level” rather than “total level”. Your
 combat level will be an invisible level you can’t see but is governed by combat skills such as “One-Handed, Block, Stealth, Destruction, Conjuration, Archery,<strong>&nbsp;Survival</strong>, etc.”<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>The Survival Skill</strong></p>
<p>A new skill I’ve just invented. I thought through this and considering survival is a semi-major factor in Hammerfell, I thought it would require a skill tree. Now what this would govern is weight (scrapping the weight governed by Stamina idea), and survival
 in the wilderness (pretty vague lol).<br />
Survival is how well you can hold items, your item slots<br />
<br />
WILL BE CONTINUED, W.I.P.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The stroy base sounds good. Typical TES but survival? The leveling of creatures? Runescape based combat and total level? All very sketchy. Sorry to be critical hee but I presume thats what you are looking for?</p>
<p>The survival you speak of should be and optinal mode otherwise it limits the player base massivly.
</p>
<p>I personally like the fact creatures level with you, it means when all the bosses are killed off and you have completed the questlines, there is still a level of challenge and not being so mighty that you can punch a giant to oblivion and back. I know you
 said that everything has a set level but if thats the case then you are now taking away the aspect of free roam because why would you want to free roam and suddenly find your self fighting a level 30 wolf while your still level 2 and trying to work out which
 end to shoot the arrrow from? The beauty of ES games partically comes from doing a tutorial and then having a whole world and guilds to go to.
</p>
<p>The Runescape style level system is mostly for PvP and brags. Thats all there is to that really.</p>
<p>One more thing, It will probabily be set 200+ years after Skyrim. So I doubt the Thalmer will still be trying to take hold. Its also not their style to launch attacks right away. They are sneaky buggers who will try and gain the support of the people before
 they attack so they face as little resistment as possable. Its why they had such a hard time with Nords and banned the worship of Talos so they they can whittle down the Nords spirit.
</p>
<p>A side from thatt, you have a really good concept for a game. And I do mean that, im not being sarcastic. &nbsp;

<p>The survival thing will greatly decrease the player base which is not a good thing. It should be an optional thing like the hardcore mode in New Vegas (was it even called hardcore?...). Also, a lot of us would rather increase the number of items we can carry
 - not decrease it with item slots. After all TES games do emphasize scavenging a lot. Also, don't you even mention words like "runescape" or "combat triangle" after they released that bs EoC!</p>

<p>Yes, I've taken all these things into account, I thought I cleared them up here, but apparently not, so I'll say it in a few dot points.</p>
<p>1) The Thalmor are attacking quickly because they need to take Hammerfell and annex it before the Empire can regain the trust of the people, and the Redguards despise the Thalmor more than they despise the Empire.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>2) Survival is only in the hardest two difficulties, but is required if you wish to get all achievements for the game.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>3) I'd like the levelling system to by governed this way because it means that you can't kill things higher than you, but you can kill things the same level or lower. Now when you say you still want a challenge, well I know, you can kill the Giant Worms
 and Dragons at extremely high levels (which will be hard to get to without glitching, I assure you. Most you say you're level 50 at the moment, I want these Worms to be level 70, much higher than your current level, and will still beat you easily) only, otherwise
 it will be VERY tough to beat.</p>

<p><em><strong>Updated the Hammerfell idea, finished (sort of) the Survival Skill, added in a pack mule system, and started the Alik'r Desrt.</strong></em><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>The Survival Skill</strong></p>
<p>A new skill I’ve just invented. I thought through this and considering survival is a semi-major factor in Hammerfell, I thought it would require a skill tree. Now what this would govern is weight (scrapping the weight governed by Stamina idea), and survival
 in the wilderness (pretty vague lol).<br />
“Survival” is how well you can hold items, your item slots, how often you need to sleep, eat and drink, how well you cope with the temperature and weather, disease, swimming skills, and stamina.<br />
<br />
To start off, in order to level up the skill all you need to do is use all these things effectively. Ie. Crossing the desert in a short amount of time, etc.<br />
<strong>Survival’s perk tree</strong>&nbsp;will be things such as more item slots, sleeping is required less, eating is almost never required (until you unlock a perk at say, 80 where eating isn’t required), water will be used less, more weight can
 be carried, diseases will affect you less (I never want to fully get rid of diseases, you should still suffer consequences), you swim faster and you have more stamina overall.<br />
<br />
<strong>A fully unlocked perk tree&nbsp;</strong>will be a couple more item slots, can carry 50kg more weight, armour doesn’t affect your speed, neither does weight, a single cow waterskin is enough for an in-game week in the middle of the desert,
 food isn’t required at all, diseases affect you 80% less, swimming is 100% faster and isn’t affected by weight or armour, stamina increases per survival level gained and sleeping will be required up to 1,000% less (so 2 hours sleep is enough for 3 days of
 in-game time, trust me, 1,000 may seem a lot, but in fact, that’s just 6 hours of sleep per day and each time you use a perk it takes off 200%)<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Will Survival be required in every difficulty of the game?</strong></p>
<p>No, Survival will only be included in the&nbsp;<strong>top two difficulties</strong>, however, for optimal experience, it is recommended.<br />
The game will also be based on Survival; every mission will be built as if you only had a certain amount of items and such.<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>Pack Mules, Followers, Carriages and Weight. How it will all work out</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I know you’ll be wanted to carry everything in a dungeon or cave and be willing to loot every nook and cranny so I’ve come up with a pack mule system.<br />
If you go to a city you’ll have the option to search around and purchase pack mules, followers who will work as body guards and defend your carriages/pack mules/etc, and once you’ve cleared a dungeon/cave/etc of enemies, they’ll go through the cave and loot
 it and place in the carriage for you which will hold chests full of the looted items.<br />
<br />
<strong>You’ve been waiting for it, “what’s the catch?”</strong>&nbsp;Well the catch will that you need to pick the people you hire carefully. The cheaper people will loot it for you, but if they find extremely valuable items… they might… keep it and
 return it to their home. You can however, just barge into their home and steal the item back, but if you’ve accidentally hired bandits (something else I’ll discuss in a second), then you’re going to need to kill them at their lair. Fortunately, you’ll get
 your item back as well as all the other items they’ve looted from other less fortunate people.<br />
<br />
Ah, here’s something very unfortunate… if your&nbsp;<strong>carriage gets raided</strong>&nbsp;by bandits, orcs, even the odd Thalmor raiding party, heck you might be just screwed and a Kalik’r or Dragon will simply destroy the carriage and kill the guard,
 well then you’ve got to find your carriage, find out what’s happened, check to see if the raiders have left any of their fallen behind, search for clues and figure what’s happened. If a dragon attacked they’ve probably taken the chest/s back to their lair.
 If a Kalik’r attacked then it’s probably underground in a cave system in its lair. If a bandit force attacked the chests would be in their lair, you see where I’m getting at?<br />
<br />
<strong><em>I’m still thinking of expanding this idea. The entire thought of pack mules and stuff is underdeveloped, so I’m going to stop it here for now and wait for some constructive criticism.</em></strong><br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><strong>The Great Alik’r Desert</strong></p>
<p>I really love deserts, well in video games, I love doing things I hate in real life. I hate heat but enjoy the cold, I hate water (I actually despise it), but I love the concept of Rapture, but the Alik’r Desert, something about it just draws me in… it’s
 so mysterious, so ancient, so forbidding… and I get to tell the story… this should be fun.<br />
The entire area east of Taneth and north of Gilane/Hegathe I’d like to an Empty Quarter like area (I’ll include a picture of the Empty Quarter in a second), barren, sandy, with the occasional oasis and nomadic Redguard camps surrounding said oasis’.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
WILL BE CONTINUED, W.I.P.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I still stand by what I said, good story concept apart from he Thalmor since the next game will be set 200+ years after the Skyrim incident. And you really seem to be puttin far too much focus into the survival mode of this, which is not what Elder Scrolls
 games are about. Also with making creatures a set level takes away the freedom that a true rpg has.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you able to open Notepad?<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>
<span><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What exactly happens when you try to open WordPad?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I would suggest you to run SFC scan.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>SFC /scannow is a super-useful command you can use in any Windows version. When the SFC (System File Checker) command is used with the /scannow switch, the tool
 will scan all of the important Windows files on your computer and replace them as necessary.
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Missing and corrupt operating system files (like many DLL files) are arguably the biggest cause of major Windows issues. Considering that, plus the fact that
 SFC /scannnow is completely automatic and very easy to use, the tool should usually be one of your first troubleshooting steps.</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a. Click Start, click All Programs, click Accessories, right-click Command Prompt, and then click Run as<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>administrator. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>click Allow</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Type the following command, and then press ENTER:<span>&nbsp;
</span>sfc /scannow<span>&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>[The sfc /scannow command scans all protected system files and replaces incorrect versions with correct<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Microsoft versions.]</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>A message will appear stating that 'The system scan will begin'. Be patient because the scan may take some time</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. If any files require a replace SFC will replace them. You may be asked to insert your Win7 DVD for this process<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>to continue </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d. If everything is okay you should, after the scan, see the following message "Windows resource protection did not<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>find any integrity violations" </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>e. After the scan has completed, close the command prompt window, restart the computer and check.</span></span></p>

<p>It also told me to search up the INACCESSIBLE_BOOT_DEVICE. As it stated it would restart for me, the same thing would be happening, showing me that blue page with "Your PC Ran into a problem, we'll restart for you" This has been going for the 12 hrs and
 I don't know what to do because I keep seeing the same thing over and over again. Please help me, thanks.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 PRO&#58; can&#39;t access using remote desktop after upgrading from Windows 8.1 PRO which supported it just fine</h2>
                    <p>I have 3 computers at home that I upgraded from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10. Two of those are running PRO while the third one is running HOME. Before the upgrade, I had no problem using remote desktop from any of them to connect to either of the Windows 8.1
 PRO computers (of course, I could not remote desktop TO the HOME computer).</p>
<p>
</p><p>After upgrading the three computers to Windows 10, I don't have any problem using remote desktop to connect to one of my Windows 10 PRO computers. However, I am not able to connect to the other Windows 10 PRO computer from either of the other two Windows
 10 (PRO / HOME) computers . I checked the configuration on both Windows 10 PRO computers and they are the same. Here is the message I am getting when trying to connect to that Windows 10 PRO computer:</p>
<p>----------------------</p>
<p>Remote Desktop can't connect to the remote computer for one of these reasons:</p>
<p>&nbsp;1) Remote access to the server is not enabled</p>
<p>&nbsp;2) The remote computer is turned off</p>
<p>&nbsp;3) The remote computer is not available on the network</p>
<p>Make sure the remote computer is turned on and connected to the internet, and that remote access is enabled.</p>
<p>----------------------</p>
<p>
</p><p>The three conditions are respected so I don't understand what is happening. Thanks for any information which could help!</p>
<p>

            <p>For the records, I just happened to fix the issue by accident. It seems like, when I upgraded from Windows 8.1 PRO to Windows 10 PRO, the option to allow other computers to find my computer was changed from Yes to No ('Find devices and content' in the network
 connection properties). Once I changed that back to Yes, I was able to connect to that computer. I guess I did change it on my other Windows 10 PRO computer after I upgraded it. There was almost two months between the 2 upgrades since I had issues upgrading
 each of my 3 computers, so I had forgotten about it. In any case, it's working now (I'm actually typing from that Windows 10 PRO computer through a Remote Desktop from my Windows 10 HOME computer).</p>

<p>
</p><p>Or are the original ones created at the start (first time) okay to use at anytime in the future without refresh?</p>
<p>
</p><p>(Also, like the return ability in Windows 8.1 to also backup to my own external hard drive as well as use OneDrive - all set for 'Offline'. The original Windows 8 only had either Cloud or external. This return for a home user is a plus.)</p>

            I don't have any personal experience with creating a Recovery Drive (via USB) just yet—so I can't elaborate on that issue much. However, I can tell you that various other recovery aspects from Windows 8.1 appear to be broken to date. For example, Windows
 8.1 cannot create a System Image DVD set, because the System Image console fails to automatically format the discs (as it should). Instead, it just gives an error message—then goes back to the main menu.
<br />
<br />
Upon researching this problem, it appears to just be an unattended loose end for now. Meaning, they will fix it in an update in the hopeful near future. Until then, we have to wait. I was able to work around this issue by saving the System Image to a spare
 HDD, that I keep separate from the system.<br />
<br />
This is likely also the case with Recovery Drive. So in the meantime, your best bet is to create your recovery partition using System Image and save it to a spare HDD/SDD until they fix the Recovery consoles.

            <p>Thank you for your comments.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a system image on an external HDD for the Toshiba created at the time of Recovery USB right after upgrade to 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then start questioning is it worth doing the same for the Packard Bell NoteBook? When you think I now have all Docs, Libraries etc etc backed up to another external hard drive (done set time each week) plus, now, OneDrive. It's just making only a system
 failure easier to resolve for the PB and is the expense of another, say 300GB hard drive worth it against a £250 notebook. Like some things, where do you stop? Too much on the start partitioning the other HDD 'cos I don't know how to do it and learning would
 take time I don't have at the moment.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm going on a solo 3000 mile cycle ride round France in a couple of weeks (for charity) and the PB is going with me so I'm not going to weigh down further with a HDD. The PB is to support routing using ViewRanger on the web and Android App (works offline
 so no data roaming charges). Great system for many things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Think I'll leave the HDD. Still curious if Recovery Drives need to be updated as time goes on? Anyway, thank you</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recovery partition drive that you had created on the first instance can be used to troubleshoot scenarios (including System Refresh). You don't have to update it the way Windows Backup is done. Usually, the drive partition is included as a default partition
 by the manufacturer of the computer. </p>

            <p>windows 10 does not have chess titans, they removed it, to force people to download an inferior chess game from the windows "store"</p>
<p>
</p><p>also as far as i know, they have removed the favorites bar too because i don't think edge supports it</p>

            tried typing chess games in windows bar but they are all rubbish in comparison that's why others are complaining they have also lost chess titans . my favourites bar was on the top left of my screen when I opened google, I've lost all my stuff I stored
 in my favourite bar....I regret upgrading to windows 10.......

            Useless, It does not restore any of my games. I still miss Chess Titans and cannot it nowhere. Windows 10 sucks and Microsoft should keep their hands of our computer espcially when we do not want their updates no they have force them on you.&nbsp; I still try
 to recover what I had and do not want a new and poor games from Microsoft. This games was on the disk when I buy Windows 7 I paid for it.<br />

In 1972, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court for a crime they didn't commit. They promptly escaped from a maximum security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. Today, still wanted by the government, they survive as soldiers of fortune.
 If you have a problem, if no-one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the A-Team.

</p><p>I had initially spoken to MS support who told me that the usb 3.1 should be able to support this, and ive tried an adapter from apple and startech although these are branded as thunderbolt 3 -&gt; thunderbolt 2 adapters so i was only quietly hoping that they
 will work&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone got their surface book 2 to connect with a thunderbolt 2 harddrive like drobo and knows what adapter would work for this?</p>

</p><p>Microsoft's USB ports on Surface devices are underpowered and the only thing that works with them "as is" are USB pendrives and super low power consuming external hard disks (if you can find one).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thunderbolt is a power eater and so is your hard disk.&nbsp; I do not believe that, that hard disk has an external power source capability and chances are, it will not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can try a WD Elements NL-2132 LS Hoofddrop external hard disk (Amazon.com is where I got mine).&nbsp; 1TB drive, USB.&nbsp; Works perfect with all Surface devices to include the Surface RT.</p>

            If that is the case, the adapter standard with the USB port is probably it.&nbsp; You can probably see if you can find an adapter that some Dell and Asus high end laptops use with their Thunderbolt ports.&nbsp; Amazon.com or eBay may point you to the right direction
 on that.<br />

<p>I think the USB adapter on the Book 2 is going to be the issue.&nbsp; Microsoft had underpowered the ports to begin and no telling what other shortcuts they took as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The USB port is going to be general purpose and basic.</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Connecting an external hard drive into your Surface should not cause any issues for as long as it is compatible for USB 3.0 ports.</p>

    <title>Cannot remove kb3004394 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cannot remove kb3004394</h2>
                    <p>
<span>Details:</span></p>
<span>Details:</span></p>
<p><span>Make: HP g56</span></p>
<p><span>Processor: Intel Pentium 2.3GHz duel core 64bit</span></p>
<p><span>RAM: DDR2 4GB</span></p>
<p><span>OS: Windows 7 home premium</span></p>
<p><span>Problem:</span></p>
<p><span>Message regularly comes up saying windows is not genuine even though it is and it came with the laptop.
 The desktop background us not black however, updates don't install and when Microsoft's scan is run it finds that windows is not genuine. The activation key says that it is activated.</span></p>
<p><span>Cause:</span></p>
<p><span>Windows update KB3004394 which is installed and has numerous reports of causing this problem. Released
 in December 2014.</span></p>
<p><span>Failed solutions:</span></p>
<p><span>The main solution touted on forums is to install the update KB4024777 there are 3 versions of this
 update and, since Microsoft has deleted is main page on this, I tried to install the x86 version of this however, this didn't work as the computer is 64bit. The other version I tried to install was the amd64 version (there isn't an Intel one) which tries to
 install but fails with error code 1. </span></p>
<p><span>Next I tried manually uninstalling the update. This was not recommend by Microsoft however, there
 were several success stories online so I thought I might as well try. After uninstalling the update it stopped saying that windows was not genuine and when I reach the scan it found that it was genuin. The problem came when I tried to install an update (as
 you can imagine there were quite a few of these) however, the update (only 350kB) locked up at 0kB 0% download and wouldn't get past that even though there was Internet.
</span></p>
<p><span>I then tried to reboot the laptop however, it then tried to install updates and it straddled on update
 1 of 2, so I had to force reboot it. I then reverted to before uninstalling the update incase I has broken something. This caused problems where I could not shut down the computer or install updates and it thought it wasn't genuine again. (although some of
 these issues may have been fixed by a hard reboot)&nbsp;</span></p>

    <title>Need help with setting up a VPN to bypass port forwarding to allow - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Need help with setting up a VPN to bypass port forwarding to allow access to my web server</h2>
                    Pretty much as the title says, but that probably isn't clear enough. Allow me to explain:<br />
I want to host a website on my computer. Not a major one, but something small and private.<br />
<br />
Before I set up a domain name, I want to make sure that the website works -- which it doesn't.<br />
I'm currently using <a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">WAMPServer</a> to organize it all.<br />
<br />
I have it set so when I connect to localhost, I have access to all of my files in the set directory, regardless of whether or not I'm "online" or "offline" on WAMPServer (whether or not others will have access to my webpage).<br />
<br />
When I turn WAMPServer "online", it allows connection to my WAMPServer homepage through both localhost and connection through the static IP I set up, but only through LAN, meaning that only computers connected to my home network would have access to the page.<br />
<br />
My router cannot be configured to allow port forwarding so I can open up a port to allow redirection to my computer, rather than the ambiguous router itself. As an alternative, I downloaded
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamachi_%28software%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Hamachi</a> to allow a computer to connect to the VPN (Hamachi), and by extension, my IP for access to the files in the directory.<br />
<br />
In theory, it should have worked, but it didn't. Computers in my LAN could still connect to the IP, but the computer in the VPN but not on LAN could not.
<br />
<br />
Is there something I'm missing here, or are there suggestions to make this work?<br />
<br />
Note: <br />
My static IP works as what it is, however, it is different than the IP used in Hamachi. If I change the IP used by my computer to access the site to the IP that my Hamachi is using, would this make it work? As an alternative suggestion, can I change my static
 IP setting to be automatic, and change the one being used on WAMPServer (from localhost, allowing connection to be made) to the one on Hamachi? Or would I have to make all three IPs the same?<br />
<br />
Thanks for all help and solutions,<br />
