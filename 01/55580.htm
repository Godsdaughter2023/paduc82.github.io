<h2>            printing from Windows Live mail prints out garbage</h2>
                    I have Windows 7 and Windows Live Mail 2011.&nbsp; When I print an e-mail from my in-box to my Pixma 4000 printer, it does not print like it appears on screen but comes out with all the code instructions (sorry, don't know the tech term) in a great stream of
 words and instructions.&nbsp; This also happens if I save the e-mail whatever type of document I save it as.&nbsp; This has not always been the case but I haven't changed anything that I know of.&nbsp; I can find nothing that helps me solve this problem.&nbsp; Grateful for help.&nbsp;

            I should have said earlier that I solved the problem myself but I didn't anser on here as couldn't describe how I did it!&nbsp; My usual combination of clicking and trying everything till something worked - ought to patent the method!

<p>Hi fastmode!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for bringing this to our attention. Is this game owned digitally or disc version of the game? Have you tried to update/install anything else to see if the issue persists with other installations?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case I would recommend to try the <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Soft Factory Reset</a> (reset console keeping games and apps). Now before doing the soft reset, make sure 2 things.</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure to have account information (email &amp; password) to sign back in as this step does signs out all the accounts on the Xbox.</li><li>Have secure internet connection; this will require to sign back in to the Wi-Fi connection to finish the set up.</li></ol>

</p><p>I ran the Windows Update Troubleshooter recently and it found and "fixed" two problems:</p>

<p>Possible issues may prevent Windows Update from keeping your system up to date.</p>
<p><strong>Windows Update components must be repaired</strong></p>
<p>One or more Windows Update components are configured incorrectly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>However, after running the troubleshooter again afterwards, it is saying it has found and fixed the same two problems. This happens every time I run the troubleshooter. Help!</p>

                    Hey guys, I just got a new Xbox because my old on scratched 3 of my games (halo 3, skate 3 and borderlands 2) so anyways I got a new Xbox and I decided to download skate 2 from the marketplace, so an hour and almost 7gb later when it's done downloading
 I go to play it and I get a disk unreadable message wtf can I do there's no disk to clean or replace. It also did this to me with dishonored, I downloaded it to run faster but after I downloaded I got the same disk unreadable (disk was brand new that day)
 so I deleted it and it works fine now. Can anyone help me out with skate, I'm kinda rattled i just dropped over 200 on a new Xbox and then 20 on a game and it doesn't even work.

<p>Hello! &nbsp;Here's the best steps for fixing that. &nbsp;Please delete the game from your system, then clear cache and restart your console. &nbsp;Then find something else free from the marketplace (such as a game demo) that is about the same size. &nbsp;Go ahead and download
 that as well, and then re-download the game that is giving you the error. &nbsp;If that doesn't help, please start a fresh thread and we'll take a look!</p>

            <p>I wanted to launch the program that is contained in the file slui.exe.&nbsp; That is Microsoft's Software Licensing User Interface application, hence the name:&nbsp; slui.&nbsp; The file slui.exe is installed during the period when Windows is being installed on the computer.&nbsp;
 It goes into the directory C:\Windows\System32.&nbsp; If you open a command shell and type dir C:\Windows\System32\slui.exe you can see it is there right where I said it would be.&nbsp; So I wrote an application program in C# that works perfectly fine when you launch
 notepad.&nbsp; But when you try to launch slui.exe, it says that there is no such file.&nbsp; So your questions aren't germane.&nbsp; But I'll try to answer them.&nbsp; To reiterate, the problem is that Windows reports FALSELY&nbsp;that slui.exe is NOT in the directory C:\Windows\System32.&nbsp;
 If my code worked as I designed it I would call slui.exe to activate Windows.&nbsp; But I haven't reached that point yet.&nbsp; The third screenshot is part of a C# program.&nbsp; I obtained my copy of Windows through the Microsoft Software Developer's Network (MSDN).&nbsp; So
 I guess it is VL.&nbsp; Could be retail.&nbsp; Sure isn't OEM.&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; The computer is connected to a domain.&nbsp; I wrote a program that scans all the files on the C: drive and, it turns out, there are many files that do, in fact, exist but which are reported FALSELY to
 be non-existent.&nbsp; And that's a puzzling phenomenon.&nbsp; Happy New Year back to you!</p>

</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Well, no.&nbsp; Nobody has formulated an acceptable answer.&nbsp; The question is why slui.exe appears when queried by the shell's dir command but does not appear when
</span>queried <span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">by System.IO.File.Exists().&nbsp;&nbsp; Apparently I'm crazy because this cannot happen.&nbsp; But it does happen.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Microsoft established The Forums because technical questions arise ALL THE TIME and Microsoft is unable to respond satisfactorily to the vast majority of them.&nbsp; So Big Enterprise turns to its loyal customers to fill the gap.&nbsp; What often happens when I ask
 a question is a) I am regaled with&nbsp;one or more non-germane/non-responsive responses, or b) I am referred to a different group because the one I picked isn't up to the task, thereby putting the onus back on me to pose the question elsewhere.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes The Forums actually perform their intended function.&nbsp; For example, I learned that one is supposed to use cleanmgr.exe to remove Windows.old (the directory) because other means are extremely painful.&nbsp; Today I learned cleanmgr.exe isn't available
 by default in Windows Server 2012 R2.&nbsp; Inquiring minds would like to know how that design decision was made.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My comments today are about philosophy.&nbsp; People, managers especially, hate to get down and dirty with philosophy as this is the best of all possible worlds, try to look on the bright side, and things are not&nbsp;as bad as they seem.&nbsp; Well, sometimes they are
 as bad as they seem.&nbsp; Or worse.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 installs 32 bit from 64 bit media disc - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> godlyplexi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 installs 32 bit from 64 bit media disc</h2>
                    So, recently I bought a Windows 10 activation code, with the intent to upgrade my non-activated Windows 7 64-bit Professional to Windows 10 64-bit via clean install from a media disc created from the provided Microsoft ISO file for 64 bit Windows 10. I
 had a little trouble getting the disc to boot, but found my solution to that and got to the point to where I installed Windows. After I installed Windows, I checked my system settings and the like, and saw that it had actually installed 32-bit Windows. My
 question is, is there any way for me to fix this, as in, making my 32-bit installation a 64-bit installation? I'm not sure why it installed 32-bit, as my computer can very much so support it. I downloaded the ISO from the program provided
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
here</a>, and used a DVD Disc to make it a bootable disc. Also to note that when I dug through the ISO while trying to see why it wouldn't boot, I noticed that it only had bootia32.efi in the efi boot file, though I have no real clue if that's part of the problem.
 My system specifications are as follows:<br />
<br />
Motherboard: Asus Z97 A USB 3.1<br />
CPU: Intel i5-4690k @ 3.5GHz<br />
Hard Drive: Hitachi HGST 1TB 7200RPM<br />
Ram: 2x 4GB G-Skill Sniper<br />
OS: Currently, Windows 10 32-bit<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance for any help with this. I may not respond immediately, as I'm about to leave for work, but I will respond as soon as I return.

            I'm sorry, but I retract this question, I realized that while I was making the ISO for Windows 10, I accidentally chose 32 bit without realizing it. So I do not need help with this question anymore.

    <title>Folder encrypted on Win7 cannot be decrypted after upgrade to Win10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> biriger  say:</h3>
<h2>            Folder encrypted on Win7 cannot be decrypted after upgrade to Win10 and factory reset&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently upgraded my win 7 professional sp1, to win 10 pro, using the windows update app. Right after the upgrade, I have reset my computer to factory settings, wiping all the data &nbsp;(only on drive C) so I have a fresh start.
</p>
<p>The problem is that on my other drive I had an encrypted folder. I only used the windows encryption on Win 7&nbsp;(right click, properties, advanced, encrypt content to secure data).
</p>
<p>Now that I have Win 10, with all the personal data and settings removed from the C drive, I cannot access the folder anymore.
</p>
<p>I can see the files, but I cannot open nor copy them. </p>
<p>If I try to decrypt the folder or the individual files within, using the same method (unchecking "encrypt content to secure data") it asks for administrator permission (which I have) and when I press continue a new tab says that "An error occurred applying
 attributes to the file: ... Access denied"</p>
<p>I tried to change the permissions to full access on all users but did not help. I also tried to copy the files but also doesnt help.
</p>
<p>I know I should have probably created a pfx certificate or something that I can import to the new system but to be honest i didnt think of that.&nbsp; I found a certificate on my usb drive that must be from my Win7 system, but it asks for a password (that Im
 quite sure didnt set, since I tried all the passwords that I use) so I couldnt import it. However I dont know what kind of certificate is that, or whether it will be helping my problem or not.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know it is not easy to fix this, but the content of the folder is highly valuable, so please don't reply "forget about it", I am sure there is a solution if not more.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>ALL HELP IS HIGHLY APPRECHIATED!</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>Microsoft is not taking this seriously enough. &nbsp;Under Windows 7 before the upgrade I did not need the password nor anything to access the file because as the user who created it, I already had permissions. &nbsp;Now, after upgrading, I cannot access this file...
 as to the password, I might be able to recover it, "IF" it would even let me try. &nbsp; THIS is SYSTEM critical for me! &nbsp; I had extremely valuable and important information in this file and I am virtually crippled without it. &nbsp; I had no problems with accessing
 this file and had I known I would lose access I'd have temporarily converted it into a vulnerable format and re-introduced it to the Windows 10 version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Frankly, I'm appalled at the flippancy with which Microsoft is handling this problem! &nbsp;Right now I'm biting my nails to gain access to this file, and am pissed off to the extreme right now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was easy enough to create this file when I made it and put information into it, and although it asked me for a password when I made it, it never asked for it again, and therefore may have disappeared into the obscurity of my mind. &nbsp;When I upgraded I only
 "NATURALLY" presumed my security would be intact and made no provisions to ensure the one file I needed would still be available because frankly, I didn't think of it like that anymore as there was never any indication that it was encrypted after I made the
 file and used it over the last 7 years!!! &nbsp; I always "PRESUMED" that it was protected as "MICROSOFT SAID SO", but from my access as an administrator, if this was so, there was never any indication of it except for the moment of inception. &nbsp; THIS IS A HUGE
 HUGE **** MISTAKE! &nbsp;FOR BOTH OF US! &nbsp;One I cannot even fathom of letting go until I recover THAT file!!!</p>

            <p>Fortunately I did figure this out, thank goodness. &nbsp;I was going to try and revert to Windows 7; but, luckily I didn't have to. &nbsp; I had a vague memory about the cert created for the encryption.</p>
<p>Here's how I recovered.</p>
<p>First: When you created the certificate, Microsoft creates the personally signed certificate and prompts you for a location, filename, and optional password to store a copy of the certification.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The file ends in .pfx, If you don't know where it is, you should start looking for it, because it *was* created. &nbsp;Thinking security, you may have chosen a USB Drive, A CD, or an external drive of some sort, or even the hard drive itself (hopefully you didn't
 store it encrypted - if that's possible). &nbsp; &nbsp;Personally, I had also left a text file in the cert folder that contained a password clue only I would understand... (pats self on back)... after 3 tries, I got it right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Double click on the certificate file ending in .pfx (ex: Win7-2007-08 Personal Cert.pfx) &nbsp;I chose the defaults to re-install the cert. &nbsp;Afterward the files I had encrypted were available once again and all is good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For longevity, I created a new certificate, saved it, and encrypted the files.</p>
<p>To do this: &nbsp;Search for, and use the Windows 10 app "Manage File Encryption Certificates"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck, I hope this works for you!</p>

    <title>Cannot install Windows to SSD - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mcross75  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot install Windows to SSD</h2>
                    I recently purchased an SSD to replace my HDD boot drive&nbsp; The SSD was going to have my Windoes files on it and my HDD was going to have my larger files. At first I did some research and attempted to clone my drives using EaseUS and all my files were copied
 successfully. Unfortunately when I went into my BIOS and set the boot priority it would never boot off of my SSD, and would always resort to my HDD. So I tried unplugging my HDD to see what would happen, and it would keep reloading BIOS after I click save
 and exit. I then completely wiped windows from my HDD and attempted to reinstall it to my SSD but no dice. I still have a windows installation disk and tried that but whenever I try to set boot priority to the disk it sends me right back to BIOS. I know this
 is a lot of information but I need some help. Please!

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does your machine use UEFI Bios ?</p>
<p>If it does, the boot debvice is not the SSD or HDD... It is "WindowsBootManager"...</p>
<p>Some machines call this "Windows UEFI" instead...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using Legacy Bios, look to see if the OS partition on the SSD is marked "Active"...</p>
<p>Cloning may have copied the files, but failed to set the "Active" status of the partition...</p>
<p>
</p><p>As a note... another recent poster ended up having a bad SSD causing a similar problem...</p>
<p>The SSD worked, but Windows could not identify it as a boot device when selected...</p>
<p>There was a internal problem with the SSD's internal controller of some type..</p>
<p>Replacing it with a different brand resolved the problem...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that it was a HP S700 SSD...</p>

            Hi mcross75 
<br />
<br />Disconnect the old HDD for the moment
<br />
<br />Connect the SSD to the same SATA port the HDD was originally connected to
<br />
<br />Boot into BIOS
<br />
<br />Set SATA Mode to AHCI if it is not already set to that
<br />
<br />Then go into the Boot priority list can you move the Installation media to the top of the boot order?
<br />
<br />If not, do you see a Secure Boot option, if so, temporarily turn that off and see if you can change the boot order . .

<p>Hi Sheldon, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Notepad++ is different from Microsoft Notepad. Notepad++ is third-party replacement for Notepad with additional functionality.
<span>On the other hand, Microsoft Notepad is a </span><span>basic text editor</span><span> included in Windows and is installed by default under the Accessories program group.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When you view a file created in another text editor, font formatting applied may be missing
</span><span>in Notepad because it </span><span>does not include all font formatting information</span><span>. The font settings you can choose in Notepad are for display, and are only visible in Notepad.</span></p>
<p>

<h2>            Microsoft Store Causes Stutter, crashing and BSOD&#40;Downloading State of Decay Stuck&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I spent HOURS and multiple re-installes of Windows 10 Pro to get to this stage. The Microsoft store causes my mouse and audio to stutter until eventually the PC crashes or I terminate the app and windows store download service (wsappx)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I've had stability issues with 2 PCI WiFi cards now. One Gigabyte card and now the ASUS PCE-AC56 which has all of the latest driver and a clean install of WIndows 10 Pro 1803, fully patched to the day of posting. To get around this I'm testing power
 line adaptors to see if its the network card (again) as I had a BSOD that pointed to NDIS (network system file) however the issue seemed to be caused by a stuck State of Decay download, the Xbox app would also crash and cause BSODs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now usually I'd just think... I wont use this app. But I pay for a game pass to play these games, not get constant BSOD and crashing issues. Sea of Theives oddly seems fine, however when in a party on the Xbox app it sometimes BSODs or closes the app.
</p>
<p>So the question is, is the AC56 simply not compatible with 1803 and causing my issues, or is there a bug with the store/game?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will post the results of using the powerlines however I will not be keeping them as they run at 70mbps where as on WiFi i acheive 220mbps. System specs:</p>
<p>AMD Ryzen 7 1700x</p>
<p>Asus Crosshair VI Hero</p>
<p>32GB Gskill RAM running at 2800Mhz (downclocked to test stability)</p>
<p>Samsung 960 Evo M.2, 1TB Samsung 850 Evo, 500GB Crucial SSD</p>
<p>GTX 970</p>
<p>650W EVGA Platinum Rated Supernova PSU</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions or help would be great as I'm giving up and don't want to waste even more time and money on WiFi cards if I'm just going to have the same issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Ryan</p>

<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />AMD ATI - Download Drivers - AMD Support
<br /><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>
<br />
<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options. 
<br />
<br />If that does not work, I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Yes, not the best news you want to hear. These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Now, get ready to go back to your previous version. I recommend Windows 10 1703 because its the most stable and efficient release to date. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>

            It may help to look at the minidump files from the blue screen crashes. 
<br />
<br />Can you zip up the minidump files in the C:\Windows\Minidump folder and make available (provide link) via a public folder on OneDrive or similar site.
<br />
<br />Here's a link on using OneDrive:

<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping the minidump files copy the minidump files to another location such as a folder on the Desktop.
<br />
<br />Also, you do not necessarily have to zip up the minidump files, you can upload them one at a time.

    <title>How to link Microsoft accounts together. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnjam23  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to link Microsoft accounts together.</h2>
                    <p>I have four accounts now with Microsoft due to the exaggerated and entirely useless security features of the 'forgot password' dialogue (it literally asks you for your password, then for information that it doesn't actually want, no matter how much you enter
 it returns: 'not enough information to recover your password')</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first account: I made this for access to my Xbox, seeing no other use at the time for a Microsoft account, I created an account under a brand new @outlook(?) email. I thought it would persist in my machine but after investing hours into my Skyrim character,
 I was suddenly asked for a password which I had, by that time, forgotten. The 'reset password' feature asked for all the previous passwords I could remember (read, only password ever used). I was unable to recover this password because I didn't already know
 it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Two more accounts: These are under my main two emails, gmail and cox.net. The prior I use regularly and the latter is so full of junk and spam that I only check it when absolutely necessary. The Microsoft account linked to gmail is lost in the void, but
 the one with cox has been uncovered by a perilous expedition into my mind palace for the password.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The fourth is linked to a phone number because when I purchased a new laptop it gave me the option of creating an account under a phone number (which I opted for because I had no access to my accounts yet), without mentioning that it would then ask for a
 NEW email once the account was created (it says 'enter email... sorry that email is already taken' which is true, it's taken by me).</p>
<p>
</p><p>THIS IS A PROBLEM, since I want to have one unified account now (I see no way around logging into Microsoft-Something at every turn, might as well be consistent). How do I unify my life?</p>
<p>
</p><p>TLDR; How do I link my phone number account to my gmail account (who's password I do not have)?</p>

<p>You can put as many Windows on your screen as you want to and will fit there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, make sure that no window is full screen. If a window is full screen, double-click its title bar to make it smaller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once a window is no longer full screen you can resize it by dragging its borders wherever you want them. You can also move the entire window wherever you want it to be, by dragging its title bar.</p>

I need to find a solution to be able to use my old scanner CanonScan FB 620U on my new Win7 64 laptop.<br />
There are no Canon official drivers and Win 7 can't find a general driver even on MS update, so I ask if a solution is avaiable.<br />
Thanks.<br />

            <p>Hello MPavi,</p>
<p>According to the Canon site, "There is no driver for the OS Version you selected. The driver may be included in your OS or you may not need a driver. ". Neither is there any software nor updates. So the question becomes, do you need a driver?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try this:&nbsp; go to the Start Menu, All Programs, and select Windows Fax and Scan. Does the scanner app recognize your scanner? Can you use this built-in application to operate your scanner?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Post back here with your results and let me know how you fare.</p>

<li>Buy a new scanner which is compatible</li><li>Use Vuescan which provides its own drivers and can enable a scanner to run in either 32 or 64-bit as required..

            <p>I know what this is actually in reference to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is an application called BootSkin, able to change the boot logo that appears during initial OS boot-up (while Windows is first loading its' system components) on versions up-to and including Windows Vista.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far as I can tell, there is no equivalent for Windows 7 or newer, and it is somewhat moot anyway as most hardware that is considered required for effective use of these OS's is usually quick enough that the boot logo would not appear for more than a few
 seconds anyway.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, there is no way to change the boot skin for Windows 10 that I am aware of.</p>

<p>Hi Geordieron,<br />
<br />
•&nbsp;When do you get this installer error?<br />
•&nbsp;When did the issue start?<br />
<br />
In addition to Cari’s post you may also check if the Windows installer service is running on the computer.<br />
<br />
1. Go to "Start" - "Run" type "services.msc" and press on "Enter" button.<br />
2. Double-click on the service named "Windows Installer"<br />
3. Check the value in the "Startup type" field. If it's currently set to "Disabled", then this is the problem. Change it by selecting "Manual" from the drop-down box.<br />
Make sure that the service is started and set to Manual.</p>
<p>If none of the above work, you may also reinstall the latest version of Windows installer from the link:
