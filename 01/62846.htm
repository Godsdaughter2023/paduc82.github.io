<h2>            Incorrect Gamerscore&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>as you can see from the title, my Gamerscore shows incorrect in a lot of places.
<span>(Even on this site?)</span></p>
<span>(Even on this site?)</span></p>
<p>I've tried nearly everything to get it to show correctly: Play a new game <span>
(SSX, which doesn't show up correctly either.)</span>, changing my Gamer picture, changing my avatar, deleting and re-downloading my profile, and even completely resetting my Xbox 360.</p>
<p>The weirdest part is that it's not just my Xbox that's acting up, as I've reset it.
<span>(So I can't go about and re-get most of my achievements, as I've lost all my saves.)</span></p>

Also, I muted it because my friend
 didn't want to stay quiet while I recorded the video.)</span></p>
<p>I absolutely love Borderlands, and I've completed it entirely, getting 69 out of 69 achievements, yet it doesn't say I've completed any games?</p>
<p>Is it because of Xbox Live experiencing problems right now, or is it something else?</p>
<p>I'm not upset about the 500-ish missing Gamerscore, but I'd like to know why it's acting so weird.
<span>(I'd be fine with re-doing Borderlands, though I wouldn't want a full reset.)</span></p>
<span>(I'd be fine with re-doing Borderlands, though I wouldn't want a full reset.)</span></p>
<p>My friend says it's all weird for him as well.</p>
<p>I've gotten most <span>(If not all)</span> of my achievements online, and my Xbox 360 is connected pretty much all the time.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time, and I hope we can get this sorted out!</p>

<p>Ah, it appears to have fixed itself!</p>
<p>I'm not sure what happened, but I'm relieved it (sort of) works now!</p>
<p>My gamerscore is correct everywhere, though sadly, Borderlands 2 still says I've completed but 52 achievements.</p>
<p>I suppose I'll just wait until it fixes itself. I'd already waited 2 days, so I guess I'd recommend everyone who has the same problem to wait around a week.</p>

<p>@Mad Max oo7: It basically fixed itself. It took a long time for everything to be entirely correct though. (About a month.) I can't give any tips, sadly.</p>
<p>@VaSaMiAn: I'd suggest just waiting. It will sort itself out eventually. I didn't expect it to ever 'get fixed', but then suddenly everything was correct.</p>
<p>I know it's not exactly helpful, but I'm not sure how it works either. Xbox Live was made somewhere around 2002, so I suppose it's going through its difficult phase at the moment.</p>

</p><p>Since Microsoft's search engine is Bing that's why it's being suggested all the time.

<p>Yes, I understand that Bing is MS search engine, however I have said "no" i don't want it.&nbsp; It should not keep on asking me again and again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, I set up Skype on my parents computer, then they get all kinds of problems and I have to support them, because they accept default settings, and then are using MSN / Bing, so their normal searches and bookmarks etc are gone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's very intrusive and bad to constantly ask this, and have it checked by default.&nbsp; Any non-tech savvy person ends up with a homepage and search engine they don't want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ask once at first install, and don't ask again.</p>

<p>As I suspected, when asked to fix elderly relatives PCs and / or helping other non-technical people, it always turns out they have Bing installed, and using IE.... then they get upset that their searches don't work, can't find email, bookmarks are gone etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very intrusive, If I stood next to you saying "support another team, go on, go on, go on, go on, support another team..." constantly, and then one day you accidentally did, but didn't realise, you'd be pretty annoyed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Remove this intrusive mechanism ASAP.</p>

            I am not aware of any current versions of Skype (8.x/12.x) that have such a prompt. I am aware of only the classic versions of Skype (7.x) producing such a prompt during install. Since they no longer host classic versions of the software and have clearly
 put all their development efforts into the latest releases. It is highly unlikely that older versions of the software will be further developed/modified/released.

            The prompts, and default "install and use edge/bing as defaults" are baked into the software update process, installing to the latest version won't stop the software doing this.

<p>Yes, it looks like now you can only download skype for store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given that&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) skype "app" doesn't work for about 75% of users who've tried it (my sample group is only about 40, but still...)</p>
<p>b) skype app has the most horrible design and features (i have it on working on my phone, and had to read online to figure out how to make a call!)</p>
<p>c) Microsoft store doesn't work on windows 10 - I have a separate post about that, it just goes round in circles, and I have 4 windows PCs where it doesn't work, plus family and friends.</p>
<p>

                    <p>Original Tile: DAT files</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hi, I have just acquired a new camera, a FUJIFILM X-S1. I connected it to the computer running Windows ten. Although the computer recognized the camera, there were no pictures. So i delved a bit deeper and Fujifilm said i needed to down load a file! So i
 did what they asked, they omitted to say what kind of file it was, or i missed it, one of the two. I tried to open it, but the computer had trouble, so i opened it with Word. Well to cut a long story short; it was a DAT file, so now every time i download a
 clean copy of this file and put it on the desktop, it opens it with Word. How can i convert it back to a DAT file? Many thanks. M Ritchie &nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>For better assistance, please answer the below:<br />
1.&nbsp;What is the file name suggested by Fujifilm to download?<br />
2.&nbsp;Are you trying to open the DAT file by double click on it?<br />
3.&nbsp;What is the extension of the file which you downloaded and what is the extension after opening it with word?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform you that there is no such option to convert the DAT file to word. You can view the DAT file using word or notepad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Revert to us with the requested information, will be glad to assist you.</p>

            Hi, the actual file is Firmware, which i should have cut and copied on to memory card in the camera. Yes i did try to open it by double clicking, and obviously could not understand it hence trying to use 'Word'. I do not understand the term extension.
 I did not try to convert it, i was merely trying to read what it said, not knowing what the file it was. But it still shows on the desktop to be a word file and not a DAT file, so i presume it still reacts as a DAT file by what you say. But i have tried to
 cut and copy but i can still, not see any pictures from the camera. Thank you so much for your support. M Ritchie

<h2>            Windows10  - losing files.  I lost an excel file.  Very frustrating. Found it eventually but none of the search browsers could find it</h2>
                    <p>I am new to Windows10. &nbsp; Do not want to discuss all of the new problems that I am having.</p>
<p>I use excel to create files and usually save to desktop for quick access. &nbsp;"Master-May-16" is a file in excel that</p>
<p>I create to put in all of my daily and monthly items. It is my main file and I use it as a scratch pad for everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday - I was working on the file. Suddenly - I switched to excel and I closed the file. &nbsp;I had a strange feeling that this</p>
<p>file was lost. &nbsp;Decided to look for it and it was gone. &nbsp;Not on the desktop. &nbsp;None of the browsers in Windows 10 &nbsp;- fileexplore, etc could find it &nbsp;- 30 minutes later - I found it and immediately saved a copy in several places. THis creates a new type of
 problem.</p>
<p>I do not know what happened and this is scary to me because it disappeared into the vast cybespace on my laptop</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any idea what is going on??</p>

<p>
</p><p>I regret the inconvenience you are facing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform that just by closing the file Windows we will not delete the related the File applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have lost the data after the restart you will not be able to recover it now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform that in Windows 10 you have an option to take a backup of your data in order to overcome loss of data in future.</p>
<p>You can use File History to create a backup of your data.</p>
<p>To know more about it refer to: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/getstarted-back-up-your-files" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>onedrive duplicating my folders... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> michel chiangmai  say:</h3>
<h2>            onedrive duplicating my folders...</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>Again, onedrive is going crazy and is duplicating my main folder, full of subfolders. It's locking me out of all my files. I have windows 10, Office 365 home. I paused synch at the moment before I have 1000 copy of my folder, which I can't open anyway!&nbsp;
 Please don't ask me any question that will further delay the repair. Simply give me a step by step solution and then improve onedrive so this won't happen again to so many of us. I suggest you also add "onedrive" in the list of "Windows Topics" below since
 thousands of users have issues with it.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

            Hi Michel,
<br />This is Vijay, an Onedrive advisor. Try following one by one and check after each
<br />
<br />A. Reset - Try to reset your Onedrive (Please note that no data will be lost because of below step) 
<br />
<br />Windows Key+R &gt; Copy the below and paste and Enter
<br />%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe /reset
<br />
<br />After few minutes start Onedrive again. if this doesn't appear, copy the below and paste into Run and Enter
<br />%localappdata%\Microsoft\OneDrive\onedrive.exe
<br />
<br />B. Reinstall - If Reset doesn't work - Uninstall Onedrive and install latest version -
<br /> 
<br />Let's try to completely uninstall OneDrive: 
<br />
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Windows Powershell (Admin). 
<br />
<br />Copy the below line, paste into Powershell and Enter 
<br />taskkill /f /im OneDrive.exe
<br />This will terminate any OneDrive processe 
<br />
<br />Copy the below, paste into Powershell and Enter  
<br />
<br />if you’re using 32-bit Windows 10
<br />%SystemRoot%\System32\OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall
<br />if you’re using 64-bit Windows 10
<br />%SystemRoot%\SysWOW64\OneDriveSetup.exe /uninstall
<br />
<br />(Note - It is recommended that you create a backup of your registry before modifying registry as suggested below so that if you commit some mistake, you will be able to restore - <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/322756/how-to-back-up-and-restore-the-registry-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/322756...</a>)
<br />
<br />Now Windows Key+R &gt; Type Regedit and Enter
<br />Go to this path
<br />HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\OneDrive 
<br />You can remove all folders that include OneDrive numeric version (example - 18.172.0826.0010 folder)
<br />and from the Accounts folder, remove all the folders inside 
<br />
<br />After that restart computer and install One Drive latest version from this link:

<br />Do let me know if you require any further help on this. Will be glad to help you.

<p>I woke up this morning to find black screen and cursor. research told me to do f8 and follow directions...didnt work. So i made a Win 7 recovery disk on another computer and tried that - nope. Tried the Win 7 install disk and did get to the system recovery
 screen . Selected one from earlier this week, no good so I went back to one last week. It ran through the whole thing and gave me a "success" but Nay-Nay...still the black screen.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any ideas...</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Why is my screen black when I start Windows 7?<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/why-is-my-screen-black-when-i-start-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/why-is-my-screen-black-when-i-start-windows-7</span></a></p>
<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong></p>
<p>Saving any needed data and re-installing Windows 7 might be the best option though here are a<br />
few others.</p>
<p>You can save your files by putting the drive in another computer or an external drive case and then<br />
backing them up. Do so using several methods in a redundant manner. Of course a real computer<br />
shop or your System maker can help recover the files.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Can you access Safe Mode? Repeatedly tap F8 as you boot? If so you can try Control Panel<br />
- Device Manager - Display Adapter - Double Click on - Driver tab - click UPDATE driver -<br />
then Right Click on Device and UNINSTALL - REBOOT.<br />
<br />
A method to try to access the desktop (try in both regular&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;and Safe Mode) is to CTRL +<br />
ALT + DEL - Task Manager and on Process Tab find EXPLORER.exe and END PROCESS on it - then<br />
on Applications&nbsp;Tab - lower right - New Task - type in EXPLORER.exe. Safe Mode is reached by<br />
repeatedly tapping F8 as you boot up. CTRL + SHIFT + ESC also starts Task Manager.<br />
<br />
First check this thread in case its a simple one and if not come back to this thread.<br />
<br />

<br />
Black screen issues are extremely tough to repair and any fix is usually on a hit or miss<br />
basis. That there is no information on a black screen like there is on a blue screen just<br />
adds to the difficulty. Often using a restore point nor startup repair will have any effect.<br />
You can try a google to see suggested repairs some of which have worked however these<br />
cover a wide field of efforts.<br />
<br />
Here is a video of one fix.<br />
<br />

</span><br />
Here is another fix<br />
<span>http://blogs.pcmag.com/securitywatch/2008/12/the_mysterious_black_screen_of.php</span><br />
<br />
Do you have a&nbsp;Window 7&nbsp;Disk? You can try System Restore from it. If you do not have the<br />
disks your system maker will sell them cheap. Or try from Safe Mode if you can get<br />
there.<br />

<br />
You can create a Recovery Disk or use someone else's same version (to do the System Restore<br />
it only has to be bootable).<br />

Another method that sometimes works : In the Command Prompt of a Windows 7&nbsp;boot disk type :<br />
(type one line or copy and paste one line at a time and then hit enter - <strong>
do not type <br />
parenthesis or BOLD</strong>)<br />
<br />
c:<br />
<br />
cd\<br />
<br />
cd c:\Windows\System32\winevt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>(there is a space between cd and C: )<br />
</strong><br />
ren Logs&nbsp;LogsOLD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>(there are spaces between&nbsp;ren&nbsp;and Logs and&nbsp;Logsold)</strong>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
REBOOT to Windows<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</p>

            Just went trough a grueling 90 minute session with MS Support. They were not able to do anything. We ended up repairing Windows (reverting to the original Windows 8 Pro key), reinstalling Windows Media Pack and then disabling Windows update which may contain
 one of the patches that disables Windows activation. The suggestion was to wait few days - not installing any Windows updates and hope that MS will patch this. If not, call back.
<div>This is stupid as it is an obvious MS bug. In their zeal to disable non-legit Windows licenses, they also put all keys that came from Windows Upgrade offer in the same category. Once again I see how MS punishes us for installing a legit copy of Windows
 and treats all their customers as potential pirates.</div>
<div>I'll see if the patch will be released soon, if not - I will dump my legitimate Windows license and go with torrent install that does not have any of those issues.</div>
<div>Thanks for nothing, Microsoft.</div>

            <p>Just ran into same problem. My new Dell came with Win8, upgraded it to pro and then added media center to it. Now it says it is not activated and I can't activate it, will just point me to the web where it says I need to reinstall it.

            In short - *don't bother* if you can possibly live without it - MS licensing is *broken* in this scenario.
<div><br />
<div>I was coming from Windows Vista - purchased Windows 8 Pro Upgrade Edition on DVD. Installed - no issue. Requested a Windows Media Center upgrade key - got it, no problem. Installed Windows Media Center using that key - BANG - Invalid license keys, windows
 not licensed etc etc as others have reported.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My solution - Stick the Windows 8 Pro Upgrade Edition DVD back in, and re-install.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Works fine, just sucked 4 hours of my life down the drain. Microsoft - SORT IT OUT.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I will not be installing Media Center again and I urge others to avoid doing so to avoid this pain.&nbsp;</div>

            <b>slui.exe 4&nbsp;</b>doesn't work for me. There is no option for phone activation, only
<b>Activate with a new key</b> or <b>Buy a new key</b>.
<div><br />
<div>I bought a Dell laptop with Windows 7 in 2011.</div>
<div>Last year, I bought the Windows 8 pro upgrade.</div>
<div>Then, I got the free Windows Media Center.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Everything worked for one month. Then one day I come back home and discover the activation is no longer valid. There's no key in my system.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've got a legal key for Windows 8 Pro.</div>
<div>I've got a legal key for&nbsp;Windows Media Center.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Neither works. Windows insists that I need a special "Windows 8 Pro + Windows Media Center" key. This key, however, doesn't seen to EXIST!</div>
<div><br />
<div>I've already spent a pretty penny calling Microsoft support, and lost hundreds of dollars in wasted work hours. I had to call Microsoft support six times because I was put "on hold" and immediately disconnected. Each time I called, I had to go through
 ELEVEN STEPS of an automatic menu before I was allowed to speak to a human being. The guy was unable to help, but promised a technician would call me the next day. Unsurprisingly, nobody called. I spent eight hours (from 10 PM to 6 AM) trying to solve the
 problem, until I had to give up, because I've got WORK to do., that does not involve trying to solve Microsoft's blunders. And now, everyday, I've got that reminder popping up.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Last week, a friend made fun of me because his <i>pirated </i>Windows works perfectly, while my
<i>legal&nbsp;</i>Windows is still broken!</div>

    <title>Can&#39;t Connect Device To Wireless Network - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> danalap  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t Connect Device To Wireless Network</h2>
                    A few weeks ago I noticed an unknown device on my network. I did some research online on how to better protect my computer. I made some changes to some of the settings on my computer. Stupidly I didn't bookmark the page or print out the instructions I
 followed. I also reset my network SSID and password. I reconnected all my wireless devices to the new network, except my Wii. When I went to reset the Wii I thought perhaps I had the password wrong but I wrote it down when I changed it and had just reconnected
 my laptop, my iPhone and my wireless printer so how could I possibly had used that password successfully 3 times and now all of sudden it won't work for the Wii. To test my theory I disconnected my iPhone from the wireless network, typed in the new password
 again and now that device won't connect. My theory is that one of the settings I changed must have disabled unknown devices from being able to connect to the network. The changes were made to one of the "checklists" because I remember checking or unchecking
 a few things and now I'm at a loss. I'm afraid to reset my router in case I can't get back online with the laptop because of the settings on the network/computer.<br />

    <title>Windows 7 Pro Remote Desktop - problems re-connecting to console once - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pauly277  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Pro Remote Desktop - problems re-connecting to console once a connection is made.</h2>
                    I have a system running Windows 7 Pro with a dual monitor setup at my house. I connect to this PC from work. I have no issues connecting to the PC using RDP.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, when I return home and try to log back into the console at my house...I type my password in and it attempts to bring back my screen but it never does. It will just hang at "Welcome" &nbsp;forever.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The same issue happens if I happen to disconnect from my RDP session and try to reconnect. I get a message saying "Remote Desktop Services is currently busy. Please try again in a few minutes"</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Is this a known issue and will it be resolved by a security fix or driver fix? I have heard that it may be due to the Dual Monitor setup. (I've done this for years with XP Pro with no issues.)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The only way I can fix it is by holding the power button down to shut if off or pulling the plug. Even if I try to "Log off"&nbsp;remotely, it still gets into a hung state. This is a major issue if this is a bug...especially for companies that are using Windows
 7 for business...</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyone have any help or ideas? My video card drivers are up to date.</div>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>You may disable the complete <strong>Security Software and firewall on your computer</strong> and try connecting again.<br />
Do you have a firewall on your router as well, disable it and try connecting to remote desktop?
<br />
<br />
<strong>To Connect to a Remote Desktop (Local Area Connectivity)</strong> <br />
<br />
1. Go to Start&gt;All Programs&gt;Accessories&gt;Remote Desktop Connection<br />
2. Enter the Computer Name or IP address of the computer you wish to connect to.<br />
3. Click on Connect.<br />
4. For more connection options, click on Options<br />
5. Here you can save the connection profile, adjust display properties, run specified programs upon connection, adjust connection bandwidth, etc.<br />
For more information on specific tabs, click on Help.<br />
<br />
Also try troubleshooting this matter with a Clean Boot to see if we can pinpoint a program or driver that could be causing the issue you are experiencing.<br />
A Clean Boot allows us to start Windows with certain programs and drivers turned off or on by selection. By doing this through trial-and-error we can hopefully pinpoint a specific cause of this issue. Here is how to troubleshoot with a Clean Boot:<br />
Clean Boot Troubleshooting. <br />
1. Click Start, type msconfig in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; User Account Control permission.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; password, Or click Continue.<br />
2. On the General tab, click Selective Startup.<br />
3. Under Selective Startup, click to clear the Load Startup items check box.<br />
4. Click the Services tab, click to select the Hide All Microsoft Services check box, and then click Disable All.<br />
5. Click OK.<br />
6. When you are prompted, click Restart.<br />
7. After the computer starts, check whether the problem is resolved.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
If the issue is resolved check which third party program is causing the problem, referring the link given below:<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a>
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Reset the computer to start as usual. <br />
After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:<br />
Click Start, type msconfig.exe in the Start Search box, and then press ENTER. <br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click Continue. On the General tab, click the Normal Startup option, and then click OK.
<br />
When you are prompted to restart the computer, click Restart.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Also change the display&nbsp;resolution on your computer and check if the issue gets fixed.<br />
<br />
Important: If you have a firewall software running, that too has to be configured to allow communication to the port you opened in your router as well.<br />
Note: The above steps assumes that you're not part of a domain<br />

<p>Hello, thank you for contacting Xbox Customer Support. My name is Josh. How can I help you today?<br />
Josh: at 22:12:28</p>
<p>I hope I didn’t lose you yet. Are we still connected?<br />
you: at 22:30:28</p>
<p>Hi, certain games are not starting on my Xbox One. Specifically NHL 16 and Rory McIlroy PGA Tour. I've tried hard resets and I have just factory reset. Initially, the title card for the game would flash up, hang there, then crash and give an error message
 saying the game was taking too long to start. Now, after factory resetting, on NHL 16 when I try to open the game it says "Just getting your game ready" for a brief moment then another message saying "Something went wrong. Give it another try. If this happens
 again, let us know by entering 0xc03f6508 at xbox.com/errorhelp so we can investigate.<br />
you: at 22:31:02</p>
<p>I typed that error code in at Xbox.com/errorhelp and it did not find a matching error.<br />
Josh: at 22:13:33</p>
<p>Thank you for bringing this error on your games and would be glad to get it working for you.<br />
you: at 22:31:26</p>

<p>Cool! Let's reset the console's power supply first. Here's how:<br />
Josh: at 22:22:14</p>
<p>Disconnect and reconnect your console's power cable<br />
Josh: at 22:22:15</p>
<p>1.Turn off the Xbox One console by pressing the Xbox button on the front of the console for about 10 seconds until it shuts down completely.<br />
Josh: at 22:22:15</p>
<p>2.Unplug the console's power cable. Wait 10 seconds.<br />
Josh: at 22:22:15</p>
<p>Important Be sure to wait 10 seconds. This step resets the power supply.<br />
Josh: at 22:22:15</p>
<p>3.Plug the console power cable back in.<br />
Josh: at 22:22:15</p>
<p>4.Press the Xbox button on your console to turn on the Xbox One.<br />
you: at 22:41:03</p>
<p>ok, one moment<br />
Josh: at 22:23:24</p>
<p>Take your time, please.<br />
you: at 22:42:26</p>
<p>the power supply is completely unplugged but still has an orange light glowing<br />
Josh: at 22:24:55</p>
<p>Is it connected to a power strip or surge protector?<br />
you: at 22:43:38</p>
<p>no, it is completely unplugged. the cord that goes to the wall socket is pulled out of the power brick and the other end that plugs into the xbox one is disconnected<br />
you: at 22:43:54</p>
<p>the light is off now though<br />
Josh: at 22:26:28</p>
<p>Great! Now, please re-plug the power supply and turn the console back on.<br />
Josh: at 22:26:40</p>
<p>By the way, I can see here that this is the first time that you are contacting us regarding this concern. Don't worry. I'll make sure that this is the first and last time that you'll contact us about this.<br />
you: at 22:46:29</p>
<p>You're right. Not to be rude but I already have been thinking about selling my Xbox for a Playstation. Stuff like this is pushing me in that direction.<br />
Josh: at 22:29:28</p>
<p>Sorry to hear that, *************. No worries, we'll get this sorted out as quick as we can.<br />
Josh: at 22:29:39</p>
<p>By the way, just to clarify, have you downloaded the Preview App on your console before this happened?<br />
you: at 22:47:35</p>
<p>yes<br />
you: at 22:48:12</p>
<p>I uninstalled it and opted out but continued to have the problem though.<br />
Josh: at 22:30:43</p>
<p>So it's now uninstalled on the console?<br />
Josh: at 22:30:48</p>
<p>I mean the Preview.<br />
you: at 22:49:37</p>
<p>it is listed in my "ready to install" pane but is not actually installed<br />
you: at 22:50:35</p>
<p>I did the factory reset thinking that would fix the issue like most computers/phones/etc so now I have to reinstall/re-download everything<br />
Josh: at 22:32:57</p>
<p>Alright. Have you tried removing and re-downloading the profile from the console?<br />
Josh: at 22:33:15</p>
<p>Got it. That includes the profile right?<br />
you: at 22:51:51</p>
<p>I'm not sure what you mean by profile. The account I sign into to access online features? I'm the only user of this Xbox One.<br />
Josh: at 22:34:58</p>
<p>Yes, **********. Just to make sure, let's do it now. It will allow the account to sync back to the server and refresh the license on the console.<br />
Josh: at 22:35:07</p>
<p>1.Scroll left on the Home screen to open the guide.<br />
Josh: at 22:35:08</p>
<p>2.Select Settings.<br />
Josh: at 22:35:08</p>
<p>3.Select All Settings.<br />
Josh: at 22:35:08</p>
<p>4.Under "Account," select Remove accounts.<br />
Josh: at 22:35:08</p>
<p>5.Select the account that you want to remove.<br />
Josh: at 22:35:08</p>
<p>6.Select Remove to confirm.<br />
Josh: at 22:35:08</p>
<p>7.When you're finished, select Close.<br />
you: at 22:53:58</p>
<p>Done. I'm back to the account pane in the Settings menu.<br />
Josh: at 22:36:28</p>
<p>Alright. Have you re-added it back?<br />
you: at 22:54:48</p>
<p>Doing that now.<br />
Josh: at 22:37:06</p>
<p>Thank you.<br />
you: at 22:56:54</p>
<p>Should i continue through each prompt after signing in?<br />
Josh: at 22:39:23</p>
<p>Yes.<br />
you: at 22:57:31</p>
<p>Ok, I'm at the home screen.<br />
Josh: at 22:40:05</p>
<p>Awesome! Now, let's try to access the games again under My Games and Apps<br />
you: at 22:59:13</p>
<p>Same error with Rory McIlroy. "Something went wrong. Give it another try. If this happens again, let us know by entering 0xc03f6508". NHL does the same thing, same error code.]<br />
you: at 23:01:17</p>
<p>Edge opens with no issues, as does EA Access.<br />
Josh: at 22:43:53</p>
<p>Alright. I think this error has something to do with the Preview app installed on your account previously. Here's what we're going to do. Kindly install the Preview app again on your console so we can Report the error code on the Preview Dashboard App to
 get the necessary update to be worked out by our Preview team.<br />
you: at 23:02:21</p>
<p>I reported the error before I factory reset but ok, I'll do it again.<br />
you: at 23:03:10</p>
<p>I'm in the Xbox Preview Dashboard app currently.<br />
Josh: at 22:45:53</p>
<p>Got it. This time, after we reported it on the dashboard, kindly remain the Preview App installed so the update that is being conducted on the server will be reflected on your console.<br />
Josh: at 22:46:30</p>
<p>You'll be receiving a notification once the update is done and when the games are working properly on the console.<br />
you: at 23:04:48</p>
<p>I'm confused.<br />
Josh: at 22:47:57</p>
<p>Sorry for the confusion, *********. This report will actually inform our Preview team that your games are being affected by the Preview app on the console.<br />
Josh: at 22:48:18</p>
<p>That's the reason why we submitted the report on the dashboard so they can work this out immediately.<br />
you: at 23:06:50</p>
<p>So I have to wait until they put out a fix for this until I can play the only two games I actually play on this console?<br />
you: at 23:07:08</p>
<p>Despite having opted out of the previews and factory reset my console.<br />
Josh: at 22:50:06</p>
<p>Yes, ********. This is actually an ongoing system update for most gamers that installed the Preview app.<br />
you: at 23:08:32</p>
<p>So many console is worthless until your team decides to patch this.<br />
you: at 23:08:37</p>
<p>*my<br />
Josh: at 22:51:18</p>
<p>It means that we're not the only gamers currently affected by the updates being conducted on the server. even if we have uninstalled the Preview program, the server recognized your account as Preview ready console.<br />
Josh: at 22:51:58</p>
<p>Please be advised that some other functions are affected by the Preview program while other functions are working.<br />
you: at 23:10:28</p>
<p>I want a call from a supervisor. Nothing to do with you, but this is ridiculous.<br />
you: at 23:11:01</p>
<p>I'm not going to sit and wait around for them to fix this.<br />
Josh: at 22:53:27</p>
<p>The games affected may varies from the location where you at. Rest assured that once this is fixed by our system engineers, we'll make sure to provide any relevant compensation for the duration you don't have access with the games.<br />
Josh: at 22:53:54</p>
<p>Let me check for an available Supervisor for you.<br />
you: at 23:11:48</p>
<p>Ok<br />
Josh: at 22:56:29</p>
<p>I definitely understand your eagerness to speak with a Supervisor now. While I'm still looking for an available Supervisor, if you can give me a chance to explain the Preview update further, I would be delighted to assist you more.<br />
you: at 23:16:22</p>
<p>I understand the preview updates can cause bugs. I get it. What I don't understand is why there isn't an option to roll the console OS back to its last stable build release.<br />
you: at 23:16:43</p>
<p>Or why it is "pending" for me to opt-out of the preview program.<br />
Josh: at 23:00:46</p>
<p>It's actually an option to uninstall it as you have done previously. As explained earlier, the system already recognized your account as Preview enrolled profile and since the update is being done on the server (for the bug fix), the games might not be working
 even uninstalling the Preview app.<br />
you: at 23:20:13</p>
<p>So the "system" can't be manually changed to remove my account from the preview group?<br />
you: at 23:20:26</p>
<p>Kinda crazy it is taking so long for it to remove me.<br />
Josh: at 23:03:06</p>
<p>That what we're trying to do actually when we reported the issue from the Preview Dashboard.<br />
Josh: at 23:04:17</p>
<p>And the next thing we're going to do is to get hold of a Preview Agent from the forums so we can ensure that someone is fixing the account for us since they have full access with the preview program.<br />
you: at 23:22:15</p>
<p>I reported it yesterday.<br />
you: at 23:22:31</p>
<p>Guess I'll report it again. Must have misread what you typed.<br />
Josh: at 23:05:28</p>
<p>But we haven't initiated a chat session with a Preview rep on the forums.<br />
Josh: at 23:06:37</p>
<p>Here's the forums link so we can get hold of a Preview rep and work with them so the account will be refreshed from the system.<br />

<p>Josh: Were you able to submit the post? </p>
<p>you: no because when i copy and paste part of our chat convo here instead of having to explain the whole thing yet again, it won't let me edit out my personal information like my email address</p>
<p>Josh: Instead of copying the whole chat transcript. Please use this Reference Number: 1345298629</p>
<p>Josh: This will be a detailed notes on what we have conducted today and the solution steps done to fix the error code.

<p>Josh: I already saw it on my end. Once the post have been reviewed by the Preview Representative, they'll get back to you and provide details about the fix of the game error.
</p>
<p>you: So what is the turn around time on the Preview Representative getting back to me?</p>
<p>you: I totally understand that you're taking some risks of things being broken with beta enrollment but the ability to not be able to roll this back immediately is unacceptable.</p>
<p>Josh: Please allow our Preview team to review our chat transcript and expect a response within the next 24 hours. I'll be sending you a follow up as well once I have any feedback with our offline team also.
</p>
<p>Josh: I myself is asking that question, ******. Since the info hasn't been updated yet on the server and with Preview team answering this queries, let me apologize again for not being to get this sorted out at the moment.
</p>
<p>you: You have nothing to apologize for. You've been as helpful as you can be.</p>
<p>Josh: Rest assured that I'll work hand in hand with our offline team to get this fix as quick as we can.
</p>
<p>Josh: Thank you. I felt bad not being able to get it working today. I know the feeling and achievements when we play via the console. Appreciate your understanding.
</p>
<p>Josh: I mean, the happiness and fulfillment that we experience during game play is worth all of this conversation just to make it work.
</p>
<p>Josh: I know it took us more than an hour without any solid solution yet but we already cascaded the issue to the right support channel that has the capability to get this fix. Let me thank you again for taking the time in dealing this with me, ********.
</p>
<p>you: Ok, I would still like to speak with a supervisor over the phone. Like I said, nothing to do with you, I understand what's going on, but they need to make this right and be made aware of what their customers who are trying to help by being in the preview
 program have to do to have a functioning console when things go wrong.</p>
<p>you: If it is too late tonight. Tomorrow is fine.</p>
<p>Josh: I completely understand. If you're requesting a supervisor over the phone, we can schedule it up tomorrow.
</p>
<p>you: Ok</p>
<p>Josh: Alright. The best phone number to contact you? </p>
<p>you: ******************</p>
<p>Josh: Phone number noted, ************. I'll still send you a follow up email tomorrow just to check the current progress. Hope it's okay?
</p>
<p>you: Yes, that's fine. Thank you.</p>
<p>Josh: Appreciate it. Any clarification or questions before we part today? </p>
<p>you: Do you know what area code or perhaps specific phone number they will call from and also, what are their working hours so I know what time of day to expect a call. I usually do not answer unknown numbers.</p>
<p>Josh: That I'm not quite sure of. What about sending you an email first to notify that they're about to call you?
</p>
<p>you: That will work.</p>
<p>Josh: Perfect! Alright. All set for tomorrow? </p>
<p>you: Yes. Thank you for the support you were able to provide.</p>
<p>Josh: Thank you. I highly appreciate your time and you deserve all the help.</p>
<p>Josh: Looking forward to hear from you tomorrow. </p>
<p>Josh: Have a great night ahead!</p>
<p>you: You're welcome. Have a good one.</p>
<p>Josh: You too. Bye for now. </p>

            Hi Sharon,
<br />
<br />
<br />If you have a problem seeing other PC's in the Network Section in File Explorer:
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type Services and hit Enter
<br />
<br />When the Services app opens, scroll down to find the following services, then double click each one in turn, set their startup type to Automatic and start the service if necessary
<br />
<br />1. Function Discovery Provider Host
<br />
<br />2. Function Discovery Resource Publication
<br />
<br />3. SSDP Discovery
<br />
<br />4. UPnP Device Host
<br />
<br />Save that and close the Services app
<br />
<br />That's It!
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />If you get a Network Credentials popup, you should be able to turn off that requirement . . . 
<br />
<br />Open Control Panel 
<br />
<br />Go to Network and Sharing Center 
<br />
<br />Select Change advanced sharing settings in the left pane 
<br />
<br />Expand the network you want to disable password protected sharing on by clicking the down arrow on the right of the profile
<br />
<br />Select 'Turn off password protected sharing' and then click Save changes.       
        </p>

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Check for malware thoroughly, then run CleanUp as indicated below - then if needed run StartUp<br />
Repair. There is also a link for&nbsp;a Repair Installation if needed (allows you to keep programs and<br />
<p>If you need to check for malware here are my recommendations - these will allow you to do<br />
a thorough check and removal without ending up with a load of spyware programs running<br />
resident which can cause as many issues as the malware and maybe harder to detect as the<br />
cause.<br />
<br />
No one program can be relied upon to detect and remove all malware. Added that often easy<br />
to detect malware is often accompanied by a much harder to detect and remove payload. So<br />
its better to be overly thorough now than to pay the high price later. Check with these to an<br />
extreme overkill point and then run the cleanup only when you are very sure the system is clean.<br />
<br />
These can be done in Safe Mode - repeatedly tap F8 as you boot however you should also run&nbsp;<br />
them in regular Windows when you can.<br />
<br />
Download malwarebytes and scan with it, run MRT, and add Prevx to be sure it is gone.<br />
(If Rootkits run UnHackMe)<br />

    <title>Inbox Windows Live Mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> deklanm  say:</h3>
<h2>            Inbox Windows Live Mail</h2>
                    <p>I deleted 500 or more emails yesterday and while doing so I pressed a button which deleted absolutely everything including all my Storage Folders.&nbsp; I went into different views etc. and pressed different buttons and eventually I reinstated everything by pressing
 the button down in the bottom left hand corner of the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today however, I noticed that my Inbox has all the emails that I deleted yesterday and removed from the Deleted Items Folder.&nbsp; I was wondering if I have changed the View yesterday while trying to fix the original problem, however, I can't work out how to
 remove those deleted emails from my Inbox without having to go through them all again and deleting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how I might be able to change the view to remove those deleted items if that is all it might be to fix the problem?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>My&nbsp;first observation would be that changing the view of messages stored in Windows Live Mail will not change the messages themselves - only the way they're displayed in the program. Changing the view won't delete messages or bring back messages that have
 been deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Deleting a message is a two-phase operation in Windows Live Mail. The first - selecting a message, then using one of the options available to delete it - will normally simply move the message to a
<em>Deleted items</em> folder, whence it can be retrieved if you change your mind. I say
<em>normally</em>, because it is possible to delete a message permanently by selecting it and pressing<em> Shift-Delete
</em>on your keyboard. This bypasses the <em>Deleted items</em> folder, but it will require confirmation before it's implemented:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/734e1c2b-d42e-4755-8ce2-8e24e0e0ee93?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/734e1c2b-d42e-4755-8ce2-8e24e0e0ee93?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>Pressing buttons more-or-less indiscriminately is not a particularly fruitful way of proceeding. The only one I can probably identify is&nbsp;<em>the button down in the bottom left hand corner of the screen,
</em>which suggests that you were viewing the program in some other display mode than Mail, so when you clicked on the Mail icon, you were returned to the Mail window. The icon you clicked on was the first of five, correct?</p>
<p>
</p><p>To delete messages from your inbox, select them and press the <em>Delete</em>&nbsp;key on your keyboard. This will move the selected messages to the
<em>Deleted items </em>folder. To get rid of them for good, right-click on the <em>
Deleted item</em><em>s</em> folder name and select<em> Empty 'Deleted items' folder</em>.

            Hi Christo, if Windows 10 was previously installed and activated on that PC, then this will be no problem . . .
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time, you will not need a Product Key, Activation will be automatic and it will not cost you anything !
<br /> 
<br />You should just clean install Windows 10 rather than upgrading from Windows 7. This will have 2 benefits, if you have to reset again, it will reset to Windows 10, not 7 and your system will be more responsive and reliable . . . 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues

<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

    <title>What is the correct &#34;Account&#34; for the Diagnostic Policy - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> timmyjaydub  say:</h3>
<h2>            What is the correct &#34;Account&#34; for the Diagnostic Policy Service to run under&#63; the Account Specified is different from other Services in the same Process</h2>
                    What is the correct "Account" for the Diagnostic Policy Service to run under? This is a Windows Service that "enables" Windows Diagnostics. When I try to run Network Diagnostics the system indicates that the Diagnostic Policy Service is not running. Attempting
 to start the Service generates a System Error Event that says that "the Account Specified is different from other Services in the same Process". The Diagnostic Policy Service is currently configured to run as the "Local System Account".<br />

<p>
</p><p>I tried the fixes that were listed for this problem (mainly involving changing default printer) and none helped.&nbsp; I have a 4 1/2 year old Fujitsu lifebook and Windows 7 with Office 2013.&nbsp; The cursor flashing is constant.&nbsp; It happens on the desktop. It happens
 in all programs. Right now it is happening in Firefox. My default printer is now set to OneNote.&nbsp; Changing default printers didn't help at all.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Is there any chance this is caused by a Windows Update?&nbsp; It seemed to start after I let some automatic updates install.</p>

            <p><span>Hello Herman, </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I can understand the inconvenience caused to you. I will certainly help you with this issue.
</span><span>This issue can be caused due to third-party application conflict or virus infection.
</span><span><span>Let’s try to identify the actual cause and troubleshoot accordingly.</span></span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to try the following methods:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Method 1: </span></span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 1:</span> </strong>
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Boot the computer in safe mode and check if the issue persists.
</strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let’s boot the computer in Safe Mode and check if issue reappears. Safe mode is a diagnostic mode that starts your computer in a limited state. Only the basic files and drivers necessary to run Windows are started. The words&nbsp;Safe Mode&nbsp;appear in the
 corners of your monitor to identify which Windows mode you’re using.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to the link below on instructions to get in safe mode.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Windows 8 Safe mode</span></span></strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Step 2</span></strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">:</span>
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If issue does not appear in safe mode, there could be possibility of some background programs conflicting with the smooth running of the computer. To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start computer by using a minimal set of
 drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "<strong>clean boot</strong>." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>

</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> After troubleshooting, refer to this section ‘<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>’.</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Method 2:</span></strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Run a full computer scan with the Microsoft Safety Scanner</span></span></strong><span><span><span>to make sure that the computer is virus free.</span></span></span></p>
