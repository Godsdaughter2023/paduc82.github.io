    <title>credant disk encryption causes Windows 7 SP1 to fail to install, - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            credant disk encryption causes Windows 7 SP1 to fail to install, system to indefinately crash</h2>
                    Does anyone here use Credant disk encryption in their corporate environment?&nbsp; If so, have you tested installing Service Pack 1 on a Windows 7 system that already has Credant, and if so what was your result?&nbsp; We're finding that systems with Credant disk
 encryption cannot successfully get the service pack installed. It will start to install, do the initial reboot, and will indefinitely sit there at that point stuck on the "Starting Windows" icon.<br />
<br />
I came across a Technet thread on SP1 installation failures where someone mentioned removing some file copies from the c:\windows\winsxs\profile.xml file, but that doesn't fix it. When I do this, the error changes from sitting on "Starting Windows" to a Bad_System_Config
 BSOD.&nbsp; I also tried someone's recommendation to update the registry key to delete then recreate a registry key (Reg add "HKLM\BaseSystem\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager" /v SetupExecute /t REG_MULTI_SZ) .. that doesn't seem to be making any difference.<br />
<br />
So far, our recourse on systems with this issue is to reimage the system and recovering the decrypted files. Not a very good solution.<br />
<br />
SP1 installs fine if the system does not have Credant, and Credant installs fine on a system that already has SP1. It seems the root of the issue is 'probably' a file somewhere that's being encrypted by Credant, then upon reboot Windows is unable to read the
 encrypted version of that file. I don't know if it's that it's failing at the point where decryption should be working on the system, and it's just not working at all, or if it's trying to copy files prior to the encryption services being started up.
<br />
<br />
Even outside of the Credant-specific realm, are there steps prior to installing SP1 that I should be taking that might assist this? For example, do I have to exclude the directory c:\windows\winsxs\ or something like that? I'm not saying this directory already
 is or isn't excluded, but I'm wondering if Microsoft has any "non-bitlocker" type information on best practices of implementing disk encryption as far as what exclusions to make (and if so, is anything like that documented anywhere by Microsoft?).<br />
<br />
We're running Credant's CMG Shield for Windows 6.8 (64 bit)<br />
<br />
Thanks for any info<br />

            <p>Who marked Naman's response as an answer.&nbsp; Seriously?&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not a very happy camper regarding Credant.&nbsp; This software is not only expensive monitarily, but also expensive with regards to all of the engineering workarounds that we have to do to manage the computer systems that are encrypted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We cannot install software on the systems when no user is logged on for the simple reason that it is user-based encryption and we don't have time to test every install and investigate all of the files that an update is going to touch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm wondering if there's a Credant support group somewhere where we can share our troubles and shoulders to cry on.&nbsp; We could hire a separate technician to specifically work on Credant workarounds and he would be busy consistently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for your issue, I'm glad we're rolling out SP1 in our build process for Win7, since it's being layed down prior to the encryption actions.&nbsp; But I'm sure this will bight us in the tail soon enough.&nbsp; SP2?</p>

            <p>I am having lot of problem with Credent software. I am consultant and i try to use my external drive at my client software it forced me to install Credent and then I did but it does not work to all the version of windows. I called up the company they said
 I should call the client to buy the software. Helloo, Why would client buy software for consultant and I can not access my own files in windows 7 now. There is no downloads which you can use so that we can fix our own issues.
</p>
<p>This software is should not be sold without validation of all the users and should have proper&nbsp;customer service and free downloads who is a user.</p>

            <p>Them asking you to properly license the software is not unreasonable.&nbsp; The bigger problem is the client who let your drive become encrypted should have either installed the software or not encrypted it.Do they have a policy dictating that you as a non-employee
 of said company can come in with an external hard drive and hook it up?&nbsp; Many companies would prohibit this outright</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if you were properly licensed, that wouldn't resolve your issue as you would still need the client's encryption key to decrypt the contents. If I were you I'd take the drive back to the client and hook it back to the same machine (keys change by machine)
 and then copy the data to another destination, then overright the whole drive again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>BTW never found a solution to this problem though we've moved on past the issue itself as far as I know.</p>

<h2>            Windows Blue Screen at Startup, Error 00x000185</h2>
                    <p>A few years ago, I won a touch screen computer, HP 23 d040t (aio touchscreen) from a blog I read. It was a secondary computer as I had a laptop I used. It was a windows 8 which I upgraded to 8.1.<br />
<br />
One day I as I was using it, it just shut off for no reason. I tried everything from turning it on, going on forums, as I am doing now and buying a new ac adapter. It was dead. I called HP but they told me it was 17 days from its warranty so they couldn't help
 me.<br />
<br />
A few months ago, in the beginning of may I decided to get someone to fix it. He switched the motherboard with another HP all in one and it seemed to be working just fine. He gave me a 60 day warranty. Right after that I noticed at startup it would do some
 type of fixing every single time so I decided to "refresh" the computer.<br />
<br />
But after that it told me my product key was invalid. I don't know how because my computer came from HP the company. I tried to call the product key people at windows to validate it but she told me my key was blocked and I needed to buy a new one. I told her
 I don't know why because there is nothing wrong with my key. The computer had also reverted to windows 8 and wouldn't let upgrade to 8.1 because it couldn't authenticate my key.<br />
<br />
The last couple of days my computer has a blue screen when it starts up. It tries to repair itself but cannot. It tells me it has error 00x000185.<br />
<br />
I don't know what to do? It tells me that it needs to have a dvd or usb to repair its files. I cannot repair it because I don't have a DVD with the computer. Should I just repair it by buying a repair dvd on ebay. Should I just pony up and buy anew authentic
 windows 10 DVD? I can buy the authentic one but I need to know if this computer is even worth it as its given me nothing but problems.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>A.</strong> Generally, an end user can upgrade or replace all of the hardware components on a computer—<strong><em>except</em> the motherboard</strong>—and still retain the licence for the original Microsoft OEM operating system software. If the
 motherboard is upgraded or replaced for reasons other than a defect, then a new computer has been created. Microsoft OEM operating system software cannot be transferred to the new computer, and the licence of new operating system software is required.</p>
<p>If the motherboard is replaced because it is defective, you do <em>not</em> need to acquire a new operating system license for the PC
<strong>as long as the replacement motherboard is the same make/model or the same manufacturer's replacement/equivalent, as defined by the manufacturer's warranty.</strong></p>

</p><p>If you bought and installed your own Retail&nbsp;Windows License, you can change Motherboards, but doing that will now require a Phone Activation and you should not follow the Auto prompts, but hold on for a real person to explain to.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Sorry for the inconvenience caused.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>From the above description I suspect that deleting the files from the particular location could have deleted any of the files which needed to uninstall the
</span><span>AutoCAD 2007.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So I suggest you to check whether any uninstaller tool is available in the Autodesk website.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If it is not there I suggest
</span><span><span>you to perform a System restore and see if it helps.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>System Restore is a way to undo system changes by using restore points to return your system files and settings to an earlier point
 in time without affecting personal files of users. System Restore uses a feature called
<strong>system protection </strong>that regularly creates and saves information about your PC's drivers, programs, registry, system files, and settings as restore points.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If you are having recent problems with Windows 10, then you could do a System Restore to restore Windows back to an earlier point in time, called a restore point.</span></p>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp; </span>
<p><span><span>Please refer the link below and refer the section
<strong>Restore from a system restore point </strong>and see if it helps:</span></span></p>

    <title>Surface Pro 4 screen shakes, blurry and double printed lines - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jagnavy1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 4 screen shakes, blurry and double printed lines</h2>
                    <p><span>My wife got me a surface 4 as a Christmas present and it had issues right out of the box.
</span></p>

<p><span>First the key board needed a replacement as it would work one day and then stop working a day or two later.</span></p>

<p><span><span>The next issues started about a month later; screen shakes, blurry and double printed lines and I had to contact their support center to try to correct.<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>That is always a wonderful experience, (joke). Well after spending hours on the phone with remote support and turning different things on\off and back on again uninstalling, reinstalling it would start to work, but
 only for a while.</span><span><span>&nbsp; </span></span><span>Well this goes on until the warranty expires and now is just site in my desk drawer.
</span></span></p>

<p><span>It all started after their software upgrades and I have been watching for that one post (3 years) that will resolve it.</span></p>

<p><span>I’m not sure what the issue is now or how to fix it.
</span></p>

<p><span><span>Is there a fix?<span>&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Or should I forget it and buy a Dell?
</span></span></p>

<p><span><span>Not going on 3 years of disappointment…….<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>

            I just started having a similar problem but it is the lower third of the screen, and of course the Surface is out of warranty.&nbsp; It stops when the screen or keyboard is touched. It occurs whether the keyboard is attached or not, as soon as the device is
 started up. It occurs with the program manager window open. It just started a couple days ago, and was intermittent at first but is now almost constantly flickering. I have backed up my files and reset my device. I do not have many apps on my device - Chrome,
 Adobe PDF viewer, iTunes and a password manager.<br />
<br />
This is obviously disappointing. The device is less than two years old and over the last few days has become impossible to read anything on. It was purchased from a MS store in Boston, and up until this point I have been happy with it and even recommended it
 to other students. Now I find myself embarrassed and let down, because a quick search of the internet suggests that this is a common problem with no solution other than another $450 to repair something that basically seems like an inherent hardware flaw.<br />
<br />
I would like my device repaired or replaced by Microsoft for a reasonable cost.&nbsp;

<p>Had the same type of issues and if is cost $400 to&nbsp;repair a device&nbsp;then MS PC's of any type will not be considered....&nbsp; It looks to me that MS (just like auto air bags) knew about the problem and had their over seas tech center do anything but recommend
 the proper fix. It use to be MS would try a sell and repair contract when the warranty was ending but&nbsp;not this time.&nbsp; They knew about the issues.&nbsp; The just decided to roll the dice and not admit to a problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>MY ADVICE TO ANYONE NEEDING TO&nbsp;BUY A PC, 'DON'T GET ANYTHING FROM MIRCOSOFT'!&nbsp; If you do buy two, one to back up the other while it is in for repairs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI - MY wife got me this because I got her an IPAD with a services contract.&nbsp; She has never had an issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I too was happy with my with the Pro 4 but is was shored lived and I too feel foolish for recommending it to others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would pay the 400 to get it repaired but the Web is full of everyone reporting problems about there brand new units and they are&nbsp;replaced with a refurbished unit, only to have more issue with that unit.</p>

<p>I feel for you. I have a similar experience with my SP 4. Screen started jittering after the warranty ran out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then paid for a device replacement, which arrived unusable out of the box; it would not boot out of the UEFI boot screen no matter what I did as per MS recommended. Now i am arranging for replacement of the replacement.</p>
<p>Very disappointed with MS, but since i paid good money for the replacement, have to see it to the end.</p>
<p>Hoping for the best...</p>

    <title>Windows 10 automatically terminated program in use claiming low - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> -vltfv-  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 automatically terminated program in use claiming low memory. RAM wasn&#39;t low at all. How to disable this behavior&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I've got Windows 10 Pro 64b, clean install almost 2 weeks old. I've got plenty of RAM (16Gb), however windows seemed to disagree. I don't like disagreements so I want to know how to put the OS back in line. I was doing my usual stuff, when from a millisecond
 to the other a warning message pops-up about some low RAM or heavy RAM usage with two options, one being close program and the other not to. Well how useful given that windows just terminated the very program I was using as soon as the pop-up appeared! Good
 thing it was nothing important and easily recoverable, but what if it wasn't? What's hilarious is that when I went to check the already open TaskManager, I see that RAM usage went from around 10Gb to 9Gb after the incident, and the program in use wasn't using
 much RAM compared to several other ones. Seriously? I've got 16Gb RAM for a reason, no? And I know I'll soon be using far more RAM than I'm using now, and with actually important work, so I need to know how to disable whatever is responsible for this ridiculous
 behaviour.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please excuse my frustration and rudeness, I'd rather discharge it on whoever thought this kind of resource automatic override was a good idea. Correct me IF I'm wrong and thanks in advance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update: looking at the Taskmanager again, if we take into account some 4.5Gb of RAM in standby, then it might have hit the 16. Still, right now it's only using half of the page file (page pool?), and isn't cached data supposed to be expendable? At least
 I don't understand why the OS would bloat the RAM with 4.5Gb of standby and terminate a 1Gb-using active program instead of freeing up space from a hypothetically useful cache... or just filling up the page-file (I think I got 3Gb allocated for page-file).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Edit: In case anyone is wondering, I ran the Windows Memory Diagnostic last week just in case.</p>

<p>I'm using Xp and have upgraded for Outlook 2007 to 2010. 3 issue coming upo and I'd really appreciate any suggestions:</p>
<p>1.The C:\Users file appears to&nbsp;be missing - does this make sense please?</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; Windows 7 and Vista use the C:\users while XP uses the C:\Documents and Settings .</p>
<p>2.Also, I cannot find the archived files and contacts I had previously on my laptop;</p>
<p>Search for *.pst and make sure you have enabled showing hidden files and folders under Control Panel | Folder Options | View and include hidden files and folders in the Advanced Search options.</p>
<p>3. There are a large number of files on&nbsp;my C:\Windows&nbsp;directory showing&nbsp; a folder logo and then a title in blue, faded script like this&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; $NtUninstallKB911927$.</p>
<p>Ignore them.&nbsp; These are updates that were applied to your computer.&nbsp; They are needed should you ever need to uninstall or reinstal an update.</p>
<p>I'm reasonably IT literate but this is beyond me.</p>
<p>Next time ask in a forum related to Outlook and not in a forum devoted to Windows 7 files.&nbsp;</p>
<p>steve</p>
<p>Any help much appreciated.</p>

Thanks for the suggestions. I had tried this earlier, but nothing worked. Seems I have to get the drive replaced.

            <p>Hi James,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The CD is still stuck in the drive. I have tried all the diagnostics tests provided by Dell. All of them say that the drive is functioning well and has no problems. I wonder why is it not ejecting the CD out?</p>

            <p>Hey Shyamala,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Traditional disk drives had a small hole under the tray. A straightened paper clip could be used to push through that hole and manually eject the tray. Unfortunately, I haven't seen a similar feature on a laptop with a slot CD/DVD drive.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since this problem is occurring with a piece of hardware on your computer, please reach out to Dell for further support and/or hardware troubleshooting.</p>

            <p>Most likely cause is the the BIOS configuration is invalid and it needs to reset it to default in order to boot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is probably due to the battery which maintains the CMOS memory&nbsp;being flat. If&nbsp;it is a standard PC there will be a flat silver coin shaped battery somewhere on the motherboard, most commonly a CR2032 cell but the part number is frequently visible on
 the top of the cell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you have identified the part and obtained a replacement turn off the computer, remove the old cell by push the metal finger that is holding one edge down, clip in the new cell, reboot and go into the BIOS settings. You will probably have to reset the
 date but most others can stay as default.</p>

<ul>
<li><span>I am running windows 7, 64 bit, using bootcamp, on a new macbook pro laptop (detailed information on hardware below). The problem I am running into is that, several times every day, the built in display as well as any external monitor connected
 to the laptop, just go blank. As if someone had pulled the power plug on them. I can still hear the laptop's hard disk running and the key board lights are on but am unable to get the display to come back. The only way to get the display working again is to
 do a hard reboot.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I have upgraded the NVIDIA drivers to the latest ones released yesterday: 8.17.12.6063, however they problem persists. Have tried other versions of the drivers from the NVIDIA website as well, to no avail.<br />
<br />
Ran extended hardware test on the laptop but that did not divulge any problems either.<br />
<br />
Reinstalled windows 7 but the problem persists.<br />
<br />
The problem does not exist if I reboot into the Mac OSX side of the laptop.<br />

            Okay, this is going to suck, but since no-one else is replying, you could try this. Could you try a 32-bit version of Win7 and see if you get the same problem.&nbsp; If not, then we know it's the 64-bit version that's giving you grief.&nbsp; If the problem is still
 there, could you possibly try Windows Vista - 64-bit then 32-bit. (I'm trying to eliminate different versions working from the top down.)&nbsp; Hopefully you won't have to go to XP. :-)&nbsp;

            <p>I've seen similar on a desktop, where the display goes white, found that by switching off the monitor then switching it back on, brought it all back.</p>
<p>I've not been able to discover what is causing it.</p>

<h2>            timezone will not update automatically</h2>
                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I travel around the US a lot, moving in and out of&nbsp;different timezones (Pacific, Mountian, Eastern, Etc. I have the internet time sync set up&nbsp;using "time.windows.com' but my time zone does not update or sync with the time. Example: I traveled from Pacific
 time to Mountain time recently, but my laptop's time was still on Pacific time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is there a way to get the time zone to automatically update to the correct time zone, like my Blackberry does?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Much&nbsp;Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I don't think that there is but you can show an additional clock in a different time zone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go to the clock in the Notification area, right click and select 'Adjust date/time'</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Click on the 'Additional Clocks' tab, and select the clock options that you want.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is done like this because changing the computer's time can adversely affect program and processes which rely on the clock being right..

            Hi Lori.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />2) Then try adjusting the Screen Resolution to see if it fits.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg, </p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thank you so much for answering and so soon.&nbsp; You are a great and wonderful help!!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is a new (June 20118) Lenova, on MS 2010, and 2nd monitor an LG 25AM56-P that I used before on a version 8 for work (don't have any longer).&nbsp; I downloaded &amp; installed the driver for that model of LG previously but it didn't do anything.&nbsp; A quick
 review of the log wasn't encouraging, not sure it worked &amp; needs an uninstall before doing it again (found it all with your info).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a setting in the regedit I can modify for the screen size just in case none of my fixing will work?&nbsp; I can't change it from the screen, it's fixed.&nbsp; I have used regedit a lot before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm wondering about the uninstall of things.&nbsp; I found the Driver Date of 6/21/2006 for version 10.0.17134.1 for MS Windows. &nbsp; I found "Generic PnP" Monitor twice listed under Monitors with the 6/21/2006 date.&nbsp; I think I should remove those entries, agree?&nbsp;
 Then I can re-connect the monitor and install the Driver again for the LG Monitor.&nbsp; I'm hoping that will fix it, agree or any thoughts?</p>

            Hi Lori.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.
<br />
<br />So download the latest Video/Display driver from the Lenovo Support Downloads web page here:  <a href="https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://pcsupport.lenovo.com/us/en/</a>
<br />
<br />Find the exact Lenovo Model or Serial Number at the above site using the AutoDetect feature or by choosing the PC type and then inputting the Serial or Full Model Number off of the Sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check that you also have the latest chipset, BIOS, display, network, bluetooth, USB and all other drivers, compared to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start button.  Take all the time you need to do this, and I'll be here to help as needed. 
<br />
<br />The monitor isn't as important as the display driver and is usually updated by Windows Update, so do expedite those but give preference to the ones you find on the Lenovo downloads page if they are newer.

            Hi again Lori -
<br />
<br />Any Update on the resolution problem?  
<br />
<br />If no Screen Resolution will fit with the latest or best working Display driver, then you can also try playing with the Scaling in the System &gt; Display settings.  Try a Custom setting of around 117% to start.

<h2>            My wifi adapter disappeared from &#34;Network Connections&#34; after update, but not &#34;Device Manager&#34;</h2>
                    <p>After a recent update, I lost my wi-fi connection. The adapter is not even visible in the "Network Connections" screen. It is visible on the Device Manager, which says it is working and has all the current drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>I am using: </strong>Windows 10 home 32 bit (running on a 64 processor) v. 1803 os build 17134.137. This is on an Intel Compute Stick. It has a WAN Miniport, driver 10.0.16299.15</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I have tried until now:</p>
<ul>
<li>Uninstalling the driver in the device manager and restarting. This had no effect.</li><li>Restoring to an earlier version of windows. v.1709 OS build 16299.431 No effect</li><li>Updated the driver. This had no effect. I used<a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/articles/000025142/mini-pcs/intel-compute-sticks.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> this website</a>, which had an .exe that was supposed to help:&nbsp;</li><li>Used the Troubleshoot function. This had no effect, but I checked and it only looked at the Bluetooth connection.</li><li>The compute stick has no battery, but I did confirm that it is set to "Maximum Performance - No Power Savings". In Device Manager it says the current power state is D0, or fully on.</li><li>command prompt "netcfg -d" and a restart. The command generated a bunch of errors. I restarted anyway. There was no change.
</li><li>Reinstalled Windows. Even this did not help!</li></ul>

            Hi, Zechariah
<br />
<br />First of all I would recommend that you install Windows 64 bits. And from here I recommend you to repair the Operating System completely, before you should backup your files, check this link.
