<h2>            .Intel GMA 3600 driver for Windows 8.1&#40;Graphics Media Accelerator&#41; not working</h2>
                    <p>Hey Community,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have bought a netbook last year with installed Windows 7 SP1 32-bit, and I decided to upgrade it into Windows 8.1. I have successfully upgraded it, but when I install the Intel GMA 3600 Driver, it installed fine but the windows 8 apps won't work. As it
 says, The screen resolution is too low. So I've decided to plug it into external display/ monitor. Still it worked fine for me, but when I open any Metro Apps including Internet Explorer 11, the screen turns black and turns off, then restarts. Does anyone
 of you have the same problem about Intel GMA 3600? Can an update fix this? How can I fix this? Or I just have to admit that Intel GMA 3600 doesn't support Windows 8.1?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Acer Aspire One D270</p>
<p>My NetBook Specs are:</p>
<ul>
<li>1024x600 Resolution</li><li>2GB of RAM- Intel Atom N2800 Processor(x64-bit based processor)</li><li>Intel GMA 3600 Graphics Card</li><li>Windows 8.1 Enterprise Operating System 32- bit (x86)</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I bought an OS for nothing!&nbsp;Please help me Microsoft!!! I want to use my&nbsp;Windows 8.1 normally. Fix Please!!;((((</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>As suggested earlier, you can contact Acer or Intel support center for further assistance on the issue as the graphics card doesn't look compatible with Windows 8.1. (Refer to the links that were provided on the previous post).

            Hi tehshibz,<br />
<br />
Thank you for using Microsoft Windows 7 forum.<br />
<br />
Is your computer part of a domain?<br />
<br />
That is by design and is a function of User Account Control (UAC) and the<br />
ACL on the root of the drive. The ACL permits only Administrators and System<br />
from writing files to the root of the drive. UAC means that even if you are a<br />
member of the Administrator's group you do not run as an administrator unless<br />
you elevate.<br />
<br />
If you really want to, you can launch whatever process you use to write the<br />
files with as an administrator and then you can write there. If you try to<br />
drag and drop a file there you get an elevation prompt. The recommended<br />
solution is to not store data there though.<br />
<br />
If you really want to store files in the root of the d: and you do not want to<br />
elevate each time, you can resolve the situation by adding an access control<br />
<br />
list entry for your account to the root of the drive, as follows:<br />
<br />
1. Click the Window button:All Programs:Accessories<br />
2. Right-click on Command Prompt<br />
3. Select Run as administrator and accept the prompt<br />
4. Run this command: icacls d:\ /grant fooSadOI)(CI)(M)<br />
<br />
That will grant the user foo modify permissions on d:\. All objects (OI) and<br />
containers (CI) will inherit those permissions. You would need to replace foo<br />
with the name of your user account.<br />
<br />
Once you do that any application you run as user foo will be able to store<br />
security setting, with all the caveats that entails.<br />
<br />
Your user profile may be corrupted and hence, you may want to fix it.<br />
<br />

                    So I recently upgraded my computer, and the new computer came with Windows 10 Home. I wanted to upgrade it to Windows 10 Pro, so I decided to look on the internet how. I ended up overriding the Pro product key with the product key that came with the new
 drive. For some reason, Windows acted as if the Pro key were a Home key and continued as Windows 10 Home. I went back to the forums, and went back to upgrade my Windows 10 Home to Windows 10 Pro with the generic Windows 10 Pro product key. Everything went
 smooth sailing until I went to replace the product key. When I replaced the generic key with my Windows 10 Pro key, it said that it was a Windows 10 Home key and I had to "upgrade" to Windows 10 Home. Confused, I went to boot up from my old drive.
<strong>Note: My old drive had Windows 7 Ultimate and upgraded to Windows 10 Pro.&nbsp;</strong>Now, the old drive said that it wasn't activated. I went to troubleshoot it, and now it said that the product key was a Windows 10 HOME key! Now BOTH drives are running
 on an unlicensed Windows 10 Pro. I have looked on many forums with no solution. I am utterly stressed out. Sorry if you find this very confusing, I'm trying my best to explain it.

            Hi Ryan.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Where did you buy the Pro Product Key?  Do you have the physical key in your possession, or was it the keyless Upgrade via the Store 
<br />
<br />Did you upgrade Home by inserting the Default Pro Product Key, and now it is at Pro version and will not activate?  
<br />
<br />Try inserting the Pro Key in Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation &gt; Change Product Key.  Make sure to input it accurately.  What is the exact result error and verbatim message?
<br />
<br />Next run the Activation Troubleshooter and report back what it reports.
<br />
<br />If all else fails contact Microsoft Support, asking for Activation help, then keep asking for an agent.  <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/menu/software/windows/setup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>1. The product key is digital, and I got it using the free upgrade tool from Windows 7 to Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Yes, then I inserted the Pro product key I got and it didn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. The error says, "The product key you entered didn't work. Check the product key and try again, or enter a different one. (0xc004f050)"</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. The Activation Troubleshooter says, "We found a Windows 10 Home digital license for this device running Windows 10 Pro. To activate using this digital license, you need to install Windows 10 Home. You can also activate this device by going to the Store
 and purchasing a genuine copy of Windows."</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I clicked "I changed hardware on this device recently," I logged into my Microsoft account, and the error says, "Oops, something went wrong. We can't add your Microsoft account to this device right now, but it's okay. We'll help you set up, and you
 can sign in later in Settings. <strong>Note: I am signed in with my Microsoft account on my pc account</strong>.</p>

            Was the original free Upgrade of Pro version or Home version?  If it was upgraded Home &gt; Home then that error you're receiving would be expected until you activate Pro version.  
<br />
<br />How did you change to Pro version exactly?  
<br />
<br />Where did you get the Pro Product Key that you've tried to activate with?

            Maybe I misunderstood that you'd already converted to Pro version by inserting the Generic Product Key:  <a href="http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-windows-10-rtm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-...</a>
<br />
<br />If necessary you must go offline to do this.  In Action center at right end of Task bar, choose Airplane Mode, insert Pro key, let it change to Pro version.
<br />
<br />Then reconnect to the internet to activate with your Pro retail key.  Is that what you have?  Where did you purchase it exactly?  I've now asked twice.

<p>Yes, I've tried to activate the Pro key with the internet access, while upgrading to Pro without Wi-Fi. I got the Pro product key for free, as a digital license, by upgrading to Windows 10 Pro, from Windows 7 Ultimate. If you're asking where I got Windows
 7, I installed it through a CD from a friend, since I've had many activation problems before. The old drive was in a custom built computer, by the way.

<p>
</p><p>*** The original free upgrade was for Pro.</p>

            Ryan, then that's the misunderstanding because there is no Product key for Digital Activation, only the generic version key pointing to the licensed version which doesn't activate it but must still be there in order to activate with the Digital License stored in MS Activation servers. 
<br />
<br />So if your old hardware Digital License was linked to your MS account, then on the new hardware you'd go offiline to insert the generic Pro key from this link:  <a href="http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-windows-10-rtm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://winaero.com/blog/generic-key-to-install-...</a>.  This should change Windows to Pro version.
<br />
<br />Once this is done sign into your MS Account and Run the Activation Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation choosing that this is the new hardware.  It should activate with the DL.  
<br />
<br />If not contact Microsoft Support, asking for Activation help, then keep asking for an agent.  <a href="https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/en-us/contact/menu/software/windows/setup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://partner.support.services.microsoft.com/...</a>.

            Ryan,  one thing I'm not clear on is if you've already changed to Pro version on the new PC because this will not even begin to work nor will SUpport help you until you've changed to Pro version following the method I've now given three times.

            If your Windows 7 Ultimate is legitimate and not an abused license, all you need to do is the following:
<br />
<br />Click Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Activation &gt; Change the product key then enter the new product key then click Next to Activate
<br />
<br />If you are unable to activate Windows 10 after all the above and you are certain you have the correct edition installed, then please attempt chat support:

<p>Hi Mary,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update keeps your computer updated with the latest security patches or device drivers. It will automatically install these updates so you won't have to search for updates online or possibly miss important updates. However, there are times where the
 update does not install correctly or there are known issues with the update. Before we proceed with getting your computer up and running, we would like to get some information about the update and what happened to your computer. Kindly respond to the questions
 below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Can you tell us which update was recently installed on your computer that rendered your computer unusable? This is for us to know if that update was listed with known issues.</li><li>What is the make and model of your computer?</li><li>Can you explain what you mean by saying "useless"? Are you able to get in to Windows? Are there any error messages?</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>On a another note, a list of the released updates for Windows 10 is available where you can read about the improvements and fixes it includes, as well as known issues with updates. You may find it through the
<em><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/4043454/windows-10-windows-server-2016-update-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows 10 and Windows Server 2016 update history</a></em>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are unable to get in to Windows, you may use an installation media to restore from a system restore point or reset your computer. Here's how to download and use an installation media:</p>
<ol>
<li>On a working PC, go to the <em><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft software download website</a></em>.</li><li>Download the media creation tool and then run it.</li><li>Select <strong>Create installation media for another PC</strong>.</li><li>Choose a language, edition, and architecture (64-bit or 32-bit).</li><li>Follow the steps to create an installation media, and then select <strong>Finish</strong>.</li><li>Connect the installation media you created to your unusable computer, then turn it on.</li><li>On the initial setup screen, enter your language and other preferences, and then select
<strong>Next</strong>. If you're not seeing the setup screen, your PC might not be set up to boot from a drive. Check your PC manufacturer's website for info on how to change your PC's boot order, and then try again.</li><li>Select <strong>Repair your computer</strong>.</li><li>On the <strong>Choose an option </strong>screen, select <strong>Troubleshoot</strong>. From there, you may:
<ul>
<li>Restore from a system restore point by selecting <strong>Advanced options </strong>
&gt; <strong>System Restore</strong>. This will remove recently installed apps, drivers, and updates that might have caused your PC problems. Restoring from a restore point won't affect your personal files.</li><li>Select <strong>Reset this PC </strong>to reinstall Windows 10. This will remove apps and drivers you installed and changes you made to settings, but lets you choose to keep or remove your personal files.</li></ul>
<p>
</p></li></ol>
<p>We look forward to an update from you.</p>

<p>i have read everything on what you post as fixes, but I cannot even get past the &nbsp;FAILED box and there are no codes associated within the box.</p>

<p>We appreciate the feedback, Mary. The instructions on the last part of our previous reply is for reinstalling Windows 10. However, you may have to use another computer to download the Windows 10 installation media. But, if you are eager to reinstall Windows
 7 on your computer, you may download a Windows 7 Disc image on this <strong><em><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">link</a></em></strong>. You may have to enter your product key on that website
 to download the image.</p>

<h2>            Slow performance of computer while playing gaming</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Problems with my CPU!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have an entry level gaming computer. Its specs are pretty good, and it can run most games finely. But I have noticed that its CPU performance has lowered dramaticaly. For example, when I first got my computer, I could run games like Team Fortress at 90
 FPS. Now it runs at about 50-60, and spikes down to 30. I have dusted out the interior of my computer, and lowered the CPU temperature by quite a bit. But games tend to run at a high cpu percentage and at lower than normal fps. I have run virus scans with
 Malwarebytes and Kaspersky. Nothing showed up. The only thing that has slightly worked is ending some not needed processes by going to restart my computer, and cancelling the restart. This tends to speed it up, and it works better than msconfig which I have
 already tried, and I do not want to try disabling Microsoft Services and Processes without guidance. Any tips or ideas why this is happening?</p>

            <p>Ok, I think that disabling some services and processes will work. However, I think some Microsoft Processes may be causing higheer cpu usage. I have confirmed this when I cancel a restart, which ends all non essential processes, including some Microsoft
 services and processes. This brings down my average CPU usage to about 1-3%, when it is usually anywhere from 1-9%. Source Engine games also lose the usual low FPS. What Microsoft Processes and Services could be causing increased CPU usage and are non-essential?
 And is there anyway to replicate what happens to all non essential processes before a computer shuts down?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Higher than Normal&nbsp;CPU tends to happen on all games.&nbsp;Almost all of the games are well below&nbsp;what my&nbsp;Computer can handle, and it handled them very well a few&nbsp;months ago. I cannot think of any new hardware installed that could cause this. And I am sure
 that this is not malware related.&nbsp; </p>

            What didn't work in System Configuration ? Did you stop some software from launching with Windows in the Startup tab as well as checking Services ?<br />
<br />
The gpu is the important fact in your games. The cpu is second fiddle.<br />
In the overall scheme of things a cpu usage of 9% is not a problem. My Phenom 965 flashes up to as much as 20% if I do a quick mouse wheel scroll over a long page, but it sits
<br />
stable @ 0% if nothing (including a key or mouse movement) is touched.<br />
You mentioned temps dropping. Dropping to what ? What are the temps of both the<br />
&nbsp;cpu and gpu while under load running games ? <br />
<br />
Did you update your graphics drivers recently ? If so you may want to go back to the previous one's.<br />
Depending on the games you are playing, and graphics card, the latest driver ain't always the greatest.<br />
<br />

    <title>Stuck in Windows XP upgrade Limbo - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> theusualid  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stuck in Windows XP upgrade Limbo</h2>
                    
<p>I have a Sony Desktop with a (presumably) OEM copy of Windows XP Home. I bought an Academic upgrade of Windows XP Professional and never used it, but when I had boot up problems with my Windows partition (this is a multi OS drive), I decided to use the upgrade
 disc to repair the partition. That didn't quite work. It seems that the upgrade did more than repair my Windows partition. It launched me into an actual upgrade.</p>
<p>To make a long story short, the upgrade is asking me for a product license key, which I dutifully put in, but even though the key comes with the upgrade package/disc, the license key doesn't work!</p>
<p>After reading on the net, it appears that upgrade discs don't work with OEM versions of Windows. (nice to know now). If I reboot, the machine, Windows detects the unfinished upgrade and launches me back into upgrade mode so I can finish the upgrade. Of course
 it asks for the license key, which doesn't work. Subsequent reboots result in the same behavior -- the upgrade licensing keeps the computer in Sisyphus mode.</p>
<p>I have three primary questions:</p>
<p>1. Has the upgrade (so far) changed my Windows partition other than to copy in (temporary) files that will be used for the actual upgrade.</p>
<p>2. If I boot up off a recovery floppy or CD and can mount the Windows partition, what upgrade setup files can I delete to make it appear that the upgrade never happened?</p>
<p>3. Are the upgrade setup files in one directory/folder, or are they all over the partition filesystem?</p>
<p>....and depending on the answers, this question:</p>
<p>If the answer to question one is that the upgrade has done more than copy in files and in fact has already changed system files, will that prevent me from getting the partition out of upgrade Limbo and back to the pre-upgrade state by deleting some files.
 Or on the other hand, will I eventually have to burn the village down in order to save it, so to speak?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>-TID</p>

<p>It would make sense for the "recovery" to commence <strong>after,&nbsp;</strong><strong>and only if</strong> ,&nbsp; a license key has been entered in successfully. At least that's how I would have written the upgrade installer.</p>

<p>Hi Andre,</p>
<p>How do I find out whether I have Windows 10 home single language. I can't find anything in the windows literature that even indicates such a thing exists. I have had an english language pack installed before the last windows update, so using your logic this
 can't be the issue. The english language pack disappeared after the Windows update.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best Regards</p>
<p>Jan</p>

            <p>I've been posting this workaround for quite some time, and no-one has come back to say it didn't work, so long as the category was complete before starting:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the message compose window, click the <em>To... </em>button. A dialogue headed
<em>Send an Email </em>opens. </li><li>Select a category and then one of the <em>To</em>-&gt;, <em>Cc</em>-&gt; or <em>Bcc</em>-&gt; buttons; the category name will be displayed in the corresponding field.</li><li>Click on the "+" beside the category name.&nbsp; All the names in the category&nbsp;should be displayed in the entry field.</li><li>Click OK. The dialogue will close, returning focus to the message compose window with a fully-populated address list in the appropriate field.</li></ol>
<p>NB: the&nbsp;vital part of this process&nbsp;seems to be&nbsp;the trip through the <em>Send an Email</em> dialogue.

<p>I had successfully used your workaround prior to today which I was grateful for. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But having discovered that deleting a Messenger entry in WLM 2012 Addressbook (on a desktop pc) allowed me to use the Club Draw category directly in the To line of a new email without using your workaround I decided to share the information.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One Default Party Audio Chat Woes</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am enjoying my new Xbox One, but&nbsp; i seem to have issues communicating with my friends on the new Xbox.&nbsp; Whenever I start a party everyone's audio defaults to off.&nbsp; Is there any way to change a setting somewhere to default it to on?&nbsp;</p>
<p>One the 360 we always used the Xbox Live party to chat with friends outside of whatever game everyone is playing.&nbsp; Now with the audio defaulting to off everyone has to remember to say Xbox snap Party, then turn on their party chat.&nbsp; This is tough to remember
 or to accomplish when you join a friends party while in the middle of a game, so I always end up with a party where everyone has their audio chat disabled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also we can't seem to use out Kinect mic for chat and are forced to use headsets.&nbsp; I thought one of the features would be a no headset chat.&nbsp; This would be great for when we have 4 or more people behind each Xbox One that would like to chat and not everyone
 in the room has a headset.</p>

<h2>            Downloading Adobe Flash Player on a Vista with a 64 bit browser</h2>
                    I went to a website to download information.&nbsp; However, I was told that I need to have Flash Player 8.&nbsp; I tried to download Flash Player 8, but I keep getting a message that Adobe requires a 32 bit browser, and mine is a 64 bit browser.&nbsp; Is there a way
 to circumvent this requirement or to switch to a 32 bit browser when I have to access this particular website?

<p>&nbsp;Hi getbak</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Adobe has not released a 64-bit version of their Flash Player yet. Any website that&nbsp;contains Adobe Flash content cannot be used with a 64-bit browser.<br />
<br />
The 64-bit version of Vista does include a 32-bit version of the Internet Explorer browser. You might be able to use this to access that website.<br />
<br />
See the following website for details about how to access the 32-bit browser.<br />
<br />
Vista Experience Update: Windows Vista x64 runs 32-bit Internet Explorer by Default:

<p>Hi</p>
<p>If this was a driver update for the installed video adapter, it may have changed the screen resolution.</p>
<p>Right click an empty spot on the Desktop and select a different resolution. Select a new resolution, click Apply/OK and check the results. You may need to try a couple of different resolutions to set it to fit your screen.</p>
<p>In the screen resolution settings the first number is width and the second number is height, measured in Pixels. (eg: 1024x768)</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

    <title>Problems cancelling service - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> l whyte  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problems cancelling service</h2>
                    I signed up for a Skype Unlimited service in 2012, and all went well until I tried to change my service, due to changing needs. But Skype would not accept the change; when I clicked on the 'cancel', button, Skype argued and winged, then (with obvious reluctance)
 marked the service as cancelled... but only until I closed the website - whereupon it cancelled the cancellation, marking the service as active. I responded by telling Paypal to refuse all payment requests from Skype - which was just as well, for Skype then
 tried to take money for a renewal.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, at the same time that I supposedly cancelled the Unlimited service, I signed up for a new more limited service (more . Skype immediately began to charge the new service, while still wanting to take my money for the old service.<br />
<br />
My question is: is Skype and its new owner Microsoft so hard up or rapacious that they need to rob everybody blind, or is there a way to actually cancel unwanted accounts, and to control which account is to be charged if two or more accounts are available for
 use?

    <title>Failed delivery for e-mails send to BCC addresses - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sorina01  say:</h3>
<h2>            Failed delivery for e-mails send to BCC addresses</h2>
                    <p>Just two days ago (August 11, 2016) my Windows Live Mail Version 12 was updated to build 16.4.3528.0331. Since then every message I sent to more than one e-mail address under BCC is not delivered and I get a non-delivery message saying:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"<strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 102, 1)">Delivery has failed to these recipients or groups:</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">;<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">The format of the email address isn't correct. A correct address looks like this: *** Email address is removed for privacy ***. Please check the recipient's email address and try to resend the message."</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">There is no extra ";" in the string of e-mail addresses I put under BCC, so there is no reason for this non-delivery message. I had no such problem before this upgrade.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">A smaller problem is that now, after I type the first e-mail address in the BCC area, the&nbsp;cursor&nbsp;moves automatically to the&nbsp;"To" field, so I have to move the&nbsp;cursor&nbsp;to the BCC area, to continue to add e-mail
 addresses there, but then immediately after I type the next address the&nbsp;cursor&nbsp;jumps back to the "To" field. Very&nbsp;annoying. I had no such issue with the previous&nbsp;version&nbsp;of WLM.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Can anybody help? Thank you.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Ali,</p>
<p>In fact I already repaired WLM before posting above, and the problem persisted. It is interesting that if I access Outlook Mail through IE all is OK. If I do it through Chrome I get the rejected issue if I have more than one address under BCC.</p>
<p>When you said remove and re-add account you meant under WLM?</p>
<p>I was just wondering if my problem does not come from the fact that Microsoft said that the WLM will not work with the new Outlook Mail - see here&nbsp;https://www.thurrott.com/cloud/microsoft-consumer-services/outlook/66990/windows-live-mail-2012-will-not-work-new-outlook-com</p>

<h2>            Why am I getting the error &#34;device ... is not ready for access yet&#34;&#63;</h2>
                    <div>I can't figure out why I'm getting this error in event viewer:&nbsp;The device, \Device\Harddisk4\DR4, is not ready for access yet. My computer freezes periodically when this particular drive gets accessed. I've got it in a storage space. It appears
 that this specific drive is sharing the same port as something else.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<p>I believe this problem started happening when I put a PCIe card in my x4 slot, not realizing that it shared the same bandwidth as my SATA drives. I've since moved the card to an x16 slot, but the problem still persists. It seems like the port is still reserved
 for my mistaken placement of the PCIe card in the x4 slot. That's my guess at least. I also noticed that the physicallocation of the problem hard drive is "Integrated : Adapter 3 : Port 0".&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is blocking this drive? It doesn't look like anything in the BIOS is blocking it. It appears to be a Windows issue. The problem seemed to get worse after the Windows 10 April update. Is there somewhere in Windows where I could track down what's blocking
 the drive and disable whatever's blocking it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi Mike,<br />
<br />
Hardware compatibility and device driver issues are some of the reasons why your computer is unable to access that specific Hard Disk drive. To address the issue, please perform the following methods:<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1</strong>: Reset your <strong>BIOS</strong> to the default settings. Please check your motherboard's manual for the steps.<br />
<strong>Method 2</strong>: Try removing your <strong>PCIe</strong> card and connect your Hard Drive directly to
<strong>SATA </strong>port. <br />
<strong>Method 3</strong>: Update your <strong>BIOS</strong> to the latest version. Kindly visit the manufacturer's website. This will help eliminate hardware compatibility issues.<br />
<strong>Method 4</strong>: Update all of your device drivers to the latest version especially the chipset driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for the results.</p>

<p>Ok, thanks. It'll take me a little while to go through all those steps, but in the meantime I think I might have identified the device driver conflict. In Windows I see 3 separate ASMedia controller drivers. The Bios also has an Asmedia controller listed.
 Seems like there's a conflict between the Bios driver and the Windows driver (s). Is that possible? Would removing the Asmedia drivers in Windows fix it? Or should I update the Bios instead?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Btw, I already removed my PCIe card and the hard drive is plugged in directly to the SATA port. It seems like the PC thinks the PCIe card is still installed though even though it isn't. That's why I thought maybe removing the Asmedia drivers would fix it.
 Although...when I tried that before it didn't seem like Windows would let me remove them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<h2>            Skype Keeps Crashing</h2>
                    Any time I try to make a call or try to receive a call on my Surface Pro 3 (Windows 10), Skype crashes. I've uninstalled and reinstalled Skype and that didn't fix it. Any other suggestions?&nbsp;

            I realized that my computer hard drive was nearly full, so I cleaned out some of my files so it wasn't so full and Skype seems to be working now. Hope that's helpful to you, John.&nbsp;
