<h2>            microsoft office dialog box will not close</h2>
                    Microsoft office is trying to make me buy office 365 which I do not want. The dialog box on the screen will not close. If I turn off the computer and turn it on again it is still there. How do I close it down?

    <title>How do I repair a program in control panel&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nikontim  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I repair a program in control panel&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have recently installed windows 10 and since then my computer seems to do most things worse than before. One particular thing is getting Nikon Capture NX to start. It sometimes works but often freezes with some percentage of completion displayed beyond
 which it will not budge despite working frantically on it according to task manager. I tried going into control panel as it supposedly has an option to repair a program and indeed it says, 'to repair, click on the program and select repair'. I have tried all
 sorts of clicking and cannot find the repair option, only uninstall. Am I missing something?</p>
<p>PS while I'm on, perhaps someone can can answer a question that has bothered me since well before windows 10. When a program is not responding and you have given it some minutes to sort itself out but it is obvious that it cannot, so then you give up and
 select (or force) it to close. Why then does windows offer to help (too little - too late)? and, has it ever in the history of ever, actually found the solution it says it is looking for? I think I know the answer, it's never, isn't it?</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community. I regret the inconvenience caused to you. Let me help you.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>While freezing, do you see any error code or error message on the screen?</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This issue might appear due to the incompatible drivers. I suggest you to download and install the latest drivers from the manufacturer website
 and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, download and install the drivers in compatibility mode and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Run the program in the compatibility mode.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If a program or driver written for an earlier version of Windows doesn't run properly in current Windows, then you could try using
<strong>compatibility mode</strong> on the program to hopefully allow it to run properly.</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to run the program/game in the compatibility mode and check if it helps. Follow the below steps:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>

            <p>Thank you for your advice. I fixed it by removing and re-installing it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps this issue was not down to windows10 after all.</p>
<p>There are many other 'faults' which I think are though. One is that when loading up a screen full of photos (either a folder on my computer or the file on the camera that I have connected to copy photos to the computer), the process of opening them before
 I can do anything with them takes longer than it used too. This is not a problem in itself but when I think they are all there and I can start to look for particular photos, the list keeps scrolling back to the top when I am looking down them. I can be several
 minutes scrolling and re-scrolling trying to find a particular photo and when I find it and am about to select it, it will almost certainly chose that moment to return to the top of the screen again!</p>
<p>I am slowly getting used to Window10 as I use it but I dread having to update and the huge learning curve that goes with it. I would have stuck with windows 8 but this was not getting any easier to use, windows 10 is a big improvement, mainly I think because
 it was a step back. I think the writers of these things should think more carefully before changing well established and liked features. If a car manufacture suddenly decided on a whim that the brake pedal should no longer be the middle pedal there would rightly
 be uproar, and a few accidents. I think computers are mature enough now that things like getting to the control panel, finding assessories such as the calculator and other such feature should be the same from now on.</p>
<p>Thanks.<br />

            I do apologize for getting so negative but computers just seem to be getting less user friendly. I use them at work too and they are unfortunately indispensible and yet unreliable to the point of wishing we could go back a few years to when they were less
 troublesome. The days of XP seem to be the high point. They had got faster and more capable but hadn't started to be slowed down by their complexity. I might just be getting old of course but I believe this downturn is real as younger people I work with seem
 to feel the same.

            Hi<br />
<br />
Network and Internet Speed is measured by the number of basic info that can be transferred in a sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Your measure indicates that you have a n Internet connection that transfers from the Internet to your computer (download) info at the rate of about 1565,000&nbsp; bits per second (1565K/b/sec.)&nbsp; and it sends info at the rate of 530,000 bits per sec. (530K/b/sec.)
<br />
<br />
The rate depends on your Internet contract, if the rate is lower than what your contract calls for, you should check with your Internet provider.<br />
<br />

<h2>            fallout 3 dlc backwards compatability issue</h2>
                    
<p>Hello I was hoping someone would be able to think of something here as I have a interesting situation</p>
<p>before fallout 3 goty edition came out they sold the dlc on disc separately from the game so i have two discs one with broken steel and another dlc on it and the other disc has operation anchorage and the other dlc on it. Here is where my issue is I put
 the discs in the xbox one and installed them like I was supposed to and it is showing all installed however whenever i enter the game it will only give me access to the dlc that is on the disc in the drive and not the others. so if i do the operation anchorage
 disc i can access that fine but if i wanted to access broken steel the only way for me to do that is to put the other disc in and it corrupts the save files back to before I started the operation anchorage dlc</p>
<p>so I am trying to figure out a way to play all &nbsp;the dlc at the same time</p>
<p>thank you in advance for any ideas&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Microphone stops working occasionaly during Skype calls - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Microphone stops working occasionaly during Skype calls</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with Skype and specifically the microphone function during calls. It started when I have installed Windows 10, still using the desktop Skype version. Having a call, my microphone initially works fine, but during the call it just stops working.
 I have found out that the problem was with the automatic microphone level adjustment - when I open the settings pane, then turn OFF and back ON that checkbox, the microphone starts working again (the call has not been closed, the other party confirms they
 hear me again). This is too strange - it never happened on Windows 7 or any other Windows before. I thought it was caused by the fact that I am using external speakers and external microphone and somehow the sound from the speakers combined with me talking
 was causing software/logical issues with that automatic adjustment. However, even if I use the laptop internal speakers and microphone, the same sounds would be combined, so it won't matter which speakers+mic am I using.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, with the new Skype App the Microsoft team has decided to cut off the original desktop version. Luckily for me, I have the desktop version already installed before this madness happened. Why? Because the app version does NOT have any control on that
 automatic level adjustment. And guess what - the microphone stops working AGAIN, but there is no way for me to do the workaround. Because someone has decided to remove a very important functionality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>While I am still able to use the desktop version (which is way better than the mobile app, no matter what your team may be thinking about it, it's the customer opinion which should matter to you), I don't know for how long will I be able to do that, because
 the moment I need to reinstall my Windows, it will never allow me to install the desktop version again. That already happened on my wife's laptop. However, the most important question I have is why am I facing the problem with the microphone - it works at
 start, but then stops working in the middle of the call (actually several seconds later, but randomly).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My settings:</p>
<p>- Windows 10 Professional, licensed</p>
<p>- all privacy settings are set to allow Skype using the microphone (and it us working, just stops randomly)</p>
<p>- Skype App version 12.1815.209.0</p>
<p>- Skype desktop version 7.4.0.101</p>
<p>- External microphone used in Microsoft LifeCam HD-3000 and Logitech - both the same behavior</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Dimiter</p>

<p>Hi Elba,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply and suggestion. However, as I mentioned above in the list with my current settings (second bullet), the privacy settings for the Microphone are already turned on and also on for all apps, not just Skype. And the microphone works when
 the call starts, but then it stops, which is the strangest thing - by itself. I think the reason is the same as with the desktop Skype (wrong automatic microphone level adjustment), but there is no such control in the Windows 10 Skype app, and also I am not
 sure such issue should exist in Skype at all.</p>

<p>Hi Ruwim,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried that during a call today. I opened the Recording tab in the Sound Control panel, but the microphone was always turned on in this screen. However, if I open the Properties for the microphone another window pops up with several tabs - General, Listen,
 Levels, and Advanced. In the Levels tabs I can see the input level for the microphone and it looks like during the Skype call this level is automatically adjusted and varies, and there is no option for me to disable that automatic adjustment. When the microphone
 stopped working during the call, I opened this tab and although the level slide was active, the button on the right side noted that the microphone is muted/stopped. I clicked on it and it was working fine again. And I think this is the same functionality I
 have in the desktop version of Skype - the microphone automatic level adjustment. Turned out it was a Windows function rather than a Skype one. And yet, I was still wondering what exactly has caused that microphone to be muted. After a few more tests it turned
 out that this happens when I change the master volume up or down. In other words, during the Skype call I need to increase or decrease the master volume in order to hear my colleague better (or less). And now the most important part (I guess) - I have a Microsoft
 Wireless Keyboard 800 (model 1455) and I am using the media keys on it to control the master volume. And when I change the master volume (no matter up or down) using the volume keys on that keyboard, the microphone input is muted. Never happens if I change
 the volume through Windows, only when using the keyboard. And this is already too strange as all these products - software and hardware - are original Microsoft products. I checked the drivers of the keyboard and everything seems just fine. Also, there are
 no specific commands set up in the Mouse and Keyboard Center that comes with the driver. In other words, the two buttons for changing the master volume with the keyboard should be only changing that master volume, but for some reason they also mute the microphone.
 Why would that happen and how can I prevent from it happening?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>1. Does this problem arise when using the default backgrounds that come with Windows Vista?<br />
2. Is the issue confined with any particular wallpaper?<br />
<br />
<strong>Method 1:<br />
</strong>You may change the wall paper size by following the steps provided and check.<br />
a. Open Desktop Background by clicking the Start button, clicking Control Panel, clicking Appearance and Personalization, clicking Personalization, and then clicking Desktop Background.
<br />
b. If the image you choose is smaller or larger than the screen, select one of the How Should the Picture Be Positioned? Option
<br />
buttons:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Fit to Screen the left option button, Tile the center option button, or Center the right option button.
<br />
• If the image doesn’t have the same proportions as the screen, the Fit to Screen option distorts the image. If you want to have a full-screen picture without distortion, open the image in a graphics program for example, Paint, crop it to the right proportions,
 and then save the cropped version under a different name for use on your Desktop.
<br />
• If the image you want to use is a picture from a high-resolution digital camera, it may be bigger than the screen. In this case, the Tile option isn’t much use. The Center option centers the center of the picture on the screen, so you’ll see only part of
 it. The Stretch option shrinks the picture to fit the screen.</p>

<h2>            Dragon Age&#58; Origins&#58; What were they thinking&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;I'm almost finished with my Hard playthrough of DA: Origins(good god, Mages are OP) but I found it has been a frustrating experience(despite it being seemingly easier than its PC counterpart).<br />
<br />
See, I wonder what they were thinknig when they did the console port of&nbsp; this game. I feel like 90% of my deaths are from wresting with poor controls that DO NOT suit this game at all. Sure, no mouse may has a bit of a hurdle but I do not under stand why I
 can't A) Zoom out to scan the battlefiled. Being locked into a third=person camera makes it incredibly hard to see and target. B) You can't Queue up attacks. Pausing and unpasing after slelecting an attack ruins most of assualts and planning in the first place.
 Why wasn't this carried over from the PC version? DAII doesn't have this problem. Lastly, why did the move to position not carry over either? Again, DAII also had this if I recall. Moving and positioning are an absolute pain.
<br />
<br />
I have to wonder if people's issue with the combat may have been the poor optimization the console port was given. It is incredible how bone-headed and contradictory it is to the overall game. It's like they trying to present it as a Third-Person action game
 or something. But then again, Normal mode doesn't even have Friendly-Fire, so I wonder what they thought of their target audience when they developed the port.</p>

                    I tried to do a backup to cd and used new cd's.&nbsp; The system formatted disc 1, but would not format disc 2.&nbsp; I tried 2 cd's (brand new CD-RW), and got an error on both that said "CD not formatted".&nbsp; It took forever to do each one and then I had to cancel
 the backup.&nbsp; Sould I try another CD, or do you think there is a problem?<br />
<br />
My computer is brand new (purchased 3-21) - it's a Toshiba satellite L305 running Vista Home Premium.

<p>Here's a procrdure written for XP but it should work fine with Vista with just a few changes.
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/setup/tips/advanced/autologon.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/setup/tips/advanced/autologon.mspx</a>.</p>
<p>NOTE: This method of logon is not recommended for security purposes because anyone can gain access to your system by just starting it (without needing a username and password) - but the decision is yours.</p>
<p>To get to Run in Vista, you need to go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Run.&nbsp; Otherwise I believe the procedure will work as described (and you won't need to reinstall any software or updates installed betwen now and the restore point you choose to
 use).</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

            <p>'Volume' is the term for a unit of disk storage. For example, a partition is a volume, and the two terms are often used interchangeably.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 'boot volume' is the partition that contains a bootable operating system. For Windows users, the boot volume is typically C:</p>
<p>
</p><p>'Mounting' a volume means making it accessible ... making it possible to find and use the folders and files in the volume.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Therefore, an unmountable boot volume (in a Windows system) is a C: drive that is inaccessible. Since the C: drive is used to boot the computer, if the C: drive is inaccessible your computer can't boot.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The C: drive is inaccessible because it has become corrupted. This can happen for hundreds of different reasons, including problems with upgrades, malware, inappropriate configuration changes and misbehaving software applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fix the problem correctly you have to know what caused it in the first place. These are highly technical things that confound most people, so many people end up re-installing Windows. Before you do that, it could be worthwhile to show your computer to
 a technician. Pick someone who really knows their stuff, not that Up The Creek Squad or whatever they're calling themselves these days.</p>

    <title>Looking for an All-In-One Wallpaper, Lockscreen App - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> consultant1027  say:</h3>
<h2>            Looking for an All-In-One Wallpaper, Lockscreen App</h2>
                    Anyone know of an app or a way to achieve the following:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- Have lockscreen, start screen, desktop wallpaper, and account wallpaper all change once a day to a random image</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>- Random image is pulled from two sources: (a) a folder on my computer and (b) an online source where I can select categories of HD wallpapers</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Or what's the closest I can get to this?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Here's the thing, I can go select my favorite photos and download some favorite HD wallpapers and put them in a folder. &nbsp;But, I'd like the system to automatically show me something new once in a while without having to go download it. &nbsp;But I don't want
 to only see random wallpapers that I haven't already chosen. &nbsp;I want a mix of both. &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My guess is, I'm just going to have to live with every month or so, (a) going through my new photos to see if I want to add some of them to my wallpaper folder and (b) shopping for new wallpapers on the net that I also may want to add.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>This still leaves this issue of getting ALL the screens to change once a day. &nbsp;They don't have to show the same wallpaper. &nbsp;Seems Lockscreen, desktop and start screen there's either a setting or an app to achieve it but account screen may not have an auto-change
 solution.</div>

<h2>            Mic in Left 4 Dead lobbies</h2>
                    <p>My mic works fine on my xbox one. However, when I play the backwards compatible Left 4 Dead, my mic will not pick up my voice but it will still give out game and chat audio. My controller is up to date so is my console &amp; game.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hey, Risky!</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Sorry to see any issues with game chat for Left 4 Dead!&nbsp;In your subject, you say it's in lobbies. Is it only occurring there, or does it happen when you are in Xbox One Party Chat while playing Left 4 Dead, or in 360 party chat,&nbsp;as well?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>With your controller being up to date, what other troubleshooting have you tried out? Any other devices or accessories you've tried, or network troubleshooting, will be helpful to know so that we don't ask you to do something that you've already done. Let us know, and we look forward to working with you to solve this! :)</p><p><br /></p><p>--------------------------------------</p><p><br /></p><p>Misses Quinzel</p>

    <title>BSOD Win32full.sys - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brianhillard  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD Win32full.sys</h2>
                    <p>Ever since I updated to the latest version of Windows 10, I have been getting random BSOD's.</p>
<p>It doesn't happen during gaming. And if it does happen on the Desktop it's normally happens randomly when clicking the mouse button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am beginning to think it's my mouse driver, but I have have included my crash dump.</p>
<p>Hopefully someone can shed some light on what's causing it.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time.</p>
<p>

            No drivers were named in the crashes, so our next step would be to find the offending driver if any. 
<br />
<br />Enable Driver Verifier:
<br />
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_other-system/driver-verifier-tracking-down-a-mis-behaving/f5cb4faf-556b-4b6d-95b3-c48669e4c983">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Upload the newer dumps when you get Driver_Verifier_detected_voilation.
<br />
<br />Please note that the system might crash before you reach the desktop-if it does please let us know so that we can guide you to disable Verifier.

</p><p>Driver Verifier did indeed crash the computer as expected.</p>
<p>No worries, I simply restarted in safe mode and then disabled Verifier.</p>

            Crashes related to Virtual box.
<br />Can you try uninstalling virtualbox temporarily to check if it indeed is the root cause.

<p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the late reply. The wife hijacked my PC.</p>

</p><p>I had forgotten I had Virtual Box installed.</p>
<p>I have uninstalled it, and I will see how it goes over the next two or three days.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
You may want to check my next reply for methods to check to see if the<br />
CD/DVD driver is viable at all (will work).<br />
<br />
===================================================<br />
<br />
Do these to clear corruption and repair/replace damaged/missing system files.</p>
<p>Start - type in Search box -&nbsp; CMD&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; find at top of list&nbsp;-&nbsp; RIGHT CLICK&nbsp; - &nbsp;RUN AS ADMIN<br />

References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</p>
<p><br />
Stage 1 : Please do all the below even&nbsp;if you have done some before as it is often
<br />
the total process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - <br />
Driver's Tab -&nbsp;click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK
<br />
the drive - UNINSTALL - REBOOT&nbsp;this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>
Even <br />
if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue&nbsp;below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could <br />
have a loose cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and
<br />
other issues.<br />
<br />
<strong>Your CD drive or DVD drive is missing or is not recognized by Windows or <br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check <br />
cables in both&nbsp;ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can <br />
often clean the power and&nbsp;data contacts with a pencil eraser.<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System <br />
maker and&nbsp;device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for you drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case
<br />
( CD &amp; DVD&nbsp;burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to <br />
not function while the others&nbsp;do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There
<br />
are some&nbsp;registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" <br />
be the cause.<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware <br />
updates</strong> and the correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-<br />
keys of course&nbsp;as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific
<br />
keys involved as well as&nbsp;the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />

<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your
<br />
CD/DVD drive from someone with the same model.<br />

Use DevManView to locate CD/DVD in registry (be careful and make a Restore <br />
Point before changing anything) - find the device in&nbsp;DevManView&nbsp;and then Right Click on it Open in RegEdit.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Try this to see if the drive is viable at all.<br />
<br />
Setup/Settings (BIOS/CMOS) often F2 so watch the screen as you boot - set the <br />
boot&nbsp;order to CD/DVD first. Remember to set it back when done.<br />
<br />
Try booting to a Windows 7 Repair and/or Installation disk, and or a Linux boot disk.<br />
<br />
If the drive will not boot to these then it has failed or there are other hardware
<br />
issues&nbsp;affecting it. However even it does boot that does not mean there are not <br />
some possible&nbsp;hardware issues affect the drive's other functions.<br />

            <p>After all the testing recommended, keep in mind that this is a common failure point.&nbsp; If yours is a desktop PC, it is simple and inexpensive to replace.&nbsp; About $20.&nbsp; Open the case, remove the 2 screws that hold it in place and the two cables.&nbsp; Insert the
 new one and reverse the procedure.&nbsp; In some desktops, you may have to remove the front cover to do this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yours is a laptop, the DVD drive is proprietary and much more expensive and only available from the OEM.&nbsp; An alternative is to buy an externally connected DVD drive for about $25 that connects to any USB port.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Remote Desktop &#38; RD Client in iPad - Mouse&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I'm using your great RD Clien in my work iPAD to remotely connect (via VPN) to my desktop/laptop at the office. This is working great with my Bluetooth keyboard but I'm missing the mouth to be fully operational on the iPad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>is there any mouse/set up option to make the Bluetooth mouse work on the RD client? I tried using the Citrix Mouse X1 but unfortunately only works within Citrix apps and ecosystem and not with the RD client (unless I'm missing something).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wonder wether Windows has considered this business case and the possibility of commercialising a mouse compatible with the RD client for iPads, I'm sure with the new iPad pro there will even be more users in my same situation!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks!!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello everyone. So I've been having a blue screen error for about a week and a half I want to say, and at first it was just a normal blue screen error that I probably could have fixed had I taken the time to do so, but I was in the middle of school
 work and I was trying to get things done. Anyways I eventually came to a point where I couldn't bypass the blue screen by simply turning the computer on and off again so I attempted to fix it myself but nothing worked no matter what I did, and I did almost
 everything that I could I even did that command prompt, but it didn't work, nothing worked, I couldn't even do a hard reset.&nbsp; I couldn't do any of the advanced options that that would come up. I did do the USB option for bootable media, and that was after
 contacting Microsoft support multiple times. </p>
<p>I contacted them they told me what to do and they accessed my other computer to download Microsoft10 (operating system of the infected computer). When I plugged it in and I did the USB option on the advanced options it did take me to the setup
 for Windows 10, but it said there was something wrong with the formatting even though I was told to put format it as NTFS instead of FAT32 and it didn't work and I am just very confused. My computer's acting as if the USB for the Windows 10 setup is still
 plugged in, because even without the USB&nbsp; the windows 10 setup is still there. It's really been hell for me. Now without the USB there is a black screen with a little white dash in the top left corner. I plugged the USB while it's still on to see what would
 happen and the Lenovo logo (my PC) appears and it's at this menu called the boot menu and I'm guessing this was actually for the bootable media that the technicians told me about however like I said once I try to do anything really it doesn't let me I'm not
 allowed to select any of the options I have two options they're both the USB (but one is an eMMC card, and the other is a USB HDD). I'm not sure what I'm supposed to do. I feel like giving up you know but I can't afford to do that because this is not my computer
 this is a school computer this could cost my family a lot of money, and I don't want to be the person you that makes us broke, and I don't wanna go back to public school, so please help me here please.&nbsp;I can't log in actually I can't do anything it's just
 stuck on this boot menu and I don't know what to do.</p>

            Hi Blancho.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />If it's a school PC it should have a Help desk behind it that you can call on for things like this.  Most schools do.  
<br />
<br /> If not I will give you all possible steps to troubleshoot installation failure which work in about 90% of cases.  If not we'll go from there:
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Make sure all other drives and peripherals are unplugged.  Update the BIOS or UEFI firmware to latest, or reset to Defaults, making sure SATA controller is set to AHCI, UEFI is enabled, CSM disabled, Windows Boot Manager set first to boot, if necessary disable Secure and Fast Boot until after install:   <a href="https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-list-of-how-key-to-press-to-access-bios-for-various-oem-and-computer-systems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.mydigitallife.net/comprehensive-lis...</a>
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-defaults-nvram-mac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/reset-pc-bios-...</a>
<br />
<br />Create the latest new Windows 10 Installation Media by installing Media Creation Tool and following the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  If you're using another PC to do this then uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first.  If you can start Windows enter UEFI firmware here:  <a href="http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-methods-to-access-uefi-bios-setup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on first screen press Shift + F10 to open a Command Prompt, type the following commands,  each followed by Enter key:
<br />DISKPART
<br />LIST DISK
<br />SEL DIS # (replace # with the disk # of the Windows disk from list in previous command)
<br />CLEAN
<br />EXIT
<br />
<br />Close Command Box, on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen choose Unallocated Space, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br />Make sure to follow the setup steps in the first link tutorial to complete your install.  Drivers are important enough that those steps are printed in red.  
<br />
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the first linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
