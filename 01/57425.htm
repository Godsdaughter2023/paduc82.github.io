<p>Hi Darion,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The system file called atikmdag.sys tends the PC to crash to a blue screen which is caused by the external graphics card drivers creating conflicts between hardware. To troubleshoot your concern, we first need to start your PC in safe mode with networking.
 Entering the safe mode environment allows the device to start Windows with minimal services, processes and drivers. Click this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ca/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link</a> to learn how to start your PC in safe mode with networking and follow the on-screen instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After starting your PC in safe mode, we need to uninstall the driver that causes the issue. Follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows</strong> key + <strong>X</strong> &gt; Select <strong>Device Manager</strong>.</li><li>Expand <strong>Display adapters</strong> &gt; Right-click on your graphics driver &gt; Choose
<strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Driver</strong> tab &gt; Click <strong>Uninstall</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>After uninstalling the driver,</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Control Panel</strong> &gt; Select <strong>Programs</strong> &gt;Click
<strong>Programs and Features</strong>.</li><li>Uninstall the program related to your graphics card (depending on the brand).</li><li>Restart your computer.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once you're done with the troubleshooting above, download and install the latest driver on the video card manufacturer's website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted with the result.</p>

<p>Hi Darion,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might have experience the same issue due Windows version not being updated. There may be some corrupted files that prevents your computer to have the updates. Having said that, we suggest that you run DISM and SFC tool. Kindly refer to this article for
 the steps: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Use the System File Checker tool to repair missing or corrupted system files</a>. As what stated on the article, you will need to run DISM tool prior to running the SFC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how it goes.</p>

<p>well, i did all those steps, and those were the results http://prntscr.com/hr1k4n</p>
<p>so, it seems like there wasn't problems, at least it seems.</p>
<p>Hope it doesn't keeps crashing, now i can't even open a game 'cause it's almost instant BSOD</p>
<p>so, i wanna ask something, my mom keeps connecting things until we have a power cut, happens almost all the time i'm playing/working, so, could it be hardware damage?</p>
<p>and, with that upgrade, i meant a driver update, but then i had a problem 'cause the installer didn't recognize the GPU or CPU, well, didn't recognize some part of the hardware so i'm kinda out of date with the video driver, one version i think</p>

            Hi Darion, <br />
<br />
A Fast Startup closes all Windows and logs off all users. The PC is like freshly booted but the&nbsp; Windows kernel is loaded and the system session is running. We just want to verify if you have done this process, if yes, kindly continue to the next step and finally
 if the issue persist&nbsp; as what the <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/14238/windows-10-troubleshoot-blue-screen-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> suggested you can go ahead and contact a virtual support agent

<h2>            Browsers can&#8217;t connect to the internet in Windows 7</h2>
                    I’m using Windows 7 and neither Firefox nor IE will find any website. Internet is working on other devices in the home. Ping test on this device comes back okay (connects to google.ca). IPv6 says no connection and IPv4 sometimes says no connection, other
 times it’s okay. I have tried re-setting LAN to auto-detect, and unchecking proxy server options. Tried DOS cmd prompt ipconfig/release and ipconfig/ renew. Tried all in Safe Mode, too. The error msg is no proxy server connection with IE and with Firefox it
 says “the remote device or resource won’t accept the connection”. Nothing has helped. Browser loads okay, but will not even make a reasonable attempt to connect to a site. Anyone have any help to offer?

<h2>            Keyboard &#38; cursor not working after Wndows 10 update</h2>
                    Since a Windows 10 update 17 Feb 2018, my keyboard does not work and there is no cursor. I also get a bleep/triple bleep sound every ten seconds. All of the suggestions that I have seen require use of keyboard&nbsp;or mouse. I have tried without success to
 get into Safe mode, so my computer is currently useless (the keyboard and mouse do work in BIOS mode, so the problem is definitely in Windows). Help!

<p>Thank you for your reply. I arrived at Windows Reset via my Dell Backup &amp; Restore USB drive, but then the program said there was&nbsp;a disc error, scanning and repairing. Then back to Reset and the same routine over again several times, even though the scan
 and repair routine said already fixed. Tried Dell Backup &amp; Recovery, but got an error in the Recovery phase. After several tries it seemed to have succeeded, then startup gave Dell automatic repair, unable to repair, go to Windows Reset which did the same
 as described above.</p>
<p>Finally did a Dell Recovery without backup, now have Windows with keyboard &amp; cursor working , but re-installing all the programs previously in use. Note that the keyboard and cursor worked fine in the recovery mode, from which I conclude that the problem
 was with the Windows 10 update. I am on the way to recovery, but Apple or Linux are&nbsp;starting to look interesting.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> masmo eka  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can disable switch between different input languages &#40;&#61; keyboard languages&#41; by pressing the Alt &#43; Shift keys&#63; __</h2>
                    Though i can achieve from following steps <br />
<br />
<ol>
<li>
<p>From the Start menu, choose Control Panel.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In Control Panel , select Regional and Language Options.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the Regional And Language Options dialog box, on the Languages tab, in the Text Services And Input Languages section, click Details.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the Text Services And Input Languages dialog box, in the Preferences section, click Key Settings.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the Advanced Key Settings dialog box, click Change Key Sequence.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the Change Key Sequence dialog box, clear the Switch Input Languages check box, and click OK.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the Advanced Key Settings dialog box, click OK.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the Text Services And Input Languages dialog box, click OK.</p>
</li><li>
<p>In the Regional And Language Options dialog box, click OK.<br />
<br />
But i need some registry key settings to do the above trick for me , since it is difficult to do it on number of PC's which needs users to restrict the swith between input languages.<br />
Any idea or help is greatly appreciated.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.</p>

<p>Hi,<br />
I've found the place where exactly this can be restricted :).<br />
<br />
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Keyboard Layout\Toggle]<br />
"Hotkey"="1"<br />
"Language Hotkey"="3"<br />
"Layout Hotkey"="2"</p>
<p>change the value of "Language Hotkey" accordingly.<br />
<br />
1 Key Sequence enabled; use Left-ALT+SHIFT to switch between locales. <br />
2 Key Sequence enabled; use CTRL+SHIFT to switch between locales. <br />
3 Key Sequences disabled. <br />
4 If the default locale is Thai, the accent grave key toggles input locales; otherwise key sequences are disabled.<br />
<br />
One more problem is that , it resides under HKCU so even if i pack this setting with MSI , it will not be of any use to me . Since , MSI installation is done using localadmin account and HKCU is coupled with that particular session. If a new user who logs on
 this settting is not applied and even if he does will throw 'access denied' :(<br />
<br />
Hope this helps someone with similar problem.<br />
Thank you.</p>

                    There is no "Windows Fax and Scan" that I can find on my HP Laptop, which is running Vista.&nbsp; I'm stumped.

<p><span>It depends on your version of Vista, as to whether you have Fax Software installed.</span></p>
<p><span>Home versions do not have Fax Software.</span></p>

<p><span>Snappy Fax enables you to send and receive faxes from your computer. You can either use your scanner to scan documents and then fax them to any fax machine, or use the Print command from other applications to use the virtual Fax printer, which allows
 you to send faxes directly from most Windows applications. In addition, the program also supports sending faxes via the internet, filtering of junk faxes and forwarding of incoming faxes to other fax machines or email addresses. Additional features include
 address book import, faxes by email (with zip support for images), OCR, spell checking and much more.</span></p>

Find out how to restore/recover the system to factory defaults (your system manufacturer will have given you a way.)

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Here is the HP information link on the different ways&nbsp;to take your machine back to Factory Settings (new condition)</p>
<p>You can press F11 at Boot or use the HP Recovery Manager to start the Recovery Process.</p>
<p>And if all&nbsp;that fails, you can order Recovery Disks from HP to do the same.</p>

            <p>If you're going to persist in going to areas you "shouldn't be in" you possibly need a program like this in addition to your antimalware product.&nbsp; Never used it but I've read positive remarks about it.&nbsp; Don't know how much it costs...never pursued it.</p>

            <p>You are describing the process of using the Windows startup repair options. The post currently marked as Answer provides you with specific details on how to restore your specific PC to factory condition using the HP Recovery process. Use that, not the Windows
 Repair functionality.</p>
<p>As for the administrator password, that may have been set when the PC was first configured.</p>

<p>I empathize with your situation, would you be willing to provide further details.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>What version of the 360 are you using? Standard or Slim?</p>
<p><br />
Are you using wired or wireless? (if wired is it a&nbsp;statically assigned IP address?)</p>

<p><br />
Home Network configuration, ISP? Router Model and version number? How many pieces of equipment are in the route between the xbox and your connection to the net. &nbsp; (Example. Cable Modem &gt; Router &gt; Wire to XBOX/Wireless to Xbox)</p>
<p><br />
(forgot to add) have you made any recent updates to the router?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey Red, thank you for posting more information in your <a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/f/9/t/234660.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
second post</a>. &nbsp;Just a friendly reminder that it usually is best to stick with 1 post when you're trying to troubleshoot an issue.<br />
<br />
That being said you posted that, <strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><em>&nbsp;"The wireless adapter wont even connect to the router whereas the ethernet cable continually links me to this error. Any help would be appreciated as of this moment I have no access and
 can see no possible way to re-connect to xbox LIVE."<br />
<br />
</em></span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Excellent information, you are trying to bridge the connection from your laptop to your xbox, now, I am going to guess your laptop is connecting to the network wireless&nbsp;or does your laptop have 2 ethernet connections?&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Also, are you running windows 7?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>As for more information, the xbox is an standard white one. And I have done the ethernet through to a laptop and enabled sharing which has given me access to the internet but not any ability to access xbox live. Whereas using a wireless adapter that is my
 friends I cannot even gain access to the internet. As for other information nothing about my home internet network has changed whilst I have been away. The last time I was home and connected around the 5th of January everything was working fine and that was
 using automated network settings. Unfortunately I dont have the ability to wire it straight into a modem so that isn't a possibilty either. Also the laptop being used for the ethernet connection is a windows 7 laptop.</p>

<p>Well, my suggestion to plug the xbox directly into your router however, since you've stated this is not possible we can try to work around that.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your laptop connects just fine I am assuming since you are posting here. &nbsp;In your network connection settings is your wireless network set as a home network, or is it set to something else?<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also I am going to assume that the cable you are using is the same cable you've used in the past to connect? You haven't changed that out by chance? Borrowed a different one? something of that nature?<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>When you test your network settings on the laptop how far does the test go?</p>
<p>Network: Failed?<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Internet: Failed?<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Xbox LIVE: Failed?</p>

<h2>            FSX Always Crashing</h2>
                    <p>Hello, </p>
<p>I got FSX 5 years ago, but didn't played it. I got it on windows 7 and it was always crashing after flying sometime. I got windows 8, now the game (Flight Simulator X-Deluxe&nbsp;Edition-Acceleration)&nbsp;crashes after changing a plane, loading a new flight plan,
 every time I got into a menu option in-flight, and then when i'm returning to flight the game crashes. I already&nbsp;tried this:
<a href="http://www.venetubo.com/fsx.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://www.venetubo.com/fsx.html</strong></a>&nbsp;(don't sure how it's called but it is replacing my FSX.CFG) and the problem still exist.
</p>
<p>I'm using some add-ons to improve the graphics and here they are (maybe they are the cause of the problem):
</p>
<p>3D lights from A2A</p>
<p>Beauty World FX </p>
<p>FSUIPC 4 (it's not an improve but I saw something about it) </p>
<p>Can some give ideas for how to fix my issues, please? </p>
<p>Thank You </p>
<p>Maksim</p>

            <p>Hi Maksim,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Do you receive any error messages?</p>
<p>2. Did you try an upgrade installation from Windows 7 to Windows 8?</p>
<p>3. What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue may occur due to corrupt installations of the game.</p>
<p>Since the game crashes in Windows 8 computer, let's try the following steps and check.</p>
<p>Method 1:</p>
<p>Step 1:</p>
<p>I would suggest you to repair Flight Simulator X installation. To repair insert the Flight Simulator X disc and click on 'Repair'.</p>
<p>Step&nbsp;2:</p>
<p>If the issue persists then reinstall Flight Simulator X, to do so:</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><font>a) </font></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press 'Windows key + R' on your keyboard to bring the run dialog box.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">b) Type 'appwiz.cpl', in the list select 'Flight Simulator X' and uninstall it.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">c) Insert the Flight Simulator X disc and reinstall the game.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Method 2:</p>
<p>You may also try installing the latest version of graphic card drivers by referring to the computer manufacturer website and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regarding the problem with Prepar3D, you may also get in touch with <span><a href="http://www.prepar3d.com/forum-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font>Prepar3D Support</font></a><font color="#000000"> and check.
</font></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Hope the information helps. Let us know if you need further assistance with Windows related issues. We will be happy to help.</span></p>

<h2>            The operating system &#40;W 8.1 Pro&#41; version is incompatible with Startup Repair &#40;from W 8.0 Pro Upgrade Disk&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi Folks,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rebuilt the Windows RE after upgrading to W 8.1 Pro from W 8.0 Pro using Command Prompts, recimg.exe and reagentc.exe. I now can get into Startup Repair through the boot up without using the Install DVD but I get the subject line at the bottom of the usual
 tests that come out 0x0 (same as I get from the DVD).</p>

<p>
</p><p>I believe, if I could get a W 8.1 Pro ISO, I could get proper WIM images that are directly compatible with W 8.1 Pro. Every time I have tried, I could only get W 8.0 Pro ISO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Is it possible to get a W 8.1 Pro ISO?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Where could I get the appropriate W 8.1 Pro "install.wim" and "boot.wim" (for the WinRE.wim") files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use DISM and SFC zealously which are coming out clean. I do not know how to get the above files into the component image store. Perhaps somebody could guide as to how to get them that way, then I could copy them into my Windows RE locations?</p>
<p>

            <p><span>Hi Crysta,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The disc for Windows 8.1 is not available from Microsoft. If you decide to install Windows 8.1 through a disc, you need to purchase one. However, it would be a clean installation and not an
 upgrade. If you would like to do it for free, you need to create a recovery media for Windows 8 and then upgrade to Windows 8.1 through Windows Store.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may refer to the article to
<strong>create an installation media for Windows 8.1</strong>:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to refer to the article and try to create a USB recovery drive which will help you in repairing the operating system:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Create a USB recovery drive</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-usb-recovery-drive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-usb-recovery-drive</span></a></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: Creating a recovery drive will erase anything already stored on your USB flash drive. Use an
 empty USB flash drive or make sure to transfer any important data from your USB flash drive to another storage device before using it to create a USB recovery drive.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If your PC came with&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;8&nbsp;and you upgraded it to&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;8.1, your recovery drive will include&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;8, and you’ll need to upgrade to&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;8.1&nbsp;after you refresh or reset your PC.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope it helps. If you have any further issues on the computer, please post your question related to Windows and we will be happy to help you.</span></p>

<p><span>Hi </span>Rohit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies for the slow reply, I was not well.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;The disc for Windows 8.1 is not available from Microsoft. If you decide to install Windows 8.1 &gt;&gt;&gt;through a disc, you need to purchase one. However, it would be a clean installation and not &gt;&gt;&gt;an upgrade. If you would like to do it for free, you

<p>
</p><p><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;If your PC came with Windows 8 and you upgraded it to Windows 8.1, your recovery drive will &gt;&gt;&gt;include Windows 8, and you’ll need to upgrade to Windows 8.1 after you refresh or reset your &gt;&gt;&gt;PC.&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought my question was clear about what I have Installed, but may be not??? I already have W 8.1 Pro Installed. As far as creating a recovery media in W 8.0 Pro, that wasn't possible because it didn't work! It is only recently that I have learned how
 to reconstruct the "Windows RE". I have not had that working since I left W 7 SP 1. I bought W 8.0 Pro Update DVD on the introductory offer. My Recovery Partition is only 100 MB on this Work Station Tower, not near big enough for Windows 8.x RE. If I can gain
 some confidence in the RE, I will make the Recovery Partition bigger, so it will hold the 2 WIM's plus a custom WIM. About 35 - 40 GBs should do it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;You may refer to the article to <strong>create an installation media for Windows 8.1</strong>:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt; http://windows.microsoft.com/en-IN/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>"Important<br />
<br />
If you don't have a Windows 8.1 product key, you can't create installation media. You can't use a Windows 8 product key for this.<br />
<br />
Make sure the USB flash drive or DVD you're using has nothing else stored on it, and has enough free space to download the Windows 8.1 Setup program: about 1.8 GB for the 32-bit version and about 2.3 GB for the 64-bit version."</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is hardly a solution, IF W 8.1 Pro is truly an UPDATE, BUT this suggests that W 8.1 Pro is a full blown REISSUE of the OS. So I would guess what MS is saying, "We will give you the Update for FREE, but Charge you to Repair it". Interesting???? With
 W 7 SP 1, if one did not have a DVD, one could D/L the ISO. As the following shows, your Website doesn't even realize I have W 8.1 Pro installed???</p>
<p>
</p><p>"The information on this page applies to Windows 8.1. Get the free update now"</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;I would suggest you to refer to the article and try to create a USB recovery drive which will &gt;&gt;&gt;help you in repairing the operating system:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;Create a USB recovery drive</span></strong></p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>This is the first time on W 8.x Pro that I have been able to successfully create a USB Recovery Drive(I would have preferred a DVD), probably because I have learned how to reconstruct the Windows RE but I still have the same incomparability with the
 "Repair Run" as I originally had, so I am no further ahead even though the ReAgent.xml says I have W 8.1 Pro:</span></p>

</p><p>I find it very interesting, when I tested the W 8.1 Pro PREVIEW, I did not have these problems. On the PREVIEW. I was able to make Repair DVD's and run Recovery and Refresh????</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will play with this more on one my alternate OS test Partitions(I have 2 of them with W 8.1 Pro) and see if there is any possibility of Reliable Repair, Refresh, or Recovery options with Microsoft Windows. For now I put my FAITH in Paragon. I take an OS
 Image about once every 7-10 days for those same above purposes(I don't keep any Data in my OS's Partitions).</p>

            <p>Hi Rohit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I last commented I have had a brainwave. I know, but it happens once in awhile. :)) I was trying to sort out missing WU Patches and was resorting to the Feb Patch ISO and saw the W 8.1 Enterprise ISO. I thought AHA..... Why couldn't I take the Enterprise
 ISO which is 9600 and extract out the install.wim and the boot.wim &gt;&gt; Winre.wim? Why wouldn't Repair work with that? After all, the basic OS's would be the same....</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I did and Walla, Repair does run and has done this twice with the same fallowing results:</p>

</p><p>Well, I don't know what this means at this time, but my next step it going to do alternating SFC &amp; DISM RestoreHealth's and then create another USB Repair Drive and see what the results are. I have not installed the Enterprise ISO and probably won't. I checked
 it out in Preview and didn't see much that I was interested in.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any thoughts on this now? I look forward to your comments.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1</span></strong><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>Run a System File Checker (SFC) scan and check if that helps. Refer the following steps to run SFC scan:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, and then tap <strong>Search</strong>.</span><span>
<br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, and then click
<strong>Search</strong>.)</span></li><li><span>Enter “<strong>CMD</strong>” without quotes in the search box, tap or click
<strong>Apps</strong></span></li><li><span>Touch and hold the <strong>Command prompt</strong> tile in the search results. Then drag your finger down until the tile is outlined by a solid line. Once it happens release your finger from the screen.</span></li><li><span>Tap or Click <strong>Run as administrator</strong>.</span></li><li><span>In the command prompt type “<strong>sfc /scannow</strong>” without quotes and press
<strong>Enter</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>Once you have completed the SFC scan, go to the properties of any photo and check if you are able to add tags in the Details pane.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2</span></strong><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>You may also refer to the article and try repair the Windows image:</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Repair a Windows Image</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh824869.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh824869.aspx</span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 3</span></strong><span>:</span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to perform check disk on the computer. It is a command-line tool that checks volumes on your hard drive for problems:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong>Windows key + Q</strong> to search Settings.</span></li><li><span>Type “<strong>CMD</strong>”.</span></li><li><span>From the results, right click <strong>Command Prompt</strong> and Click
<strong>Run as Administrator</strong>.</span></li><li><span>At the Command Prompt, type “<strong>chkdsk /r /f</strong>” without quotes and press Enter.</span></li></ol>
<p><span>When you restart the computer, it will be scanned for errors and attempts will be made to correct them.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: While performing <strong>chkdsk </strong>
on the hard drive if any bad sectors are found, it tries to repair that sector and if any data available might be lost.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue is not resolved, let us know and we’ll be glad to help.</span></p>

            <p>Hi Rohit,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that I have already told you that I use SFC &amp; DISM religiously but OH Well, guess you missed it. I use GRC's Spinrite and sometimes ChkDsk which I have done so recently and found no sector errors, ever. So therefore I believe this approach is not
 applicable at this time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So what is? Well I have been busy using DISM, a fantastic tool for Images, to take out the "Enterprise Feature Package" out of the "Install.wim" that I got from the W 8.1 Ent ISO Install Package. This left only the "Language Package" and the "Windows Foundation
 Package" left in the Image but I still get the same Repair error. This may indicate that the problem may be in the WinRE.wim(boot.wim)? Is that where the Repair Utility is?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am thinking of taking an Current OS WIM and striping out everything but the same as above and trying that. DISM has all of the tools in it to do just this but it is a bit laborious. I will post further results here for the Community to use if they ever
 want to create a viable install.wim right from there own working W 8.1 Pro OS image. :) I have learned allot and am still learning!!!! :))</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best Regards,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Crysta</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I discovered an error that I made,&nbsp; Rohit. I seemed to have missed coping the "boot.wim &gt;&gt; Winre.wim" over to the E:\Recovery\Windows RE\ Directory. O.o I have now done that which reveled some new errors in the Startup Repair. To be quite honest with you,
 I don't believe at this point I have any errors in my Image but I don't know why Repair seems to think so. I am out of Ideas on getting Repair to run properly. I run SFC &amp; DISM .... /RestoreHealth on my Online Image and DISM .... /RestoreHealth on the "install.wim.
 I also cleaned up the component store in each before I did. As you can see below, one can not run them on Windows PE. I will run Spinrite over night but I don't expect any errors.</p>

</p><p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">MY ANSWER:</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>The fact of the matter is, is that Microsoft has no real answer to THIS CONUNDRUM that they have created. I have tried to come up with solutions using Enterprize ISO's but that has been unsuccessful!!! Here is my latest find to work around Microsoft's MESS!</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/windows-8-1-iso-download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to download Windows 8.1 ISO using Windows 8 Product Key</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you can get a W 8.1 Pro ISO on disk, use 7zip to access the pertinent contents. There should be enough info on that above, about the boot.wim and install.wim&gt;&gt;WinRE.wim.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't tried it yet but hope it helps somebody.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I can't mark my own posts as an answer, somebody else will have to, if we in fact have an answer. I find it interesting how MS BOTs care more about solutions to our problems than some of the employs???</p>

<h3> oteca  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Digital Image Suite 2006 on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I have had Digital Image Suite 2006 working on Windows 10 since 10 was released and as of yesterday (February 14, 2018) it will not re-install. The lasted update "crashed" my system and after many hours of reloading everything, I can not install Image Suite
 2006.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone explain to me as to why this update would strip all the programs used most often are not compatibly to run on the new updated Windows 10? It's 32 bit (Image Suite) and it has always worked on 64bit Windows, but not anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nobody seams to give me a straight answer, redirects and solutions to extra software I do not need.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This update has caused more problems than what good it has prior</p>

<p>I agree this is a shame as I still use DIS 2006 on a regular basis.&nbsp; However the program is 12+ years old so I've always considered that compatibility as Windows 10 progresses was a "borrowed time" thing at best.&nbsp; DIS 2006 also has a few other issues (opening
 image files beyond about 2GB, resolutions restrictions, and a few quirks with 4K displays) that reflect how far PC's have come in the last decade that it is hard to fault to program for as well.&nbsp; It's old.<br />

The good news is that it is ONLY the installer that fails on Builds past 1703 as it can no longer find the IE6 32 bit "pieces". Once the application is installed it continues to work fine on all the release builds of Windows 10 I've used so far (including the
 just-released "Spring Creators Update"&nbsp; Build 1803).<br />
<br />
A few approaches I've successfully used to keep my access to DIS 2006:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Keep an Install of Build 1703 handy so if you do have to reinstall everything on your system, you can use that build, install DIS 2006, and then let Windows Update bring you current on new builds of Windows 10 (which is what I've done the last 2 times I
 had to wipe-and-rebuild the O/S).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Do an install of Build 1703, install DIS 2006 and any other apps that still look for 32bit IE pieces (I've run across a few that I really didn't care about but your mileage may vary.&nbsp; Do the upgrade to the most current version of Windows and them make a disk
 image of that "clean" build in case you need to do a future restore.&nbsp; This is my preferred method as I do often test software on my system and occasionally have to restore to baseline.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Create a VM of Windows 7 and install DIS 2006 on it (as well as any other legacy apps you still want access to).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, one could always go to 3D Paint.... 😜</p>

            <p>Hi Gabby,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community. I understand that you wan to know why DVD Player app is not free for you. I will surely help you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To be eligible for the free DVD Player app, you must upgrade your Windows&nbsp;7,
<span>Windows&nbsp;8</span>, or <span>Windows&nbsp;8.1</span> PC rather than perform a clean installation. If you’re running an edition of Windows&nbsp;7 or
<span>Windows&nbsp;8</span> that doesn’t include Media Center and you upgrade to <span>
Windows&nbsp;10</span>, go to Windows Store to buy Windows DVD Player or another app that plays DVDs. Provided your PC has an optical disc drive, Windows DVD Player will play DVD movies (but not Blu‑ray Discs).</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3> ksan1  say:</h3>
<h2>            fs9 atc stutters</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;Hi, I have a problem with stuttering with both the atc and pilot voice.&nbsp; I have tried disabling<br />
the sound card, and no joy.&nbsp; My sound cards are up to date and I have not experienced any<br />
other sound problems.&nbsp; The engine sounds, etc are fine.&nbsp; The instructional voices are good.&nbsp;
<br />
DirectX says everything ok.&nbsp; I don't know how to adjust/shut down the "accelerators"??. I<br />
recently did a system restore and virus/malware scan and have all the latest Windows updates.&nbsp;
<br />
I tested the sound and have the same problem even with FS9 being the only installed software<br />
(aside from what came with the factory). I have re-installed fs9 several times with the same<br />
problem (yes I purchased the discs).&nbsp; I have also lowered the various settings to minimum and
<br />
lowered framerate but to joy there. I love to fly (former CFII with medical limitations<br />
which makes FS9 a godsend).&nbsp; The interactive ATC system is great and if I could just get the
<br />
stutter to stop I would love it.&nbsp; Many thanks to anyone with some good Ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp; KSAN1. specs:

<p>Acer Aspire 5251 (notebook), AMD processor, V120 (2.2GHz), ATI Mobility Radeon HD 4250 Graphics<br />

    <title>Gamertag and account gone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dttruax  say:</h3>
<h2>            Gamertag and account gone</h2>
                    So my son’s profile disappeared from his xbox one. &nbsp;It took dozens of tries on recovery quesstionnaire to verify sccount csuse he couldnt remember his password. We entered his email, name, birthday, gamertag and console ID. We received verification from
 microsoft but when he logged in with email and new password its a new gamertag and his dozens of games are gone. Phoned xbox support many times to be told that the email he is using isnt connected to his orginal gamertag. This is confusing since we used that
 gsmertag and email to get verification from microsoft. Afraid he lost all his games he has been collecting. Microsoft keeps sending us in circles.

<p>Hey there dttruax, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear you are running into this problem. Unfortunately in this case you would need to remember what email was used with the original account. Now of course Customer support would be able to assist if you do have up to date security proofs on your
 account where you can receive security codes. If the account information is not completely up to date then that's where we can run into problems.
</p>
<p>Once you have been able to recover the correct email address you should be able to go through the
<a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Account Recovery processes
</a>and recover the account. </p>
<p>

            Like i said been through the recovery process and used the original email and gamertag in the process. Dont understand if this info was incorrect why would microsoft verify account? When we did get logged back in it was a brand new gamertag. Using his
 original gamertag in recovery process it should have been denied if it wasnt correct with that email

<p>
</p><p>When you do fill out the form it allows you to submit the information and because it is not matching that's when it does deny access to resetting the password. I understand you are saying that you are using the original email address but if it is pulling
 up the wrong Gamertag then this is because it is not the correct email address. You would need that to

<p>The games are attached to the account themselves. That seems like that's what causing the problem.</p>

<p>What it sounds like happened is that the email that your son thought was attached to the gamertag was not that email and you recovered the account for a different profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best thing to do in a situation like this is to contact xbox support by going to support.xbox.com/contact-us and give them your sons gamertag and if they can verify ownership of the account they can give you the email that would be associated with that
 gamertag.</p>

<p>Hi All,</p>
<p>I have installed GTA4 in Windows7 Home without any problem, but when I am running the application it is failing to start and giving a message that windows parental controls may be blocking the application, make sure you have rights to access the application.
 As I am ruunig an admin account as parental controls are not applicable on admin account, still it is showing the same message and game is not starting.</p>
<p>I found some solutions on&nbsp;internet, like, running the&nbsp;game(program) in compatiblity mode of XP SP3 or Vista, but still the application doesnt start.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kindly let me know if anyone faced the same issues and have any solution&nbsp;for the mentioned problem.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The only way that I have found that someone else was able to fix this was with a &nbsp;factory reset of the console. It may be caused by corruption of an update. They used the Offline System Update Diagnostic tool to accomplish this (<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-one/system/offline-system-update-diagnostic-tool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../offline-system-update-diagnostic-tool</a>)</p>

<p>It references installing on a Netbook, but the same principles apply to a desktop computer.</p>
<p>----------------</p>
<p><br />
And that’s it, the next step now is to boot your&nbsp;Computer from the thumb drive, make sure the thumb drive you will be installing Windows 7 from is plugged into the USB port. This might vary by manufacturer, but the usual one to try is F12, start your Computer
 and press F12 repeatedly until a screen is displayed giving you the option to boot from a USB Memory device, select that and press Enter on your keyboard.
</p>
<span>
<p>- Samsung uses ESC on most of its systems<br />
<br />
- HP uses F9 on most of its systems<br />
<br />
- Fujitsu uses F12 on most of its systems<br />
<br />
- Acer uses F12 on most of its systems, but you often need to go into the BIOS to enable it<br />
</p>

<p>- Dell uses F12</p>

<p>In general, look at the screen during POST for a hint about what is possible.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3&#58; scrolling issues in long documents - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ill_rendition  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3&#58; scrolling issues in long documents</h2>
                    <p>In any large text document I cannot scroll through the document using two-finger swipe. I also cannot scroll through by swiping on the screen; instead, the screen automatically selects text when I swipe. When the document is not very large, both of these
 features work fine. This is greatly&nbsp;lowering the efficiency of use of my surface pro 3 as I am a writer and bought this primarily to be able to work on writing books on the go. To be unable to easily swipe through large documents is turning out to be&nbsp;a huge
 inconvenience. This problem shows up in Word and even in Scrivener. As soon as the document gets too long, swiping malfunctions. Anyone else seeing this problem? Any fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for your contribution to the Surface Community. I apologize for the inconvenience, and I fully understand your frustration when you cannot scroll the document, especially when it's for your work. I'd love to help you get this issue resolved.</p>
<ul>
<li>First and foremost, do you have all Windows updates?</li><li>When did this issue start appearing?</li><li>Is this app specific, or happens whenever a document becomes large? I understand that you are experiencing the issue on Word and Scrivener - does this happen on a web browser, Notepad, etc. (wherever text is), as well?</li><li>Are you using a Cover (Type Cover/Touch Cover/Power Cover)? If so, does the touchpad function properly?</li><li>If this is app/program specific, have you tried uninstalling and reinstalling them?</li></ul>
<p>Please let me know. Hope to hear from you.</p>

            <p>Hi Shiho_P,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have all of the Windows updates. This issue has been present since I bought the SP3. I just copied and pasted a book into Notepad and found that the scrolling works fine there. The scrolling also works fine in both Scrivener and Word in smaller documents.
 Up to around 40-50 pages or so the scrolling is fine. In a document with 100+ pages the scrolling does not work and I am forced to use page-up/page-down so navigate through the document or the sidebar scrolling. Two finger scrolling or swiping the screen does
 not work. I have not uninstall/reinstalled Word and Scrivener yet. I will try that this evening.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your answers.</p>
<p>I understand that you have no problem with Notepad, and Scrivener and Word are working fine as long as they are smaller documents. I have tried reproducing the issue myself, but Word worked fine and I was able to scroll through 100+ pages.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When two finger scrolling or swiping on the screen stop working, are you able to use the touchpad on the Cover to navigate?<br />
As suggested in my previous response, please let me know the results after uninstalling and reinstalling Scrivener and Word.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know your findings.</p>

            <p>Looks like my reply from last week didn't post for some reason. I uninstalled and reinstalled both Word and Scrivener. I'm still having the same problem with Word. If I try to scroll by using two-finger swipe on the touchpad it doesn't work, and if I try
 to scroll by swiping the screen it automatically selects text instead of scrolling. However, in Scrivener the two-finger swipe on the touchpad works now. Scrivener still has the same problem as Word when I try to scroll by swiping on the screen.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your suggestion, at least Scrivener is somewhat more usable now. Any other suggestions as to how I can fix Word? It's the 2007 Home and Student version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            This seems to be some systemic problem that doesn't just affect Surface Pro. I just purchased an expensive HP laptop and it has the same problem in that it will not scroll for large documents. As an experiment, I open a large document in Word and try to
 scroll as soon as the first page is displayed. Scrolling works until the amount of the loaded document reaches some threshold and then it stops. None of the support people from MS or HP seem to have any idea what might be causing this.

    <title>Windows activation troubleshooter is missing - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows activation troubleshooter is missing</h2>
                    <p>So I upgraded my hardware recently and now Windows 10 isn't activated anymore.&nbsp; I was told to go to the troubleshooter on the activation page, but there's no troubleshooter there.&nbsp; So... How do I get to the troubleshooter?&nbsp; Is there something I can do to
 make it appear on the page?&nbsp; Is there a command I can run to bring it up?&nbsp; And yes, Windows is fully up to date.</p>

<p>Hi Silly,</p>
</span><span>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Activation</strong> helps verify that your copy of Windows is genuine and hasn’t been used on more devices than the Microsoft Software License Terms allow. Depending on how you got your copy of Windows 10, activation will use either a digital license
 or a 25-character product key. </p>
<p>
</p><p>If you made a significant hardware change to your device (such as replacing the motherboard) Windows 10 might no longer be activated. If you're running Windows 10 (Version 1607) and added your Microsoft account and linked it to the digital license on your
 device, you can use the Activation troubleshooter to reactivate Windows. </p>

I would really really like to use the troubleshooter, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
but it's not there.</span>&nbsp; I can't click on a thing that doesn't exist, so please, if there's another way I can launch it, I would really like to know.&nbsp; And for reference, this is what I'm looking at:<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3f17f664-0e5c-45ba-b75b-35695a58112a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3f17f664-0e5c-45ba-b75b-35695a58112a" /></a>
<p>
</p><p>If you can find a troubleshooter in this image, by all means, show me where it is, or if you know why it's not there, please let me know so that I can fix it.</p>

            <p>Hi, Silly!</p>
<p>
The Activation Troubleshooter is only available on Windows 10 1607 version.<br />
To make sure that you have the correct version, please check by pressing the Windows key + R and type in winver then press Enter.<br />
If you are still not on the 1607 version, I would suggest updating your system first so you will be able to activate your your Windows 10.

<p>I only noticed this issue while trying to update to Anniversary Update. Had issues with the installer crashing, and this led me to realise that somehow it was no longer updated (even though it had previously been).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyways, I managed to enter a product key I had used for Win 8 Pro and upgraded to 10 (I *think*). Hopefully I picked the right one and one of my other machines doesn't now lose it's activation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to update again now. *fingers crossed*</p>

            If you are having trouble updating to 1607, I suggest using the Media Creation Tool to manually download and install the latest Windows build and version to your computer.
