<h2>            GTA V - Installationsprobleme</h2>
                    
<p>Ich habe mir gestern gta 5 über xbox live gekaut und heruntergeladen doch als ich das Spiel starten wollte kam eine Meldung "gta 5 installation pack 1,2,3,4 konnte nicht heruntergeladen werden". Ich habe aber genug speicher frei bzw einen usb stick wo das
 spiel auch drauf installiert wurde aber die Meldung lässt sich nicht umgehen und dann hängt sich die xbox bei "lade story modus". Kann mir jemand dabei helfen ?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Danke schon mal im voraus</p>

<p>[quote user="Itzizzyitzeasy"]Ich habe mir gestern gta 5 über xbox live gekaut[/quote]</p>
<p>Vielleicht hängt Dir noch ein kleiner Teil davon zwischen den Zähnen? Oder fehlt ein "L" und Du die Xbox hat erkannt, dass Du das Spiel geklaut hast, oder fehlt ein "F" und Du hast es ordnungsgemäß gekauFt?</p>
<p>[quote user="Itzizzyitzeasy"] Ich habe aber genug speicher frei bzw einen usb stick wo das spiel auch drauf installiert wurde aber die Meldung lässt sich nicht umgehen und dann hängt sich die xbox bei "lade story modus".[/quote]</p>
<p>Wie genau hast Du das Spiel installiert? Das Problem ist, dass GTA V eigentlich darauf ausgelegt war, dass es von zwei Datenträgern (der Festplatte und beispielsweise der Disc) gleichzeitig laden kann.
</p>
<p>Wenn Du das Spiel komplett nur auf USB Stick hast, kann es sein, dass der Stick zu langsam ist und daher der Start nicht funktioniert.

<h2>            Windows 7&#58; Nothing happens after I accept running something as admin</h2>
                    <p>So,</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of a sudden my computer has stopped working properly, the only thing that changed was that I connected to a network in a hotel so my guess is some kind of virus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main problem is, I cannot run ANYTHING as an administrator (either by clicking or the command prompt)</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I click, then it will ask me as usual if i want to continue, I say yes, and nothing happens, the screen remain gray (as it does when the prompt appears and nothing happens regardless how long I wait). &nbsp;if I press ctrl+Alt+Sup then I can get out of there
 but the programm will not run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I try from the command line using runas /user:Administrator it will give me an error of access denied&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried changing my UAC settings also from the command line and could not do it either. (I used&nbsp;</p>
<pre><code>C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /k %windir%\System32\reg.exe ADD HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System /v EnableLUA /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f
</code></pre>
<div>
<p><code>or</code></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe
 /k %windir%\System32\reg.exe ADD HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System /v EnableLUA /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f</span></p>
<p>neither work, again error:access denied.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran my antivirus (AVG) and did not find anything. I ran bitdefender online (since I do not need to run it as admin) and also found nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cannot run malwarebytes because it needs admin rights. and I ran it from safe mode but did not find anything (which is weird since malwarebytes always finds at least a dozen errors each time I run it). But I cannot run it in normal mode again because of
 the admins rights.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also cannot install a new antivirus.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So basically I am effed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone has any suggestions? (that are not return it to factory settings)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either to bypass the admin rights so I can run another antivirus or any other ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

<p>This would be rather drastic. Here is a better method:</p>
<p>1. Keep tapping F8 during the early boot phase.<br />
2. Select Repair from the menu.<br />
3. Select an admin account, then enter its password.<br />
4. Select System Restore when prompted.<br />
5. Set Windows back to a point before this problem occurred.<br />

<h2>            Why do i get a windows varification message every time i stat my PC&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have an issue with a new PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After a windows 10 upgread messed up some of the menu options I opted to run a "recovery" and reinstall windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But ever since I've done this I get a CMD prompt every time I start the computer that's trying to verify windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure you can imagine its a little frustrating so I wondered if there's a way to get rid of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the CMD prompt message...</p>
<p>
</p><div>C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt;if exist c:\windows\oem\oeg\ProductKey.cmd start c:\windows\oem\oeg\ProductKey.cmd /wait</div>
<div>C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt;start slmgr -ato</div>
<div>C:\WINDOWS\system32&gt;cd\</div>
<div>C:\&gt;cd windows\oem\oeg</div>
<div>
<p>C:\Windows\oem\oeg&gt;powershell -executionpolicy bypass -file update.ps1</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then a few seconds after I get a pop up which tells me that windows if verified!</p>
<p>
</p><p>(this also confuses me as if its been verified then why does it keep running the script every time I start the PC).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help / explanation would be great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main system change I made was to run a factory reset to overcome the original problem from the windows 10 upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it is only since then that the CMD prompt runs just after start up with the text i'd highlighted above.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After this text has finished running I get the following pop up on screen...</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4c43d940-2453-4099-bf18-bd29eb6b00ad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4c43d940-2453-4099-bf18-bd29eb6b00ad" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>then I press OK and it goes away.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The challenge is that this happens every time I start the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(and I don't understand why of the "product has been activated successfully").</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then to answer your other questions...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The credentials I am using are a local user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No I am not connected to a domain network</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooting - just the factory reset</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if you can help.</p>

<p>Thanks for updating us. One of the possible reasons why you get this error is due to a 3rd-party program that is loading up in the background.

                    <p>I have been having no luck creating a&nbsp;working&nbsp;scheduled task in the Windows 10 Task Scheduler.&nbsp; This particular task is intended to wake the PC from sleep mode to later perform a automatic daily system restore point.&nbsp; The wakeup task&nbsp;does not work and has
 reported in the History tab that scheduled task was missed.&nbsp; I have checked and the PC is in sleep mode at the time the task is to run.&nbsp; After the task fails to run I can manually wake the PC from sleep and find that the start menu has been opened.&nbsp; I'm&nbsp;setting
 up this task with&nbsp;administrator&nbsp;privileges.&nbsp; I ran a&nbsp;troubleshooting process for power problems that I found in this forum.&nbsp; The troubleshooter did find two errors and corrected them.&nbsp;&nbsp;The corrections had no effect.&nbsp; I have successfully created two other scheduled
 task and they tested good.&nbsp; One task is to create a daily system restore point.&nbsp; The other is to shut&nbsp;down the PC after the other two are completed.&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyone had this problem and knows how it is corrected?&nbsp; Tnx</p>

            The&nbsp;clean boot made no difference.&nbsp; I disabled all third party software and all Microsoft services resulting in no improvements.&nbsp; This PC has no third party virus program and relies on the ISP antivirus program and Windows Defender.&nbsp; This problem appears
 regardless of the IE being connected to the internet.&nbsp; Any other ideas of what to try.

            Thank you for your response to my inquiry.&nbsp; It has no third party antivirus software.&nbsp; I run Windows Defender only.&nbsp; I did disable Defender and got no change.&nbsp; I do run Seti At Home, and had disabled it with no change.&nbsp; I have not added any third party
 software recently.&nbsp;I had previously performed a safe boot and the problem persisted in safe boot mode.&nbsp; I had also disabled everything in the start up list.&nbsp; Let me add that in addition I have experienced failure of the two tasks I had reported worked correctly.&nbsp;
 I am at a dead end with no ideas left.&nbsp; Tnx

Creating a new use account did not change the problem.&nbsp; Windows 10 was not able to find the power restore command prompt (<strong>powercfg –restoredefaultschemes).&nbsp;
</strong>It's odd that I cannot use an administrator account for setting up a task. :)

            <p>I sucessfully installed the ISO file.&nbsp; When I run&nbsp; it from the shortcut, a message immediately appears saying "checking for updates."&nbsp; A couple of seconds later a white window appears saying "Thank You for updating to the lastest windows 10".&nbsp; Nothing appears
 to happen.&nbsp; After waiting a period of time I click on the Exit button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FYI, Two weeks ago, long after I found that the task scheduler was not working I&nbsp;began having problems with adware interferring with Internet Explorer.&nbsp; Windows defender had problems&nbsp;detecting it.&nbsp; I then downloaded the latest Defender update, and it continued
 to give no warning of the virus.&nbsp; Running a system restore seemed to disable it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About two hours later Defender reported it had detected the trojan.&nbsp; It was identified as "Trojan:win32/fethar.b!cl".&nbsp;&nbsp; I instructed&nbsp;Defender to remove and delete it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday that same trojan appeared again.&nbsp; I performed another system restore to&nbsp;be rid of the problem.&nbsp; Defender as yet has not reported it to me. &nbsp;A search today revealed that
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/entry.aspx?Name=Trojan:Win32/Fethar.B!plock" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.microsoft.com/security/portal/threat/encyclopedia/entry.aspx?Name=Trojan:Win32/Fethar.B!plock</a>&nbsp;is present in the PC, although under a slightly different name that what Defender previously reported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect this too be concidence and not related to the Task Scheduler problems.&nbsp; But I could be wrong of course.&nbsp;

<h2>            Window&#39;s in constant reboot cycle</h2>
                    Windows 8 Bizarre start up failure/restart
<div>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hello, I've just purchased, downloaded and installed Windows 8 pro (39.99 virtual download); upgrading from Windows 7 Ultimate (64-bit).
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I do have the receipt email with the approved Windows 8 pro activation key.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The Download and installation went smoothly to the point of common system restart. On the first boot of Windows 8,I was brought to a CMD Prompt entry:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><i><b>A winpeshl.ini file is present, but no commands were successfully launched. This could be caused by incorrect formatting or an invalid executable &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;name. Please consult the documentation for more information.</b></i></div>

<div><i><b><br />
</b></i></div>
<div><i><b><br />
</b></i></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>I exited the command prompt window.</li><li>The system started to reboot as before.</li><li>I then came to a light blue window which displayed the following in the order...</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>I selected&nbsp;<b><i>Choose other options</i></b></li><li>I was brought to another light blue window witch displayed nothing that would help me start my newly purchased Windows 8 pro.</li></ul>
<div><br />
</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I have not yet been able to start Windows 8 Activation, nor have&nbsp;<i>I</i>&nbsp;been Prompted to register my approved Activation Key.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also have windows 7 still active on the computer I am upgrading win8 to, If I attempt to reinstall windows with the Windows installer helper will it make more problems for me? Considering I do have windows 8 installed just&nbsp;inaccessible&nbsp;by the looks of
 things.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Finally after I get this fixed will the win7 boot option disappear? So it goes right into win8?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you!</div>

            <p><span>Hi Bradley,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I am sorry to hear that you are getting an error “winpeshl.ini file is present, but no commands were successfully launched” while trying to upgrade to Windows 8.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>- Did you run Upgrade Assistant before upgrading to Windows 8?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I do understand the inconvenience and I will certainly help you out with this issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Here are few troubleshooting methods you may try in order to fix the issue.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Rename the WebSetup file from the following location <b>%localappdata%\Microsoft\<span>WebSetup</span></b> to
<b>WebSetup.old</b> and then try.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a. Click on Start and click on Run.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Type <strong>%localappdata% </strong>and hit enter.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Click on Microsoft Folder and see WebSetup.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Right click on WebSetup and rename it to <strong>WebSetup.old.</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Run System Update Readiness Tool and check.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>System Update Readiness Tool fixes Windows Update errors in Windows 8, Windows 7, and Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008 R2, and Windows Server 2008</strong></p>

<p><b><span>Method 3: Uninstall Security software and check.</span></b></p>

<p><b><span>Warning: </span></b><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software,

            Hello! Thank you for your speedy reply.
<div><br />
<div>I did in fact run the upgrade assistant&nbsp;prior&nbsp;to actually upgrading my windows version. I have renamed the folder AND I ran the Update tool, I will attempt to reinstalled shortly and update you with my progress.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also a quick question on the side, I heard that if you upgrade you motherboard your windows can have problems. Is this true? Perhaps should I hold off on actually installing the win8 version until I upgrade my motherboard?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Once again thank you for all your help.</div>

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro deactivated - started with misidentified hardware change&#63; Completely stuck in deactivation limbo now</h2>
                    Windows has deactivated my Windows software, mistakenly I believe - it looks like Microsoft/Windows Updater thinks I made a hardware change recently. Here's why I think that: when I request an update in Settings, Updater says its updating my computer with
 an AMD64 reference. But my laptop -- computer in question -- is equipped with an Intel CPU. I have an AMD64-equipped desktop, but I'm not trying to update that. Here's what I think happened: I got a USB plug-in for my Samsung Galalxy Note 4 cell phone, and
 plugged it into the laptop -- I was going to be somewhere where there wasn't an Internet connection for my laptop, so I wanted to be able to use MS Office apps on my laptop, then transfer them via the USB connection to my cell phone from whence I could blast
 them off into the Internet. Anyway, no sooner had I plugged in that USB device and up pops the message that my Windows system has been deactivated and needs activating. No amount of frettig with the Activation troubleshooter has

            Hello,
<br />
<br />How did you get Windows 10 on this PC ?
<br />Preinstalled, migration from W7 or W8.1, Retail version bought ?
<br />
<br />To reactivate Windows 10,
<br />Select the Start  button &gt; Settings  &gt; Update &amp; Security  &gt; Activation  and then select Troubleshoot. 
<br />
<br />If the troubleshooter can’t resolve the issue, 
<br />- if you bought your product key on a non Microsoft website, contact the seller for an exchange
<br />- else call Microsoft support to activate your Windows 10 system.
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/contactus/</a>
<br />
<br />Hope it is helpful.

            Hey Stanley the Grate (name!).  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Be aware that sometimes AMD64 refers to their copyright on 64 bit that they recently have started exercising and confuses many customers.  So it can be Intel but because it refers to 64 bit legally had to include their name.  
<br />
<br />So the deactivation may be something else entirely.  Did the Dell come from the factory activated.  If so you can read the Product Key embedded in the UEFI firmware by installing and running ProducKey:  <a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/produkey-x64.zip</a> to look for the OEM-BIOS key, copy and paste it in Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation &gt; Change Product Key.  
<br />
<br />What is the Activation Status and Edition showing at the top of the page at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Activation?  
<br />
<br />Run the Activation Troubleshooter in the same location and report back its findings.
<br />
<br />You said Phone activation didn't work but did you actually speak with Microsoft Support.  Why did they say they couldn't activate it exactly.  I would call or chat back with them and ask for supervisor to find out for sure.  Tell them you're working with an MVP in MS Community forums.  
<br />
<br />Dell Support may also help if they provided the embedded key.  Were there any hardware changes as this requires another procedure?
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and keep me posted.  If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Stanley
<br />
<br />There sort of activation problems are very common when you are signed up to the Insider program, your best option is to wait it out and with the next insider update, this situation should right itself
<br />
<br />This is the nature of being a beta tester for Windows, these glitches can and will happen due to the unstable nature of preview builds . . .

            Hi Stanley,
<br />AMD64 is common name for any processor with x86-64 architecture both Inter and AMD. This was done to distinguish the from earlier Inter 64-bit architecture (IA64, Itanium). So there is no any mistake.
<br />Did you update BIOS recently? Sometimes this operation may have similar effect.

<p>Well thanks for the clarity about what is and isn't AMD64. That makes sense. As to bios update I did that through Dell maybe 4-5 months ago. Dell updated the bios to take care of that Intel security problem. I did notice that Dell posted what might be an
 update to that update very recentlt. It looked to be more of a teeak, if that since the bios version remained the same. I almost hit update on it to see if it might address my activation problem, but then reigned my update-happy self in. I had a vision of
 bricking out my computer. Maybe I should just go ahead and get it?</p>
<p>As to how I got WinPro to begin with it was preloaded from the eBay source that I bought it from. If I go back in my records maybe I can track the dealer down. I had the impression that the computer had come out of a corporate user base.&nbsp;</p>

            Did you bought Windows 10 Pro key for unreasonably low price? This may be a source of your problem.

<br />Microsoft warns at <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/Shop.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/howtotell/Shop....</a>
<br />Beware of Product Keys Sold Separately
<br />With the exception of Product Key Cards (PKC’s) distributed with COA’s, Microsoft does not distribute products keys as standalone products. If you see a listing on an auction site, online classified ad, or other online page advertising product keys for sale, it’s a good indication that the keys are likely stolen or counterfeit. If you were to purchase and use a stolen or counterfeit product key to activate Windows installed on your PC, the key may not work for activation, may already be in use on another PC, or it might be blocked from use later by Microsoft when the key is reported stolen.

            Hi Igor, yes, I see your point about buying product keys. As far as I know, this was a fresh install of Windows 10 Pro on this computer. I bought it from an eBay seller who looked to have sold thousands of computers. I've had it for more than 2 years,
 never had any problem like this before. But it could be that the computer started off life as a Windows 7 Home machine and later morphed into a Windows 10 Pro machine. I get a product key when I run the Nirsoft software, but the product key seems not to connect.
 Something to do with the KMS. I tried working with the KMS but that hasn't worked either. Very perplexing.

            If your key ends with 3V66T this is general key and it may mean the activation was made by digital license and probably Windows 10 was upgraded from Windows 7. It is possible for second hand computer but in most case there must be a Windows 7 sticker with product key.

<p>Hi Igor, and thanks for continuing to think this through. The product ID that shows up is not one that ends in 3V66T.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The one I have, at least that shows up in the Windows Activation screen, is a 20-number product ID.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I believe that the COA is under my battery. Unfortunately I can't open the battery panel at the moment to check because I don't have the right kind of screwdriver to unscrew the panel screws at the moment. I'll try to get it open tomorrow and report back
 on that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, Dell did have a more recent bios update, which I installed with the help of a Dell update program. That probably did the computer a lot of good, but it doesn't seem to have done much to help solve my activation dilemma.</p>

            Yes, thanks, it could be the beta situation. I'll have to wait that out I guess. The Dell diagnostic software that I ran reported that the Windows update was stalled over a recent hardware change, and then said there was nothing I needed to do to fix this.
 It seemed to indicate that a solution would come along from Microsoft. It basically said not to worry. Which may or may not be a valid thing to say.

            I got this rather unbelievable problem for myself suddenly.
<div><br />
<div>Usually I use the mouse by left hand as I find it more convenient to utilise extra desk space by the left side of the keyboard that is not occupied by keypad.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I connected my MS Natural Keyboard 4000 that I brought from home to my workstation in the office recently.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Last update installed Microsoft Mouse and Keyboard Center having detected the hardware apparently.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To my surprise the mouse buttons switched back to right hand setup. So I opened the Mouse dialogue in Control Panel to swap primary and secondary keys and didn't find the option because the tab is replaced with Mouse and Keyboard Center. The latter doesn't
 have any mouse config options in it as the mouse is a Logitech one.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So Microsoft doesn't allow me to use the hardware I have as I would like it to use anymore.</div>
<div><br />

<h2>            Batman Arkham Origins On Demand version&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've noticed that both Arkham Asylum and Arkham City are available via Xbox Live On Demand (digital download). I also noticed that all the DLC for Arkham Origins is available to download On Demand but not the full game. Are there any plans for Arkham Origins
 to be available for download via the marketplace and if so when?</p>

<p>The current disc version doesn't allow for you to install the 2nd disc (Multiplayer) so perhaps that's the stumbling block for a Digital Download release...:-)</p>

    <title>System image backup fails to NAS. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> joeye7  say:</h3>
<h2>            System image backup fails to NAS.</h2>
                    
<p>I installed my Netgear gigabyte router which has USB easy share for creating a network drive. I configured my 1 terabyte USB terabyte external hard drive to the router and mapped the network drive “Z:” to both my desktop and my laptop. The problem that I
 am having is that I want to set both to create a windows backup to the network drive and when I run a windows backup, by default, since the drive is large enough windows backup automatically includes creating a system image of each computer when creating a
 backup. I get an error message “<strong>Windows backup did not complete successfully.<span>One of the backup files could not be created. Details: The system call level is not correct. Error code: 0x8078002a”</span></strong>. When I uncheck
 the checkbox for creating a system image and run a backup, the backup is successful. I tried performing the task of creating a system image to the network drive by itself and get the same error message. So I know that the problem is only when trying to backup
 a system image to the network drive. I installed the trial of acronis to create a system backup to my NAS and it completed successfully. Do you have any suggestion on what I can do to make this option functional in windows 7.</p>

<p>Hi Lucille, </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The issue that you're experiencing is a Synctoy sync issues. This is could be one of the reasons why your game encounters problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we proceed with restoring the backup of your program, let's try to troubleshoot it first and check if this can resolve the issue. For our initial fix, we suggest that you run the

</a></strong>as this can diagnose the issue and will also provide fixes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persist, we recommend that you post your query on <strong><a href="https://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/home?forum=synctoy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Social
</a></strong>forum. This forum has the software developers and IT professionals who can fully assist you and provide you the best advice on how to restore a program. On that page, simply click on the

<p>Ok I ran the windows app troubleshooter and it applied some fixes but this is really&nbsp;not my issue.&nbsp; There are no instructions on how to restore a save anywhere on the synctoy&nbsp;program.&nbsp;That's my question.&nbsp;
 this app?&nbsp; </p>
<p>I wound up just right clicking the program in windows explorer and clicked &nbsp;"restore previous versions" and it worked--I got the game back, however my icon files have changed and I can't tell a package file from a zip file they all look like a little "e"---but
 at least the game works now.&nbsp; I can't imagine why that even happened.</p>

<p>I am still looking for an answer to my question about how to restore a file that you backed up with SyncToy.&nbsp; I guess I will post this question again on the Microsoft Social forum, since there are no instructions I can find on my own on any search engine.&nbsp;
 Hopefully someone knows how to do this otherwise I don't see the purpose of this program/utility.</p>

    <title>How to uninstall all vcredist&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> s73  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to uninstall all vcredist&#63;</h2>
                    Problem started from eternal attempt to upgrade KB2538242 and KB256506. One day they was blocked from attempt to fix until I found them hidden in important updates again.First one was solved by downloading some Vcredist.msi 2005 (required for uninstall)
 and reinstalling with proper from Microsoft site. However I can't nor uninstall nor update vc 2010 redist: I have no idea by what it was installed, I clearing trash in temp folder sometime, and of course I deleted folders like "j:\e66a8f5043542b20d5ca6ddc935d73\".<br />
During install vcredist was asking for path to vc_red.msi to probably remove previous version.<br />
Was trying to find vc_red.msi for any version 2008-2010 but there is only exe available.<br />
Been trying to uninstall through "Revo uninstall", unfortunately this program only removed registry entries. Now vcredist says "newest already found".<br />
<br />
Is there solution to cleanup vc redistributable mess? Also was trying to remove all redistributables but same problems with looking for proper vc_red.msi.<br />

            Unfortunately uninstall requires .msi files from temp (I clearing this folder sometime) folders or folders already gone like "j:\e66a8f5043542b20d5ca6ddc935d73\". I cannot find any vc_red.msi required to uninstall for 2008-2010 redistributables. I tried
 to download from Microsoft, but there is only vcredist.exe and uninstall not accepting them.<br />
Same problem was with upgrading 2010 redistributable, since install required uninstall of previous version (it starting uninstall and requires some vc_red.msi).<br />
Also I can't use MicrosoftFixit.wu.LB.34286417860115948.1.1.Run.exe or MicrosoftFixit.wu.LB.32286329470264708.3.1.Run.exe as suggested (error code 8004FE2C).<br />
<br />
My goal right now to completely uninstall them all and reinstall from downloaded from Microsoft (maybe some cleanup tool exists?).<br />

            Try to unzip VC_Redit installation file, you first need to find the full version of Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable and download it like version&nbsp;9.0.30729.6161 home page is&nbsp;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=26368 it`s need to
 be extracted with 7-zip.org software 7-zip, extracted folder must be with vc_red.msi file with which it can be uninstalled I was solved similar problem in my PC by this method https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-windows_update/how-do-i-find-installation-package-vcredmsi/c3b30b0b-a70b-441e-9a28-04c97250b4fa?rtAction=1498895947722.

                    Great!<br />
I installed an awful webcam with drivers &amp; wanted to undo it with System Restore.<br />
Glad I found out now that System Restore is going to be worthless in Windows 7:<br />
<br />
System Restore did not complete successfully. Your computer's system files and settings were not changed.<br />
<br />
Details:<br />
System Restore failed to extract the file (C:\windows\system32\drivers\sfi.dat) from the restore point.<br />
An unspecified error occurred during System Restore. (0x80070005)<br />
<br />
Wow!<br />
Yes, there's an sfi.dat file in the specified folder - with a timestamp about the same as the reboot after System Restore selected.<br />
If I try and look at the Security properties of the file, Explorer tells me to continue I must be an administrative user with permission to view the object's security properties / If I try and Continue, I'm told I don't have permission to view this object's
 security properties. To view them I can try taking ownership of the object. <br />
Current owner: Unable to display the current owner.<br />
<br />
It will not allow me to take ownership - "Unable to set new owner on sfi.dat. Access is denied."<br />
Wow!<br />
<br />
I'm really not liking Windows anymore.

            Hey Richie X:<br />
<br />
I also experienced a similar problem, with the exact same error code, dealing with a camera.&nbsp; What I did as a workaround was to boot on the "Recovery Disk" that I had the forsight to create early on in the game.&nbsp; I tried the "System Fix" option on the menu.&nbsp;
 That failed, complaining of some strange "camera or mp3" device connected.&nbsp; So like any deaf, dumb, and blind "geek", I did the second option on the menu -- A System Restore.&nbsp; I'm happy to tell you that I'm typing this to you on said system.<br />
<br />
Try it if you want: might work.<br />
<br />
Good Luck!<br />

    <title>Screen Protectors - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david moose johnson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Screen Protectors</h2>
                    I just have to rant on my very first post ever on microsoft's site.  Surface RT, awesome tech so far; wife just loves it.  But the worst thing that could happen today happened.  She asked me to put on her screen protector.  Now I know, making billions a year, microsoft needs more and more billions through additional screen protector sales, I get that.  What I don't get, IS WHY DON'T YOU PUT THEM ON FOR US?  We don't have people in Tyvex in dust proof rooms, able to put these on.  I cleaned my desk, turned off the fans, opened new everything, and still particles of ****.  Why microsoft, if we want to, and you expect us to hold you to a higher standard, why can't you do this for the customer.   I'd gladly pay the cost of the screen protector( which btw is sitting at an 1000% profit margin btw) just put the dam thing on.  Thx

            Oh and btw, I looked up some stats, over 20% of people say they don't even put on screen protectors on devices, 76% of them saying its because they can't get them on.&nbsp; Do companies like microsoft factor that into the business plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; eg:&nbsp; "Well Bob, we
 have to figure at least 1/2 of those are going to damage their screen enough to want a new screen or device $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$...."&nbsp; Do you guys not read what people write, their concerns?&nbsp; Or are we all just numbers to you?<br />

            Microsoft doesn't make screen protectors, AFAIK. But I stick to one company for all my screen-shielding needs, so I wouldn't have even seen if they did offer one on the Microsoft Store,<br />
<br />
I got mine from ZAGG - I like their Invisible Shield line. But you're right, it can be a challenge, and the larger the screen, the greater the challenge in attaching the protector. I had to partially remove and reattach mine 3 or 4 times to get all the little
 dust bits out, but it finally looks good and is protected.<br />
<br />
But the nice thing about ZAGG is they send you a free replacement if the protector gets damaged guarding your screen, so you don't have to live with a scraped up screen covering.
<br />
<br />
Maybe someone should start a business of selling screen protectors and attaching them for a small fee.<br />

            that's all fine and Mr. Connell, but for billions, i expect the screen protector, on the device before it's boxed.&nbsp; At their profit margins, microsoft, apple, whoever doesn't need more Units per transaction.<br />

            The screen protector is an add-on, not a standard item, and isn't made by Microsoft. Why would Microsoft include an add-on, especially one from a different company, standard? Isn't it better to decide if you want one and which one to get?<br />
<br />
The first two items I bought for my Surface were an Invisible Shield protector (from ZAGG.com - not associated with Microsoft in any way!) and a protective case I ordered from Best Buy. It never even occurred to me these extras should be included. The only
 actual Microsoft product I use with my Surface is the touch keyboard. The rest is custom-bought to suit me - case, screen protector, 3rd party 16 GB microSD card, Doctor Who TARDIS USB hub, HDMI cable to hook the Surface up to my TV.
<br />
<br />
And it's a good thing these aren't included IMO - why pay more for something you may not even want or need? Not everyone needs a USB hub for their Surface, and not everyone wants to use the Surface as a media player to a TV (HDMI cable).
<br />
<br />
Isn't it better to get just the device, and customize it with the add-ons you want? I'd rather get exactly what I want, than pay extra for stuff that I may just replace!<br />

            Maybe provide a basic one, easily removed if you want something better? Maybe.
<br />
<br />
I know a lot of people who leave the in package protective film on their devices as if it were a screen protector.<br />

I'd still rather buy my own protector than pay extra for an included one that I might not care for.<br />

            <p>I paid $40 extra for one recommended by the Microsoft store. It's&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"anti-microbial". &nbsp;It was nearly impossible to install, even though we followed the instructions, and now that we know it's completely worthless, we can't return it, because the packaging is broken, we used the "cleaner", etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're going to have to go to a store to buy a new one, and have them install it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish they didn't bother to recommend it in the Microsoft store, where we bought our Surface Pro. &nbsp;We would have waited and gone in-store to get a better one.</p>

    <title>Odd Windows 10 Technical Problems &#40;Long boot times, Steam not - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dr1961  say:</h3>
<h2>            Odd Windows 10 Technical Problems &#40;Long boot times, Steam not launching sometimes, blank icons for Desktops apps&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hey y'all,<br />
</p>
<p>So after talking with MS support on the phone they made it clear I'd have to pay money to actually get this thing fully solved so I'm asking to see what y'all can do for me.&nbsp; Hopefully I can avoid such an outcome :D<br />
</p>
<p>I have a Windows 10 PC that I've rebuilt a few times (CPU, GPU, Mobo etc) and have had very few problems with until 2 days ago.&nbsp; I should note that I torrented 2 games for the first time in about a decade or more maybe 3 weeks ago and ran them both, then
 played the games a bit and deleted them.&nbsp; I didn't have any issues at all for weeks after they had been deleted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On 6/4/19 my load times went from about 40 seconds from pressing the Power button to opening Chrome after a log in and rose closer to 5 minutes, which is insanely long on the SSD I have my OS installed on.&nbsp; When it did eventually finish booting and I logged
 in, all of the usual apps that turn on after the PC has powered up and I've logged in (Steam amongst them) did not start up.&nbsp; Also about half of the apps on my desktop didn't have their proper icons load, so I got a lot of the blank sheets of paper instead.&nbsp;
 When I clicked on these blank paper icons the error I was given said</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; "The drive or network connection that the shortcut XXX refers to is unavailable.&nbsp; Make sure that the disk is properly inserted or the network resource is available and then try again."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes these icons would love however and I could access the app through the shortcut, except for Steam for some reason.&nbsp; But even accessing the other ones would vary based on my luck apparently, as once I rebooted the PC the shortcuts would be lost again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything was also incredibly slow, way slower than normal, with multiple apps freezing or Not Responding for minutes before continuing like nothing was wrong.&nbsp; Steam also wouldn't start or respond at all really, even after I killed the Steam Bootstrapper
 and Web Client processes through Task Manager.&nbsp; I have a 4790K with 16 Gigs of RAM so it's usually blazing fast even though that CPU is a little older, what I was experiencing was ridiculous.<br />
</p>
<p>I downloaded a suite of anti-virus/spyware stuff and got to work scanning all of my drives (Super Anti-Spyware, Malwarebytes, Microsoft Support Emergency Response Tool, CCleaner).&nbsp; Super Anti-Spyware found the usual cookies, MSERT didn't find anything.&nbsp;
 Malwarebytes found what appeared to be some bitcoin mining programs so I quarantined and deleted them then restarted my computer and ran the scan again.&nbsp; All the scans showed that everything was clear but I was still having long boot times and not getting
 my icons back.&nbsp; I've had issues before with the Windows Explorer program but usually a restart of my PC or killing that program through the task manager to force it to restart is enough to solve that one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I made a bootable Windows 10 USB stick just in case and tried to do everything I could short of a reset or reinstall of Windows.&nbsp; Upon booting up into Safe Mode I was still having very slow speeds and again about half of the apps didn't have icons.&nbsp; Scanning
 again didn't find anything so I restarted to do a Startup Repair but was told that Startup Repair failed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Giving up, I just did a reset as most of my documents are on an external drive or my laptop anyway.&nbsp; Welp that didn't work and I'm still having the same problem.</p>
<p><br />
At this point I used Crystal **** Mark to make sure my SSD was running fine and it seemed to pass.&nbsp; While my SSD is only 128 Gigs, it has 25 free Gigs on it so that shouldn't be the problem.<br />
</p>
<p>So now I am appealing to you, o people of the Microsoft forums, to help me.&nbsp; I really just wanna figure out what the hell is happening here.&nbsp; I could do a reinstall of Windows 10 but I just want to know at this point what the heck is going on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>

<br />Press the Shift key and click Restart
<br />
<br />The PC will boot into the Windows Recovery Environment
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC
<br />
<br />Click Start
<br />
<br />Choose to keep nothing!

<h2>            &#34;Windows cannot find &#39;file path of whatever I&#39;m trying to open&#39;. Make sure you&#39;ve typed the file name correctly and try again. Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi, Installed windows 10 recently along with installing Office 2016. Since doing so there are large swathes of files which won't run or open. This includes all Adobe products, all Office apps and documents and then a number of other files which I can't get
 any rhyme or reason to. I've tried updating default programs, compatibility troubleshooting and checking that the relevant windows programs are running correctly but its made no difference. The problem effects both files sitting in the hard drive but also
 an external hard drive. The files aren't corrupted. The message I receive is the following</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"Windows cannot find 'file path of whatever I'm trying to open'. Make sure you've typed the file name correctly and try again.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance would me much appreciated.</p>

            Hi Shaun,
<div><br />
Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.&nbsp;</div>
<div>We understand how you feel about the situation. We're sorry for the trouble this has caused.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>This issue occurs due to any third party antivirus software or due to lack of&nbsp; taking ownership of the file on your system.<br />
<br />
I suggest you to follow these methods below and check, if it helps.&nbsp; </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Method 1:</strong></span></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<p><strong>Disable Antivirus software.</strong><br />
<br />
Disable the Antivirus software temporarily and check, if it helps.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
<strong>Disclaimer: </strong>Antivirus software can help protect the computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable the antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should
 re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time the antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; </p>
<div>If the issue still persists, follow method 2.</div>
<div><br />
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Take ownership of the file.</strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a)&nbsp; Go to the drive that contains the file or Folder whose ownership you want to change.<br />
b)&nbsp; Right Click of mouse on that file or Folder and Choose “Properties“.<br />
c)&nbsp; Navigate to “Security” tab.<br />
d)&nbsp; Click on Edit, then click Add. <br />
e) Under the "Enter the object names to select box"- type "Everyone"(without quotes) and click on "Check names".<br />
f) Click Ok<br />
g) A new window will open up with Security tab- Under "Permisssions for Everyone", Check mark the "Full control" option.<br />
h) Apply and Ok.<br />
i) Ownership allowed for folder or file.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Hope the above information helps. Reply with necessary information and the result to help you further.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Thank you.</div>

            Hi!
<br />
<br />My name is German, and I am here to help you.
<br />
<br />You can try to recover those files with third-party tools (Wise Data Recovery, Recuva)
<br />
<br />Any other questions I am at your disposal.
<br />
<br />Have a great day!

            Hi Carmine
<br />
<br />If you have sent files to the Recycle Bin and then deleted them from the Recycle Bin, Windows will be unable to recover those files . .. 
<br />
<br />You will need a 3rd party utility to try to recover those files, try the free version of Recuva which is available for download on the Internet to see if that can restore those files for you

            <div>Hi Bradley,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft community.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
From your issue description I understand that keyboard and mouse do not work after logging into the computer.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Let’s start with some questions.<br />
1. What is the make and model of the computer?<br />
2. What is the make and model of the mouse and keyboard?<br />
3. Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
I want you to try the following methods for resolving the issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 1: </strong><br />
<strong>Step 1<br />
</strong>I would suggest you to start the computer in Safe mode and check if the issue persists. To start the computer with minimal set of drivers and files, refer the link.<br />
<strong>Windows Startup Settings (including safe mode)</strong><br />
<a href="http://Windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows-8/Windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://Windows.microsoft.com/en-US/Windows-8/Windows-startup-settings-including-safe-mode</a></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Step 2<br />
</strong>If the issue is resolved you may put the computer in clean boot and check if it helps.<br />
By setting your system in clean boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue.<br />
<strong>How to perform a clean boot to troubleshoot a problem in Windows Vista, Windows 7, or Windows 8</strong><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><br />
<strong>Note</strong>: After clean boot troubleshooting steps, referHow to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong> I also want you check the status of mouse and keyboard in device manager.<br />
Perform the following steps:<br />
1. Right click Start, and then click Control Panel.<br />
2. Click System and Maintenance, click System, and then click Device Manager.<br />
Note: If Control Panel is in Classic View, double-click System, and then click Device Manager.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation, type the password, or click Allow.<br />
3. In Device Manager now check the status of the keyboard and mouse and see if there is any exclamation mark on the device drivers<br />
If there any exclamation marks then I suggest you update the latest drivers of mouse and keyboard from manufacturer website and check.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
Hope the above information helps.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Do get back to us and let me know the status of the issue or if you need further assistance regarding Windows.</div>
