<p>
</p><p>After 8 hours of troubleshooting and searching, i am not any closer to fixing this. the wlan driver on my Dell xps 15 l501x has disappeared after waking it from sleep today, after years of it working just fine.i have made no changes, no updates,
 installed any program, or dismantled the laptop, it occured on its own.</p>
<p>the ethernet connections are there, but no wlan. on the device manager, there is only the list of WAN miniports and Realtek PCIe GBE Family controller, which doesnt work even after removing and installing.</p>
<p>the network card inside the computer is Intel centrino wireless-n 1000 rev a00.</p>
<p>
</p><p>things i have tried:</p>
<p>network troubleshooter, only indicates problems with ethernet</p>
<p>
</p><p>rollback driver. no option with the realtek driver</p>
<p>
</p><p>update driver, no internet to update with</p>
<p>
</p><p>reinstall intel centrino wireless driver. setup errors "cannot install on this device"</p>
<p>
</p><p>reinstalling realtek driver. does not work after restarting. also seems to eternally reinstall itself after removing it from device manager</p>
<p>
</p><p>turned off firewall</p>
<p>
</p><p>used network reset</p>
<p>
</p><p>checked network card. oddly, it was not properly installed even after using it for many years (wires are now attached correctly)</p>

            Hi NitohS, 
<br />
<br />I’m sorry you are having this issue. It hit a bunch of my laptops randomly a couple of months ago. Different fixes worked for each one, and one of them actually had a bad wireless card in it, crazy. 
<br />
<br />You’ve done a ton, so I’m trying to think of other things we can try...
<br />
<br />Have you tried to restart the wlan service in services? 
<br />
<br />Start - type “services” and then go to wlan, right click and restart, see if we have any luck. 
<br />
<br />I just checked for drivers and BIOS, and it looks like the latest Drivers are for win 7 64... and the BIOS is from 2011. So Odds are you have the latest and greatest BIOS for your model.
<br />
<br />If no luck with WLAN, I’d entertain a reset or a fresh install of Windows. If still no luck that card may be shot...
<br />
<br />Another thing you could try... if you have a free USB, and is make a Linux distro bootable, and see if it detects the wireless card. I can send over instructions of you’d like. 
<br />
<br />Let me know!
<br />- C

<p>in services, all i have for wlan is "wlan autoconfig" which didnt change anything. come to think of it i may have killed an important process accidentally while on routine process killing when i restart. im currently trying to find a usb to test linux.</p>
<p>also i have become aware that Realtek network driver was NOT my original network driver.</p>

            I’ll send over my instructions for the Linux USB creation below:
<br />
<br />This next step may be a little involved, but has saved me in the past with stuff like this. 
<br />1. Do you have another usb we can use? (If not, DVD?)
<br />
<br />2. <a href="https://linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=254" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://linuxmint.com/edition.php?id=254</a> - download Linux mint from one of the mirrors from the link above. 
<br />
<br />3. Once downloaded - use one of the following apps to build Linux Bootable Media:
<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.pendrivelinux.com/yumi-multiboot-usb-creator/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.pendrivelinux.com/yumi-multiboot-us...</a>
<br />
<br /><a href="https://rufus.akeo.ie" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://rufus.akeo.ie</a>
<br />
<br />Plug the USB in, and then launch Rufus or Yumi, point to Linux mint, and install it on the USB you have inserted. Once it’s done, click finish, and reboot your PC. Boot to that USB, and boot into the Linux OS. Once the OS is loaded, plug in your other USB and see if we can retrieve the data.

<p>i dont know what process it was, but either way it doesnt explain why the wlan stopped working on its own after turning my computer back on.</p>
<p>i cant do the linux test because the phone im using to download the iso is too small.</p>
<p>i was told recently that i was using the incorrect driver version, and now i cant find the correct version anywhere on Intels site (centrino wireless-n 1000 rev a00). if all else fails i will just give up and wait to buy a new laptop, its not worth reinstalling
 windows now i have too many program data to lose and no external space to back it all up on.</p>

<h2>            My usb headphones won&#39;t work. Please help.</h2>
                    <div>I have just about had it with windows right now because this has never happened. You can't tell me to use the troubleshooter because I have already done that and it says nothing is wrong with it. Obviously something is wrong. Nothing
 is wrong with the headphones. I tried them out on my friend's MAC and they worked just fine. This only started happening right after the update so this really ticks me off. So it says that it's connected and it's working just fine but it says there is no jack
 information available. I have done just about everything possible. Downloading, un-downloading, restarting, shutting down, not going on my computer for the whole day. It stopped working the day after the update when I went to go on youtube to listen to some
 music while I was finishing up a project for school and no music played. I have a youtube account and need to make videos so...this is pretty vital to me so I need these headphones to work. Everything else works just fine, regular, non usb head phones. Just
 my logitech ones don't work. I'll click on the audio bar and it'll show like it's making a sound but I don't hear anything. This is starting to tick me off now and I also need these head phones to make a video for school. So this needs to be fixed and fixed
 quickly.&nbsp;</div>

            <em><span>
<p>Hello,</p>
</span></em><span>
<p><em>Welcome</em> to Microsoft Community. I appreciate your effort and time towards resolving this issue. I will certainly help you with the issue. This issue sometimes arises when there is a conflict with a third party application or driver. Is there any
 error code or error message regarding the same?</p>
<p>I would recommend you to try the following methods in order to fix the issue.</p>
<p>　</p>
</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<p>Method 1:</p>
</span></span></strong><span>
<p>Ensure the headphone or microphone is fully and firmly inserted into the correct jack. Plug in the headphone and see if the same shows up in Control Panel.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Please follow the instruction </p>
<p>　</p>
<p>a) Right-click on sound icon in the taskbar and select "Recording Devices". </p>
<p>b) See if the Microphone is listed.</p>
<p>c) If not, right-click on the blank area and select "Show Disabled Devices".</p>
<p>d) Right-click on your microphone and select "Enable ".</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>Also check the volume property. Ensure that it’s not mute</p>
<p>　</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong>You can try setting the headphone as default and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>　</p>
<p>a. <strong>Right click</strong> on the <strong>volume icon</strong> in the system tray and then click "<strong>Recording devices</strong>".</p>
<p>b. <strong>Right click</strong> on the blank space in the popped up window and then select "<strong>Show Disabled Devices</strong>" and "<strong>Show Disconnected Devices</strong>".</p>
<p>c. Right click on <strong>Headphone</strong> and then click "<strong>Enable</strong>".</p>
<p>d. Highlight the microphone and then choose "<strong>Set as Default Device</strong>".</p>
<p>e. Click <strong>Apply</strong> and <strong>Ok</strong>.</p>
<p>　</p>
<strong>
<p>Method 3:</p>
</strong>
<p>I would suggest you to uninstall the USB controller from the device manager. Then download and install the latest "Chipset" driver from the manufacturer’s website and then check whether your Logitech USB headset works.</p>
<p>Follow these steps:</p>
<p>a. Press "Windows key + W" from your keyboard.</p>
<p>b. Then type "Device Manager" without quotes in the search box and hit enter.</p>
<p>c. Expand "Universal Serial Bus Controller".</p>
<p>d. Right click on the each controller and select "Uninstall" option.</p>
<p>e. Then restart the computer for changes to take effect.</p>
<p>f. Then download and install the latest driver from the "Motherboard" manufacturer’s website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the information helps. Let us know if you need further assistance with Windows related issues, we’ll be glad to assist you.</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

<br />I am Vijay, an Independent Advisor. I am here to work with you on this problem.
<br />
<br />It takes time for the recording to appear in the client.  Can you login to Web Skype (only Edge/Chrome browsers) and let me know whether you can see your recording?

<p>Rename C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\Web Folders\MSONSEXT.DLL</p>
<p>to MSONSEXT.old. You can rename it back if something else doesn't work later. </p>
<p>As soon as I renamed, PED-Basic let me browse to a different directory. <br />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>May not work for everyone but this worked for me. I found it by my event viewer telling me that msonsext.dll_unloaded cause the issue.

            Hi Gerard
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />There seems to be some early adopter issues at this time with Windows 10 1903, if you can, I recommend you downgrade to your previous version until Windows 1903 matures with future cumulative updates. 
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1809 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1809 
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 4: how to recover your files from Windows.old:

<br />
<br />
<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1903 again. See instructions how to block it:

            Hi BillysGames
<br />
<br />1.
<br />
<br />Right click your Desktop, choose Display Settings
<br />
<br />Make sure Scale is set to 100% and resolution is set to the one marked (recommended)
<br />
<br />
<br />2.
<br />
<br />If you are unable to do that because everything on your screen is way too big, boot into Safe Mode and make those changes:
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode       
        </p>

<p>Sounds like you're experiencing issues downloading the new system update. Try connecting it directly into the modem. If that doesn't work try this:

<p>Follow steps 1 through 5 until you can download the system update</p>

<p>Try running ChkDsk to check your drive for errors. Right-click your Drive icon/ Properties/ Tools/ Error Checking.&nbsp; Try it first by not checking either box (this will run it in a Read-only mode) to see if it flags any hard drive or file problems.&nbsp; If it
 does, restart&nbsp; it by ticking both boxes, and rerun it to allow it to attempt to fix any found problems.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you use this to run the programs that wont print does it make any difference?&nbsp; Have you tried right-clicking on the shortcut to the program, or the .exe, and selecting the "Run As Administrator" option?&nbsp; Do so even if your user is an Admin.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could try removing all the Printers and then adding them back (as a last resort).</p>

<div>The only exceptions are:</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>I can print normally in notepad</li><li>In Chrome, which does not bring up the system print dialogue, I can click on print, but nothing happens - no print job is added to the list, and nothing prints. If I hit ctrl-shift-P to bring up the system print dialogue, then Chrome becomes unresponsive,
 just like everything else.</li></ul>
<div>I tried setting the default printer to a PDF printer, but it makes no difference. I've also tried uninstalling and reinstalling printers, but it made no difference.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Sometimes if I restart the computer I can print again... but lately this has stopped having any effect.</div>

            Wow, that works - if I right-click on the shortcut to the program, and select&nbsp;"Run As Administrator", then I can print. Thanks!
<div><br />
<div>But that's still very annoying - how can I make it so I don't have to do this?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, there is no single troublesome printer - I have one printer installed and several virtual printers, and no matter what printer is selected as the default printer, the program hangs and soon as I give it the print command, before the dialogue screen
 comes up that would allow me to choose a printer.</div>

            <p>Is your user an Administrator or a Standard User?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is possible via the Compatibility Tab on the .exe (or Shortcut)&nbsp;Properties to set the Privilege level to Administrator, forcing the .exe to run with Administrator privileges all the time.&nbsp; However you will still be presented with a UAC prompt.&nbsp; The only
 way to stop such a prompt is to disable UAC which is not recommended.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wonder if these program had been installed in the first place as Administrator via&nbsp; right-clicking on the actual Setup.exe and selecting the "Run As Administrator" option, might that had avoided your problem?&nbsp; You could try uninstalling one of them and
 then checking that.</p>

            Hi, and thanks again for your helpful advice!
<div><br />
<div>My account is and has always been an administrator account. Also, I should add that when I initially installed all these programs, I had no problem with printing for the first few years of using my computer.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I tried uninstalling and re-installing some programs, and the problem went away - first just for the programs I had reinstalled, and then for every program! (Interestingly, when I restated Chrome after reinstalling it, it started printing out everything
 that I had been trying to get it to print all day.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'm not sure if it is actually fixed though, because this uninstalling/reinstalling involved rebooting the computer several times, and in the past rebooting has fixed the problem. Or perhaps reinstalling Chrome was somehow the solution, perhaps because
 of some kind of bug with Google Cloud Print?&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>At any rate, it seems like if the problem does come back, I can just reinstall the program while choosing "run as administrator" or if I don't want to go through the trouble, I could just run the program itself "as administrator".</div>
<div><br />
<div>I don't really understand why it would make a difference to "run as administrator" if I'm already an administrator, or why this should be required to bring up a print&nbsp;dialogue, but thanks for your help none the less!</div>

            By Design, since Vista, and onward, the Administrator really has no more rights than a Standard User when running programs, unless you invoke those higher privileges by invoking the "Run as Administrator" option.&nbsp; It is a security thing, mainly.

<p>Why are you wanting to un-install the Windows 7 OS ?</p>
<p>Have you bought Windows 10 OS to upgrade with ?</p>
<p><strong>If so make sure you have a legitimate PRODUCT KEY for Win 10.</strong></p>
<p>Back up anything that is important to you on a external drive.</p>
<p>You can install Win 10 over the top of it as a upgrade and then when its finished and set up to your liking's you can delete the windows.old folder that basically contains a backup Win 7 if you for some reason wish to revert back and or retrieve data from
 it.</p>
<p>If you go this way make sure your Hard Drive has enough space as the Upgrade Installation of Win 10 and the Winows.old folder will consume possible up to and above 30 Gigabyte or more.</p>
<p>

<p>Dear Gregory who is not Lauretta,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The term "uninstall" usually applies to application software rather than to operating systems.&nbsp; You can, however, delete all Windows-related files from the partition in which Windows 7 is installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, you cannot delete Windows from within Windows (this would be like sawing off a tree limb while sitting on that limb).&nbsp; That is, Windows does not have a "self-delete" operation.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead, you have to delete the operating system's files by using another operating system.&nbsp; The other operating system may reside on a different partition on a hard drive installed in the computer or it may be on external media, such as a CD, DVD, or USB
 flash drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are some examples with pictures:&nbsp; <a href="https://www.digitalcitizen.life/how-uninstall-windows-8-windows-7-or-any-other-version-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Suddently there is no connection to the printer. Tryed to install printer drivers when this message appear.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>OK,</p>
<p>before you tried to install new drivers did you go to:</p>
<p><strong>windows start menu</strong>;</p>
<p><strong>control panel</strong>;</p>
<p><strong>programs and features</strong>; (locate and select your printer driver then select repair. if unable to repair then uninstall before trying to install a new driver)</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>If you go to the:</p>
<p><strong>windows start menu;</strong></p>
<p>use the file search to find "Dpinst.log" open it with notepad and post a copy as this will show what happened to cause the driver install error.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>If the driver is installed and good, try this to relocate the printer:</p>
<p>go to the <strong>devices and printers </strong>menu.</p>
<p>if you see your printer you can select it then right click to select the troubleshooting wizards.</p>
<p>if you don't see your printer select the <em>add a printer </em>option to do a search for your printer.</p>
<p>-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Hope this was helpful. That's about all I can think of without more information.</p>
<p>Let me know,</p>

<p><strong>Hi everyone,</strong></p>
<p><strong>I've had a copy of windows 7(bought at store,home edition,normal not upgrade) and have been using it for a while now. I activated windows successfully when I first installed it, and it said it was genuine up until now. There now seems to be a water
 mark in the corner that&nbsp;says&nbsp;it isn't, which is strange because it has been genuine for a long time. My copy of windows is a normal version of windows 7 home edition&nbsp;<span><strong>(x64)<span><strong>&nbsp;bought
 from a store which I&nbsp;presume&nbsp;has 3 installs. Any reason why windows thinks it is not a genuine copy?</strong></span></strong></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span><strong><span><strong>Thanks.</strong></span></strong></span></strong></p>

            I just rebooted my computer after writing this post. A popup windows appeared with an option to continue or "Get Genuine Now". I clicked the genuine option and it activated automatically,without me having to do anything. Still wondering why it would do
 this though.

<h2>            XBOX 360 servers is there a future for them&#63;</h2>
                    
<p><strong><span>With the anticipated release of the next gen console, what does the future hold for the servers for the xbox 360 console? Remember when the xbox 360 was released it was not long after that the servers for the original
 xbox console were shut down due to the updated hardware and software&nbsp;and even know the xbox 360 could play some of the original games due to the backwards compatability, there was still no way to play any of the original games on the newly updated xbox live
 service. So my question is, whats going to happen to the xbox 360 servers, once the next gen console goes global? Word is the new console is not backwards compatable with the xbox 360 games. Now I know that a lot of people are going to say that they are happy
 that it will not be backwards compatable, but I am kind of nostalgic. I still like to play what few original xbox games that I have left. I still play Atari 2600 games on my PC. Anyways the future looks very dim for the xbox 360 and all its glory, and yes
 I know it has had its share of problems but what do you expect its man made and as we all know mankind is not perfect.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Alas&nbsp;XBOX 360 you will be missed, but all great things must come to an end.</span></strong></p>

<p>Who says that Xbox Live wont be integrated fully with the Next Xbox, thus no need to shut down the servers? The reason why the original Live server was shut down was because they made the 360 servers from scratch, and didnt integrate with the new vision
 of the service. </p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I would actually expect the Live servers to stay the way they are, as there would be no real need to make a new infastructure for a service that already exists, besides, i dont see much as how the servers and service themselves could be improved upon. (besides
 hardware based)</p>

<p>I think the servers will stay and be upgraded. I dont exspect the nex gen consoles to flood the market like the 360 and ps3 did. The main reason &nbsp;for this thought - the hdtv move was happening during 360/ ps3 release and if you purchased any hdtv you needed
 a new game console to take advantage of it. xbox and ps2 didnt look to pertty on my 65 dlp tv</p>

<p>Lol... You Do realize the Xbox 360 /ps3 are basically 8 year old PC rigs.... The Chips used in&nbsp; these new systems are probably comparable to about a decent spec mid-high end GPU with an AMD A10 APU ( They are APU's in the next ps4 and supposedly uses similar
 tech from AMD with the next xbox) If you think games like uncharted 3 , Halo 4 look amazing just wait till the ps4/ next xbox comes out</p>

<p>Closing u didnt understand what i said -if u wanted high def you had to get a360/ ps3 console for hdtv. We all know the nexgen consoles will blow 360/ ps3 away and for us that have the funds will get nexbox /ps4. I Purchased HDTV first and after seeing how
 bad the ps2 / xbox look I RAN out and bought ps3 a month later a 360. Most of my friends followed the same path. Considering the economy for most compared to 8 years ago and the fact we dont need a new console to operate on HDTV. I dont see a big surge of
 sales coming.</p>

<p>@ClosingRacer all I was asking was what people`s thoughts were on what MIGHT happen with the 360 servers. There is no need to start blasting me simply for asking other people`s oppinions, you know this is a forum and I`m hoping that you understand the purpose
 of forums. Seems like you just want to use them for other reasons than what they are meant for.</p>

    <title>System sound issues after upgrade - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            System sound issues after upgrade</h2>
                    <p>Ok.. here goes my weird and frustrating problem:</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is how my setup goes for sound. I modify all my applications to a level 1 volume (except for Skype) because otherwise the sound is way too loud. This has been my while using my Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>pd: My OS language is in Spanish, i hope that's not a problem to understand the images.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0c6f49cc-c2a5-48ea-9fb8-c2a15f9e8774" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>After upgrading to Windows 10 a couple of days ago, i encountered a stage problem. Every time a System notification pops up, the volume of said notification way too loud, like if it was in max volume on my sound mixer. I checked and found that in fact, after
 receiving the notification, it had raised to the max volume:</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/340d6987-28eb-4c00-aa14-120d02f5c335" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>I proceeded to lower it back down, but the problem persisted. Each time i got a system notification popup, the volume would reset to maximum. This ONLY happens to notifications related to System sounds. Also for some reason, if i leave the audio mixer interface
 on the screen the volume behaves as it should, staying on volume level 1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>That is my problem. I am aware that you can disable all system notifications, but that doesn't fix the problem. I'm not looking for a way around it. I want it to behave as it did prior to upgrading to windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are my device controllers:</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7c1989e8-1c6e-4e9e-961a-7d18d81ca5d2" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the devices the sound manager: I use the SAMSUNG-4 as speakers (Tv monitor)&nbsp; and the problem is also present when using it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/9d38c0c3-067d-4e8c-a31a-5c6fbb509aa6" /></p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/75bbad7a-b7b0-4405-af8e-1e05ba6342d2" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>None of them have changed or been replaced after the Windows 10 upgrade. Also, my video card is an Nvidia GTX 650 Ti, if that is even relevant. I've looked the past two days for a solution, and i've tried the normal things like re-installing my drivers and
 such with no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please, microsoft wizards i am in need of your assistance.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the reply. I tried updating my drivers but the problem wasn't solved. Also, when i as trying the troubleshooting i encountered this problem, It says there is no information available for the connector. I checked my device manager and it shows
 the same message. I have already installed the latest driver for my SoundBlaster headphones and there aren't any updates for my USB controllers.</p>

</p><p>My motherboard is a P55M-UD2 from Gigabyte. Already checked their page and installed what was available. Any other ideas? Remember, my Headphones and Speakers work perfectly fine with other programs. It's just the System notification alerts that get disconfigured.</p>

            <p>I have the same problem and im using speakers with the Asus Xonar DX (and the unified drivers that work perfectly), many users have the same problem with different hardware (realtek, creative, asus, etc..) it must be a windows problem it always reset the
 system sounds to max.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first workaround was to disable de UAC notification sound, at least every popup related to allow a program to do this or the other wont pierce my ears.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On a related issue and i have tested this, even if you turn the System Sounds to 1 every UAC notification will reset this option to MAX, also the notification when you insert a device to the computer can reset the System Sounds to MAX.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For people that need the sound mixer to control the volume this is very annoying, I hope the audio department of microsoft read this and try to fix it in a update soon, is very easy to replicate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My system is also in Spanish, and i was using the Pro and x64 version on a clean install (bootable usb made with the microsoft tool).</p>

            Uggh.. at least i know im not the only one. I even did a fresh install of w10 to see if the problem would fix itself. No luck. Worst thing is.. im already getting used to it being loud and breaking my ears each time i have to give Adm. privilages to any
 program.

            <p>Same issue here. &nbsp;Whenever the notification sound plays, the system sounds level gets reset to 100%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will try setting the notification sound to none to see if it still happens.</p>

            <p>My problem is similar: </p>
<ul>
<li>Reducing the System Sounds slider in the Volume Mixer doesn't reduce the UAC system sound notification.</li><li>The System Sounds slider does stay where I set it.</li></ul>
<p>There is still a very high level of roughness in Windows 10. If Apple released an OS with this level of roughness users would be thinking that the world was coming to an end. Unfortunately, us Windows users just put it down to business as usual.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kinda getting tired of the lack of UI and UX refinement from Microsoft. It's like they are still stuck with being a developer focused company. You think that they would have taken a few cues from Apple by now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh, and please don't bring out the "it must be a driver issue" reply. I'm running Windows 10 on a bog-standard DELL Precision m4800 and I think the drivers are just fine.</p>

            <p>I believe I have the same problem. &nbsp;I have a Creative Labs X-Fi external USB sound "card".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the workaround that I've found: &nbsp;right click on the speaker in the System Tray and select "Open Volume Mixer". &nbsp;Move the System Sounds slider to wherever you want it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now here is the important part: &nbsp;<strong>do not close the Volume Mixer!</strong> &nbsp;Just click another window and let the Volume Mixer sit in the background. &nbsp;When I do this, the System Sounds volume level stays where I set it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately, this has to be repeated on every reboot, so the first few notifications will be loud.</p>

            <p>Resurrecting this post a bit, but after the last update it has broken another Creative product's drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My USB Sound Blaster HD is now doing the same. The exact version of mine is "Sound Blaster Digital Music Premium HD/X-Fi HD". &nbsp;The Volume Mixer trick there works, but its still a problem that the volume mixer all around is ignored for it's settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oddly enough no one has posted a true solution to this even though there's tons of posts around this issue. I've done the general fixes to attempt to resolve this as well, and got the latest driver which the last update was from August 15th.</p>

    <title>Blue Screen of Death Video Scheduler Internal Error - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Blue Screen of Death Video Scheduler Internal Error</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been facing a huge dilemma with my computer. Ever since I replaced my graphics card with a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti, I started to get crashes giving me the Blue screen of death. It happened 3 times today, 2 of the times with the "Video Scheduler
 Internal Error" and another crash with an error I have never seen before called "Kernel Data Inpage Error". Honestly I'm not too worried about that error. I'm mostly concerned about the&nbsp;Video Scheduler Internal Error because it keeps happening all the time.
 I have looked up so many things online to help stop it and have done everything such as messing with the drivers and looking to see if there is corruption on the hard drive. I am really at a loss with this problem and need help. These are the minidumps I was
 able to retrieve from the crashes and uploaded to onedrive:&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>I would really appreciate it if someone helped me figure out what is wrong. This is driving me crazy!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

            First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />nVidia - <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />Some of these sites offer autodetect options.

<p>
</p><p>There is an option for you to export your chat history <strong>only if </strong>
you are&nbsp;using the classic version of Skype. The chat history exporter in Skype for Windows desktop lets you export your conversation history in CSV format so that you can keep it outside of Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To export your chat history:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Select Tools &gt; Options.</li><li>On the left, select Privacy.</li><li>Select the Export Chat History button.</li><li>Choose a location to save the file to, then select <strong>Save</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Remember, the&nbsp;last 30 days of your conversation history are stored in the cloud, so won't be exported. Only the history saved on your hard drive, according to your 'keep history for' setting, is exported.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you need anything else.</p>

    <title>Folder grouping in Windows 7 libraries&#58; I&#39;d like the library I - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Folder grouping in Windows 7 libraries&#58; I&#39;d like the library I created to display like the Documents library</h2>
                    <p>original title:Folder grouping in Windows 7 libraries</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The default Documents library for Windows 7 includes two folders.&nbsp; When I select the Documents library, the contents of those two folders are displayed in the right pane without grouping.<br />
<br />
I created a new library for myself, and added folders to it.&nbsp; When I select that library, the contents of the folders I placed in it are shown in the right pane grouped by folder.<br />
<br />
So far as I am concerned. the grouping is just clutter, and I'd like the library I created to display like the Documents library.&nbsp; Is there any way I can turn grouping on and off in the "arrange by folder" view?</p>
                </div>

            I found the answer after I posted the question.&nbsp; If you right-click in free space (but not&nbsp;on any of the icones)&nbsp;in the right-hand pane when a library is selected, you get a context menu that lets you change the grouping of that pane.&nbsp; You can't get to
 the same menu by right-clicking the library in the left-hand pane.&nbsp; I haven't found a way to change the grouping behavior using the folder options diaglogs.<br />
<br />
I suggest that&nbsp;the to-do list at Microsoft should have an entry to add to the help system so a search for "group" and 'library" comes up with something related to grouping in the display of a library.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the reply.
