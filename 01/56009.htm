<h2>            Windows 10 - Weird problems and reset &#40;resolution&#47;multiple problems&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>On the 29th, I downloaded the windows 10 media creation tool for windows 10 on the 2 desktops in my house. To upgrade both to Windows 10. My Windows 8.1 pc upgraded without a hitch and I love the new operating system.</p>
<p>However the Windows 7 one has turned into a real mess. Various problems have occurred for example my screen resolution has suddenly been limited to 1280*1024 from 1920*1080 ( the only other option to change to is 800*600). Cortana is blatantly refusing to
 work. And I keep getting an error saying net framework 3.5 did not download properly but whenever I click download it goes error. It also randomly demands my password for the most minute thing or to allow administrator access . Even though this is an administrator
 account ( I have 2 administrator accounts)</p>
<p>So a bit of history.</p>
<p>I did not use my Windows 7 machine for a considerable time. I went away for 4 months and when I came back I noticed some anomalies but had to immediately leave again for another 5 months. When I returned for the second time. We bought a second pc for my
 use this one being the windows 8.1. But the windows 7 has somehow been&nbsp;infected with a bunch of adware and this same&nbsp;anomaly (&nbsp;Very specifically: My D: drive was 1 TB big (972 GB since no drive is perfect) and its said only about&nbsp;10 GB of that was free 960
 gb occupied but the drive in fact only contained about 150GB worth of files. I being very much confused finally copied everything off and formatted the drive .. which fixed the problem) I ran multiple scans with both SuperAntiSpyware and Malwarebytes which
 removed&nbsp;(supposedly) all the adware and malware.</p>
<p>Once I upgraded I immediately ran into this resolution problem. but was tired and shut down the pc and my MacBook(sorry Microsoft).. I then used my other desktop which had a great installation experience though it deleted all my programs. Ive now booted
 it up a few days later and run into&nbsp;this whole host of problems including some small time adware which Malwarebytes promptly removed.</p>
<p>What I think should be done. But not completely sure So any help would be great.</p>
<p>I should do a complete reinstallation of windows 10 wiping all my data ( I have a 250 GB Portable hard drive which I can transfer everything of to ) However when I go to updates and recovery in setting all my options are to do an advanced start up....
</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<span>
<span>
<p>(Source I downloaded Windows 10 Tool:http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10)</p>
</span>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So An UPDATE:</strong></p>
<p>I copied all my data of the machine, and did a full system reset. I checked the things saying Wipe my drives and clean them. This morning when it had finished I started going through the&nbsp;default procedure and just at the bit where you sign in with your Microsoft
 account.. The computer suddenly goes "Your PC Needs to restart because of a problem (I think it also added Sysystem_Threat_Not_Handled or something like that)" when it restarted it suddenly shows 2&nbsp;accounts both called DefaultUser0 both asking me for a name
 and password I don't have. Help Microsoft.&nbsp;</p>

            Hi, this issue is solved....&nbsp; i'm just posting here to assist anyone else with this query .... Eventually what happened was I created a system recovery disk of my other computer. Then booted from that disk in my BIOS ( of the problem computer) it ran through
 a bunch of stuff and then ended back in this thing. So from that I pressed Shift + Restart ... and click system recover... eventually that sorted it... The administrator / active:yes thing doesn't work for me it claims its active but when trying to log in
 it doesn't work

<p>
</p><p>HELLO GUYS.....</p>
<p>I have dell 5547.</p>
<p>I had this problem after I had upgraded my dell 5547 to windows 10 from windows 8.1.</p>
<p>This issue was a bios related problem, I had called dell technical support he remotely used my laptop and upgraded the bios version from A07 to A10. After that he said this issue was because of new OS that my laptop upgraded to.... SO they&nbsp;had A10 bios version
 tofix this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So guys if your laptop manufacturers have recent bios version to fix this issue,kindly try to upgrade it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upgrading BIOS solved my issue. I hope it will help you.but I am not 100% sure All I say is that my problem is fixed.</p>

<h2>            Threshold limit on battery charging&#63;</h2>
                    Running Windows 7 home premium 32 bit, Is there an app which would allow me to limit the charge on the battery to say 50%/75% capacity as currently it charges to 100% which over time will shorten the battery life, My other laptop has this facility I tend
 to use mains power on both my laptops &amp; short of removing the battery is there another way?

    <title>Media Streaming Options &#38; Troubleshooting - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Media Streaming Options &#38; Troubleshooting</h2>
                    <p>Question 1:&nbsp; Windows 10 Media Streaming - I have two PC users,&nbsp; I want to disable media streaming for 1 of the 2 users.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (Explanation:&nbsp; I keep a profile on my PC for my dad when he comes over, he's not good with change so I keep it so nothing jumps out new to him.&nbsp; However, media streaming appears on my PS3 console as his database available despite me having never technically
 turned it on for his profile.&nbsp; There's nothing there, and it's annoying, I just want it to disappear from my devices).</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Question 2:&nbsp; Windows 10 Media Streaming - Streaming to PS3 console has issues now.&nbsp; Plays for a moment, then audio gets out of sync &amp; shortly after the video pauses for a good 15-20 seconds before it works properly.&nbsp; Long video's like movies will&nbsp;repeat
 this after a while too.&nbsp; I have a thought of what's going on, my 3TB 3.5" External SATA drive attached via USB 2.0 is added to my media library, I store nothing on my boot drive, I believe maybe it's going into a standby or power saver mode &amp; that might be
 the issue.&nbsp; I had these options disabled before upgrading to win10.&nbsp; Not even sure this could be it, any ideas?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Question 3:&nbsp; Wireless connections - How can I prioritize networks on win10, this sync option from other devices has my main PC switching to my repeaters sometimes.&nbsp; They only run off wireless-N whereas my primary PC uses 5ghz band&nbsp;&amp; 802.11ac</p>

    <title>Networking issues with att hotspot. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> landonenglish  say:</h3>
<h2>            Networking issues with att hotspot.</h2>
                    im in need of some help. I live where my only internet option is my phone. I use my xbox to connect to the hotspot to game on and watch Netflix/Amazon prime. This has worked ok for years but just recently I get a error every time I try to watch a movie
 or login to a game. When I run a speed test the download and upload are fine but the Ping is 0 every time. I can still send messages over Xbox live and I can still play Fortnite but that's about it. I took my xbox to my sisters where she has charter and everything
 worked fine so I know it's connected to the att hotspot but I can watch Netflix on my iPad while connected to the hotspot but not my xbox. I can't figure it out. Any insight would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp;

<p>Hey Landon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the error message that you are receiving?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, what troubleshooting on the Xbox have you done (if any)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first thing we like to suggest is a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
powercycle</a>, which will fully reboot the console and clear cache.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For network troubleshooting I recommend clearing the MAC address and restarting the console to refresh the MAC address.</p>
<ul>
<li>Settings&lt;Network Settings&lt;Advanced Settings&lt;Alternate MAC address&lt;Clear</li></ul>
<p>Let us know so we can further assist you.</p>

            I couldn't find anything helpful in that link. It's not like I can't connect to xboxlive. My connection is fine. I can load games but right before I load in I always get a error like it's being blocked. I can load up Netflix, select my profile and scroll
 through all the movies and shows but when I select one I get a error before it loads. I know of four other friends all using mobile hotspots that this happend to. It happend at the exact same time for us all. Around 8:00 pm on sept 26th.&nbsp;

    <title>Bad Frame Rate when playing Red Dead Redemption in 1440p- Xbox One X. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bad Frame Rate when playing Red Dead Redemption in 1440p- Xbox One X. Any suggestions&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm experiencing bad frame rate in Red Dead Redemption when playing in 1440p specifically. I have a 2k monitor in which to play games on, and when I switch to 1080p the issues resolve. There have been a few posts on Reddit about this issue and I was wondering
 if anybody has a fix. The gameplay is smooth in 4k and 1080p, but in 1440 there is apparent stutter and camera issues. It would be great to be able to play this game in my native resolution. My monitor is an ASUS PG279Q.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hey thumbcactus,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sorry to hear about this issue with frame rate&nbsp;drops while playing RDR2 on the Xbox One X in 1440p resolution. I'd be happy to try and help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you have the display set to 1440p on your Xbox, I would recommend to perform a complete
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/power-cycle-console" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
power cycle</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Turn off the Xbox One console by pressing the <strong>Xbox</strong> button &nbsp;on the front of the console for about 10 seconds until it shuts down completely.
</li><li>Unplug the console's power cable. Wait&nbsp;5 minutes.</li><li>Plug the console power cable back in. </li><li>Press the <strong>Xbox</strong> button &nbsp;on your console to turn on the Xbox One.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Is this only happening when you play RDR2 or have you noticed it happening with other games in 1440p?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know so we can help you further!</p>
<p>

<p>Thank you for the reply!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I can tell this is only happening in RDR2, for I have played a decent amount of hours in Halo and Black Ops 2 with the console set to 1440p and have not experienced the same types of issues, in fact both ran really great and I am very impressed
 with the Xbox One X (recently purchased it for Red Dead and Halo). </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read a few forums on Reddit with Xbox One X owners experiencing the same type of issue, I can provide you links to those if you'd like. I can see the frame dips and stuttering in my captures when playing in 1440p also so it doesn't appear to be an
 HDMI cable issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reached out to Rockstar, but they didn't provide much help so I decided to post here since I heard about Xbox working closely with devs during the Xbox One X Enhanced process for certain games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just tried the complete power cycle and the issue is still there, the only solution seems to be to set the console to 1080p, but then the picture is less clear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The primary reason for purchasing an Xbox One X was to play games in 1440p, so I hope something can be resolved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for the response.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi thumbcactus,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Alright so let's try to figure some things out. I had to look up your monitor specs to see what we're working with. I noticed the monitor has refresh rates up to 165Hz, while the Xbox is capped to 60 Hz for 4K resolutions and 120 Hz for 1080p resolutions,
 so 1440p would probably work best somewhere in between if you can charge the refresh rate setting on your monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something else we could try to troubleshoot is turning off the G-SYNC setting on your monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not entirely sure if this is true or not, but the One X enhanced&nbsp;updates of the games was originally engineered to display the games in native 4K, and 1440p resolution was introduced earlier this year I believe so there could be bugs in relation to that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest to perform a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
soft factory reset </a>on your Xbox to restore the operating system. Make sure before you do that, you know your email and password to the account and a stable network connection as it will remove accounts during the reset. You won't lose any data permanently.
 Once you do that, it would be a good idea to also re-install RDR2 if the frame rates are still dropping after a factory reset.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the results!</p>

<p>Hello,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's been awhile since I've posted here, but there's been a few updates that I missed regarding this issue. It now seems that this is an Xbox One issue and not a Rockstar issue. For example, the Reddit threads I have been keeping track of got some replies
 that state:</p>
<p>
</p><div>

<div>
<div>
<div><br />
<div style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">
<p>"Omg I thought my xbox is broken. Tested 1080p everything was fine. 1440p I keep on loosing frames. It drives me nuts. The problem is I've tested this with other games and it's exactly the same...i think it's an issue on MS side."</p>
<div>
<div>

<br />
<div style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">
<p>"Yes I noticed this on AC Odyseey too, funny enough 60fps games aren't showing this problem, so maybe there is something broken on MS's end with half refresh rate sync."</p>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div>
<div><br />
<div>
<div style="color: rgba(28, 28, 28, 1)">
<p>"I did more testing on this with AC Odyssey, switching the xbox back and forth from 1080p to 1440p on the output, it was very noticeable how smooth 1080p was with no stuttering and hitching, with 1440p output the framerate randomly stutters and just doesn't
 feel as smooth."</p>
<p>Using 1440p output produces noticeable frame skipping/stutter. Setting the system to 1080p shows even frame pacing 30fps.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Playing titanfall 2 at 1440p produce beautiful locked 60fps, no frame drops. So it's clearly not a hdmi/interface problem with the monitor, it's definitely something odd with the game.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I noticed a similar issue with Assassins creed Odyseey, but it's not as bad to the same degree as RDR2. Setting the dash output to 1080p for both these games produces a smooth 30fps."</p>

</p><p>
</p><p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">
</p><p style="text-align: left">I see that you are a Microsoft Agent and moderator, so is there any way I can make this issue known to Xbox? I purchased this console primarily because it supported 1440p, so if they are able to look into it and fix it then it will
 make many people happy who game on 1440p displays. Thank you.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every game I play on the Xbox One X which is rendered at 4K (Forza Motorsport 7, Forza Horizon 3 &amp; 4, Gears of War 2, 3 &amp; 4, and of course RDR2) has frame rate issues when I choose the 1440p output. While playing, all those game will stutter every now and
 then, which doesn't happen if I set the output to 1080p or 4K (tested on a friend's TV). So something must be wrong with how the console does the downsampling from 4K to 1440p. Could you please notify them about this issue and if you already have, could you
 let us know if the team have acknowledged this issue?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi thumbcactus,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This does seem like an issue when trying to downscale the resolution to 1440p for 4K games at 30 fps on Xbox One X. I haven't been able to confirm it personally, but I have seen others on Reddit and one other post about it here that I found when searching.
 The first thing I recommend is to install the Xbox Insider program and launch the Report a problem feature within the app. From there you can report the issue as new if you don't see it on the list of known issues and you are able to provide a screenshot or
 a video to send it in to be investigated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here is a resource for how to report a problem to Xbox: <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/xbox-insider-hub-report-a-problem" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I hope this helps!</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 - no wireless networks on resume from sleep - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Surface Pro 3 - no wireless networks on resume from sleep</h2>
                    <p>I've had my Surface Pro 3 for over a year now and Wi-Fi has worked flawlessly on Windows 8.1 since the beginning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now after upgrading to Windows 10 Pro, there's a problem. When I resume the Surface after a long sleep (over an hour, perhaps) I see that no wireless network connections are available. If I go into Control Panel &gt; Network and Sharing Centre &gt; Network Adapters,
 I find that my Wireless adapter has been disabled. If I right click and enable it, I still don't see any wireless networks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A reboot cures the problem and the Surface will work as expected, until the next long sleep.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone else experienced this, and is there a resolution yet?</p>

            <p>Hi Divya</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply. I have already followed all of the steps in the troubleshooting article you have provided, none have helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have updated to the latest version of the driver - what I am currently running is Marvell AVASTAR Wireless-AC version 15.68.3091.193 (dated 04/06/2015)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any other suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you</p>

            <p>After updating the driver, I'm still getting the same issue.</p>
<p>It seems to occur randombly. Sometimes, my Surface can be in sleep mode for hours, and resume with WiFi working just fine. Other times, the problem will occur.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly, when the problem occurs, the wireless network adapter shows as 'Disabled'. I can right click and enable it, and the icon will refresh, but still show as disabled. Only a reboot will bring it back to Enabled.</p>

            <p>I have the same issue when starting from sleep mode.&nbsp; I've found that running the network troubleshooter will fix the issue most of the time, although very annoying.&nbsp; This fixes the "disabled" issue that I'm unable to perform manually with the wireless adapter.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also have a second issue that networking will stop working while using my SP3.&nbsp; When I check available&nbsp;access points, it only shows current connection&nbsp;and doesn't show all available access points.&nbsp;&nbsp;When this happens, running network troubleshooter doesn't
 work and I'm forced to reboot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've had&nbsp;WiFi issues on the SP3 with every version of Windows, just different flavors depending on the release.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>Annoying as you cannot connect to the net to attempt any reinstall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Prior to this on windows 8 the surface would need to troubleshoot wireless at times despite being on the same network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

                    I moved the games folder from the list under Start--&gt; All Programs and put it on the desktop.&nbsp; It is now on the desktop - not just a shortcut, but the actual file.&nbsp; I want to put it back where it was, but haven't been able to.&nbsp;I can't drag it to the start
 menu (the way I dragged it out), because I can't get the start menu to stay open when I click on it to drag it there.&nbsp; And, I can't get it to go anywhere else, without also reappearing on my desktop - and if I move the icon on the desktop to the recycle bin,
 it disappears from the libraries - when I try to move it back just there, the folder reappears on the desktop again.&nbsp; How do I get this games folder back into the "All Programs" subheading of the start menu?

            When I saw your reply, I had already pinned&nbsp;the games folder to the Start Menu on my own (I figured out how to do that all by myself), but it is still not in&nbsp;the "All Programs" list.&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
This is the sequence:&nbsp; I "accidentally" moved it to the desktop.&nbsp;&nbsp;I made a mistake when&nbsp;I was&nbsp;trying to do something&nbsp;else and had highlighted it,&nbsp;I think, and then&nbsp;"dragged" it to the desktop.&nbsp; At first I thought that I had just inadvertently created a desktop
 shortcut for the games folder, but then I saw that it was no longer on the All Programs list.&nbsp; I later found out&nbsp;that this desktop icon was&nbsp;not just a shortcut.&nbsp; At first, I
<em>thought </em>it was a shortcut and since I didn't want a shortcut for it on the desktop, I moved it to the trash bin.&nbsp; I couldn't find it in the All Programs list, so I went into Libraries.&nbsp; Then when I tried to open it up in Libraries, I found out I had
 moved the actual <em>program </em>from the desktop to the trash&nbsp;bin....not just a shortcut!&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I&nbsp;tried to get it to go from the trash bin to the All Programs list, but could never do it.&nbsp; I tried several times to put it in the Library folder without putting it on the desktop, but although it went in to the library, it ALSO popped up back on the desktop,
 no matter what I tried.&nbsp; I checked it time and time&nbsp;again found that, each time, &nbsp;the icon on the desktop wasn't just a shortcut, it was the program itself.&nbsp; Whenever I sent it to the trash bin, I removed access to all of those games (determined this by trying
 to open the games folder in libraries, only to find out the folder was EMPTY), so it was obviously not just a shortcut.&nbsp; To regain access to games, I had to move it out of the trashbin, but whenever I tried to put in into the library (I put it back into the
 games folder) and into the All Programs List,&nbsp; I could never prevent it from <em>
also</em> putting itself on the desktop....plus I never could get it to appear on the All Programs list! &nbsp;What I finally did was to put it back into the library (under games) - then&nbsp;I clicked on the desktop icon that appeared on the desktop&nbsp;and pinned it to
 the Start Menu.&nbsp;This is an okay solution.&nbsp; I was able to get an intact link in the Start menu and get it off my desktop........BUT, it STILL doesn't show up on the All Programs list.&nbsp; I would like the All Programs list to contain&nbsp;all my programs, not just
 all my programs minus&nbsp;the one I <em>unintentionally </em>sent to the desktop! <br />
&nbsp;<br />
So, although I figured out an okay solution all by myself, which is the very first thing you mentioned (pin it to the start menu), it does not appear that it is easy to move it back where I want it - back to the All Programs list.&nbsp; (The games I am talking about
 are ones I selected for my games folder, including the old fashioned type games, like solitaire, spider solitaire, freecell, etc.) I am afraid that if I go to all the trouble of uninstalling and reinstalling the programs, I still couldn't be sure they would
 appear on the All Programs list and I might lose them altogether.&nbsp; Why is it so easy to move an item from the All Programs list to the desktop (so easy one can even do it unintentionally), but NOT easy to reverse the action and move it back to the All Programs
 list???? I guess I will just live with the situation as it is now, but it would be nice to know the answer to the question..... Would what you suggest (uninstalling and reinstalling) truly get it to appear back on the All Programs list? It is not one game,
 I am talking about, it is a bunch of games I have in a games folder.....<br />

            This recommendation sounds promising.&nbsp; I don't want it to disappear from the Libraries location (under "Games").&nbsp; Right now, if I look under the Libraries folder, this is where it shows up:&nbsp; Under the Libraries, there are these headings:&nbsp; Documents, Fred
 File OTR, Games, Music, Pictures and Videos.&nbsp; (I made the Fred File, but the others were already there).&nbsp; Under the Games heading, there is the Games Folder - shown as "Games (C:).&nbsp;&nbsp; This is the only "location" I know of currently - it now reports itself as
 the only location (so the listing in the start menu must be a link to this one location).&nbsp; Are you telling me to move it to another location or put it in a second location, so there are two locations?&nbsp; How do I move the Games listing where you are telling
 me to move it?&nbsp; What is ProgramData, the hidden folder you are talking about? How does any of this relate to whether or not what you tell me to do will put the games folder back into th

 was on the desktop, but I didn't want it there.&nbsp; I wanted to move it back to the "All Programs" list, but couldn't figure out how to do it, but I did figure out how to pin it to the Start menu and get it off the desktop.....&nbsp; At least I like it on the Start
 menu, as opposed to the desktop.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
It wasn't any particular game.&nbsp; It was all of the games that came in the "Games" folder.&nbsp; They include things like: Solitaire, Spider Solitaire, Free Cell, Mahjong titans, chess titans.....etc.....</p>
<p>
</p><p>I never bothered to follow the suggestion about putting it back to where it is supposed to be (C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs) as described before, because it is too much of a pain in the neck to do that - and I am not sure if that
 action would put it back in the "All Programs" list, anyway.&nbsp; I was happy enough when I was able to figure out, by myself, how to put it on the Start menu and get it off the desktop................KLP</p>

<p><span>Hi Derrek,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Did
 you check if you’re able to open the Start menu from Safe mode?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Is
 your computer up-to-date with the all the latest device drivers?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Firstly, I would suggest you to perform system file scan on your computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1: To perform a system file checker</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Visit the link below to know how to perform system file checker on your computer.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929833</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:</span></strong><span> To boot the computer in Safe mode, follow
 the steps below</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Use
 F8 while restarting the computer.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Under
 Windows Advanced Boot options, select Safe mode and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Once
 you login to Safe mode, check if you’re able to open Start menu.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>If
 you’re able to open Start menu, then restart the computer back to normal windows mode and follow Step 3 to perform clean boot.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

 a clean boot in Windows Vista. Visit the link below to know how to perform a clean boot.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Once the troubleshooting is done, reset
 the computer back to normal startup. There might be some conflicting software which is causing this issue to happen.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you’re not able to resolve the issue by performing a clean boot, then I would suggest you to perform an online virus scan on your computer by

<h2>            Cannot view files in program files folder</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I am using ExpressVPN - my printer won't work when connected to the VPN so I am trying to specify in the VPN software that the printer bypasses the VPN. This requires me to specify the printer app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am assuming the printer app (HP Smart) is located in Program Files/WindowsApps folder -- please correct me if I'm wrong. But when I try to navigate to that folder, it tells me I don't have permissions. It tells me to continue, then tells me I have to use
 the Security Tab - but it looks like I have the necessary permissions for everything but still doesn't let me view the files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am the owner of the computer (Microsoft Surface Pro) and am the one who performed the installations. I have checked my profile and am listed as an administrator/trusted installer. So why can't I see these programs?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know whether, even if I am able to access the printer app, that it's going to work with while I am connected to the VPN so if anybody knows how to do it, please let me know. I have asked in the HP printer forum and haven't received an answer.</p>

<p>
</p><blockquote>In general, printer drivers are not located in the %ProgramFiles% folder tree, they are under the Windows folder, down a few levels. I take it that your printer is connected by a network rather than a USB cable. Is that correct?
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks for replying. Yes, the printer is connected to my network.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I think I've solved the problem partially. In the ExpressVPN software, instead of looking for the printer in order to exclude it from the VPN, I've excluded everything except the Web browsers.&nbsp; The printer now works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I think I should include apps that connect to online services such as Outlook and OneDrive - otherwise there's not much point in using a VPN. How/where do I find these apps? Are they in WindowsApps?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which comes back to my original question - why can't I view the files in WindowsApps folder? It keeps saying I am not authorized to see them, even though I am the administrator. It says I need Read permission.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Try this method for accessing the windows app folder:<br />
<br />
1- First Download this Take ownership registry from here: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/j8yk084d4bf1ixy/TakeOwnership.zip?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.dropbox.com/s/j8yk084d4bf1ixy/TakeOwnership.zip?dl=0</a><br />
<br />
2- Then Extract the ZIP file and install it by double clicking on it<br />
<br />
3- Now go to the windows app location and make folder visible by clicking on view&gt;hidden items<br />
and then right click on the&nbsp;windowsapp&nbsp;folder and then you will see an option of "Take&nbsp;owner&nbsp;ship" Click on it.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
4- You will see the command&nbsp;prompt and after it's completed, you will have access&nbsp;of&nbsp;the folder.<br />
<br />
Note: Must use this process as administrator<br />
<br />
its always useful to allow the permission&nbsp;of specific apps, like I also do it with PureVPN<br />

                    <p>Original Title: Access denied on C drive and anything to do with it...</p>
<p>Hi there, I created a powerpoint document in Windows Office 2010 last night, but it wouldn't let me save it anywhere. It was the first day of school, and my lesson plan wouldn't even go on a stick. I went online to find a solution, and tinkered with settings
 (maybe not the best idea). I think it was thr UAC (not sure), but it had two columns of allow/deny. I unticked one of them, started a process, but then the plug came out and the computer shut down. Now, I cannot access the c drive at all. It is simply access
 denied EVERYWHERE! I've been in safe mode, tried using run and msconfig to get to the problem but I'm blocked everywhere. Please can you help me restore my access to the c drive. When I right click-properties it says 0 bytes. Aaaargh!</p>

<p><span>i. Right click on C: drive and select “Properties” from Context Menu.</span></p>
<p><span>ii. Click on
<b>Edit </b>button in <b>Properties </b>windows.</span></p>
<p><span>iii. Select user/group from permission windows or click Add to add other user or group.</span></p>
<p><span>iv. Now under

            <p>Hi Debleena.</p>
<p>Yes, I had made changes before this happened. I think it's <em>why</em> it happened (as outlined in original post). I changed some settings for allow/deny and cancelled them halfway through by accident, then became locked out.</p>
<p>I can't do <em>anything</em> related to the drive, including changing ownershiop, it seems.</p>
<p>When I am in advanced security settings for local disk c:, the current owner field has 'unable to display current owner' in it, which is ineditable.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beneath it, it has change owner to: User (User Pc\User).</p>
<p>What elese can I do? It seems as htough there's no magic switch judging by the amount fo threads this has generated before. Would reinstalling WIndows do it?</p>
<p>Thanks, Gary</p>

            Hi there. Ironically, had problems logging in to reply, so, created a new MSN account.<br />
<br />
I don't mean to state the obvious, but I've tried all the recommended options found on these threads. Also, I'm getting c++ visual runtime error on Windows packages.<br />
<br />
I can't get to a restore point. I get this (can you clarify the error code please?)<br />
windows cannot access C:\windows\system32\rstui.exe<br />
<br />
When I hit diagnose, I get this:<br />
An error occurred while troubleshoting:<br />
A problem is preventing the troubleshooter from starting<br />
<br />
No kidding. I <span style="font-style: italic">cannot</span> access, or <span style="font-style: italic">
run</span> anything directly connected to the c:drive. I'm taking it to a shop tomorrow to see what they do (probably install a new copy of windows). Any last minute ideas to unlock this infernal machine!? ...<br />

<p>
</p><p>Happened after I disabled homegroups to try and use Windows Easy Transfer (my ****)</p>
<p>
</p><p>What a stupid program that is. It wanted permissions to change. Tried everything to allow new computer to transfer files and folders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Used original net set up USB I created to get back into original network. Access denied.. Does anyone from Microworst get that this thread has never/ever been solved by anyone for MS.</p>

</p><p>Access denied: EVERYTHING&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; includes BOOT MODES, Dos prompts, ETC</p>
<p>
</p><p>Like she suggested above, will probably have to partition the hard drive, buy a Windows 7 CD and reinstall operating system and lose every program and all my files and folders on my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And as the new manufacture of my new laptop recommended to use Microsoft Easy Transfer to transfer my data. All is lost.</p>

<h2>            Uninstalling and then Reinstalling Windows 10</h2>
                    Currently I am using Windows 10 which came pre-installed on my Dell&nbsp; Inspiron 15 5570 laptop, but I am a college student and being taught the basics of Unix operating system. I want to uninstall Windows 10 and install and learn about Unix and Linux. I
 want to ask that can I remove Windows 10 and then reinstall it later after this semester. Can Microsoft help me reinstall the genuine version of Windows later so that I may not face the problem of the Windows being "Not Genuine" or "Inactivated".&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Hi Shailesh, that will be no problem, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool

            Have you considered installing Linux and UNIX in a virtual machine instead? You don't need to actually install it on the machine to learn how both work.
<br />
<br />That said, you can always install Linux or UNIX then reinstall Windows 10 at any time. 
<br />
<br />That said, here some options you can consider.
<br />
<br />Install Linux in VirtualBox:
<br />
<br />How to Install Linux on Your Windows Using VirtualBox: 6 Steps
<br />www.instructables.com/id/How-to-install-Linux-on-your-Windows/
<br />
<br />or Dual boot:
<br /><a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/dual-boot-windows-10-linux/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/dual-boot-wind...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />If you prefer to install Linux entirely, go ahead and do so, if at anytime you would like to reinstall Windows 10 - you might want to do this in advance. 
<br />
<br />Step 1: How to download official Windows 10 ISO files 
<br />		<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-download-official-windows-10-iso-files/35cde7ec-5b6f-481c-a02d-dadf465df326">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />		Step 2: How to: Perform a clean install of Windows 10
<br />		<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-clean-install-of-windows-10/aef0ae63-2117-41ee-a8ea-4a3181625b08">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>

<br />
<br />Another option you have is to back up your Windows 10 installation in advance, go ahead and install Linux. When you are ready to go back to Windows 10, you can restore the image:
<br />
<br />How to: Create a system image in Windows 10
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-win_upgrade/how-to-create-a-system-image-in-windows-10/84fa6683-e3ac-4e93-9139-368af9267869">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />How to restore a Windows 10 system image to an existing or larger storage device
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/how-to-restore-a-windows-10-system-image-to-an/e20992ca-5641-4f7c-bb09-3895d0732162">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If you decide to go with the clean install:
<br />
<br />Windows 10 Digital License
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10.

<h2>            Empty folders on one drive</h2>
                    I have one drive on my laptop and all of the folders are populated - BUT the folders with blue arrows next to them have no content on my Surface. The folders with ticks are available across my devices - what am I missing?

            <p>Well, if (for instance) you have a 32GB Surface RT (or even the 64GB model), which device/system has the lower number?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Heh, heh. &nbsp;You are trying to stuff an elephant into a shoebox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The best way to manage a huge amount of data is to get an external, portable hard disk. &nbsp;Keep only critical files on Onedrive and that will reduce the amount on cloud storage which syncs to any computer with that account. &nbsp;The hard disk can fit in your pocket
 and you can attach it to the RT and also attach it to a laptop/desktop, or another tablet with USB.</p>

<h3> james vinyard  say:</h3>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>On the Surface RT, go to http://www.onedrive.com with Internet Explorer (either one) and make sure you are logged in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, on your laptop, right click on the "Onedrive" folder name and click on Properties and look how much space is taken up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does your Surface RT have enough storage to store all of your files?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you do not have a massive amount of files on your laptop and Onedrive.com and you are logged into Onedrive with the RT, are you leaving the tablet on and running long enough for it to 'sync' with Onedrive to populate those folders?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If everything looks good but still does nothing, check to make sure all updates are installed. &nbsp;Move your mouse pointer to the far lower left corner of the screen and right-click for the text menu. &nbsp;Select "Control Panel/System and Security/Windows Update"
 and manually run it and tell it to "Check for updates".</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can be a problem in some cases is that you have excessive amount of files (exceeds available space) and it won't sync. &nbsp;Onedrive has had many updates in the past and one could have failed. &nbsp;Other times, you may not be on the same account with the tablet
 as you are with your other computers and not logged onto Onedrive. &nbsp;You have to be in the same account.</p>

<p>Salut à tous,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>J'ai ma XBOX 360 élite qui est tombé en panne (pour être précis, le lecteur ne lit plus mes jeux après avoir tenter le calibrage et le nettoyage) et il me faut un nouveau lecteur pour ma xbox élite et vu que ma XBOX a déjà était ouverte car la garantie n'était
 plus valable, je cherche un lecteur.</p>
<p>J'aimerais savoir le quel prendre, sachant que celui qui était dans ma 360 élite était un philips lite on.</p>
<p>Si vous avez un lien pour en acheter un en toute sécurité je suis preneur également ^_^</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Merci de vos futurs réponses,</p>

                    Microsoft online support advised me to go to support.microsoft.com/kb/979281. Scenario 3 on this website seemed to apply. It advised me to go to 976972. The resolution at this website had two files to download to resolve the problem. I have a 64 bit operating
 system, therefore, I chose "All supported x64 based versions of Windows 7. The next screen asked me to download the file "windows6.1-KB976972-x64". The Windows Update Standalone Installer gave me a message "The update is not applicable to your computer."&nbsp;
 I still have this problem. How do I resolve it.<br />

<p>i just don't see how this can be done. i have tried.&nbsp; if i can do this and beat arcade on insane, i will pretty much have seriously 3.0.&nbsp; it will just be a matter of time getting the rest of the onyx medals. i know i can get arcade on insane. beast mode
 on insane without failing is the only thing hindering me on this. is there a way people are doing this on insane without failing? if so, what are they doing exactly?</p>

<p>It's not that difficult to do it on insane after a practice run or two. What's hard is the teamwork aspect of it. Communication trumps skill when going for this one.<br />
<br />
Some tips:<br />
<br />
-Play on checkout. It's small, and there's lots of cover to mantle over barriers. There is also high cover for kantus and boomers in later rounds.<br />

-Rounds 2-11 all have hero characters and should be farmed using this method: Kill all other targets but one or two heroes. Down the heroes, as they don't bleed out; They stand up and then you down them again. Savage drones can down them quickly with their
 retro, so they stay on the target (mark it) while everyone else goes around as a wild ticker destroying barriers. If someone dies during this time don't have them respawn.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
-Early rounds should be a savage drone (or two) and the rest wild tickers. Middle rounds kantus and two boomers or two savage drones (or a mix). The kantus stands in the spawn behind cover and just heals the team (massive points).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
-Do not go past the half way point (or even the 1/3rd point) on the map in rounds until most of the enemies are gone; They will come to you, even going so far as to spawn rush you.<br />
<br />
-Wild tickers are immune to auto-turrets.<br />
<br />
-Execute the last hereo. It earns more cash, and if a savage drone player doesn't have the retro execution, it can buy more time doing the repeated arm rip.<br />
<br />
-Troikas and silverbacks are brutal, as are baird and cole. Boomers can take care of most of these easily.<br />
<br />
-Again, communication. Tell your teammates when there's a silverback, when you need healing, mark enemies, etc.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I finally beat insane yesterday, took us a few tries and about 2 hours. I think you need 5 people with no randoms and everyone has a mic. Stay in tight groups, you will need eachother to finish of kills or revive falling teammates</p>
<p>Use the checkout map, there is no hammer of dawn or mortor shells fling at you</p>
<p>The first few waves have most of the team be wild tickers eating barriers while the other 2 are savage drones</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Have the drones advance slow behind the tickers, the enemy will come to you so no need to rush it</p>
<p>Never kill the last hero while there are still things to destroy, just have someone put them down as they get up</p>
<p>As people can afford it have some be the Kantus and move on to the sentapeed (not sure if thats spelled right)</p>
<p>&nbsp;I see some people like the boomer, I found them to slow and big target; the Kantus smoke granade will force people to
</p>
<p>&nbsp; leave the troikas and the silverback. The choice of what to become dependis alot on your play style</p>
<p>With a mix of tickers and sentapeeds the las few waves are not that hard.</p>
<p>I am up for earning it again, let me know and I will see if any of the guys I earned it with are up to it</p>

<p>i just finished it twice on trenches, no mics, just random ppl, first time with 5-ppl, second time with 4-ppl. i</p>
<p>i ran with tickers till like round 7, then i switched it to wild tickers to destroy guns while my team destroyed everything else. i noticed that tickers are great in the beggining as well as wretchs, then boomers, as long as u keep cover u could bring the
 enemies down while ur team of wretches bring them down. it was easy, but imo u should at least have 4 ppl.</p>

<h2>            How do I use the RUN Command in Windows 10&#63; Where do I go to find this&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Just updated Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 64, but can no longer find where to run the RUN command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to run SFC/runnow to correct a sending problem in Outlook 2010 email section, where I can no longer send emails.</p>
<p>All tests in Outlook 2010 show that I have the correct settings and a test email is apparently sent correctly. But when I come to use my email accounts, sending an email just will not function. Error message says I have no connection to the network , but
 this is not the case as I can receive emails and have full internet connection.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the Community, I found a possible solution, but I cannot find any way to enter a RUN Command.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All help appreciated</p>

<p>Most helpful, Prabhavathi. Wish MS would make this clear when they update their OS !</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a search in Windows 10 for this information, but Windows came up with a "nothing found" reply. Most odd!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now tried using the RUN command followed by SFC / scanner, to try to get round my Outlook 2010 problem, mentioned in another post last week by myself. The suggestion was that running SFC&nbsp; / scanner could possibly correct the problem of not being able
 to send emails in Outlook 2010 under Windows 10, but sadly this is not the case.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You invited me to come back to you if more help was needed, so, if you know of a possible solution, I should be grateful for your further advice.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again.</p>

    <title>&#34;An error occurred while applying security information to&#58; ... - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> david_l_107  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;An error occurred while applying security information to&#58; ... The system cannot find the file specified.&#34;</h2>
                    So this is what happened:
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I accidentally kicked my wife's laptop monitor, and I bought her a new one. The laptop seemed to be okay, but I couldn't see anything because of the busted monitor.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I bought an enclosure, took out the old HDD(Vista) and hook it up to the enclosure.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now I'm trying to move my wife's old files from the old HDD(Vista) onto her new laptop(Win 7), but I can't access them.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>So I did a little web-surfing, and tried the following.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Logged in as administrator, opened Properties, Security tab, Advanced button, Owner tab, Edit button, changed owner to myself(my wife) and checked the Replace owner on subs box.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And then a slew of errors come up. Every one says "An error occurred while applying security information to:".</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>And among those errors, about half of em had "The system cannot find the file specified", and the other half had "Access is denied."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>At the end, there's a separate error that says "Unable to set new owner on (Folder). The system cannot find the file specified."</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'd really appreciate some help.</div>
                </div>
