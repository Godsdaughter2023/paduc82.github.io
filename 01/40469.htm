<h2>            Window Batch File Commands Guru Help is Needed Please.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have inherited below batch file (saved in notepad) from former staff of my employer. This batch file is ran manually to archive files accross the shared network. It used to work but has now stopped working according to my colleague.&nbsp; I have investigated
 this to the point of running out of ideas. I am hoping not to design ssis package to perform this task has i dont want to change the company procedure due to their limited skill to manage it, when I&nbsp;leave.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, I am a SQL DBA and limited in batch file scripting hence i am desperately in need of help of guru out there to get this script working again.
</p>
<p>It is a very basic MOVE command, it is not apparent to me what is wrong with this script.&nbsp; Any suggestions or ideas or help is (are) highly appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Many thanks in advance for your help.</strong></p>
<p>

<p>Hi Shawn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your interest to help me. </p>
<p>I have right clicked on the batch file and selected trouble the compartibillity option. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The error i got is <strong><em>'the specified path does not contain a valid program (please select a program ending in .exe)'</em></strong> though the path selected or shown was the correct path of the batch file and the batch file is apparently .bat</p>
<p>Hope this shed any light on the issue. </p>
<p>and further to your wide guess, I have no permission to the network share drive where these files are archived.</p>
<p>Thanks and regards</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Shawn,</p>
<p>Sorry for late response. I have left for the day yesterday.</p>
<p>Yes, to answer your question. When I ran the batch file at the prompt. I got <strong>
<em>'System error 67&nbsp;has occurred,&nbsp; the network name cannot be found' </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>My investigation of this 'system error 67' was suggesting </em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>* updating network adaptor on the Domain controller driver or</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>*restarting the Distributed File System service of the domain controller.

<p>I have tried it and <strong><em>no access to the network path</em></strong>. I was susspecting that may be part of the problem and&nbsp; I have already raised Help Call to the IT Department to assist in setting up the access right to network share folders this

<h2>            Fonts No Longer Visible In Windows</h2>
                    I am running a very old version of Windows on one of my computers, Windows 95, and have recently run in to a problem where all fonts on the system have become invisible to applications. When I go to the fonts folder in the control panel I see that the
 fonts are all there, but in applications like Microsoft Word none of them show up in the fonts menu. Some applications like Corel Draw will not start at all because they say that they can find no fonts on the system. The fonts that the system uses for the
 icons on the desktop and dialogue boxes also appears to have changed.

<p>Hello chestercat7,</p>
<p>Support has been discontinued for Windows 95, however you might look at the&nbsp;KB article below.</p>
<div>KB Article ID: 314960 - How to install or remove a font in Windows<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314960" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/314960</a></div>

<div>Article ID: 146904 - Err Msg: Error Loading GDI.EXE. You Must Reinstall Windows<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/146904" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/146904</a></div>
<div>From the article:</div>
<div>
Method 1
Reinstall Windows.
Method 2
Boot the computer with a Windows 98 Startup disk with CD-ROM support. (Or, choose<strong>Command Prompt Only</strong> from the Windows 95/98
<strong>Startup</strong> menu if you have real-mode CD-ROM drivers installed, or if you have a copy of the Windows source files on your hard disk).<br />
<br />
<strong>NOTE</strong>: These instructions assume that your CD-ROM drive letter is drive D and that Windows is installed in the C:\Windows folder. If this is not the case, adjust the following instructions accordingly.
Windows 95
Type the following commands, pressing ENTER after each command:
<div>md c:\windows\fonts<br />
attrib +s c:\windows\fonts<br />
extract /a d:\win95\win95_02.cab *.fon /l c:\windows\fonts<br />
extract /a d:\win95\win95_02.cab *.ttf /l c:\windows\fonts</div>
Reboot the computer. If the Fonts folder exists, just use the <strong>extract</strong> commands to extract the fonts into the folder.</div>
<div>If this doesn't help, then please search on Internet for other articles that might assist you.</div>
<div>Sincerely,</div>

<br />This delay is caused by some Explorer's extension. Use third-party ShellExView program to turn off non-Microsoft extension and find a guilty.

            Hello Amir,
<br />
<br />I'm Independent Advisor and Microsoft MVP, here to help you with your question.
<br />
<br />Suggest you to run System File Checker scan:
<br />
<br />1. Search for 'command prompt' using Cortana or Windows Search.
<br />
<br />2. From results, right click on Command Prompt and select Run as administrator.
<br />
<br />3. Type sfc /scannow command and press Enter key.
<br />
<br />4. Let the command complete and then reboot the machine. 
<br />
<br />If issue still persists, try resetting File Explorer (explorer.exe) process:
<br />
<br />1. Press Windows Key + R and type SYSDM.CPL in Run. Click OK or press Enter key.
<br />
<br />2. In System Properties window, switch to Advanced tab, click Settings under Performance.
<br />
<br />3. Next, in Performance Options, under Processor scheduling, make sure that Adjust for best performance of: is set to Programs.
<br />
<br />4. Then in the same window, under Virtual memory, click Settings button.
<br />
<br />5. On Virtual Memory page, make sure Automatically manage paging file sizes for all drives option is checked. Click OK, then Apply, OK on rest of windows.
<br />
<br />6. Reboot the machine and see if issue is resolved now.
<br />
<br />Let us know if this helps!

            Here is that same procedure spelled out in more detail by one of your customer support representatives:<br />
<br />
<p><strong><span>1. Temporarily disable Firewall and third party antivirus program on the computer for a test.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>2. Verify relevant services</span></strong></p>
<p><span>=========================</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click "Start", type "services.msc" (without quotation marks) in Search Bar and press Enter.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type your password, or click Continue.

            <p>to stay permanently on the taskbar a program has to start when windows starts, look under options in your program to see if you can start it with windows or if a service has been added to services in administrative tools, set to started, automatic.

<h2>            Xbox Live Account and modded Xboxes</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, im new here on the forums, i apologize if &nbsp;i am doing anything wrong.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I currently live in Syria.&nbsp;<br />
the xbox scene in syria isn't that good at all. Probably 90% of all xbox 360 in the country is modded. its probably because of a lot of aspects. but most importantly that buying a legal copy of a game would get most the people in a financial problem. but i
 digress.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The thing is, i found a friend who has an unmodded xbox, and have used his to connect online.&nbsp;<br />
I had an offline account that i put on a usb that i moved from xbox to xbox incase i wanted to play with friends.<br />
Now i know that connecting my actual live account with that offline account is impossible to achieve.&nbsp;<br />
and even more so that most of the games played with that account are all from modded xboxes.<br />
so after i explained the situation, here are the questions.<br />
keep in mind that i don't want my live account or my friend's live account and xbox to be banned.</p>
<p>Will me moving my offline account to my friend's xbox harm him?<br />
What would happen if i connect that offline account with a live account. (i heard you can turn local accounts to live)&nbsp;<br />
What would happen if i put my live account on the same usb as the offline account?&nbsp;<br />
What would happen if i played with my live account on any modded xbox.&nbsp;</p>
<p>thank you for reading through this. Please be mindful that i havent done anything yet, and i won't unless nothing happens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>and i appologize to microsoft about the whole modding scene in my country.</p>

<p>Yeah it's perfectly fine to put your account on another console. You wont be able to download any of your purchased games on your friends Xbox though, but you can play disc based games and all that.
</p>
<p>As for the second part on connecting a live account. In order to do so, the offline account or local as you said, can't have an account attached to it yet. Once you connect it, that gamertag is part of that email/account.
</p>
<p>As for playing on a modded console, do not do that. It will most likely get you banned.

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>I have been having the same problem while trying to upload documents on my online classes. 1. I wasn't ever using any mail apps It was just on my online class website. 2. I don't get any error messages it just goes back. 3.&nbsp; I have never been able to upload
 files 4. I have not made any recent changes, it is a fairly new computer. I would really like to know if there is any way to fix this bug as it has been quite an inconvenience. Thanks.</p>

            <p>I have the same problem. Uploading resumes is impossible on the RT. I have tried to save my word documents in various formats (doc, docx, rtf, and PDF) the only one that works sometimes is the PDF which isn't even useful half the time because most companies
 don't accept resumes in PDF format. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Every time I try to upload a regularly formatted document nothing happens. The browse/upload bar stays blank.

            <p>Thanks for getting back to this topic. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I tried attaching the file again today, and it worked perfectly. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I do not think the initial error was due to any add-ons since my surface is only two weeks old and I have yet to install any. I think it may have been an issue related to sky drive. The file I tried to attach were created in Word, converted to PDF and stored
 on my sky drive. After saving the files I tried to attach the PDF to an E-mail, but got the mentioned error. It may be because sky drive had not discovered the files yet? I am not sure. But it seems to work now, so it is a bit tricky to do any further testing,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for your input anyway.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Best regards</p>
<p><br />
</p>

            Hi haz3boys,<br />
<br />
If the game requires a specific graphics card configuration you may need to install a graphics card.<br />

    <title>autochk cannot run due to a recently installed software package, error - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            autochk cannot run due to a recently installed software package, error 766F6C756D652E63 3F1, proceeds to a black screen with only the cursor</h2>
                    <div>
<div>Occured after several BSOD playing Fallout 4. On boot up, it attempts to check disks and gives me "autochk cannot run due to a recently installed software package", and the error is "766F6C756D652E63 3F1", after which
 I'm met with a black screen and only the cursor. I suspect this is something to do with my AMDA00 interface driver, at least that's what it said before I uninstalled it in safe mode, for better or worse. Now in device manager it tells me there is an Unknown
 Other device, "The drivers for this device are not installed. (Code 28)<br />
There is no driver selected for the device information set or element.<br />
To find a driver for this device, click Update Driver." Update Driver doesn't work. I've performed a disk clean up, cleaned my registry, checked for malware and updated all of my other drivers also.<br />

<h2>            Not all drive letters are available in Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p><span>File Explorer (My Computer) displays devices with Drive Letters: C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, L.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In my situation:</span></p>
<p><span>Letters C and D are assigned to partitions on the main disk</span></p>
<p><span>Letter E is assigned to USB memory stick</span></p>
<p><span>Letter F is assigned to DVD RW Drive</span></p>
<p><span>Letters G, H, I, J are assigned to card readers</span></p>
<p><span>Letter L is assigned to en external hard drive</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In this situation, when I connect any other device, it does not matter if it is an external hard disk or an USB stick, the device is recognized by the
 system and shown in Disk Management with a new Drive Letter, which may be K or M-Z, but it is invisible in the File Explorer (My Computer).&nbsp;The recently connected Device is active, the contents can be seen via Explore in Disk Management, but it is not shown
 in M</span><span>y</span><span> Computer.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>When changing a Drive Letter, the drop down menu offers all accessible Drive Letters. When a letter&nbsp; between M - Z, or K is selected, the device will be shown in Disk Management with the selected Drive Letter, but it will not be shown in the File Explorer
 (My Computer).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Conclusion: Only devices assigned to Drive Letters &nbsp;C, D, E. F. G, H, I, J, L are shown in File Explorer (My Computer).&nbsp; Devices assigned to all other Drive Letters are shown only in Disk Management, being invisible in File Explorer (My Computer).</p>
<p>Is there any restriction in Windows 8.1 which could explain this issue?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 installation error 0xc0000001</h2>
                    <p>So I go to boot my new pc that I built with a Windows 10 pro USB Key inserted. I select the USB as my boot device and I can get into the Windows boot manager where I can select to either install x32 or x64. I select x64 and it says "loading files" followed
 by the error message "A&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">required device isn't connected or can't be acessed&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">Error

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">A forum post said it could be many things including RAM being faulty. I retried everything after removing all but one
 module to the same effect.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">I can't run memtest, any repair utility, or Windows function as it doesn't even start to install anything. The only devices
 I have hooked up are a keyboard, monitor, the Windows USB Key, and an nvme ssd which I intend to be the home for my os. I'm contemplating making my own USB Key but I don't think it makes sense that the legit one I bought at best buy wouldn't work.&nbsp;</span></p>

<br />I am Sumit, an Independent Advisor and a 2-Year Windows Insider MVP here to help.

<br />It is possible that the USB you got from Best buy is corrupted. In that case, to narrow down this create your own installation media:

<h2>            INTEL DRIVER For windows 10 BUG &#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>WINDOWS 10 USERS,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has did well for its windows 10 and also working hard to address the bugs. For windows 10, drivers are forced which is a major issue and is already VIRAL in the community. This windows 10 forced updates are causing major issues for example, crashes,
 bootloops, freezes, etc. Big example, NVIDIA driver which was having a major bug&nbsp;and was considered the latest driver was the worst that broken, stopped and caused disaster to many PC's.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now one such issue is the<strong> INTEL DRIVER </strong>for windows 10. At first, it was thought that why the screen refresh rate is 40 Hz but not 60Hz, now its confirmed, the<strong> INTEL driver for windows 10 is in BETA state and not fully stable and
 compatible which caused the issue to show an unpleasing and rough desktop graphics experience in windows 10</strong>. The windows 10 intel driver is also in manufacturing condition and is forced updated by Microsoft to the windows 10 PC's as because you are
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">bound to receive the update cause this particular windows 10 intel driver update CANNOT BE RECEIVED DIRECTLY THROUGH INTEL DRIVER DOWNLOAD WEBSITE. Intel themselves asking users to receive the update through windows update.
</span></p>
<p>ISSUES with the driver known till date:</p>
<p><strong><em>1. Refresh rate is related to graphics properties and not with the monitor (that means updating monitor driver will not solve the issue)</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>2. Refresh rate is always&nbsp;40 Hz on battery.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>3.&nbsp;Awkward graphics for&nbsp;many (Not all).</em></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this issue would help&nbsp;MICROSOFT &amp; INTEL to work together and solve. We hope that we get a stable driver and option to choose&nbsp;updates ourselves from the windows update.&nbsp;</p>

                    Pretty simple question.&nbsp; My HP laptop had Vista Home Premium X64 factory installed.&nbsp; After numerous issues with system resource use, I decided to try out windows 7.&nbsp; So I installed Win7 Ult, but now find that I can't find any information about BUYING a
 product key.&nbsp; I wanted to know if my HP Vista key would work in activating Windows 7, or if anyone has any information about how much I'd have to pay Microsoft for a valid license.

<h2>            ISP camera device problem windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello, i upgraded to Windows 10 yesterday, i have finally managed to install all drivers but camera does not work.</p>
<p>I installed "Intel AVStream Camera" and then rebooted my tablet. Sadly it still does not work, i tried to enable it in Settings-Privacy but i didn't get any result. I also did all the updates and disabled and enabled the driver too.</p>
<p>Any idea about how to make it work?</p>
<p>Camera always says "<strong>Something went wrong</strong> <em>Make sure your camera is connected and not being used by another app."</em></p>
<p><em>Thanks in advance</em></p>

<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p>
<span>Make older programs run in this version of Windows</span></p>
<p>
<span>Most programs written for Windows&nbsp;XP also work in this version of Windows, but some older programs might run poorly or not at all. If a program written for an earlier version of
 Windows doesn't run correctly, use the Program Compatibility Wizard to change the compatibility settings for the program. To change settings for a program manually, use the individual program's Compatibility tab.</span></p>
<span>Run the Program Compatibility Wizard</span>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Open the Program Compatibility Wizard by clicking the
</span></span><span><span><strong>Start</strong></span></span><span><span> button, clicking
</span></span><span><span><strong>Control Panel</strong></span></span><span><span>, clicking
</span></span><span><span><strong>Programs</strong></span></span><span><span>, and then clicking
</span></span><strong><span><span>Use an older program with this version of
</span></span><span><span>Windows</span></span></strong><span><span>.</span></span><span>
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Follow the instructions in the wizard.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>For more information check out this link which talks about “Make older programs
 run in this version of Windows”</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><a href="http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/bf416877-c83f-4476-a3da-8ec98dcf5f101033.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/bf416877-c83f-4476-a3da-8ec98dcf5f101033.mspx</span></a></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Along with flash player, I would also suggest installing the latest java component on your computer from the below
 mentioned link.</span></p>
<p><strong><span><a href="http://www.java.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.java.com/en/</a></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 4:
</span></strong><span>Remove all the temporary files by using the Disk Clean up.</span></p>
<p><span>If you want to reduce the number of unnecessary files on your hard disk to free up disk space and help your computer run faster,
 use Disk Cleanup. It removes temporary files, empties the Recycle Bin, and removes a variety of system files and other items that you no longer need.</span></p>
<span>To delete files using Disk Cleanup</span>
<p>
<span><span>The following procedure cleans up files associated with your user account. You can also use Disk Cleanup to clean up all the files on your computer.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span><span>Open Disk Cleanup by clicking the
</span></span><span><span><strong>Start</strong></span></span><span><span> button. In the search box, type
</span></span><span><span><strong>Disk Cleanup</strong></span></span><span><span>, and then, in the list
 of results, click </span></span><span><span><strong>Disk Cleanup</strong></span></span><span><span>.</span></span><span>
</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the
<span><strong>Drives</strong></span> list, click the hard disk drive that you want to clean up, and then click
<span><strong>OK</strong></span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the
<span><strong>Disk Cleanup</strong></span> dialog box, on the <span>
<strong>Disk Cleanup</strong></span> tab, select the check boxes for the file types that you want to delete, and then click
<span><strong>OK</strong></span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the message that appears, click
<span><strong>Delete files</strong></span>.</span></span></p>

<h2>            installing Flight Sim X on Win7</h2>
                    There have been many posts about problems installing Flight Sim X on win7 but I haven't seen any that address the problem I am having.&nbsp; The installation gets to the very end, and the installation screen is showing the message "publishing product information"
 when after a while I get a screen that says "The wizard was interrupted before Microsoft Flight Simulator X could be completely installed/uninstalled."&nbsp; All the files except for a few disappear from the FSX folder and&nbsp;FSX is not installed.&nbsp; I've tried 3 times
 and this happens every time.&nbsp; Has anyone run into this problem?&nbsp; Any ideas on what's going on or how to finish the install?&nbsp; Thanks.

            <p>The company I work for has PowerBroker installed on all of its machines and it turns out that was causing the problem. Someone at our IT ran the install as admin (which users can't do) instead of PowerBroker admin and it installed OK.</p>

<h2>            BSoD-- NMI Hardware Failure caused by only League of Legends</h2>
                    <p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been having issues with my computer ever since I first got it, but have been reluctant to send it for warranty repair as I am afraid that my issue is slightly too trivial since it only arises upon gaming. The game in question is League of Legends, but
 I am unsure of other games since I only play 2 games (the other being CS:GO). The problem does not seem to be due to LoL, since I have reinstalled it countless times and yet the crashes still ensue. These crashes can occur in 2 ways -- one of which involves
 League going unresponsive, but the computer still continues to run albeit I am unable to close the game, leading to me requiring to force-restart via pressing the power button. The other is a direct Blue Screen, with the cause being a NMI Hardware Failure
 (will post the DMP files) linked to the core processes hal.dll and ntoskrnl.exe. I am currently running Windows 10, but this problem also existed in Windows 8.1, with the cause of crashes being varied then, occasionally involving hal.dll and ntoskrnl.exe,
 and other times&nbsp;dxgkrnl.sys and watchdog.sys (I used WhoCrashed to obtain such data). These issues seem to occur randomly (and only when I am in a League game), and most often occur when I am 30-40 minutes into a game. ]</p>

<p>
</p><p>I could upload the older (Windows 8) DMP Files as well, but I'll just leave it as such for now.</p>

            <p>Check the event viewer for when the crashes take place.</p>
<p>If you look at the windows servicing entries and the time of windows updates </p>
<p>running, it may be at the same time.</p>
<p>Win10 home gets the automatic updates and restarts so unless </p>
<p>some modifications &nbsp;to how Wu runs it is still running this way.</p>
<p>I am on steam and have seen more issues running games that worked before</p>
<p>the latest updates in april.</p>
<p>It is almost as if win10 forgot how the games was set to run and I have to reconfigure it again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;The display drivers can also be overwritten on the home version so even if&nbsp;</p>
<p>you installed the intel and gforce driver the MS basic driver could be causing the issue.</p>

    <title>Unidentified notification chime knocks me out of current window - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unidentified notification chime knocks me out of current window</h2>
                    I replaced my old PC last year with a Windows 10 machine.&nbsp; Once or twice a week it would make this chime noise (I assume its a notification of some sort) and knock me out of my current window (extremely annoying in-game).&nbsp; It doesn't close the window or
 anything, it just has the effect of clicking outside the window.&nbsp; Over the last year I've done every troubleshoot I could find...nothing helps.&nbsp; I got the bright idea to try the Windows sounds list in the Control Panel, but this newer machine has no Control
 Panel anymore (boo, devs).&nbsp; I've shutdown the notifications in my A/V software, thinking it was some sort update notification, but that didn't help.&nbsp; I eventually shut down all Windows notifications from every app that was registered...its still happening.&nbsp;
 Over the last year, the frequency of the occurrence has increased to every couple hours and its getting very frustrating!&nbsp; Help!

<p>Hi Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'd like to verify a few things in order for us to assist you effectively. Kindly confirm the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Do you see any small pop up message from the Action Center when you hear the chime?</li><li>In what particular situation do you usually hear that chime sound? Do you hear it when working on some documents?</li><li>When playing games, do you use some type of game controller? If so, is it connected via USB or Bluetooth?</li></ul>
<p>

<p>It's possible that the chime sound could be due to a "connect and disconnect" happening with your input devices. Check your cables and verify that you have the latest drivers installed.<br />

            Hello,
<br />
<br />I hope I can help you today
<br />
<br />The error that you mention to us, is due to failures in device drivers. These are not updated or are not installed.
<br />
<br />To correct the incident, you must access the manufacturer's technical support page, in order to download and install the latest drivers. Look especially for chipset drivers, BIOS and system utilities.
<br />
<br />I hope this can help
<br />
<br />regards

<p>Hello Greg!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on Xbox Forums! As mentioned before by the Ambassador, you will need to try and create a
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/billing/xbox-subscriptions/digital-goods-subscriptions-refund" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Refund Request</a> for the purchase your brother made on your account. I would also recommend making a
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/my-account/security/create-xbox-one-passkey" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Passkey</a>, then making it a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/my-account/security/passkey-purchases" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Requirement for Purchases</a> to try and prevent this from happening again in the future. If you have any further questions please feel free to reply back letting us know. Thank you again for posting on Xbox Forums!&nbsp;</p>

            you can request a refund but to be honest it is difficult, you have to have a really good reason.
