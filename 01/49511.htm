<h2>            Changing Existing &#34;other accounts&#34; to family by changing local login to microsoft account login&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I have installed Windows 10 on a new laptop and set up Microsoft Account logins for me and my family including children, which is working fine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now also upgraded Window 7 ultimate to&nbsp; Widows 10 on my older desktop. I have changed my account login to the same Microsoft Account as on the laptop which has worked fine. The accounts of my family members have now appreared under family but as blocked.
 Their exising accounts on the desktop are under other accounts. I have tried to change the local&nbsp; logins for their "other accounts" to their Miscrosoft Account logins but when asked to type the old password in one more time nothing happens.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also tried the same with allowing them to login using their microsoft accounts under family, but this still doesn't allow them to change the local logins to miscrosoft account logins.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone tell me how I can get my family member's accounts currently under other account moved to family by changing from the local login to Miscrosoft login?</p>
<p />

            <p>I have attached a screenshot of my account management section. It shows the accounts associated with my hotmail login as well as the local accounts that are currently shown under other accounts but I want to change to microsft account logins.&nbsp; I managed
 to do this with my account but am unable to do it with the remaing three. Allowing acces to this PC for the microsft account logins provides an additional logins but still doesn't allow me to change the local accounts.</p>

            <p>Hello Oscar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Do you get any error code or message while using/opening store apps?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of now, I recommend you to go through following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>STEP 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Clear &amp; Reset Windows Store Cache</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Press Windows + R, type
<strong>WSReset.exe </strong>and then click on<strong> ok.</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span><span>Windows Store will open and you’ll get a confirmation message saying that:
</span></span><strong><span>The cache for the&nbsp;Store&nbsp;was&nbsp;cleared. You can now browse the Store for apps.</span></strong></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>STEP 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>Since the issue is occurring while using windows store we have to troubleshoot the windows store app.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the article based on
<strong>“<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/what-troubleshoot-problems-app" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Troubleshoot problems with an app</a>”</strong></span></p>

<h2>            Block world game doesn&#39;t work in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Original title: Games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before Win 10 I was using the free version of Block World from Store to see if I liked the game and was considering Minecraft.&nbsp;I found I really enjoyed Block World.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;After Win 10 Block World no longer works.&nbsp; The free version has been removed and&nbsp;it is for purchase only.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I have seen on the&nbsp;Web that Minecraft from Mojang&nbsp;will not work on Win 10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MS offers Minecraft for sell in their&nbsp;Store.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that why the game does not work on Win 10?&nbsp;

    <title>How can i stop windows media player library grouping albums in - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> calicop  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can i stop windows media player library grouping albums in Alphabetical groups&#63;</h2>
                    my WMP 12/11 library keeps grouping my albums in alphabetical groups. eg.. Albums starting with A under (a), ect ect.<br />
<br />
i have tried clicking all the coloums and choosing Sort By "...", and checked that there where no hidden files.<br />
<br />
it has only started doing this once i added a few more albums to my library, so it must automatically do it after a certain amount of albums are added.. Is there a way to disable it all together?<br />
<br />
its very similar to going to My computer, right clicking in an empty space in the xplorer and choosing "Group By Name"<br />
<br />
EDIT: heres a picture.<br />

                    For the past week, my computer has been randomly shutting down. I don't get any blue screens or errors, it just shuts down. It's not very hot and I have performed a registry clean with CCleaner in case that might have been the problem, but it's not fixed.

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>I haven't done any major changes or installed any new software. Also, I haven't noticed a pattern about the crashes in point of time, temperature of the computer or software.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have tried to run CCleaner to clean the registries and even if it solves all the problems it finds, the next time I run it, it finds problems again. Could this be caused by a virus? I have ESET NOD 32 installed as an antivirus software but it hasn't
 detected anything. I have tried to perform a full scan of the computer with the software but it never stays on long enough to finish the antivirus scan.</div>

<h2>            Backing up and re-installing questions - preparing for the expiration of the free W10 in July 2016</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Hi guys</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to make sure that I have a working <strong>backup</strong> of Windows 10
<strong>before </strong>the MS (free W10) deadline expires in July 2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am doing this to ensure that in the years to come (e.g. 2017) it will be very easy for me to rapidly restore my system using&nbsp; Acronis or some other software.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px"><strong>To that effect I have already:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Backed up my Dell OEM W8.0 Pro (2013)</li><li>Updated my Windows 8.0 Pro to W8.1 Pro</li><li>Updated my Windows 8.1 Pro to W10 Pro.&nbsp; <br />
</li><li>After ensuring I had the W10 activation, I then <strong>wiped the whole system</strong> and downloaded the Media Creation tool, ISO etc and installed everything 'clean'</li><li>After an activation problem, I then contacted a MSVP here in on the community board who said there were issues with some early W10 clean installs, and he gave me my Product Key which I entered without a problem.</li><li>My W10 Pro (64)&nbsp; has been working without issue since then.</li><li>My understanding at the time was that doing future clean installs would be easy - and activate without issue.</li><li>I do an annual backup which I never erase -&nbsp; as well as interim backups.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>QUESTION1</strong></p>
<p>I shall be doing an Acronis ('complete disk image') backup now of my (presently build 1511) working system. Let's call it Feb 2016 backup to make my questions easier to understand....</p>
<ul>
<li>If I then proceed to totally erase my system,<strong> can I then download the latest build 1511 ISO,&nbsp; do a clean install again, and (most importantly) activate automatically/without issues?.</strong></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>QUESTION2</strong></p>
<p>I will assume the clean install will go ok without issue.</p>
<p>I then will proceed to do an Acronis ('disk image') backup of this clean install . Let's call it March 2016 backup.</p>
<ul>
<li>If in the future I discover that this March 2016 backup is corrupt, <strong>could I restore the earlier Feb 2016 backup,</strong> and
<strong>would it activate OK without issue? </strong>The reason for asking is that the build number will of course have incremented beyond 1511 by then.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>QUESTION3</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Finally, <strong>would it be important or more effective in any way to do my (permanent) annual archive backup after July 2016 ?&nbsp;
</strong></li></ul>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">The reason I ask is that I am guessing that one of the updates in July/August 2016 may inhibit any updating of older backups.
</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p>I hope my questions make sense, and I would appreciate knowledgable replies.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>

            <p>firstly windows 10 will <strong>NOT </strong>expire in July, the <strong>offer
</strong>to upgrade from windows 7 or 8 free of charge, expires in July. providing you have upgraded to windows 10 before then you can reinstall it any time you want.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; yes. if it doesn't activate automatically for any reason you can use your windows 8 key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Yes. it will activate, or, you can download the later build and activate. (because you upgraded before the deadline)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; can't have too many backups.&nbsp;you will still be able to update any version of windows 10, it is only the free upgrade from windows 7 or 8 that will expire in July.</p>

            <p>Each ATI image is a complete standalone image so the status of any other image is completely irrelevant. The backed up image is of an activated Windows 10 installation so the restore is activated by default, it does not have to reactivate with one caveat.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The license for the Windows 10 upgrade is valid for the lifetime of the device. A restore to a new motherboard in the future would be classified as a new computer and invalidates the license. If your original 8 license is transferable&nbsp;you&nbsp;could reinstall
 it and upgrade back through to Win10 before July for free.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After July the license remains valid for the original device so a clean install can be done on the same registered device at any time even after the free period has expired. It would be recommended to get the latest ISO for any rebuild but the license is
 for Windows 10, it does not at this stage restrict to particular builds.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The build number is also irrelevant, any restore of an old image will just appear that the computer has been turned off since the backup. The next time it connects it will then update itself to the latest build.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Electronic distribution allows Microsoft to refresh the master image published for download, whether they do or not for any particular release is down to them. One of the problems with the Windows 7 distribution was that once SP1 had been integrated no further
 builds were published, the last install I did from an ISO download required 128 updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However backups are only half the process, it does not matter how many you do if you are not sure they are recoverable. The only solution is a test restore. In fact Microsoft have moved away from complete image backups, instead recommending clean installs,
 reinstalling software and connecting into the Microsoft Account to reinstate OneDrive and the File History function.</p>

<p>Yes, I couldn't find it too but I can fix the upside down scrolling issue by downloading a driver here:</p>
<p>
<span>
</span></p><p>http://support.asus.com/download.aspx?SLanguage=en&amp;m=Touchpad </p>
<p>
</p><p>When prompted the OS, just enter Windows 8.1, download the 64-bit driver and install it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Asus A451L, 64-bit and just upgraded to Windows 10. Touchpad is now back to normal.</p>

<h2>            Laptop keeps shutting down&#33;</h2>
                    <p>hello.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I started to use my laptop after a while and I realised that it shuts down randomly, some of the reasons it shuts down:</p>
<p>1.When I insert the charging cord or take it out</p>
<p>2.When I move my mouse quickly</p>
<p>3.When I move the laptop or press a key with a little force</p>
<p>4.When I click play on any game</p>
<p>
</p><p>and I guess when I do any of these, the screen get’s glitchy and it says “Your pc ran into a problem”or something like that and it restarts, then when again I do any of these it turns off again, so it’s almost unusable.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am waiting for your valuable opinions, thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<br />
<br />With your laptop turned on, pick it up and shake it, does your laptop turn off?
<br />
<br />If so, it may be that one of the sensors (possibly the Accelerometer on your hard drive is either faulty or a new device driver needs to be loaded for it . . .

<h2>            Connecting via HDMI &#38;amp&#59; Optical cable question</h2>
                    
<p><span>Is it possible to run an optical cable and a hdmi cable from my xbox one to my receiver without causing any conflicts?</span><br />
<span>I assume, to use the Optical Cable, I would go into sound preferences, and choose optical connection, which would&nbsp;eliminate&nbsp;the HDMI from doing audio, and only video?</span></p>
<span>I assume, to use the Optical Cable, I would go into sound preferences, and choose optical connection, which would&nbsp;eliminate&nbsp;the HDMI from doing audio, and only video?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Basically, with the game Rocksmith 2014, they recommend running HDMI from TV to my Xbox One, and using Optical for audio to my receiver. &nbsp;As this wont work, because I have an apple tv plugged into the receiver, and having my tv plugged into my xbox
 one, opposed to how I currently have it, connected to receiver, won't work.</span></p>

            <p><span>Hi JohnE Mensah,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>1. Do you have any applications from Whale Communications Ltd. installed on the system?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Whlmgr.dll is a process file from company Whale Communications Ltd. belonging to product ComponentManager Module.</span></p>
<p><span>Step 1:</span></p>
<p><span>If you have any applications from Whale Communications, then you can unintsall and reinstall the same and check.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Uninstall a Program</a></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Step 2:</span></p>
<p><span>If not, <span>&nbsp;then </span></span><span>you can try performing </span><span>a clean boot and check if the issue occurs.</span></p>
<p><span>A clean boot helps to verify if any third party application services or startup item is causing this issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>You may refer the following KB article to put the computer in clean boot:</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>If your issue is resolved after performing Clean Boot, then follow the steps mentioned in the above KB article to narrow down the exact source.</span></p>
<p><span>Also, after resolving the issue, see the section on the clean boot link to how to return your computer to a Normal startup mode by following the steps under “Reset the computer to start as usual.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope this information is helpful. </span></p>

            Why not admit there is nothing anyone can do or you have no idea what to do about it yaself as &nbsp;clearly you ain't qualified for this kind of problem solving instead of wasting peoples time with pointless bs and time wasting suggestions. This is a well
 known problem as well as a damn good question that needs to be solved. Why not go get someone that can help ha? That would actually be helpful!

<p>There's no doubt that issues exist, the problem is too many people getting their knickers in a twist over issues that are not game breaking. &nbsp;I have had my fair share of issues over the last 105hrs but I have managed to complete all main and faction quest
 lines, which is the main aim of the game!</p>

<p>Exactly! &nbsp;And my point is that I can't progress one of the faction quest lines because the screen freezes every time I try to enter Fellglow Keep. &nbsp; Maybe its not a big deal to some, but I'd really like to complete all the main quests and faction quest lines
 in this game.</p>

    <title>Missing Drives On Windows Explorer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Missing Drives On Windows Explorer</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having an issue where no local drives are showing in windows explorer. I am able to browse to any drive via inputting the path in the address bar in Explorer or via CMD, and net use shows all mapped drives.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Troubleshooting&nbsp;</strong><strong>Completed</strong></p>
<p>Rebuilt Profile - This fixed the issue, but the drive disappeared the next day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Checked for the hide specified drives registry key - it does not exist on the endpoint.</p>
<p>Checked for hide specified drives GPO - It is not set at the GPO or local policy level.</p>
<p>Had the user login to a different computer, the issue does not follow him.<br />
Logged into the affected endpoint with other user accounts, the issue did not occur, looks to be profile specific.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has occurred twice now at the same location with two different users on two different computers. &nbsp;The first computer was resolved by a system restore (Windows 7). Second computer is still missing drives (Windows 10). Has any one come across this before?<br />
</p>

<p>This is similar to what is happening on my home computer. Certain drive letters will not appear in Windows Explorer. I have to manually type the drive letter to list the contents. It affects the external hard drives and USBs that I connect to the computer
 that automatically get assigned the next consecutive drive letter. They simply do not appear in Explorer, but show up in Device Manager with no issues.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I use Disk Management and reassign the drive to a different letter, then the external hard drive appears in Explorer normally. It's only certain letters (like E: and F: and G:) that don't appear. They used to appear fine, but stopped a long time ago after
 an update was applied.</p>

    <title>External hard drive and expansion packs - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            External hard drive and expansion packs</h2>
                    <p>Hi! I bought games that came with expansion pack disks. Most said I needed a hard drive to install it, so I went and bought an external hard drive. Everything seemed to work fine, but when I put in the disk to download the pack it still said that I needed a hard drive, even though the external one is plugged in and has plenty of space on it. Is there any way to solve this problem? Thanks !</p>

            <p>edit: some games will download content on it no problem, like shadow of mordor, but others won't, like Dragon Age Inquisition. If I borrow someone else's xbox, download it on its hard drive and then transfer it to my external one, will it work?</p>

 </blockquote> <p>I searched all the places I could and there was nothing helpful about external hard drives. It seems the only problem is that these games need one made specifically for xbox to download. But it works if I transfer it on my hard drive, so i can play just fine :)&nbsp; Just going to add that internal hard drives&nbsp;for Xbox are much less trouble if you wanna play these kind of games and probably&nbsp;as expensive, in case someone was thinking about buying an external one. Thanks for your help! Not many people try to help, it's really appreciated&nbsp; :D&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Have you made any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>Run the Hardware troubleshooter and check if it helps.</p>
<p><b>Open the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter</b>:
</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Open-the-Hardware-and-Devices-troubleshooter</span></a>
</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span></b></p>
<p>Boot to safe mode and check if the issue persists, if the issue does not persist then the issue may be due to some third party application. To check which application is causing
 the issue, place the computer in clean boot state and check if it helps.</p>
<p><b>Step 1:</b></p>
<p><b>Boot to safe mode in Windows 7</b>:
</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Step 2:</b></p>
<p>Place the computer in clean boot state and then check whether it helps.</p>
<p><b>How to troubleshoot problem by performing clean boot in Windows 7:</b><br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><b>Note:</b> Once you are done with the troubleshooting, perform the steps in
<b>Step 7</b>: to reset computer as usual.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Update the driver software of the wireless mouse from the manufacturer’s website or from Windows update and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly:</span></strong><b><br />
</b><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Update-a-driver-for-hardware-that-isnt-working-properly</span></a>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the above mentioned methods do not help, then it would be better to contact the manufacturer of the mouse for further assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope the information is helpful.</p>

<br />
If so, where are the drivers? Microsoft's link to Canon USA doesn't even list this model. Looking at other Canon sites (Europe, Australia) doesn't produce any 64-bit drivers for this model (which I bought new in 2009).<br />

    <title>After Windows update on Dell Laptop, battery not detected - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            After Windows update on Dell Laptop, battery not detected</h2>
                    <p>After being prompted to do so, I accepted the recent round of Microsoft updates. My Dell laptop was plugged in, connected to wifi, no issues with battery prior to this point. Upon restarting, the laptop will not function unless plugged in, the battery icon
 says "battery not detected". This is a fairly new laptop, no previous issues and this literally happened right after the update so the update must be the problem. How do I fix this?</p>

    <title>Win-10 Millenium Update Keeps Failing at 18&#37; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> dbo_111  say:</h3>
<h2>            Win-10 Millenium Update Keeps Failing at 18&#37;</h2>
                    <p>I'm tearing my hair out here. After successfully having upgraded to the Millenium build Win10 on two other PC's, I'm having one troublesome computer that refuses to perform the upgrade.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried a heap of regular things to troubleshoot it, from clearing the download cache to even running an ISO image. All behave the same way. Update starts, computer reboots and install gets to around 18%, then restart and restore of old operating system.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reported error (which I only get from the ISO install) is : </p>
<p>" 0x80070002 - 0c20007"</p>
<p>"The installation failed in the SAFE_OS phase with an error during INSTALL_DRIVERS operation"</p>
<p>
</p><p>The machine is already on Windows 10 (1511). </p>
<p>After the failed attempt the update service of course tries to do a fresh download of the rather large update file yet again! (hugely bandwidth intensive and a waste of time!).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help or suggestions are seriously appreciated. Already lost most of the weekend trying to sort this one out.

<h2>            Prevent Deletion of Administrator User Accounts</h2>
                    Hi<br />
<br />
My name is Muhammed Hasan Ahmed and i am using Windows XP Professional Service Pack 2. I need assistance with managing User Accounts on my Desktop Computer. I submitted my query to a Microsoft Live Chat Representative but she didn't had sufficient echnical
 information about the topic to be able to assist me in this matter.<br />
<br />
Here's the issue:<br />
<br />
I have 2 Administrator accounts on my computer. First account is mine and the Second account (named HOME) is for home users. The account i use is password-protected. HOME account does not have password. I want to prevent the HOME account from deleting any other
 user accounts, either its a Limited account or an Administrator account. However, HOME account requires Administrator Rights so it cannot be switched to Limited Account. Is there any other way to do this without changing the account type to Limited User ??
 What could be the possible steps to perform this task ???<br />
&nbsp;<br />

<p>Big the cat has some tougher (or more annoying missions) firstly you need to make sure you have the upgrades, some are in levels and some outside and near about, then in the level cast near to where froggy is and wiggle the stick, not too much but enough
 to make some vibrations in the water, you can tell this by the fact froggy or fish near by will turn to approach.
</p>
<p>When Froggy bites and you get the message , move the tumbstick down to yank the hook in and press reel to get froggy on the hook, once you've got it hooked try to only reel when froggy is facing towards you and when he's pulling try to only reel once in
 a while to try and get him to turn, you can however move the tumbstick to waggle the line which can help turn froggy round. (A good tip is right at the start Life Bigs bed up to find a better line.</p>
<p>The DLC is the DX edition add on, you have to unlock metal sonic and the extra missions are mainly challange like missions on exsisting levels.</p>

                    I am finding that Surface RT does not have an App to run just about everything. I now find that I can't transfer music from a flashdrive that was on Window Media Player.&nbsp; This major flaw is never told to prospective buyers. I would not have bought.

            Windows Media Player is a program on Windows 8.&nbsp; It primarily gets its music from the stored files in the music folder.<br />
<br />
If you opened up the File Manager on your computer that has the music, click on the MUSIC folder you see in the left tree.&nbsp; If that folder is blank, then your music has been stored somewhere else.&nbsp; Check the other folders including the Downloads folder.<br />
<br />
Windows Media Player scans the entire computer for files and catalogs them but won't display where they are stored.&nbsp; You have to manually browse the folder via the File Manager to find them.<br />
<br />
Best to stick a pendrive into the USB port and when you are looking around and find the files, copy them over to the pendrive.<br />
<br />
If it is music you have been downloading, most of the time they will go to the Downloads folder or to the last location where you had downloaded a file from Internet Explorer.<br />
<br />
When I have backed up people's data to work on their computers, I have noticed that a lot of them stored pictures, videos and music in the Documents folder for some weird reason.&nbsp; However the program in windows scan the computer for the media type they are
 designed for and will organize them in their own built in file manager.<br />
<br />
Always best to stay organized.&nbsp; Chances are, your music files are scattered all over the place.<br />
<br />
You can organize at the same time you are copying them.&nbsp; Just tell the program to "Cut" and then "Paste" to the pendrive.&nbsp; That way, it will move the files to the pendrive and then when you are done, and you want the music to stay on your main computer, just
 copy the music back onto the main computer into the MUSIC folder.<br />
<br />
That way you will always know where they are and the music is not only organized on your computer but also copied onto the pendrive so that you can copy them onto the RT.<br />
<br />
I kept mine pretty simple.&nbsp; I put all of my files onto a micro-SD card and inserted it into the RT of mine.&nbsp; I opened up the XBox Music app and waited about two minutes and bingo, my music was being cataloged and ready to play.&nbsp; Most people screw that up and
 think the computer can't find their music.&nbsp; They forget that they have to WAIT and let the computer scan the drives for the media.&nbsp; That RT can be slow but sure.<br />

            All of your files are going to be on you main computer, not the RT.&nbsp; You are trying to get your files from the main computer "TO" the tablet.<br />
<br />
Right now, we are trying to FIND your music so that you can copy onto a pendrive so that you can then copy it onto the RT.&nbsp; You can park the RT, you don't need it right now.&nbsp; Get on your Touchsmart and on the desktop, open the file manager and your folder are
 listed on the upper left corner.&nbsp; Search each of those folders for your music.&nbsp; They are supposed to be in the MUSIC folder and since you have iTunes, iTunes creates a sub-folder in MUSIC called "iTunes".&nbsp; Any media you bought through the iTunes Store will
 go into that sub-folder.<br />
<br />
Once you can find the music files themselves (you don't need the media players running, you can close those), insert the pendrive and copy the files over to the pendrive.<br />
<br />
Now then for playback of those files, especially iTunes, there are a few programs in the Store that will.&nbsp; In fact, the RT may already have the codecs some of the formats already.&nbsp; I haven't tried it.<br />
<br />
For your main MP3 files, playback will be through the XBox Music App and it does a fairly good job.&nbsp; It doesn't have an equalizer though.<br />
<br />
Now also, you are mistaking the media players as the file catalog of your music files.&nbsp; The media players list the music you have on the computer.&nbsp; The files are located (supposedly) in the MUSIC folder.&nbsp; That is where the media players are getting those files
 at.<br />
<br />
As for the iPad, I have an iPad 4 myself and bought it to replace the RT with since it had an issue with connecting with WiFi.&nbsp; In fact, I have it already configured with the programs and files I need to replace the RT now.&nbsp; The iPad plays back everything;
 all formats.&nbsp; The only problem with it though, no USB port or SD/micro-SD slot for expansion and file transfers.<br />
<br />
A note about the iPad for productivity though; Pages, Numbers, and Keynote are about the only productivity programs that you can do anything with.&nbsp; The other programs they have can compete with a vacuum cleaner (they suck).&nbsp; Pages, Numbers, and Keynote make
 Microsoft Works look good if that tells you anything.&nbsp; BUT, the iPad works, gets online instantly, and just plain works.<br />

<p>Hello AJG047,</p>
<p><span>If the program is not compatible, then you may try to install and run the program in compatibility mode.</span></p>
<p><span>Use the following steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Right
 click on the Program</span></p>
<p><span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Properties</span></p>
<p><span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Click
 on Compatibility tab</span></p>
<p><span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Select
 Run this program in compatibility mode and select Windows Vista or whatever operating system the program was running successfully.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer to the link here: Make older programs run in this version of Windows</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the compatibility is not successful, then try and run</span><span>the</span><span> Program Compatibility troubleshooter:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Open the Program Compatibility troubleshooter by clicking the<span>Start</span> button.</span></p>
<p><span>Then click <span>
Control Panel</span>. In the search box, type <span>troubleshooter</span>, and then click<span>Troubleshooting</span>. Under
<span>Programs</span>, click<span>Run programs made for previous versions of Windows</span>.
</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the instructions in the troubleshooter.</span></p>
<p><span>If you cannot install a program, insert the installation disc for the program and, using the troubleshooter, browse to the program's setup file, usually called Setup.exe, Install.exe, or something
 similar. The troubleshooter is not designed to work on programs that have an .msi file name extension.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you can't get the&nbsp;software to run in&nbsp;Compatibility mode and the manufacturer doesn't have an update to be compatible with Windows 7, you may need to consider a virtual machine.<br />
&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you run Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate version, install Windows Virtual PC and Windows XP mode (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/virtual-pc/default.aspx</a>)
 and execute your software in Windows XP.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you run Windows 7 Home Premium, try VirtualBox (<a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>www.virtualbox.org</span></a>) or VMware Player (<a href="http://www.vmware.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>www.vmware.com</span></a>)
 or any other 3&lt;sup&gt;rd&lt;/sup&gt; party virtualization software and install a separate copy of Windows XP (either Home Edition or Professional) for that purpose.<span>You can find virtualization software free of charge that will run on Windows
 7 Home Premium.</span></span></p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
