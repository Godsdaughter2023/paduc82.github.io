<h2>            Mic keeps Automatically Adjusting on Windows 10</h2>
                    I don't know how, but one day when I decided to start up my PC, my mic kept adjusting Automatically. Then when I researched an answer, I found an answer that said "1. Go into Control Panel, 2. Click Hardware and Sound, 3. Click Sound, 4. Click Recording,
 5. Double-Click your mic, 6. Go to Advanced, 7. Uncheck allow applications to take exclusive control of this device." When I unchecked that, turned up my mic and tried talking on Skype, my mic would automatically adjust itself, and it would do so, by muting
 the mic as well as turning down the mic volume from 100 to 0. So I decided to Restart my PC, and when I did so I didn't launch Skype this time went into the same settings everything was adjusted like how the video said to. But my mic kept muting itself even
 if I tried to talk. Also I tried updating the mic driver, but it still wouldn't do any change at all, as well as I tried updating everything that dealt with Audio and when it updated nothing changed. Does Anyone have any informati

<h2>            Add a &#34;LOCK MICROPHONE REC. LEVEL&#34; please&#63;&#63;&#63;&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    <p>This has been going on for years... and I am not the only one to have this problem. This is crazy annoying in our day and age: I use my microphone everyday. People are constantly complaining that I am too loud and there is nothing I can do. My #$#@% microphone
 mic levels keep adjusting auto.<br />
<br />
Can you SIMPLY add a check box with "Lock mic. rec. level" underneath the slider? This would override everything. Once you click on this, no software, service or anything can adjust the level. You are in total control. This doesn't seem to be like an IMPOSSIBLE
 feature to include. PLEASE MAKE THIS HAPPEN QUICKLY!!!<br />

<p>Dropping the /x switch should fix the problem.</p>
<p>I recommend you use robocopy instead of xcopy. It should do everything you want without this zoo of switches.</p>

<h2>            Will my Windows 7 games work in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I am considering upgrading to Windows 10.&nbsp; However, I have a small fortune wrapped up in games I have purchased thru Big Fish.&nbsp; Will those games play well on the new Windows 10?</p>

            <p>Just a very good tip since you're considering upgrading to Windows 10. I rolled back to Windows 7 Home Premium after two weeks of trying it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reasons were because some of the older games I had from Big Fish did not work right even after uninstalling and reinstalling. These were Hidden Object games like Mystery Case Files: Prime Suspects and Mystery Case Files: Ravenhurst. The other game I
 had a lot of trouble with was Play Haunted Manor: Lord of Mirrors. As I stated, these were older games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I reinstalled Haunted Manor, I still couldn't use the curser that's supposed to be used in the game. I had to use the original curser (the one I'm using now). So, the game didn't work right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried to play the older Mystery Case File games, they were distorted and stretched all the way across the screen. After I uninstalled them and reinstalled them, they weren't distorted or stretched across the screen anymore. The games were still a
 little slow however.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you upgrade to Windows 10, uninstall the games you're going to plan on playing on your PC or laptop. That way, you won't have to go to all the trouble of uninstalling them and reinstalling them if they don't work right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you're upgraded to Windows 10, then reinstall them. I don't know if it has to do with DirectX 12 or not. I have AMD Radeon HD 7730M, and it was/is very compatible with Windows 10. So, I'm not sure why the older games didn't exactly work right.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>

                    <p>hi,</p>
<p>I have windows XP and installed windows media player 11&nbsp;two years ago. Until few days ago the WMP was fine and suddenly when I tried to open programes using the WMP I always use it only shows the bottom bar of the player, not the screen and you can hear
 the sound. All the softwares have been upgraded. An update of the mozilla firefox 9 browser seems to have caused problem with the adobe reader X and the WMP 11. I uninstalled and installed mozilla and the adobe with the help of the FIX it from microsoft as
 it was not possible to be uninstalled manually. However, when I try to install WMP and I try to validate the windows XP the IE browser freezes and crashes (not responding) and&nbsp;get the message as shown above...Access violation at .....</p>
<p>Please, any advice how to fix the problem?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Windows Update messed up my computer....&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows Update messed up my computer....&#63;</h2>
                    
<div>I was going to reboot my computer and saw the windows update sign...so i decided to update my computer as well... when windows finished updating and reloading... it would work for the first minute or so then it would freeze.. not literally
 freeze... but nothing will work and i can still move the mouse but the mouse icon would be stuck in that loading symbol...(the little blue circle)<br />
<br />
At first I figured I would just let it finish loading whatever the computers trying to load... but 30 mins later its still stuck on loading... I did a hard reboot, and the same thing would happen... 30 secs - 1 min into loading windows it would just freeze
 on whatever its doing...<br />
<br />
So I figured the windows update screwed up my computer... I loaded up safe mode and tried to do a system restore only to find out that my computers system restore was turned off!!!???... so now I have no idea what to do.. someone please help I have a lot of
 work to do... thanks in advance<br />
<br />
off the top of my head here are my computer specs:<br />
<br />
Windows Vista SP1<br />
Intel Core i7 940<br />
12GB ram<br />
NVIDIA FX 1700<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Update on the situation:<br />
<br />
I've posted on several tech forums and 2 of them asked me to go to safe mode Add/Remove Program and then uninstall windows updates...<br />
<br />
The problem with that is my computer doesn't register the fact that it just installed an update..it says that the last update done on the computer was on the 17th of sept... the date today here is 23rd of sept...<br />
<br />
I uninstalled the the 2 updates from the 17th with no prevail..the problem still persists... i load windows in normal mode...and 30 secs -1 min later it just freezes on loading things...<br />
<br />
Should I just keep uninstalling windows updates until the problem fixes?<br />
<br />

    <title>Hide popular now once and for all - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> johnhaber  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hide popular now once and for all</h2>
                    <p>Last week I posted that I kept seeing news and graphics I didn't want, whenever my hand moved too close to . . . well, I couldn't say. For some reason, the replier complained I hadn't supplied enough information. I still deny that, but here's what I think
 is happening, and I still need help. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Presumably I'm opening Cortona inadvertantly. I removed Search from the Status Bar, in case my gestures accidentally pointed there. But it could be something else. I read that hitting the trackpad three times can open it, and maybe the edge of my hand does
 while I'm typing. Annoying, and I wish I could turn that feature off. Thoughts? </p>
<p>
</p><p>But second, I then always see Popular Now, and that is what I mistook for ads and the like. Clicking on the three dots in Cortona at upper right, I can hide it. And it will stay hidden if I then ask for a search immediately after. But nope,later they're
 back. What can turn them off once and for all? I don't use IE or Edge almost ever, so it's not about them. (They're the context of turning off Popular Now in other forum posts.)

            <p>Thanks, but that doesn't seem at all relevant. I'm using the Windows "search" feature, which I gather is the same as Corona, generally in order to search for files on the hard drive.&nbsp; Bing is no doubt the search engine in Edge, but I almost never open it.&nbsp;
 (I use Firefox.)&nbsp; And the few times I have opened Edge, I've never gone to Bing's home page.&nbsp; I'm not even sure I know how to call it up.&nbsp; I have Edge set to open with new tab page, which appears to mean that it displays a search bar but no graphics.&nbsp; Anyway,
 I'm sure that settings for Bing's home page within Edge would be held in cookies, which no doubt I clear every so often.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for a report on my progress, without question my turning off the touchpad, while not the ideal solution, means the glossy news won't suddenly pop up on my desktop out of nowhere.&nbsp; But the option to turn off Popular Now within the search, when I do go
 to search, still isn't "sticking."&nbsp; I call it a bug.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Entering a link to the CSS file you referenced&nbsp;into the&nbsp;IE11&gt;Settings&gt;Internet Options&gt;Accessibility&gt;Use Style Sheet setting disables the Popular Now feature&nbsp;when viewing Bing with IE11. But&nbsp;this trick does not work with Edge. So if Microsoft wants us to
 use Edge then you need to provide a permanent, easy way to disable Bing Popular Now that is browser-independent.&nbsp;In addition, based on&nbsp;what some other users are saying, you should also provide a setting to disable the background image. But please make these&nbsp;settings&nbsp;separate
 and independent of each other since some users&nbsp;(including me) like the background&nbsp;image but NOT the tabloid stuff shown in Popular Now.

<h2>            Can I stop a downloaded update from installing when I shut down my computer&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My update setting "Download updates but let me choose whether to install them"&nbsp; I would like to keep that way. I&nbsp; notice lately that when I go to Start, shut down, there is a little yellow exclamation point or shield on the&nbsp;shut down button&nbsp;and when
 you hoover over&nbsp;shut down&nbsp;it&nbsp; says that Windows will install updates&nbsp;and then shut down. It does not give you a choice.<br />
Is there a way to shut down without installing the update till you see what the update is all&nbsp;about, which might not be right away. Can you go to Windows Update and hide the update, which would be a pain in the neck if there is more than one?
<br />
Or is there a way to somehow to get rid of it or them till you are&nbsp;able to check and see what the update or updates are about?</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; TomS</p>

            What is the make and model of your computer? 
<br />What have you done so far to troubleshoot the problem? 
<br />How long has this been happening? 
<br />
<br />Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed: 1507, 1511, 1607, 1703? 
<br />Which version of Windows did you upgrade from? 
<br />
<br />Sometimes your computers firmware, which deals with things like power management, which is related to sleep needs to be updated. Remember, the issue you are experiencing here is outside of Windows, where its not resuming from sleep. Windows is in a saved state on the hard disk and can't manage the hardware resources, thats left up to Firmware (your BIOS) to handle. So, its obvious this more a hardware issue than software, but updated driver software can fix it. 
<br />
<br />It could suggest you need to update your chipset drivers and BIOS. 
<br />I recommend you update the most critical ones:  BIOS, Chipset, Display Driver, Network adapters. 
<br />
<br />If that does not work, I recommend you try two things 
<br />First: Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Batteries 
<br />Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System. 
<br />Choose Update Driver Software. 
<br />Make sure you are connected to the Internet, the check for updates. 
<br />
<br />When complete, restart then check if you can sleep and wake. 
<br />
<br />Second option 
<br />uninstall your display driver then restart 
<br />Boot to the Windows 10 desktop 
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />
<br />If that does not work, well, we need to try something else. Try resetting the BIOS:

<h2>            Need Help With DNS Settings when connecting to Mac with Ethernet. </h2>
                    
<p>So I have tried searching for a long time but I simply can't connect my Xbox 360 to the internet using my Mac.</p>
<p>Running OS X 10.7.4</p>
<p>When I set my Xbox settings to automatic it comes up as:</p>
<p>Ip address: 192.168.3.2</p>
<p>Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0</p>
<p>Gateway: 192.168.3.1</p>
<p>However when I set my DNS settings to automatic, they stay as 0.0.0.0.</p>
<p>On my Mac I have enabled internet Sharing and the green light is on.</p>
<p>By default when I select Use DHCP it states it is currently active with an address of 169.254.8.16 and Subnet Mask 255.255.255.0 while the rest is blank.I have tried manually changing the IP address using DHCP with manual address to match my automatic settings
 and have follewed many guides as to what I should set the basic settings on my Xbox as but I either get DNS error or it won't connect to the network at all.
</p>

<p>I have tried manually setting the DNS setting with primary and secondary to 192.168.3.1 but with no luck.</p>

            <p>Hey there Trophic!</p>
<p>You can do as ROZILLA suggested, this will work as well. However, you need to direct your Xbox Primary DNS to a DNS server. This can not be done by having your Xbox DNS settings set to automatic. The DNS server is your routers IP address or a public DNS server. You can open the Terminal window and type "dig" (without quotes). There you will find "Server" followed by its IP address (the router) and port number (#53) listed as well. Like this: ;; SERVER: 192.168.1.1#53(192.168.1.1).<br /><br />You do not need to setup manually DHCP, only configure with DHCP. Open Terminal window and type ifconfig en0 (en0=wired, 0=zero). Below your APIPA address (169.254.xxx.xxx) you'll find the IP address for the airport (mine is currently 192.168.2.1). For your Xbox IP address you need to type in your inet number but with the last number being one digit higher (e.g. 192.168.2.2).<br /><br />You will have a moderate NAT when sharing your internet connection using a Mac.&nbsp;</p>

<p>what kind of Router do you have ? The best would be you connect your XBOX direct to the Router.</p>
<p>If 8.8.8.8 does not work, something in your Network on your side is wrong. It can´t go outside an try to search an internal IP which 8.8.8.8 can´t resolve.</p>
<p>Please describe what Router do you have an how it is connected.</p>

<p>There is no Airport connection only Wifi because Im using a belkin router.</p>
<p>My mac is running on a wireless connection from my router. It's not the best set-up so I'm guessing that's where the problem is coming from. It looks like it's my end and I have no choice but to reconfigure my setup.

<p>Haha you guys are silly. The solution was a super simple mistake I made when sharing my connection; I selected the wrong 'share from' connection as ethernet instead of wifi by mistake.</p>
<p>PS. Anyone know how to make the connection at least moderate instead of strict?

                    <p>I live in India and plan on buying a surface pro 4 i5 8GB RAM model with type cover (without fingerprint ID) from the US via my cousin who will be there for a month. The same model is available here but is considerably more expensive. However I would like
 to confirm <strong>will the surface pro warranty be valid in India ?</strong><br />
</p>
<p>Please give a concrete answer and not just links to warranty documentation pages since I have read them all and the query remains unresolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, there is an option to register the surface pro device in India after purchase for warranty on MS India site. So can I purchase in US and register in India so that this whole warranty issue goes away !?<br />

<h2>            Surface Pro 4 replacement faulty</h2>
                    My Surface developed a line through the screen. &nbsp;After many hours with the Tech Department, they put in a replacement ticket. &nbsp;I received the replacement which was not only a USED one, it had a screen that had a yellow tinge to it. &nbsp;It was sent back. &nbsp;The
 issue was escalated. &nbsp;I have written demanding a NEW one as I spent thousands on the high end model. &nbsp;This practice of sending a used model is unethical. It is their product that is faulty and not user caused. &nbsp;This is my only computer and was purchased for
 my business. &nbsp;It has taken two weeks so far and has affected my business. &nbsp;I receive no responses to my emails and I still don't know what I am going to get. &nbsp;Has anyone else had this problem? &nbsp;Do you have a contact number for Management so that I can deal
 with someone that isn't just a front end block?

<p>MS support is crap. I got my Surface Pro 4 ( brand new ) with something getting off the egde of the screen. Contacted the support and after a stressful talking arguing that i want a NEW ONE they finally agreed and send me a new one saying "This is the last
 time we will ever do it", WTF!?</p>
<p>Now after a year using my Surface connected to a external monitor, when i open it the both sides of the screen was yellowish ( badly ) and the touch screen was gone. It only works with the pen and not all the time.</p>
<p>So here i went again to their crap support system but this time much more worse because my unit was out-of-warranty and even to talk to a real person in their online chat i have to pay $35 !! WTF!?</p>
<p>I only get option to send the unit for a replacement paying $702.00 !!!. No options, no support, i send the unit for a replacement paying the robber amount. The unit get in their address on the next day and i on my account, the repair process still not updated
 saying it is waiting for the unit ( 4 days already ).</p>
<p>Now I'm sure they will send me any crap used Surface they have there as a replacement and the mess will start.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can a company survive disrespecting their customers like this ?</p>

            I agree! &nbsp;I have had to send back TWO replacement units as they both had problems with yellow screens! &nbsp;I spent a fortune on my high end model and still have it. I has taken a month already and now I have to wait for a THIRD replacement. &nbsp;This is unbelievable.
 &nbsp;I have asked for a new one as this is my business computer. &nbsp;I am a professional artist and purchased the surface because of it's screen quality...so much for that. &nbsp;It has a line through it and when it heats up the lower half is gray and has a shadow of
 the keyboard on it. &nbsp;So far all they have sent is crap replacements. &nbsp;i think a lawyer should take on this practice of giving people used replacements when it is their own manufacturing problem! &nbsp;It is ethically and morally wrong. &nbsp;I will actively let everyone
 I am in contact know of this situation so that they don't find themselves in the same position. &nbsp;I wouldn't wish it on anyone. &nbsp;I am terrified that the third replacement w

            They just don't care. This is something that comes from the top and our complaints will never reach those people who have their pockets full of money and do think they are doing something great giving us all that crap products. I only have this Surface
 because part of my work requires a windows machine and i thought a MS product would be the best option.. something i regret for sure.

            I love the surface when its working but when it only lasts a year and the service is useless, it kills any interest in buying again. &nbsp;when I look at something to buy I always look at the service first. &nbsp;I thought Microsoft was reliable and went ahead.
 &nbsp;I &nbsp;had an Asus that went wrong right out of the box that took 4 replacements before I got an actual new good one that worked. &nbsp;It took 6 months and threat of lawsuit to get it though and my business suffered badly. &nbsp;I will NEVER buy from that company again.
 &nbsp;Microsoft is heading in the same direction. &nbsp;It seems all the companies are following the same pattern. &nbsp;all it will take is one company to provide ethical practices and they would be on top. &nbsp;In the meantime I will have to wait and see if the THIRD REPLACEMENT
 has a yellow screen!

            That's the reason i only use Apple products for my own purpose. I have been Apple customer for decades. They always took care about issues, have support to talk to you and this kind of thing NEVER happened. You are pro artist, you should go for it.

            That's great but I need this one replaced with a new one right now. &nbsp;I invested a lot of money in it and until I can afford another computer, need to stay with it. &nbsp;Also all my programs are for microsoft. &nbsp;

<br />
<br />The Appdata\Local\Temp folder is reserved for temp data storage from the applications running on your PC, it is not appropriate for downloaded files
<br />
<br />Set your browser to another folder, or create another folder for downloading files to and you should have no problems with files downloading . .

<h2>            error 0x80070057 While moving and copying files from internal hdd to external hdd</h2>
                    <p>Hello, i tried almost ten pages of google search of fix to no result.<br />
Windows 10 tells me that:<br />
"Impossible to copy file. Unexpected error. If the error persist it's possible to use error code to search for additional info of the problem<br />
Error 0x80070057, incorrect parameter"<br />
Semi-letteral translation from italian language.<br />
</p>
<p>I tried:</p>
<p>- changing decimal symbol with a .(dot)</p>
<p>- setting additional decimal numbers (from 2 to 9)<br />
- performing chkdsk on the drive</p>
<p>- performing sfc scan (i noticed a error in opencll.dll in the log)</p>
<p>- copy a file from the INTERNAL hdd to EXTERNAL hdd, come files copy, some don't.</p>
<p>- copy a file from the EXTERNAL hdd to INTERNAL hdd with success</p>
<p>- use a different USB cable</p>
<p>- use a different USB port</p>
<p>The only thing i have not tried is format the hard disk, because i have nowere to store all my files in the meantime<br />
</p>
<p>size doesn't seems the issue, my hdd are all NTFS from the storage management.</p>
<p>i tried to copy a 150 MB file, nothing.</p>
<p>copy a 40 MB file, copied.</p>
<p>Copy a 1,5 GB file, before a restart nothing, after magically works.</p>
<p>Just for fun i tried to copy THE SAME 1,5 GB file to my internal hard disk, success, then try to copy AGAIN to the external, nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The external hard disk is a WD green (i think) 3TB version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Needless to say i can access ALL of the files in both hard disks correctely (so i think they are not corrupted or anything)</p>
<p>
</p><p>edit: i also tried to look in event viewer about the issue but i can't see nothing in the correct time i made my test.</p>

            i found the problem after thinking about a "internal malfunction" in the external hard drive. Since the USB cable is not the cause and the pc isn't either, I plugged it in my desktop pc with sata cables and it works, both way and with every size and every
 type of files i tried.<br />
My guess is that the hdd box was rather old and something broke in the circuit.
