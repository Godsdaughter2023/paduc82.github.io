    <title>Wireless adapter cannot connect to the internet. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wschmidt  say:</h3>
<h2>            Wireless adapter cannot connect to the internet.</h2>
                    Hello,<br />
<br />
I'm not the most computer savvy person out there but I'll do my best to explain my problem and what I have done to try correcting it.<br />
<br />
As suggested by the title, I'm having difficulty connecting to the internet. I can connect just fine with the Ethernet cable, and my wireless devices can connect; however, my computer will not connect wireless. My computer recognizes the network but the connection
 fails when it is "identifying." The last time I used my computer I was able to connect without problems. The last thing I did before I shut down was install windows updates, and renew my Norton 360 subscription. I have been reading a number of articles and
 trying various things to try correcting this issue myself. I have listed my actions below:<br />
<br />
Run Windows Network Diagnostics - Reset network adapter<br />
Run Windows Network Diagnostics - Automatically acquire new IP address<br />
Reset Winsock Catalog<br />
Restore system to previous restore point<br />
Uninstall and reinstall Norton 360 (as this was the last thing I did before shutting down previously I thought this might help)<br />
Uninstall and reinstall network adapter driver <br />
Changed various settings and them changed them back as there was no improvements.
<br />
<br />
I believe that is all I have tried. I have not tried resetting my modem or router, or creating a new wireless network as I'm still connected with my wireless devices.
<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what other information I can provide. Any help here is appreciated. <br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
Wade<br />
<br />

<br />
you need start your PC totally disconnected from internet (to avoid Windows Update service connect to Microsoft Servers) and then install this updates manally....<br />
<br />
<strong>KB3173424</strong> <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3173424" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>KB3172614</strong> <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3172614" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<br />
once both updates are installed, you can connect to internet again, and Windows Update should start to works normally again.</p>

            <p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I see that this is your first post in this forum, welcome to the Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you connected any other Bluetooth devices to the computer? Did you face similar issues with those devices?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This issue could be caused due to some incorrect settings or due to a driver issue. I would suggest you to try these steps and check:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, I would suggest you to check the device manager for any errors as the error details would help us determine if it is a hardware related issue or a driver issue. Refer to these steps:</p>

            &nbsp;I had this problem too after installing 8.1 on my laptop. The short answer is that neither the generic Windows Bluetooth drivers nor the Atheros Bluetooth suite are able to provide full BT functions, and the maker of my laptop, Toshiba, does not support
 my particular model/spec for 8.1 so their BT stack would not install either.<br />
<br />
I got round this by buying a USB Bluetooth 4.0 adapter (less than Â£10 from Amazon) and using this. After following the instructions supplied to activate it I now have full BT capabilities, including streaming/remote control from my phone which I did not have
 with the standard version on this laptop in Windows 7 or 8.<br />

            <p>Hello Ben,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>thanks a lot for your advice. Unfortunately, this did not help me any further. The Samsung Galaxy S3 smart phone pairs with my Laptop and then unpairs again. The same issue I have with my Bluetooth ISDN Access Point device which I wanted to use as an access
 point&nbsp;to my fax-modem in order to use Microsoft Fax and Scan. Here I have the same problem: the device sucessfully&nbsp;couples with my Laptop and a few seconds later decouples again. The only bluetooth device which flawlessly works is my Blackberry Torch smart
 phone This makes me really sad with Windows 8.1 as I did not have at all these problems with my old PC under Windows 7 and it seems there are a lot more users posting similar issues.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Please let me know if you have any further ideas.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thank you and best regards,</p>
<p>Richard.</p>

            <p><strong>UnInstall Bluetooth drivers and re-install Bluetooth drivers meant for Windows 7 or Windows 8.0 in "Windows 7 Compatibility Mode".</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I had tried all suggestions and troubleshooting steps including disabling power saving options, doing a factory reset and clean install of Windows 8.0 / 8.1 but I continued to have problems with Microsoft Bluetooth mice (w/o USB dongles) randomly disconnecting.
 The ONLY solution that worked for me was un-installing existing Bluetooth drivers from Control Panel as well as Device Manager and re-installing Bluetooth drivers meant for Windows 7 or Windows 8.0 in "Windows 7 Compatibility Mode".
<strong>The key </strong><strong>here is installing Bluetooth drivers in "Windows 7 Compatibility Mode" by right-clicking the Bluetooth EXE file &gt; Properties &amp; selecting "Windows 7 Compatibility Mode". Avoid Bluetooth drivers meant for Windows 8.1</strong>.
 Luckily, my touchscreen laptop manufacturer (Acer) had both Windows 7 &amp; Window 8.0 Atheros Bluetooth drivers for my model on their support website. Additional side-benefits I noticed after doing this:</p>

<li>All three models of built-in Bluetooth Microsoft mice (Microsoft Scuplt Touch, Sculpt Comfort &amp; Bluetooth Notebook Mouse 5000) started working perfectly without any sudden disconnects or freezing;</li><li>The overall mouse operations also became lot smoother and predictable;</li><li>Windows Power Management started working perfectly with the laptop going into sleep / standby nicely and waking up instantly without any lockups or WiFi issues</li><li>CPU / Fan noise is much quieter-- it seems the Bluetooth drivers installed as I suggest are more "in harmony" with the rest of the system.</li><li>Everything including the Bluetooth mouse is working great for almost a week since I made these changes. I promptly updated my complete system image backup with the new setup.</li></ol>

<h2>            Replaced router and can&#39;t see server</h2>
                    I replaced a Linksys g router with a Netgear n router and now I can't see the server from my laptop or join the homegroup. Windows 7 has renamed my network as Network 2 now. When I go back to the Linksys the name goes back to Network and the server is
 visible again. Windows must think I am adding a second network and router. I want to just replace the router in the first network so it keeps all the settings and I can see the server. Thanks.

<p><span>I would suggest you to open Network and sharing center and under available networks, delete all the networks.</span></p>
<p><span>As you are changing the router,
<span>&nbsp;</span>you will have to reconfigure the settings on the new router page.</span></p>

<strong>Run as administrator </strong>option.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>3. </strong>Type <strong>Get-AppxPackage </strong>and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p>(This command will output a long list of all installed apps containing lots of information about each app).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>4. </strong>Type <strong>Get-AppxPackage | Select Name, PackageFullName
</strong>and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p>(This command will show only the name of the app and its PackageFullName information).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>5</strong>. Select the <strong>PackageFullName</strong> information of the desired app and
<strong>copy it.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Type <strong>Get-AppxPackage PackageFullName | Remove-AppxPackage
</strong>and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</p>
<p>(This command is to remove the app from the system, replace <strong>PackageFullName</strong> with the copied information with
<strong>Step 5</strong>).</p>
<p>
</p><p>For example, if you want to remove <strong>Photo app</strong>, the command to remove it will be as following:</p>
<strong>
<p>Get-AppxPackage *photos* | Remove-AppxPackage</p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p><strong>7.</strong> Wait till completion of the command, and check if the app is uninstalled, if not
<strong>restart</strong> the system and </p>
<p>check.</p>
<strong>
<p>
</p><p>Note:</p>
</strong>
<p>If you want to uninstall the app from all user accounts, use the following command format:</p>
<strong>
<p>Get-AppxPackage -allusers PackageFullName | Remove-AppxPackage</p>
</strong>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to remove the app from any particular user account, use following command:</p>
<strong>
<p>Get-AppxPackage -user username PackageFullName | Remove-AppxPackage</p>
</strong>
<p>(Replace username in the above command with the correct user account name).</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>8. </strong>Launch the <strong>Windows Store </strong>and <strong>reinstall the Photo app.</strong>
</p>

<p>Hi Shawn,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should be able to see my reply to Lee for some background. Is there any way to see whether my laptop has been set as part of a domain? If not directly, is there somewhere else I can look on the device to maybe lend credence to it possibly being part
 of a domain?</p>
<p>
</p><p>As for the specific settings, it's:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Store my activity history on this device</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Send my activity history to Microsoft</em></p>
<p>I'll try and mess with the Policy Editor based on those suggestions in the link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate the help</p>
<p>

<p>It would be the two policies in the tutorials below for those two settings.</p>

<h2>            Getting Blue Screen error BCCode&#58;    50</h2>
                    So recently I had a question about BSOD answered and my computer worked fine after that for about 2 days. Now it is starting to act up again with more BSODs. But this time they arent as frequent as they were before. Now idk what the problem could be because
 I'm pretty sure all of my drivers are up to date. But here is the skydrive link with my latest BSODs after updating a driver in my motherboard. Also included in there is my computer specs. Finally my Motherboard is an Asus
<br />
M4A785T-M
<p><br />
</p>
<p>https://skydrive.live.com/redir?resid=18C79C1DFA02E2FF!212</p>
<p><br />
</p>
Help would really be appreciated. I'm just ready to get to the bottom of this.

            &nbsp;I had a computer built back in February and for awhile now I've been experiencing a slew of Blue Screen crashes and it is always a different message being displayed . (They range from IRQL Not less or equal, Page fault in nonpaged area, System Service
 Exception, etc.&nbsp; It always happens when I am playing World of Warcraft but I do not think that is the problem. I've uninstalled and reinstalled the game numerous times. What usually made me stop is that after awhile my computer would then start acting normal.
 But I'm ready to get to the bottom of whats causing it and fix whatever needs to be fixed in it. I will post the various messages I've been getting from the most recent ones. Please let me know if you see any commonality between them and what I will have to
 do to fix this. Thank you very much.<br />

            Sounds like it could be related to hardware, either your system overheating (since its graphics are being pushed with a 3D application, albeit only WoW, but the same nonetheless) or you might have faulty RAM (RAM modules and/or GPU memory).&nbsp; I'd run some
 hardware diagnostics to be sure everything with the hardware is functioning normally before troubleshooting the software.<br />

    <title>Can I Restore from System Images like I Restore from System - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Can I Restore from System Images like I Restore from System Restore&#63;</h2>
                    Perhaps a poorly worded question. I know what each of them are and how they are different. What I don't know&nbsp;are the real-life differences. In the past, I have from time to time needed to restore from System Restore. It's easy, and if you use the wrong
 restore point, you can undo the restore and/or choose a different restore point. But then you have to go back and update things that didn't get included in the Restore Point. I understand I can create a new system image before restoring a previous system image,
 and in that way I can essentially undo a System Image restore. So if I have saved multiple System Images, I can restore a prior system image, then "undo" the restore if necessary (by reverting to the&nbsp;just created&nbsp;System Image), and then restoring a different
 System Image. I think I've got all that right,&nbsp;that restoring from System Images (in the manner described above) is&nbsp;quite&nbsp;comparable to&nbsp;doing a System Restore (except with the added user insta

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>I use system images.&nbsp; I had a problem ages ago with a failed <em>Restore point</em> attempt and have relied on system images ever since.&nbsp; I used to think that system images were just things that IT departments used but they have become my first response
 to any problem that I cannot immediately solve or that has symptoms that defy diagnosis.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a&nbsp;few things worth pointing out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1&nbsp; Images are made in a folder called WindowsImageBackup that comes straight off the root of the drive where it has been made.&nbsp; So you'll see, for example, F:\WindowsImageBackup.&nbsp; System images are best made onto an external drive so you can recover from
 a failed hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2&nbsp; If you make a new image then it will be saved on top of&nbsp;the old one. Both will be in F:\WindowsImageBackup.&nbsp; Windows will make its own decisions about which bits of the old one to keep and which to overwrite.&nbsp; So you can never be sure just what you are
 restoring.&nbsp; Windows is probably making excellent decisions but ....</p>
<p>
</p><p>3&nbsp; The way to avoid any confusion is, when preparing to make a new image, to move the existing image somewhere else such as F:\ImageLibrary\20150517\WindowsImageBackup.&nbsp;
<em>You'll get a UAC prompt ["Elevation UI" prompt] so you'll need to give Admin permission for the move.&nbsp;&nbsp;</em><em>It's worth using&nbsp;a folder name with the date in it to avoid confusion later on.&nbsp;
</em>That frees up the drive to be able to accept a new image at F:\WindowsImageBackup that is completely independent of the old one.&nbsp; In moving the old image, keep the whole of WindowsImageBackup together - you'll probably have a look and see how it is structured
 inside but Windows will not accept anything that has been altered or extracted if you later try to restore an image.&nbsp; You can keep as many images in your image library as you wish as long as you have a separate folder for each one and as long as you don't
 tamper with anything inside WindowsImageBackup.&nbsp; I make images onto two external hard drives alternately and I keep two or three images on each inside an image library - if I get a problem but realise it's been building up for two weeks then I can restore
 from an image made before any symptoms started or before a glitch occurred that I now guess might be the cause even though I don't understand what happened or why.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4&nbsp; If you decide to restore an image, decide if you want&nbsp;the latest one or one that's in the library.&nbsp; If it's the latest one that you need then you are ready to restore.&nbsp; If not then you need to move the&nbsp;latest WindowsImageBackup folder into your library
 and move the chosen WindowsImageBackup folder from the library into position at F:\WindowsImageBackup or G:\WindowsImageBackup or H:\WindowsImageBackup.&nbsp; Windows goes not care which drive you are trying to restore the image from as long as WindowsImageBackup
 is off the root of the drive.&nbsp; If your computer is so badly corrupted that you cannot use it to move images around then either decide to use the latest image [as you will have left it in the correct folder] or use&nbsp;another computer to move things around.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5&nbsp; You can restore an image from within Windows or by booting from a Windows 7 System repair disk or installation disk.&nbsp; I prefer the booting method as it has never let me down.&nbsp; The procedures are given at

<p>
</p><p><span>6&nbsp; Once you have restored and checked your system, decide which is the image you are most likely to want to restore from in the future.&nbsp; Keep that one in
</span>F:\WindowsImageBackup and the others in the image library.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>7&nbsp; If you have separated your system drive from your data drive [either by having two hard drives or by partitioning a single disk] then a system image is likely to be less than 40GB and take only 25 mins or make [and 25 mins
 to restore from].&nbsp; Do you know what I am talking about here?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>8&nbsp; A system image is a replica of the system drive at the moment that it was made.&nbsp; Any changes made to that drive since the image was made are lost.&nbsp; Other drives are pretty safe - I always back up my data drive before restoring
 a system drive image but it has never gone wrong and messed up the data drive.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>9&nbsp; Windows system images are not tolerant of hardware changes - if you ever have a complete hard drive failure then you ought to be able to recover the last system image onto a new hard drive if that hard drive is of the same type as the old one.&nbsp; To make
 the process easiest, the new one should need the same driver as the old one so buying a replacement of the same make, model &amp; size is best.&nbsp; You would probably decide to get a larger one though and that can make the restoration more difficult.&nbsp; If you are
 forced to replace the hard drive and you decide to get one of a different type [larger or just a different model] then you could have one try at restoring before then buying
<a href="http://www.acronis.com/en-gb/personal/pc-backup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Acronis TI 2015</a> which can cope with restoring Windows system images despite hardware changes a lot better than Windows own utilities can.&nbsp; When I had to replace my hard drive &amp; bought one of a different
 make-model, I restored my old image but I could not use Windows update or update drivers from Device manager.&nbsp; I gave up and installed everything from scratch.&nbsp; Since then, I have paid attention to&nbsp;relevant discussions in this forum and have seen many of the
 competent contributors to this forum recommend Acronis TI.&nbsp; The latest version [2015] actually boasts of its ability to cope with hardware changes.&nbsp; Personally, if I have to change hard drives, I will buy
<a href="http://www.acronis.com/en-gb/personal/pc-backup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Acronis TI 2015</a> without even waiting to have a single restoration attempt without it.&nbsp; There are lots of alternatives but&nbsp;it's Acronis that I keep seeing recommended.</p>

<p>

<p>
</p><p><em>1.2, 1.3&nbsp; I was just trying to draw your attention to the huge difference in the amount of backup space taken up by system images if you don't partition the disk.&nbsp; It is this large&nbsp;usage of backup storage space that can make regular system imaging impracticable
 for non-portioned systems unless you get very large external HDDS [four years ago it was still the case that a 500GB portable external HDD was regarded as very large and you had to go to AC-powered ext HDDs to get anything bigger&nbsp; without spending more than
 the computer itself had cost].</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>2.1&nbsp; I should have chosen my words more carefully.&nbsp; You have the choice of buying an extra disk so that you can put the system on one of them and your data files on another but laptop users are pretty much forced to consider partitioning to achieve the same
 end.&nbsp; The result of buying an extra disk would be pretty wasteful in terms of unused HDD space and I don't suppose you would consider it [<em>unless
</em><em>you happened to have a small 100GB HDD sitting on the shelf already or </em>
<em>you were deliberately installing an SSD as your system disk because the speed difference was important to you</em>].&nbsp; Adding an extra disk would be&nbsp;more&nbsp;straightforward&nbsp;than partitioning but, provided that you make you preparatory system images and file
 backups, there isn't any&nbsp;particular risk in partitioning since you can always revert and start again if you make a mess of it.&nbsp; I was very wary&nbsp;of&nbsp;partitioning my HDD but the whole process went very smoothly [<em>so smoothly that I did it again to get a better
 result - partitioning after installation would only allow me to get my system drive down to 200GB but partitioning during installation allowed me to get it down to 67GB.&nbsp; Actually, I did it three times as I had a practice run using an old disk before even
 touching the new disk I had just bought.]</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>2.3&nbsp; There's nothing wrong with AppData but, as I was referring to making backups,&nbsp;I thought I should point out the possibility that some of your applications might use locations outside of your Documents folder by default.&nbsp; I used the example of Outlook
 merely because that's the only application I have that does this - and its pretty easy to change it to use any folder you choose instead.</p>

 that they would not boot.&nbsp; In looking through the procedure for testing an installation disk, skip straight to the section on testing it as the procedure for making one no longer applies for people&nbsp;with OEM licences [only retail licence holders can get Windows
 7 ISO files now].&nbsp; <em>The point in having one of these disks is that if Windows is messed up you might not be able to run a recovery operation from within Windows itself and would need to boot up with them instead to run your recovery from there.</em></p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Overall</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate that it is&nbsp;up to you to decide what to do with your own system.&nbsp; It must be clear from all of my posts that I have been firmly converted to the idea of partitioning to separate system from data.&nbsp; I have partitioned my day-to-day Win7 computer
 and my WinXP computer.&nbsp; I am currently playing with Win10 on both computers and have those&nbsp;dual-booting from&nbsp;separate partitions referencing the same user data folders as the original OS on each one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had been seeing comments about images for some time and had realised that it was the lack of system-data separation that prevented me from regarding them as a useful tool.&nbsp; I had known IT support to restore a thing they called an image and I knew the result
 was a computer that was returned to its original state.&nbsp; What I had not realised was that having the option of restoring an image in only 25 mins on my own computer meant that I could recover from problems both rapidly &amp; painlessly.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A&nbsp; When, just for example, I decided to link my Win7 with my aging WinXP by directly connecting their LAN cards to avoid buying a router, I made images of both computers before I started - until I had finished and seen it all working I was concerned that
 I could mess up both systems and be left with a confusing situation that I would be unable to fix [I had had to combine advice from a dozen different sources as there was no single source of guidance&nbsp;for doing the task].&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>B&nbsp; Some time later, I had a McAfee problem and their online chat "engineers" screwed things up instead of fixing them - 25&nbsp; minutes later, I was back where I started and was able to do their procedure correctly rather than the way they had done it - 25 mins
 after that I had a system image of the now fully functioning system so I was fully prepared for any future problems.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>C&nbsp; Much later, I bought a smartphone to use as my internet connection and so dispensed with the mobile broadband dongle I had previously used.&nbsp; I made an image before this significant hardware change knowing that, yet again, I could make a pot of tea then
 be back where I had started off if there was a problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>D&nbsp; I tried to hook up a&nbsp;ten-old phone that was not Win7 compatible so I was confident that I could try to get it working [for syncing Outlook Calendar, Contacts, Notes and other files] because I knew I could recover from the experiment.&nbsp; I failed but 25
 mins later everything was back to normal.&nbsp; I then adopted a completely different approach to the problem and succeeded - something that would not have been possible if there had been residues left over from my first attempts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>E&nbsp; I make a system image before every monthly Windows updates because so many users report in these forums that updates have wrecked their computers.&nbsp; Looking back through my notes, I cannot find&nbsp;a single occasion when Windows update has caused problems
 for me but ... [fingers crossed, wood knocked].</p>

<h2>            Clock resets when unplugged.. No internal battery&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey,</p>
<p>I had a question about the internal battery (or if there is one at all). &nbsp;I transport my XBox One console here and there lately to play when I am away from home. At my secondary location, I don't connect to the internet when playing as there is no connection.
 I noticed that when I am offline, currently playing MGS: TPP, my games don't continue where I left off. I thought it was a connection issue as in, if I am not online it will not load the most recent activity. That in itself sucks, since I put in about 5 hours
 only to reconnect my console and turn it back on the next day and see none of my progress saved since I was last connected online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I then noticed when I went back to the main Xbox dashboard after properly quitting my game and then backing out, that the time on the console was wrong by a few hours. Is there a battery issue with the console which is why it is not saving my games when
 offline?</p>

<p>Was just thinking about something. Is it possible that since my console was set on the power save mode (stays on for updates when I am not playing) that when I unplug the power cord it loses the save?</p>

<p>Opening the console means tampering and is forbidden by the xbox live service rules. At this point any damage you might have caused to the console is your doing.

                    Hi,<br />

Just installing this month's updates, and I'm having a problem installing one of them. Games For Windows Software 3.5 doesn't seem to want to update and is giving the error code 80070643. Had a quick search round and can't seem to find anything useful. Not
 sure what's causing this. Anybody else having this issue?<br />

<br />
Yes, I'm having the exact same issue; error 80070643. <br />

Tried using Microsoft Fix it, but still same error on updating.<br />

            Ok, got it!<br />
<br />
Ran Fix it as I said above, but this time the ShutDown button had the little orange exclamation icon beside it.<br />
<br />
When clicked on it said "Shut Down and install update".<br />
<br />
So I did, and upon cold re-start (not re-boot), Windows Update said all was installed and everything was OK.<br />

            Didn't get the same results as you â "fixit" didn't appear to do anything, I even ran the "aggresive" fix it earlier, to no avail. Glad yours is good now though. . . .

            I'm having the same prob. Used the fixit - no change. Tried to find the actual update to download manually - just get redirected to the very Windows Live support page.&nbsp; No exclamation mark in the shutdown icon.&nbsp; Did do a restart (since the update was bundled
 with all the other "patch tuesday" updates but that didnt help. Am on Vista Business SP2 32-bit.<br />

            <p><strong>Update: </strong></p>
<p>Microsoft has noted a potential detection issue with Games for Windows Software 3.5 that might have affected the login experience for some users. We have temporarily withdrawn the relevant update, which will be reapplied when the issue is addressed.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hello All,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue symptoms that everyone is describing appears to be a Windows Installer Error.</p>
<p>Morever, the error 80070643 is a generic error message that can have many causes.&nbsp; To better understand the issue and cause, we would need details from a Windows Installer log file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though the steps are somewhat advanced, any help from the community would be appreciated.&nbsp; To provide us with details of the instlal error, you would need to do the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Turn on Windows Instlal logging: Click on this link: <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9723030" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9723030</a></li><li>Make an attempt to install the update again.</li><li>Once you get the error 80070643, you will need to go look for the log file.&nbsp; The log file is located in the system temporary folder and the file name is random, but begins with the letters "Msi" and end with a .log extension. To locate the Temp folder location:
 Click Start, type (%temp%), then press Enter.</li><li>Once the temporary folder is open, you need to locate a very recent file that begins with "msi".</li><li>Open the file with notepad, and copy and paste its content as a reply.</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kim</p>

<h2>            Laptop restarted while shrinking a drive</h2>
                    <p>I was shrinking one of my drives (not the Windows Drive) on my hard drive, when the laptop restarted.</p>
<p>Now, when I open My PC, it shows the shrunken drive, but when I open the Disk Management, it still shows the unaltered size of the drive.</p>
<p>What happened to that 'shrunk' space and how can I get it back ?</p>

            Hi,<br />
try this to fix a corrupt Windows Media Player database:<br />
<p>First thing that needs to be done is to stop the Windows Media Player Network Sharing Service. This service controls media sharing over your network but it also locks the database file so it canât be deleted by the user.
</p>
<p>To stop this service enter task manager (crtl+alt+del) and select the services tab.
</p>
<p>Find âWMPNetworkSvcâ in the list then right-click and select âStop Serviceâ.
</p>
<p>If you receive a denied error you can also stop the service from the âServicesâ button at the bottom.</p>
<p>Open Windows Explorer and go to â\Users\YOUR USERNAME\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Media Playerâ. It may be hidden but you can enable hidden folders to be shown on your pc by going to Control Panel &gt; Folder Options and enabling showing
 hidden folders.</p>
<p><span>Once youâre in the folder, locate the âCurrentDatabase_371.wmdbâ file and delete it. If you receive a permission denied error the âWMPNetworksvcâ may not have been stopped or you may need to restart your machine and
 start again.</span></p>
<span>Once the wmdb file has been deleted, restart Windows Media Player and the database should begin to repopulate<br />
hope this helps,<br />
eddie b<br />

    <title>how to factory reset windows7 without cd - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pitsan  say:</h3>
<h2>            how to factory reset windows7 without cd</h2>
                    hi everybody,<br />
<br />
I need to do a factory reset on my three year hold hp pavilion dv6 1330 sl. I'm running windows 7 64 bit and i haven't any disk to reinstall windows... i do a lot of research in the internet but i'm still a bit confused.... i try to synthesize what i understood:<br />
<br />
1) there is a recovery manager already installed on my pc provided by hp that allows me to recover to system to the factory condition. does this procedure need the disk? can this procedure use the D: recovery hard drive present on my pc? are there other procedure
 to factory reset the system using the D: recovery hard drive and hence avoid to use a dvd or cd?<br />
2) I can reboot my pc and press f8 and select system recovery, but i think in this case i will do a recovery of the system not at the factory condition<br />
3) there is the window backup and recovery in the control panel but i can only make a recovery or an image of the system how it is right now and i've already backed up all my files on my external hard drive. so i think i don't need this one.<br />
4) i can download an iso file of windows 7 and run the one during the installation process inserting my serial number but i didn't understand if is this procedure really safe and legal<br />
my pc is now running quite normally but i recently do various virus scan whit malwarebytes helping me because i suspected to have a rootkit on my pc. now i just wanto to reset the system to be sure i'm out of danger<br />
<br />
please advice me thank u very much<br />

            <p>1&nbsp; The procedure for using the HP recovery facility is defined by HP alone.&nbsp; It will not require use of a full Windows 7 Installation Disk [such as the one you refer to in para 4] but might require use of a recovery disk that you made previously [but I do
 not think that constraint applies to HP PCs].&nbsp; As this depends entirely on HP, you need to check your PC manual [you can get another copy from their website].&nbsp; HP have probably provided a special section on the hard drive that contains the restore-to-factory
 image and the manual will tell you how to get this to operate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2&nbsp; The Windows 7 recovery options available in the F8 menu are very limited as you suspect.&nbsp; You can only think of these as running repairs to the current state of the system.&nbsp; These Windows 7 options&nbsp;are not a means of doing a restore-to-factory [but HP
 might have chosen to add the gateway into their restore-to-factory into this menu - your manual will answer that question for you].</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3&nbsp; You can use Windows Backup to make file backups, system images &amp; system repair disks.&nbsp; None of these can now assist you in getting back to square one as you intend.&nbsp; But please note that making&nbsp;a system image as soon as you complete your restore-to-factory
 procedure will give you precisely that in the future - you could then regard that image as your second shot should the restore-to-factory procedure ever fail for any reason.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4&nbsp; Using the installation&nbsp;DVD or USB created from that ISO file with the Product Key from a Certificate of Authority [the "CoA", the label it's on] is legal.&nbsp; The DVD/USB counts as the single backup copy of the OS that you are allowed to make.&nbsp; Strictly-speaking,
 the HP restore-to-factory facility probably counts as that single backup but as you'd only bother to use the installation DVD/USB if the restore-to-factory failed then nobody is likely to be bothered if you make sure you have both available to you.&nbsp; Do note
 that the Product Key will only work for the Windows 7 Edition [Home Premium etc] that is stated on the CoA.&nbsp; Using the installation DVD/USB will result in the loss of the pre-installed HP utilities unless they have put copies of them on their website for you.</p>

            thank u very much mike and try<br />
<br />
the fact ur not professional makes even more good ur advices. I will try as soon as possible to do the recovery... if i will have time i will do also a system image (a friend advice me on clonezilla), to turn back just in case the recovery should not end well.....
<br />
the alternative is to download the free version of windows 8 from dreamspark (i'm a student) and to put install this one so that i will have a clean os whithout all the hp bloatware utilities. In this case i think it should be beter to make an ISO of the D:
 partition to keep in case in the future i'd like to restore the factory hp condition....<br />
I will think another bit on the possibilities and finally will decide<br />
<br />
thank u for ur NON professional, but very useful advices<br />

<h2>            I have a Windows 7 Home Basic India &#40; OEM Software &#41;. Can I upgrade it to windows 10 for free</h2>
                    <p>I have a genuine&nbsp;Windows 7 Home Basic India ( OEM Software ) product key bought from a retailer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have bought it around an year ago but have not used it yet. If I use it to install windows 7 home basic in my laptop now, will it give a free upgrade to windows 10 home?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I directly download the iso of windows 10 pro, can I use the windows 7 genuine product key to activate it?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer both of my questions. It will really be helpful if i get a way to install windows 7 home basic and then upgrade it to windows 10 because in that way my windows 10 will also be genuine.&nbsp;<br />
