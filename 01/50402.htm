<p>Hello</p>
<p>Here's a couple questions for you to help us better understand the situation:</p>
<p>When's the last time you were able to see your Tenure on your Xbox One console? (If you don't know for sure, just give your best guess).</p>
<p>Has your membership changed at all lately, even for a couple of hours? For example: Let us know if your Gold Membership expired and an hour later you upgraded from Silver back to Gold again.</p>
<p>What tenure are you seeing on your Xbox 360 console?</p>
<p>Let us know and we'll be standing by to hear from you!</p>

<p>im having the same issue and ive had no breaks in between memborships and states 4 years on my xbox 360 but when I check my xbox one its gone or has been glitched or something and doesn't show up and it had only happened a month ago since the update before
 recently I think this is something to do with software or just temporary I hope, but also before I get asked is yes they are both using the same profile on each console?</p>

<p>Thank you for getting back to me with that information! Let me start off by saying please don't worry. Your tenure isn't stored only on your Xbox One console, it's tied to your account. The fact that you can see your tenure on your Xbox 360 console is proof
 that you haven't lost your tenure. It's simply not showing on your Xbox One console, as I know they are looking into this.</p>
<p>Rest assured that you haven't lost your tenure, it's simply not displaying on your Xbox One console for now.</p>

            <p>Hey STONED MUMMY!</p>
<p>To piggy back off of M3tal Ac3, tenure can sometimes not show for a full billing cycle if there has been any lapse in an Xbox Live Gold membership. Since you mentioned that you added Xbox Live Gold a few days ago,&nbsp;I suggest allowing a full billing cycle to pass and then check your tenure on your Xbox One console.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!&nbsp;</p>

<p>Mister Beep - Mine has been like this for 6 months and still shows on my Xbox 360 but not my Xbox one but I'm glad I'm not the only one as I know it has something to do with these updates from Microsoft but they aren't to sure what it has done or when it
 may get fixed and its not fair to many people who have always kept there account up to date with gold memberships every annually and the support we are being given is horrendous and needs to be fixed otherwise people are going to ask for there money back until
 this is fixed because I'm a big fan of this tenure thing and love seeing how long I can keep being an annually gold member for. Plus we keep getting asked have we had any long periods of breaks in renewing our gold and the answer is no I would of been on 9
 years myself if Microsoft hadn't of let my account be taken from me by some inconsiderate kid then I would be more happy but mine states 4 years up to now on my Xbox 360 and before I get asked again I've had no breaks and it has been 6 months since it vanished
 of my Xbox one profile, and still shows on my Xbox 360 profile! &nbsp; &nbsp; FIX THIS ISSUE MICROSOFT!!!!!</p>

            <p>Hey there, x Wazzaaaaaa x! I appreciate the screenshots, those help us out. We are able to confirm your tenure is 4 years. For some reason, it's likely that the system just hasn't updated the console. This happens when your account Gold lapses, and generally does update after a full billing cycle. In your case, it should appear once your tenure rolls over to 5 years. If it doesn't happen then, please let us know and we can look into it further. :)</p>

<p>I have looked in Local Security Policies but I can't find how to turn off the locks on the folders on some of the folders on the new Windows 7 (Ultimate).&nbsp; Understandable some people might need these folders locked up, because they will hurt there systems,
 but for a system administrator, this is rediculas.&nbsp; I have also looked in Group Policies settings under MMC, but could not find anything setup for this feature.&nbsp; Probably resides in the register, but should have a little direction before tweeking.<br />
<br />
Let me know.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
In Windows 7 (and Vista), Documents and Settings is actually something called a symbolic link (similar to a shortcut).&nbsp; Basically, Microsoft changed the folder structure a little and now in fact, your use profiles are stored in C:\Users instead of C:\Documents
 and Settings.<br />
<br />
They did however create a symolic link for backwards compatibility so in essense, if you were to go into C:\Documents and Settings you would in fact go into C:\Users.<br />
<br />
The reason you're having problems is because you account technically is not an administrator (due to UAC) and therefore doesn't have rights to follow the symbolic link - nor do you really need to (just go into C:\Users instead).<br />
<br />
However, if you do continue to have a problem, a guy wrote a tool for this and posted it to my site - it's here -
<a href="http://www.insidetheregistry.com/content/viewarticle.aspx?articleid=1703" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.insidetheregistry.com/content/viewarticle.aspx?articleid=1703</a><br />
<br />
I hope this makes sense.&nbsp; You'll find these symbolic links all over the place now, C:\Users\All Users and C:\Users\Default User for example are symbolic links too.<br />
<br />
If you are still having problems, let me know.<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
Jon<br />

<h2>            authui.dll renamed and get black screen</h2>
                    
<p>hi, yesterday night i was trying to do a customization of my computer, by browsing in the internet i found a bootlogon authui.dll from a trusted website. after taking ownership of the original file and renaming it to authui.dll.backup i couldn't do any change
 or copy a new one to the system 32 folder. after that i restarted my pc to try to fix it by going in safe mode but the after going in any mode the vista loading bar appears but then i only get a black screen with the cursor and i don't get any logons or anything
 it just stays like that. so is there any way to fix this or can i get a command prompt window in the boot screen menu so i can rename my file back to normal.i will really be thankful for your answer. sorry for my english</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Did you try selecting Safe mode with Command Prompt from the boot menu? Otherwise, you might try loading the Recovery Console by booting with your Vista disk. (If you don't have one, see:<a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</a>).
 A system restore from there may also be a solution.</p>

Also, my graphics card is an NVIDIA GeForce 8400M GS.&nbsp; I will provide any additional information you might need in order to help me with this issue. Thank you!<br />

<p>I think I finally figured this out.&nbsp; It appears to me that many thousands of Microsoft customers are dealing with this problem.&nbsp; Here is what appears to have fixed my WMC problem.</p>
<p>WMC is simply a GUI.&nbsp; It should not be allowed to handle your video motion capture or other processing needs.&nbsp; Instead, your video card should be doing that.</p>
<p>On my ATI/AMD Sapphire HD3800 card, I went into the Catalyst Control Center settings.&nbsp; Most of them (in fact, probably all of them as I recall) had check marks for "Let application handle [video motion capture; rendering], etc."&nbsp;&nbsp;I unchecked all&nbsp;such boxes
 and instead gave my video card&nbsp;instructions for the card itself to&nbsp;handle video motion capture, rendering, etc.</p>
<p>Voila.&nbsp; Beautifully smooth video, which also looked richer and sharper to boot, was the result.</p>
<p>WMC is a nice product, but it's just a GUI, not a substitute for your own video card's image rendering.&nbsp; Tell your card to handle all the video motion capture and rendering functions, instead of leaving those functions to simple GUI applications like WMC,
 and I'll bet you'll get a fix too.</p>

<h2>            Alternative ways to download windows 10 &#40;other than Media Creation Tool&#41; or a way to disabled down speed limit&#63;</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">Hi, I've been trying to download Windows 10 using the Windows Media Creator app for like 48 hrs now and failing.. I reached 86% and 17% in two attempts and the download simply disappeared at 86%. This is really annoying and it seems
 that the download through the Media Creation Tool is REALLY slow. Is it using a speed limiter protocol? If yes how do I disable it?</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">
</p><p class="contentStandard">Also I'd like to find a legit alternative download method for windows 10. Where can I get the .iso to create a bootable USB? Will it work for me? And I have to enter my Product key on that (from what i know) so will my Windows 7
 Key work on it? Is there anyway to validate my product key? :P</p>
<p class="contentCodeblock">

    <title>Windows defender closing instantly - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> christianschau  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows defender closing instantly</h2>
                    <p>Not so long ago I had some problems and reinstalled windows. There were some problems after installing, mainly that the taskbar is missing some of it's functions. I now tried to run an experimental .exe file but an error message came up saying "Operation
 did not complete successfully because the file contains a virus or potentially unwanted software." I knew what I was doing so I decided to add an exception to Windows Defender. But as I ran it through Settings it just opened a blank window then instantly closed.
 What do I do? I don't want to reinstall again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: I should add that there were no problems while installing.</p>

            You could perform a repair upgrade, it is similar to reinstall, but it keeps your personal files, apps and settings while fixing broken operating system files.

<br />If you still don't want to do that:
<br />
<br />Try these first to see if they work:
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt OR Copy and Paste these one at a time : (Hit enter after each)

<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /CheckHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /ScanHealth
<br />
<br />Dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /RestoreHealth
<br />
<br />Also run the System File Checker utility:
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />At the Command Prompt, type: sfc/scannow
<br />
<br />This will check for any integrity violations
<br />
<br />Restart your system

            Please answer ALL of the following [admittedly tedious] diagnostic questions by number, preferably without quoting my post:
<br />
<br />1. When (approx. date) did you purchase the computer?
<br />
<br />2a. Did the computer come with Win10 preinstalled, did you do a clean install of Win10, or did you upgrade a Win7 computer or a Win8.1 computer [&lt;=PICK ONE!] to Win10? 
<br />
<br />2b. When (exact date, preferably) and how did you "reinstall" Windows?
<br />
<br />3. Who manufactured the computer (e.g., Dell; HP; Acer; Lenovo; ASUS)?
<br />
<br />4. Has a Norton application or a McAfee application EVER been installed on the computer since you bought it? 
<br />
<br />5. Have you ever run the Norton Removal Tool and/or the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool?
<br />
<br />6. What Version &amp; OS Build of Windows 10 is currently installed? 
<br />
<br />•  Press &amp; hold the Windows Key and press the R  key. In the RUN dialog, type WINVER and press the Enter key.

<p><span>1. When (approx. date) did you purchase the computer?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br />
Considering that the computer is more than 7 years old I'll say 2009.<br />
<span>2a. Did the computer come with Win10 preinstalled, did you do a clean install of Win10, or did you upgrade a Win7 computer or a Win8.1 computer [&lt;=PICK ONE!] to Win10?&nbsp;</span><br />
Upgraded from Win7 to Win8.1 to Win10<br />
<span>2b. When (exact date, preferably) and how did you "reinstall" Windows?&nbsp;</span><br />
I reinstalled windows in early September by using the windows installer. There were a bunch of bluescreens before it installed successfully. I then reinstalled because I had mistakenly installed 32bit. I reinstalled both windows through an installer on an USB.<br />
<span>3. Who manufactured the computer (e.g., Dell; HP; Acer; Lenovo; ASUS)?&nbsp;</span><br />
I am not quite good at computers, but the case says "Zalman"<br />
<span>4. Has a Norton application or a McAfee application EVER been installed on the computer since you bought it?&nbsp;</span><br />
No.<br />
<span>5. Have you ever run the Norton Removal Tool and/or the McAfee Consumer Products Removal Tool?&nbsp;</span><br />
No.<br />

<p>1. The computer just completely malfunctioned, nothing would work and eventually fonts were replaced with the desktop and the screen just flickered.</p>
<p>2. Windows Defender was working without any problems.</p>
<p>3a. AVG Antivirus</p>
<p>3b. Adaware</p>
<p>3c. Hitmanpro</p>
<p>3d. Hitmanpro(?)</p>
<p>4. Yes.</p>
<p>5a. The upgrade was free.</p>
<p>5b. I chose to upgrade to Windows 8.1</p>
<p>6. I do not know what update I was in before the whole computer failed, for it was an update that made it fail.</p>
<p>7. No.</p>
<p>8. No.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am preparing to do the repair upgrade tonight.</p>
<p>I should also say that there were no problems right after reinstalling, but after some memory management bluescreens it went downhill.</p>

            1. AVG (Free or paid) is no longer installed nor was it still installed after you "reinstalled" Windows in September, is that correct?
<br />
<br />2. When and why was Hitman Pro (an anti-malware application, not an anti-virus application) installed? Have you purchased Hitman Pro? Has Hitman Pro detected &amp; removed anything since it's been installed?
<br />
<br />3. REPOSTING =&gt; Did you choose to upgrade from Windows 8.1 to Windows 10 manually or was the upgrade offered AND INSTALLED via Windows Update? 
<br />
<br />4, Did you do a "repair upgrade" in September?
<br />
<br />[I don't think a "repair upgrade" - or a Reset or a Refresh - will fix this. AVG - as well as Norton, McAfee, and Avast - applications are notorious for not uninstalling or upgrading cleanly. The "leftover" may be playing a role here.]

<p>1. Correct.</p>
<p>2. I installed Hitman Pro after mistakingly downloading malware. It deleted it completely This happened some time around the 14th-18th September. I've noticed it's flagging some of the files in System32.</p>
<p>3.It was offered and installed.</p>
<p>4. No.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried doing a repair upgrade now, after installing it restarted, and now Steam doesn't work.</p>

            <p>It seems as though the ability to zoom on the PS4 is tied to the touchpad on the controller. &nbsp;Something we do not have on the Xbox One.</p>
<p>Perhaps you could try posting to the developer to see if they may be willing to add that feature to the Xbox One in a future update.</p>

<p>I have been searching tirelessly online to find information about a zoom-in function. It appears there is none and I can't get onto the 505 games webpage to report the issue. I sincerely hope this is something that is addressed soon, because currently the
 camera is panned so far out that it literally hurts my eyes to play the game. additionally I am visually impaired so that certainly doesn't help matters. Anyone who reads this I humbly ask that you please attempt to report this issue to 505. Not including
 a zoom feature or at least simply having view distance in the options menu seems like a severe oversight and should be fixed.

<p>Totally agree with you, this needs to me fixed sooner rather than later. I can't seem to get into the game without the up close perspective that made the game feel more intense.

<p>Yeah it is kind of unplayable as it is, unless I get stupidly close to the screen... I am also very disappointed that there were no ability to import saves from the 360 version... I didn't buy this game just to start over from scratch when I have a save
 that I built on for hundreds of hours... I read that they are at least working on that, so that is good.. It is just that a lot of people will have no reason to buy the game until they can bring their creations with them..... But then without being able to
 zoom in, I still personally can't play it properly... They could "easily" add that feature.. Either by using a left stick push to cycle zoom levels, or a combination.. You can jump with the A button already, so it is kind of unnecessary to use the left stick
 push for jumping as well. </p>

<p>I agree. My son and I put 100's of hours on the 360 version and we were excited to start new world/characters on the x1 edition. Right away single player was way too small. My eyes were killing me trying to just see my toon. Try a split screen two player
 game!!!! We have a 55" TV and even sitting 5 feet away was too small. Hoping there is some kind of resolution or zoom funation added within the week. The game is unplayable period right now as is.

<p>I agree with everyone else. The game's default view is too far out for comfortable play when not sitting directly in front of the screen. The feature needs to be added quickly.</p>
<p>Also, multiplayer seems to be broken, for me. Can't get into my friend's game or get him in mine.</p>

            That's a negative as of right now. I had 8.1 which I bought from Walmart and then I upgraded to 10. Just yesterday I did a motherboard swap and now I can't activate my windows 10 even after it was already activated on this computer. It reverted to an inactive
 state and I can't activate it, as well as I refuse to buy another copy because three weeks ago or so I spent about $118.00 on windows 8.1. In short, as of right now, don't swap your motherboard.

            reinstall windows 7 or 8 first activate the key if it ask you to contact Microsoft to read them a 25 dig number and letter they will ask you if this key was used on another pc you tell them no as you the only owner of it. After the key activates then do
 the upgrade to windows 10. Trust me I done this many times pain in the butt but its the only way you can do it.

                    <p /><p>Olá,&nbsp;</p>



<p>Recentemente comprei o Forza 7 da Microsoft, baixei o jogo e instalei no meu SDD Kingston. Inicialmente, nas primeiras corridas os frames quanto a suavidade e estabilidade do jogo estavam muito bem, porém, depois o jogo começou a travar, congelando a tela por alguns segundos constantemente sempre quando vou entrar em uma nova corrida, pós carregado. Outras vezes quando carrego a corrida voltando ao menu volta ao normal, mas é irritante. Preciso de um auxílio, os demais jogos via Steam ou Origin funcionam perfeitamente no Ultra. O Forza eu jogo no recomendado mas mesmo assim não resolve. Segue as especificações da minha máquina:</p>



<p>Processador: I7-7700K Kaby Lake</p>

<p>Memórias: 2 x 8Gb HyperX 2400mhz</p>

<p>Placa Mãe: MSI 270 Gaming M5</p>

<p>Placa de Vídeo: Nvidia GTX 970 EXOC Galax</p>



<p>Armazenamentos:</p>

<p>SSD 240Gb Kingston (instalado)
HD 1T Seagate</p>



<p>Monitor: LG 25 polegadas UltraWide</p>

                    <p>Can anyone help me with the two above problems?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since version 1709 i have this stupid 'pick up where i left off' feature which "tries' to re open all my programs i had open when i turned off the computer. of course it cannot do this successfully so my itunes has failed multiple times and has required
 a reinstall and even my office has had to be reinstalled.</p>
<p>
</p><p>i have read that it is some cortana feature but it can only be turned off if you are in the US?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>also now every time my screen turns off i have to put a password in? why?!?!?!?! likewise i cant find a way to turn this off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be much appreciated seeing as the microsoft support has not been any help.</p>

<p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Pick up where I left off</strong> is one of Cortana's feature under the

<p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of the moment, <strong>Pick up where I left off</strong> option/feature in Cortana is only available with United States region. We recommend that you change the current region set on your computer to disable the feature. Follow the steps below on how-to:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Start </strong>button and select the <strong>Settings </strong>
icon.</li><li>Choose <strong>Time &amp; Language</strong> from the list.</li><li>Select <strong>Region &amp; language</strong> in the left pane of the window.</li><li>Make sure that <strong>United States</strong> is set as your region.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>After setting the region to United States, go to <strong>Cortana's Notebook</strong> again and scroll down to find the
<strong>Pick up where I left off option</strong>. Toggle the switch to turn it off. Also, are you still experiencing issues with sign-in options on your PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're looking forward to your reply.</p>

<h2>            New account high jacked my Desktop</h2>
                    <p>I set up a Microsoft account for Skype purposes (using my name, a different password and email) on our home PC for my other user account. Now I have to use the new account to see my desktop, shortcuts and files. My original account now shows a generic desktop
 with a few shortcuts and none of my files.&nbsp; It's like&nbsp; I accidentally changed the default email and password to my original administrator account but there is still an account matching my original info but has no payment info attached now. My Office subscription
 shows up on the account with the new email and password not the one I originally used to set that up.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Stevie,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It would be best to delete your new Microsoft account and then re-add it again. To do this, go to Settings&gt; Accounts&gt; Family &amp; other people&gt; Remove&gt; Restart your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since you're only using the new email account on Skype, it would be best if you simply log-in your new email account so you don't need to create a new account on your computer.</p>
<p>

<h2>            A way for see and compare ICC profile</h2>
                    <p>In Windows XP there was a simple applet (Microsoft Color Control Panel Applet for Windows XP) which was very useful for seeing 3d gamut representation of ICC profiles, in similar way OSX does.</p>
<p>It's an old app (almost 10 years)... is there any way to do something similar on Windows 10?</p>

    <title>Blue&#47;Gray Screen after Start-up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> riteorrong  say:</h3>
<h2>            Blue&#47;Gray Screen after Start-up</h2>
                    
<p>After pressing the start-up button on my PC,&nbsp; what look to be coding errors immediately begin to appear on my screen followed by the screen having horizontal blue stripes across it as it tries to load Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The computer will then go to the black screen and ask&nbsp;to either start computer in normal mode or in repair mode (only 2 options it will give).&nbsp; If normal mode is selected, Windows will begin to load then the screen will go a blue/gray color and completely
 blank without finishing loading.&nbsp; If repair is selected, it will try and repair, but ultimately starts the whole process over.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have tried unsuccessfully twice to do a system restore to previous dates.&nbsp; When loading same thing happens.&nbsp; Have been able to bring it up in Safe Mode, but unable to do anything other than do a system restore.</p>
<p>Am completely at a loss as to how to work around this when it will not load into Windows and I have the ability to use Start or anything else.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Tried several more times to get Windows to load, but it would not.&nbsp; Only once after shutting down and restarting would it even give the option for safe-mode.&nbsp; Then it would not&nbsp;load Windows&nbsp;in safe mode.&nbsp; So I was unable to even get into my files/folders.</p>
<p>Finally decided to do total system restore.&nbsp; Doing that I have lost everything that was on my computer, so now computer is back at square one, only the basic programs which originally came with it.&nbsp; But at least it loads Windows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Problem now is the computer still has the same screen showing what look to be coding errors on my screen followed by the screen having horizontal blue stripes across it as it tries to load Windows.&nbsp;It finally does load Windows, but something is amiss still.&nbsp;
 Is this a virus?&nbsp; Is there a cure?</p>

            It depends on what you mean with "Total system restore". If you did a factory restore and the problem persists then you have a hardware problem. If you used some other restore mechanism then it was insufficient to resolve the issue. A factory restore would
 then resolve it.

            It means that you have to get the machine attended to by someone who is familiar with hardware and who can replace various components in order to identify the culprit.

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>Just curious as I don't know if you are getting a error code, but would you midn trying to log off of xbox.com then shutting down your console. Re log in on your console and try your purchase again. If that doesn't work try to log on to xbox.com while your
 console is off, and adding the points from xbox.com and please do come back to let us know of your successes failures? Thanks</p>

<p>Hello bimmerPXG, although I have not personally experienced something like this, as I have not redeemed any codes in recent times, perhaps trying to redeem a code on another profile and seeing if the problem persists. If it does not then try redownloading
 your profile and trying to redeem a code. Good luck and hope this works!</p>

<p>No there is not. See the things in the chest at a time were items you won from various minigames on the fable 2 website. Also the chest contained master chiefs armor and what not. If you had the collectors edition of Fable 2 it came with a card that basically
 let you open the chest. But unless you find one of those cards that chest will remain locked. Sorry Man.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 defaults to the SLOW 58mps wifi connection rather than using the FAST 1GB ethernet connection</h2>
                    <p>Really???!!!&nbsp; I just bought a new computer and 8.1 refuses to use my Ethernet connection.&nbsp; It uses my Wi-Fi no matter what I do.&nbsp; I've researched this for a few days and the only solution is that this is a design flaw created by incompetence or arrogance.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need to get this straight.&nbsp; I have a cable plan that affords me up to 100 mps of download speed,but because 8.1 forces me to use the Wi-Fi connection, which caps out at 58.6 mps, I can just do away with that EXTRA 41 mps.&nbsp; So, I can switch to a SLOWER
 but CHEAPER plan.&nbsp; Wow!&nbsp; Thanks Microsoft!&nbsp; You're going to save me so much money.&nbsp; Why, it almost makes me wish I had Optimum with up to 300 mps so I could slow down to 58mps and save EVEN MORE MONEY!&nbsp; Wow!&nbsp; I'm missing out on so much.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously!&nbsp; I'm stuck using the Wi-Fi connection!&nbsp; I have tried EVERY suggestion I found, so unless an MS tech responds to this, there's no need to provide a "solution."&nbsp; Trust me - I've tried it already.&nbsp; The only hope for this is that it is resolved in
 Windows 10.&nbsp; But I will refuse to upgrade unless it is.&nbsp; Unless Windows 10 allows me to use my 1GB Ethernet connection I may consider switching to one of the Linux iterations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>FIX THIS MICROSOFT! IT'S RIDICULOUS!</p>

    <title>Installing Windows 10 as a Virtual Machine ob a licensed Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> murphythedog  say:</h3>
<h2>            Installing Windows 10 as a Virtual Machine ob a licensed Windows 10 host</h2>
                    <p style="text-align: center"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>Apologies if this question has already been asked and answered ...
</strong></em></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>For my sins, I "own" (<em>please see below</em>) and use a licensed version of Windows 10 Pro as the host OS for my main desktop.&nbsp; Onto this host machine I have installed, amongst other software, Oracle's VirtualBox and employ it to run multiple guest VM's
 mostly based on one or other *nix kernel.&nbsp; So far, so good.&nbsp; This way I can test out solutions safely before prejudicing my aging laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would now like also to achieve a similar solution by deploying a VirtualBox Windows 10 Pro guest VM onto my Microsoft Windows 10 licensed host.&nbsp; My question is therefore:
<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">can I do so using the xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx key that I use with my host desktop?</span>&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Please note</span>, I am neither installing Windows 10 on different metal nor am I providing a boot leg copy of Windows 10 and a license to a illicit 3'rd party nor am I in any way trying to defraud the software vendor
 of legal revenue, I am simply proposing to install end user software of my own choosing onto a legitimate licensed product that I already own.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now if I can't (<em>and there seems to be a popular belief to this effect</em>) this seems to imply that Microsoft as the host OS vendor is acting to filter what software they will permit me, their customer, to choose to use on my own property.&nbsp; And if this
 is the case, presumably they can, either now or in the future, also do likewise with my choice of browser, DBMS, web server, etc?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have insufficient detailed knowledge of networking protocols and standards to understand the minutia of what and how a Vurtual Machine communicates via its Host over a wide area network such as the Internet but common sense suggests that at least part
 of the protocol and data packets involved in communicatig employs the Host's wide area IP address (which of course, in my case is properly licensed to emply Windows) as a part of it.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This being the case, why then can I simply not piggy-back a Guest VM (of any genesis including that of Microsoft) on my own host, immaterial of the nature of the software running on the Guest?&nbsp; If Microsoft's response is that currently they are not set up
 to differentiate sites such as that I would wish to deploy then, frankly that is their problem and there is no reason why they should visit it upon their customers?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I entirely understand why Micorsoft (or any vendor) doesn't want huge numbers of unlicensed copies of their products scattered and unpaid for around the world; in the case of a licensed host running multiple VM's this is simply not the case.</p>

<p>Thanks Sumit Dhiman2 for the help I have now managed to fix it. My flatmate has just come in and ask if I had tried ending the windows installer in task manager which I completely forgot to check and now I am able to install everything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help</p>

<h2>            Minecraft Story Mode Season Two Xbox 360</h2>
                    <p>Hi&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>I am having problems installing Minecraft Story Mode&nbsp;Season Two on the XBox 360.</p><p><br /></p><p>I downloaded from the Xbox marketplace what I thought was the game but it was actually the Season Pass (Add on).</p><p>I then&nbsp;found what I&nbsp;thought was the main game and episode 1.

    <title>Windows 7 Home Premium Remote Administration - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> russellwooten  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Home Premium Remote Administration</h2>
                    <p>What I have read so far says that 2 computers with Windows 7 Home Premium cannot use "Windows Remote Assistance" or " Desktop Remote Connection" for remote administration. One computer is in North Carolina on a cable router. The other is in New York on a
 Verizon broadband modem.</p>
<p>In the past one could remote login for remote administration using something like a peer to peer or point to point login without having to use specialized access applications or software. I tried using TeamViewer free version but found it has limitations
 especially when the computers are far from each other. The limitation is that if you try to go several processes deep in remote admin, it will freeze. I am looking to bypass all applications, including Windows applications and connect directly to the remote
 computer via IP, network, and/or domain settings. Can someone point me in the right direction to a link or YouTube video? Is there anyone who knows how to do this?</p>

<p><span>-&gt; Distance is irrelevant. I routinely use TeamViewer or Remote Desktop to access Australian PCs from Switzerland. However, you might get permission problems with TeamViewer, depending on how the hosts are configured.
 Remote Desktop is probably more robust.</span></p>

<p>Setting up an RDP connection is not exactly trivial. In broad terms, here is what you need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Either a static external IP address for the RDP host, or a domain name that resolves to the current dynamic address.</li><li>A tunnel through the router at the RDP host site.</li><li>A fixed internal IP address for the RDP host.</li><li>Remote Desktop must be enabled on the RDP host.</li><li>The RDP host's firewall must accept incoming RDP packets.</li></ul>
<p>If you lack the experience then you need to ask a computer-savvy friend to help you, either in person at the remote end or by granting him remote access to the RDP host.</p>

<h2>            Remove RemixOS from dual boot</h2>
                    <p>I installed RemixOS on my Windows10 (64bit) pc. After using few days I uninstalled Remix OS. To remove that I did following things-<br />
1. I ran MSCONFIG and remove remix os from boot menu.<br />
2. I formatted the drive partition where remix os was installed.<br />
<br />
But it is still showing in dual boot. When I select Remix OS to boot it shows error(included in image)-</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/48bd8b93-ed51-443e-8ca2-16555d1c8fa7?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/48bd8b93-ed51-443e-8ca2-16555d1c8fa7?upload=true" /></a><br />
</p>
<p>I ran MSCONFIG again but it is listing only one OS (following image)-</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/35950e8f-5e66-4eb0-879f-9afe05472c98?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/35950e8f-5e66-4eb0-879f-9afe05472c98?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried EasyBCD tool, but it is also listing only one entry i.e. Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I tried Command Prompt with 'BCDEDIT' command, it shows two boot manager, one is 'windows boot manager' where identifier is {bootmgr}, device is 'partition=\Device\HarddiskVolume2' and path is '\EFI\RemixOS\bootx64.efi'.<br />
The second boot manager is 'Windows Boot Loader' where identifier is {current}, device is 'partition=c:' and path is \Windows\system32\winload.efi'. (following image)-</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/54e1b3df-c2a5-468f-ac59-a9e8a827ee28?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/54e1b3df-c2a5-468f-ac59-a9e8a827ee28?upload=true" /></a><br />
I tried command 'BCDEDIT /DELETE {bootmgr}' but it says "This entry cannot be deleted unless the /f switch is specified on the command line.&nbsp; Run bcdedit /? for more information.<br />
Access is denied."<br />

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>There are a few methods that can be done to uninstall programs on a Windows device. One of the most common would be using the Control Panel's Add/Remove Programs option. To completely uninstall the program, kindly perform these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the Windows button + R on your keyboard.</li><li>Type "appwiz.cpl" and then press the Enter key.</li><li>Search the program that you want to remove by highlighting it, and then click on the Uninstall button.</li><li>After uninstalling the program, restart your computer.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>In the event that the program isn't listed on the Application Wizard, then you can perform these steps instead:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: </p>
<p>1. Right-click on the shortcut launcher. </p>
<p>2. On the drop-down list, click "Properties".</p>
<p>3. On the "General" tab, click on Open File Location button.</p>
<p>4. Once you are on the folder location, look for the program's executable file. Usually, it would be named as "setup.exe" or "Uninstall.exe" or abbreviations like "Uninstll.exe" and such.</p>
<p>5. Run it to uninstall the program.</p>
<p>6. Restart your computer.</p>
<p>7. Check if the program is still present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Another method that you can perform is the uninstallation of the program by using the Built-in Administrator. To do so, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 3:</p>
<p>1. On your keyboard, press the Windows + X button.</p>
<p>2. Click on Command Prompt (Admin).</p>
<p>3. On Command prompt, and type "net user administrator /active:yes"</p>
<p>4. Exit the command prompt and restart your computer.</p>
<p>5. After restarting the computer, perform the same steps stated in Method 2.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Note</span></strong></span><span><span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>: The hidden Administrator account has more privileges than a regular administrator account. Privileges that can easily generate a conflict
 on your system. We only recommend enabling the built-in Administrator account for troubleshooting purposes and you have to disable it once you are done.</span></span></span></span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>To disable the hidden Administrator account, follow these steps:</span></span><span>
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>On<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Search<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>type<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>CMD</span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>to open<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Command Prompt</span></span><span><span>.
 Right click on<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>CMD</span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>then choose<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Run as administrator</span></span><span><span>. If you are prompted for an administrator password or for a confirmation,
 type the password, or click Yes.</span></span><span> </span></li><li><span><span>In the Command Prompt window, type<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>net user administrator /</span><span>active:no</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>then hit the Enter key.</span></span><span>
</span></li><li><span><span>The administrator account will now be disabled, and shouldn’t show up on the login screen anymore.</span></span><span>
<br />
</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>In the event that the program still exists after performing the troubleshooting methods above, we advise that you contact the support team of the program that you are trying to uninstall. This is for you to be advised of any possible uninstaller that they
 have. Uninstallers could wipe clean any system file that is associated to the program.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have further questions, please don't hesitate to reply to this thread.</p>

<p>Thanks for your attention,&nbsp;</p>
<p>As I told you earlier I was trying to remove dual boot by BCDEDIT command, I ran command 'bcdedit /delete {bootmgr} /f' after that I shutdown my system. System was not shutting down automatically so I force shutdown ut by holding Shift key while shutting
 down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that I started my system but it is not starting(error in following image) -&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Upon replicating your concern on our end, the command
<strong>bcdedit /remove</strong> needs to be run first before running the command
<strong>bcdedit /delete</strong>. Upon testing, running the <strong>bcedit /delete</strong> command would delete all system files relating to the other OS, however, it would not totally remove the files associated with it. That being said, we recommend running
 the following commands to be able to remove it from your system: </span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>In Command Prompt run <strong>cd c:/</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Once done, run
<strong>fixboot</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Change the directory to
<strong>C</strong> and then run <strong>bcdedit</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Check if the same issue persists.</span></li></ol>

<p>
</p><p>(a) <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">One approach: Do it with BCDEdit</span>.</p>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Hint</span>: After entering each /Set command,
<strong>Up-Arrow</strong> will recall it for alteration.</p>
<p>

<p><span>BCDEdit /Set</span><span> {BootMGR}&nbsp; inherit&nbsp; {globalsettings}</span></p>
<p><span>BCDEdit /Set</span><span> {BootMGR}&nbsp; default&nbsp; </span>{<del>140ab405-3491-11e7-a4a0-952787f57a8e</del>}<span> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; //<strong>See note below</strong>.</span></p>

<p><span>BCDEdit /Set</span><span> {BootMGR}&nbsp; timeout&nbsp; 30</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>Note</strong></span>: To set "default", you must enter
<strong>your </strong>actual GUID value (<strong>not mine</strong>). I tried to use "{default}" &amp; "{current}", but they didn't work. (But after this, it
<em>will </em>work for "</span><span>displayorder</span><span>".) So...</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>BCDEdit &nbsp;-enum&nbsp; OSLoader &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; //Lists the OSLoaders</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/120fd5b3-44b9-44d6-b14b-d36487c19050?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/120fd5b3-44b9-44d6-b14b-d36487c19050?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Several OSLoader's will show up. Choose the one that is <strong>Windows 10</strong>. Its description likely will say that (instead of Recovery Environment or Rollback). Also, its device will be a partition (not a RAMDisk), &amp; it will be a Boot Loader (not
 Setup).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Select the text of the <strong>identifier </strong>with your mouse (drag it), &amp; use
<strong>Ctrl+C </strong>to copy it. Then, go to the command line &amp; paste it with <strong>
Ctrl-V</strong>. (Or, use the Edit menu provided by clicking the icon in the header of the Command Prompt.)</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This is how that went (into my copy of my BCD in "C:\Stuff\Copy", made with "/Export", then I did the delete you did).
</span><span>See how it ends up becoming "{default}" after all...</span></p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3d7b4629-319c-4e24-8897-3cdb6a65bb80?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3d7b4629-319c-4e24-8897-3cdb6a65bb80?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>"{default}" is what shows up as "{current}" when the BCD is online. Yours will be offline until you can reboot. Here is the finished product. It looks just like yours did before the catastrophe, except I gave it a reasonable "timeout"...</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c4157b70-05f2-4885-8c6a-641b209089de?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c4157b70-05f2-4885-8c6a-641b209089de?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>(b) <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Another way: Delete the whole BCD, then recreate it with "BootRec&nbsp;/RebuildBCD"</span>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll post instructions separately later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BootRec only exists at the Command Prompt of the recovery environment (where you are). Normally, "/RebuildBCD" will just add any Windows installation it finds (that isn't already there) into the current BCD. That would only be a Boot Loader entry (not a
 Boot Manager). But BootRec can be made to regenerate the <strong>entire </strong>
BCD by deleting the current one first. That includes the Boot Manager entry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To do that, we must put a letter (say, "X:") onto your EFI partition for access. It looks like yours will be Partition 2 (not Volume 2). But I'm unsure where your current BCD is. Normally, it would be at
<span>"\EFI\Microsoft\Boot" &amp; the Boot Manager normally is </span><span>"Bootmgfw.efi". (But I've read that "</span><span>Bootx64.efi</span><span>" is actually the same file - but only has a different name.)
</span>It's possible your BCD to delete will be in "<strong>X:\EFI\RemixOS</strong>". We'll have to look &amp; see. If so - will /RebuildBCD be able to handle it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Here is its help blurb...</p>
<p>
</p><div>
<p>X:\windows\system32&gt;bootrec /?</p>
<p>
</p></div>

<p>
</p></div>

</p><p>Hmm, you still need to find the BCD first. That likely means you need to put a letter on the system partition. But I like the BCDBoot command, as it exists in a booted Windows DOS Prompt...</p>
<p>

</p><p>
</p><p>It will regenerate the BCD, &amp; probably will be best to delete the current one first. It left some junk in my BCD intact because I didn't delete it first. And I didn't like it writing MBR boot files to my EFI (system) partition, which is GPT style. It didn't
 hurt anything, really, but I did soon delete them. So, use "/f UEFI" or "/f BIOS" (whichever applies) - not "/f All". Probably, really, it is best to use "BootRec /RebuildBCD", which only does the BCD, not any other boot files.</p>

<div>&nbsp; source&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifies the location of the windows system root.</div>
<div>&nbsp; /l&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifies an optional locale parameter to use when<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; initializing the BCD store. The default is US English.</div>
<div>&nbsp; /s&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifies an optional volume letter parameter to designate<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the target system partition where boot environment files are<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; copied.&nbsp; The default is the system partition identified by<br />

<div>&nbsp; /d&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifies that the existing default windows boot entry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; should be preserved.</div>
<div>&nbsp; /f&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Used with the /s command, specifies the firmware type of the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; target system partition. Options for &lt;firmware&gt; are 'UEFI',<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 'BIOS', or 'ALL'.</div>
<div>&nbsp; /addlast&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifies that the windows boot manager firmware entry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; should be added last. The default behavior is to add it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; first.</div>
<div>&nbsp; /p&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifies that the windows boot manager firmware entry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; position should be preserved. If entry does not exist,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; new entry will be added in the first position.</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp; /c&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Specifies that any existing objects described by the template<br />
