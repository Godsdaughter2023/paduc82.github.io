<h2>            HP PSC 2355 Printer problem on W10</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>My Laptop recently upgraded to W10 and since then I can longer print. I have a quite old HP PSC 2355 printer. It looks like the upgrade removed the printer as when I try to brint the dialog box just has print to PDF and MS Writer but no HP printer.</p>
<p>I tried using the original intall disc but my laptop wouldn't recognise it as the the disc wasn't x64.</p>
<p>I tried the HP site but to no avail.</p>
<p>Any help out there even just to say its a lost cause. Wouldn't have minded but only bought some new ink the other week :-(</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Darren</p>

<h2>            Sony Vaio Pro 13</h2>
                    <p>Hey, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with my windows 10, where I am unable to here anything from my headphones.
</p>
<p>I have installed the latest drivers and everything. reinstalled and installed multiple times. Restarted&nbsp;many&nbsp;times as well.&nbsp;Been looking for the past couple of days and nothing.
</p>
<p>I have enabled the "show disabled devices" in sound, but nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is running "Realtek HD audio manager". I cannot also seem to find the software for the realtek hd audio to configure anything, as there seems to be nothing in "hardware and sound". And it has nothing to do with the headphones either. because they do the
 same with my speakers as well (sol republic headphones and Logitech z623 speakers).
</p>
<p>When I connect the headphones, nothing appears in the sound.&nbsp;and the music or whatever I play just come out of the speakers, as if nothing was connected to headphone jack.</p>
<p>I don't believe it is a internal problem, because it didn't do this in windows 8.1.</p>
<p>Please help, and thank you :)</p>
<p />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same Vaio pro 13 laptop and the headphones work well for me.<br />
I have downgraded the Realtek audio drivers to version 6.0.1.6895 because the presets in ‘Vaio Audio Utility’ didn’t work with the latest Realtek driver. I have no audio issues with this version.</p>

            <p>I want to try this method I saw:</p>
<p><strong>I found another simple solution for this. If you have installed the Realtek software, open the Realtek HD Audio Manager , and check the " Disable front panel jack detection" option, under connector settings in the right side panel. The headphones
 and other audio devices work like a charm.</strong></p>
<p>But it seems as I cannot access the realtek software, it does not seem to appear in my control panel. I have the Realtek HD Manager installed, but I cannot seem to find the software to do this. And when I go into my PC and find the exe. for it, it doesn't
 do anything when&nbsp;I try open it. </p>

<h2>            Tethering from iPhone to Surface Pro doesn&#39;t work...</h2>
                    Hi. Took my Surface Pro to work today to show it off... and tried setting up tethering with my iPhone 4S. Unfortunately it didn't work, and I was left annoyed and rather embarrassed in front of my colleagues.
<div><br />
</div>
<div>WiFi &amp; USB - It sees my iPhone, I enter the password, then after a few seconds, the connection fails.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Bluetooth - My iPhone says the Surface is unsupported and gives me one option, 'Forget this device'.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I was fine with the Surface not having 3/4G as I always intended to tether it... but now I'm very disappointed, it's almost a deal breaker for me. Is there any way round this!? I've read many threads on the subject and I can tell you there is no funny
 characters in my personal hotspot password, it's simply lower case words (without a space) please help!</div>
                </div>

            <p>I had some of the same troubles but now I have been able to get my surface pro to tether using either Bluetooth OR Wi-Fi. Here is what I found:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. my Wi-Fi had trouble because the surface could not connect to a Wi-Fi network with a ' in the name, that's right, an apostrophe. by renaming my phone from "Bob's iphone" to like just "Bob" my Wi-Fi tethering started working.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. I don't remember the steps I took to get the Bluetooth working, but there was a lot of trial and error. It was all done on the pro's side. I had to like go make a new (wired)&nbsp;connection that was of type Bluetooth and some other things, but then it started
 working. I stopped using Bluetooth because I couldn't set it as a metered connection, since it thought it was wired.</p>

<h2>            Cannot access websites for child&#39;s account on Family Safety</h2>
                    <p>Recently my son's PC cannot access sites like www.google.com but his PC can access www.usatoday.com. &nbsp;I have deleted and added him back as a child account under family safety both on the PC and at MS family safely online with no success.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have added www.google.com to the approved list of website for him to view as well. &nbsp;The PC is running IE 11 and this issue occurs on both the desktop and panel versions of IE 11.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Very frustrating since I was just in Redmond, WA at an ECB with MS and even the guys in the room could not figure this one out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One message I got was to enable TLS, TLS 1.0, and TLS 2.0 -- which all settings were enabled.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Welcome to the Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you Family Safety Apps Restriction is not working properly. </p>
<ul>
<li>What is the error message when you try to access the website from the child account?</li></ul>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong><span> I suggest you to create a new child account for testing purpose and check if you are able to access the website.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: </strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to run the family safety troubleshooter and check if it helps.</p>

<h2>            Lost Planet 2 Backwards Compatibility </h2>
                    <p>Despite multiple posts on the Xbox Uservoice forums calling for this game to be made BC, each post with thousands of votes that are in agreement, why is nothing else being said about the game?</p><p>Furthermore, why is Uservoice in general, seemingly ignored? It seems more like a pseudo-forum made to have us think our votes and opinions matter when they really don't seem to.</p>

<p>It was announced a while back that they would no longer be taking suggestions on the user voice website for backward compatible games. Additionally, even if there is strong support for a game to become BC, it's still ultimately up to who ever owns the license
 for the game. Not to mention if there is any specif product licensing like music or advertisements for other companies that would also need addressed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Short version: Microsoft doesn't have the ability to just make every game BC, because they don't own every game.</p>

            It was my understanding all MS has to do is get it through their testing and they’re good to go. If they
<strong>want</strong>&nbsp;to seek permission they can but it’s not necessary as the developers don’t have to do anything but watch the free money come in.

<h2>            Error message&#58; &#34;Windows encountered a problem installing the driver software for your device&#34; when installing USB devices.</h2>
                    <p>Original title: USB driver update error</p>
<p>My <b>Dell Inspiron 1420</b> laptop kept crashing and finally I replaced the harddisk, reinstalled
<b>Windows Vista</b> Basic, downloaded and installed all Windows updates and downloaded and reinstalled all Dell drivers. At some point during that process, I lost my USB ports, i.e. USB devices (mouse, USB flashdrives, external hard-disks) were ignored and
 the device manager didn't show the <b>USB ports</b> any more, just two "unknown devices". I made sure that all the newest Dell drivers for my Computer were installed and Windows correctly updated, then I right-clicked on the "unknown devices", selected "Update
 driver software" and after a while got the following error message:</p>
<p><i>Windows encountered a problem installing the driver software for your device<br />
</i><i>Windows found driver software for your device but encountered an error while attempting to install it.<br />
</i><i>Intel(R) ICH8 Family USB Universal Host Controller - 2830<br />
</i><i>An error occurred during the installation of the device:<br />
</i><i>The driver installation file for this device is missing a necessary entry. This may be because the INF was written for Windows 95 or later. Contact your hardware vendor.<br />
</i><i>If you know the manufacturer of your device, you can visit its website and check the support section for driver software.</i></p>
<p>I've searched the web for this error message, but found nothing. What should I do?</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

            <p>&lt;&lt;device manager didn't show the USB ports any more, just two "unknown devices</p>
<p><br />
Were you able to identify the unknown devices? I have encountered once that missing bluetooth drivers can cause missing USB's. See if you can find details of the unknown device in Device Manager. Look at the "Details" tab of the Device's properties, you'll
 see the Device description "Value" which usually describes the device. Also on the same tab, under Property, click on the drop down arrow and click on "Hardware Ids", under the "Value" you will see something like PCI\VEN_8086&amp;DEV_2838.... The VEN_8086 identifies
 the vendor and DEV_8086 identifies the device. You can make your search in the below link:<br />
PCI Vendor and Device Lists<br />
<a href="http://www.pcidatabase.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcidatabase.com/</a></p>
<p>Enter the 4 digits in the search box or you can post the device decriptions and Hardware Ids, so others may help.<br />

            Thanks!<br />
<br />
There are eight "unknown devices" are under "Universal Serial Bus controllers", and their Hardware Ids look like this:<br />
<br />
USB\ROOT_HUB&amp;VID8086&amp;PID2831&amp;REV0002<br />
USB\ROOT_HUB&amp;VID8086&amp;PID2831<br />
USB\ROOT_HUB<br />
<br />
What could that be?<br />
No VEN_... or DEV_... values.<br />

            <p>I was referring to the two unknown devices in your previous post which should be under "Other devices".<br />
Device Manager displays the device as Unknown Device next to a yellow question mark and puts it in the Other devices branch, yours are under USB Controllers?. This is very common with universal serial bus (USB). Also, a status of Error Code 1 or Error Code
 10 may be displayed when you view the properties of the device in Device Manager. What's the error code indicated?</p>
<p>Most USB devices function correctly without additional device drivers because they are configured by the drivers that are included with Windows, perhaps updating Windows would do the trick.
</p>
<p>You may have already tried deleting everything under USB Controllers then rebooting. Try that again and this time perform a complete power off situation, that is, turn off the computer, remove the power plug from the outlet, and remove the battery. Wait
 about a minute, then restart.</p>

<div>The unknown devices are not under "Other devices", but under "Universal Serial Bus controllers."</div>

<div>No, they are under USB controllers, and there is no yellow questions mark. Under properties - General it says "This device is working properly", under Details there are the hardware IDs I've quoted above. Under Details - property - problem code it says
 "00000000", at install error "There is no driver selected for the device information set or element &nbsp;E0000203".</div>

<div>As I've written in my first message, I did update Windows. I constantly update, and when I encountered this problem, I was very surprised that Windows update wouldn't fix the problem, because I know that problems like this are usually solved that way.
 This time, it doesn't work.</div>

<div>Yes, I've tried deleting everything under USB controllers and then rebooting, but then I didn't take out the battery. I did it again, unplugged and took out the battery. When I turned the computer on again, I got the same as usual: unknown devices found,
 but after several steps, no driver was found or installed.</div>
<div>Thanks for your suggestions. I'm a bit desperate and I'm afraid neither Dell nor Microsoft are going to help me, because Dell will say that's a software problem, so re-install Windows; and Microsoft will say, that's a problem with Dell components, so re-install
 their drivers. I'm not keen to format my harddisk and re-install Windows again. Last time I did that it took me almost three days to set up my machine properly again. And downloading those drivers from Dell and installing them hasn't worked either. This is
 a nightmare. I find it very difficult to use a computer without a functioning mouse.</div>
<div>When I plug in the mouse, The computer realises that there is something and says "Installing driver device software &nbsp; Pending...", and the mouse shows up with a yellow exclamation mark in the Device Manager under "other devices", as you suggested. When
 I xxx, it says "Searching online for software", and then it says "Windows was unable to install your Microsoft 5-Button Mouse with IntellyEye", which is quite ironic.</div>
<div>Maybe there's a problem with Windows update on my computer? But regular updates for Windows are actually installed almost every day. The latest update was "Definition Update for Windows Defender - KB915597 (Definition 1.113.126.0)", installed on September
 23rd, 2011.</div>

<p>[/quote]You are not allowed to name and shame on the forums.&nbsp; Even if support said to, they are wrong and not up to speed on the forums terms of use.&nbsp; You will need to block communications, avoid player, and file a complaint via your console.&nbsp; There is nothing

<p>Naming and shaming may end up getting you in hot water. &nbsp;Don't do it. &nbsp;Just block their communications. &nbsp;And just so you know, NO ONE and I mean NO ONE can kick you off of Live other than Microsoft themselves. &nbsp;They are just blowing smoke dude. &nbsp;Kids think
 they can hack, but true hackers don't make threats they just do it and if you was trully hacked you wouldn't even be online at all. &nbsp;Ignore them and move on.</p>

<p>^^ They can't kick you offline, but they can flood your ip address and it will knock you offline for a while.<br />

For anyone interested here is quick look at what a DoS or DDoS is and what to do <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/connecting/dos-attacks-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
click here</a>.<br />
<br />
Here is an overview from Micrsofts' support page:<br />
<br />
</p>
<div>
Overview
<div>
<p>If you play games on Xbox LIVE, you could experience a denial of service (or DoS) attack or a distributed denial of service (or DDoS) attack. Such attacks may render your device (that is, your Xbox 360 console or your computer) temporarily unable to connect
 to the Internet or to Xbox LIVE.<br />
<br />
If you have an Xbox LIVE account, your Xbox 360 console could experience a DoS attack or DDoS attack from another Xbox LIVE account. DoS attacks and DDoS attacks are sometimes used as retaliation between Xbox LIVE gameplayers.<br />
<br />
If you think you've experienced a DoS or DDoS attack, we recommend that you reset your Internet router and contact your Internet Service Provider (ISP). If you know who initiated the DoS or DDoS attack, you may also want to submit a player review to Xbox LIVE
 and avoid the attacker in the future.</p>

<p>I sent this from my iPhone so forgive the bad grammar lol and it was a Ip flood or what ddos attack. The point is nothing is done and when you decide to take action and try to get results customer service points you In an opposite direction....it's sad really
 but who cares Microsoft doesn't so just block them and file a complaint and more on and act like it never happened....pathetic</p>

<p>Ok, recently my Vista Tower thingy is beeping and sounds like its reloading and buzzing. Sometimes i try to make the system run something thw tower keeps on bussing and beeping like ts going to overheat or stop running. when i play a fullscreen game and
 start to play its buzzes also and when i sometimes shut down the computer it buzzes. Also when i'm barely doing anything it starts to buzz again</p>
<p>This recently happened 2 days ago when i got disconnected from the internet like 4 times in a row when i was running a game and Mozilla</p>
<p>i didn't download anything new</p>
<p>I didn't try to do anything to stop it but trying to stop using the computer.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>The beeping sounds are error codes which describe an issue with your machine. <br />
<br />
Bootup and select SETUP/SETTINGS (BIOS/CMOS) - usually F2 as you start up - look <br />
to see BIOS creator then refer here : (or check with System maker)<br />

                    <p>On both a desktop and a laptop using windows 10, if the created character is using the top part of the grid, this top part is not saved by the program (I first inquired about it on November 14, 2009, with windows 7, but probably didn't explain well enough).

    <title>Backwards Compatibility Requests for Project Scarlett - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mastermindevan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Backwards Compatibility Requests for Project Scarlett</h2>
                    <p>Before I get to the requests, let me start off by saying that the Backwards Compatibility (BC) team at Xbox has done a FANTASTIC job with bringing back many Xbox 360 and Original (OG) Xbox titles and making them playable on Xbox One. I know I can speak for
 the entire Xbox community in saying that we definitely appreciate their hard work and dedication to this massive project. Thank you BC team!</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the transition from the Xbox One into Project Scarlett occurs, there are a few requests that I would like to ask of the BC team as they prepare to work on backwards compatibility for the next generation of consoles. Some of these requests might have already
 been addressed, but I'm still going to put them here as one complete list in the order of highest importance to lowest importance. Here they are:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. If possible, please make it where all Xbox One games and all currently available Xbox 360 and OG Xbox games via backward compatibility are ready to download and play on Project Scarlett as soon as the new console comes out. A seamless transition of our
 games library from Xbox One into Project Scarlett would definitely be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Once the Project Scarlett generation arrives, PLEASE go back to the currently unavailable Xbox 360 and OG Xbox titles and make them backwards compatible for Project Scarlett. Again, I can speak for the entire Xbox community in saying that while we still
 do appreciate the amount of effort that has made backwards compatibility possible for the Xbox One, there are a TON of Xbox 360 and OG Xbox titles that we still would like to see brought back. The announcement of Xbox One BC coming to a close at E3 2019 left
 a lot of Xbox fans disappointed, and this is VERY evident in the comment sections of articles and YouTube videos that covered this announcement. I understand that making older games backwards compatible on newer hardware is NOT an easy task by any means, especially
 when the aspect of licensing rights comes into the equation. Despite these challenges, Xbox One BC has proven to be a major success for Microsoft in terms of both profit for the company, and customer appreciation when compared to Xbox's competitors regarding
 the same topic. So, please consider bringing back the currently unavailable Xbox 360 and OG Xbox titles because there are many fan favorites (Max Payne 3 and MechAssault as examples) that we would like to play on Project Scarlett.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. This probably isn't a well known fact, but there are some currently available Xbox 360 (and possibly OG Xbox) backward compatible titles that are only available with the physical disk and NOT available for digital purchase. Some examples I personally
 have noticed are Doom 3 BFG Edition, Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X., and the recently added Battlefield 2: Modern Combat. There are many fans (like myself) who have moved on completely from physical copies of games and only purchase digital copies. I'm not sure why
 and even how this is an issue, considering that certain games that were released before the ones listed above are already able to be downloaded digitally. In any case, please revisit these and any other titles that currently cannot be purchased digitally and
 make them available in the Xbox Store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Please continue to provide enhancements for fan favorite backward compatible titles in the Project Scarlett generation, just like how many Xbox 360 and OG Xbox titles are currently Xbox One X Enhanced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>5. This final request is a long shot (figured I would ask it anyway), but it would be really nice to be able to play OG Xbox games over Xbox Live again. Certain games like the original Star Wars Battlefront and Battlefront 2 would be an absolute blast to
 revisit in online multiplayer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to read this extremely long post. I would love to hear feedback on this topic, so please post any questions, comments or concerns that you might have in the discussion thread and give this post an upvote if you agree with my
 requests. I hope that the BC team finds this post and considers implementing these requests into their plans for Project Scarlett.</p>

<p>Microsoft is basically ending backwards compatibility, at least making games backwards compatible either permanently or temporarily to actually focus on Project Scarlett. However, backwards compatibility may return by fan request and eventually once the
 system is out they'll get back to work on it. As it stands probably every game that is currently backwards compatible plus every single Xbox One game will be available to play on the new console. It will without a doubt have backwards compatibility support,
 probably at either a greater degree or some lesser extent with a skeleton crew putting out a few titles here and there.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's an article. They announced ending the BC at E3.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2019/microsoft-will-end-xbox-one-backward-compatibility-focus-project-scarlett/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.geekwire.com/2019/microsoft-will-end-xbox-one-backward-compatibility-focus-project-scarlett/</a></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Lockscreen Slideshow on multiple monitors</h2>
                    <p>Back before on 8.1 my lockscreen slideshow was showing on both of my monitors, but now it is only on the main monitor. I can't seem to find anywhere in the settings to change this.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know how to get the lockscreen slideshow in windows 10 to display on both monitors?</p>

<h2>            battery cannot be identified, system will be unable to charge battery</h2>
                    i have a dell laptop and it was running fine until the other day when unfortunately i let the battery run on when it was not plugged in . when i did try to plug it in at first it kept saying about the ati not working but windows had repaired it, then when
 i tried to shut down my computer a weird blue screen popped up with a bunch of white scribble. now every time i turn on my computer it says that the battery cannot be identified this system will be unable to charg this battery. then it says to push any key
 to start computer once i do that my computer runs fine. The battery shows a full charge of 100% but when i use it without it being plugged into the ac adapter&nbsp; for a while the battery drains faster and when i plug it back up the battery symbol says it is charging
 but the battery symbol usally shows it moving up and down while recharging and now it only does it for about five or six times then stops. Do I need a new battery or do i need my computer checked out ?

                    I was told my skype problem had been solved but it has not been solved. My old account is missing taken in the middle of a conversation. I was made to change passwords not only on my skype account and resign up for a new on but for my hotmail account which
 apparently no LONG EXISTS either. And no matter how many times I change my passwords when i go to sign in again it, whichever microsoft program I happen to be on, says it's not the right one when I know it is as I keep good records. I lost all my money with
 my account on skype and i lost a very good skype program instead of this horrible piece of junk that is new that i said i did not want in the first place yet you forced it on me. now what are you going to do? THIS PROBLEM IS NOT FIXED NO MATTER WHAT YOUR TECH
 GUY SAYS IT"S THE SAME AS IT WAS BEFORE&gt; I want to know why I can't get into hotmail anymore and why outlook sucks so bad and why everytime i try to sign in it wants a different password and it takes hours to get resigned b

            Sorry, these things upset me so bad. I'm disabled and can't walk and have no way to go anywhere and it's been days of this horrible mess. The thing just gives me tomfoolery over the passwords. It never accepts them. Every time I try to log into anything
 it says it isn't right then it has captchas that go on endlessly and I can't do them as I said I am disabled. If it weren't for knowing touch typing it'd be difficult to see to type. I finally got back some of my information on skype but I still don't have
 a clue what the password is. Every time I try to go on it won't accept my password and says that my Hotmail or Microsoft&nbsp;password isn't correct. I've had to change my google account, my home email accounts my Hotmail account and my facebook account and a few
 others because of this one thing. If I fix one by changing the password then they are all messed up all over again. I can't even shut down my computer because I'm afraid I will lose my account again and NEVER get it back. I do not lik

<h2>            My controller caught fire.</h2>
                    
<p>So I was playing COD and all the suddenly my character started spinning around and gun going crazy like I was holding down the trigger then the controller disconnected and a strong smell of burnt electronics and smoke started coming from the controller.
 This was a normal controller using the plug and play kit with the usb cable plugged into the xbox one. I was a little bummed my controller blew up but when I went to use my turtle beach xo seven pros on another controller I could not get it to work. Not sure
 if the controller took out the headphone dongle as well. Going to try to buy a new controller today to test but sucks as I am out the cost for the controller I dont trust the plug and play kit so a new plug and play kit and maybe a new xo seven pro headset.
 That is close to 233$&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Computer restarts suddenly without any reason</h2>
                    <p>* Original Title: Sudden Restarts </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've upgraded from Windows 7 Pro to 8 Pro 32-bit and after installation none of my USB ports worked. I took care of that by using the Refresh feature and now nearly everything is working fine and dandy. The problem now is that I've had my system restart
 suddenly for no apparent reason three times so far:<br />
<br />
1) Browsing the internet and between re-installing some software in desktop mode<br />
2) Upon coming back and logging in from the lockscreen. Start screen freezes up and it restarts.<br />
3) While browsing the internet and listening to music in desktop mode<br />
<br />
I checked around for what could be wrong it seems that one of the display devices is faulty<br />
<br />
&gt;Microsoft Basic Display Adapter - (Code 31)<br />
<br />
Could this be the problem and is there any other way to check for what might be causing this? My 64-bit 7 Pro also seems to have a faulty Generic VGA Display device, a code 10 IIRC.<br />
<br />
Specs:<br />
Acer Travelmate TimelineX 8472TG<br />
Intel Core i5-480M<br />
NVIDIA GeForce GT 330M<br />
Dual Boot: 7 Pro 64-bit &amp; 8 Pro 32-bit<br />

            <p><span>Hi Acht27,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for the post.<span>&nbsp;
</span>I am sorry to hear that the computer restarts suddenly without any reason.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I can imagine the inconvenience you have experienced. I will do my best to help you fix the issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Let’s try these methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1: Update the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter driver and check.</span></b></p>
<p><span>Download the latest drivers from the Manufacturer’s website and check.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The other way to find out the issue is clean boot. A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2: Perform clean boot and check.</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may perform a clean boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><span>a) Press the
<b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the
<b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click the
<b>‘Boot’</b> tab and uncheck <b>‘Safe Boot’</b> option.</span></p>
<p><span>d) On the
<b>‘General’</b> tab, click to select the option <b>‘Selective startup’</b>, and then click to clear the option
<b>Load startup items</b> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>e) On the
<b>‘Services’</b> tab, click to select the <b>‘Hide all Microsoft services’</b> check box, and then click
<b>‘Disable all’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>f) On the
<b>‘StartUp’</b> tab, click ‘<b>Open Task Manager’. </b>In the<b> Task Manager window
</b>under<b> startup tab, </b>right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘<b>Disable’.</b></span></p>
<p><span>g) Click
<b>‘OK’</b>, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a) Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Click the
<b>Services</b> tab, and then click to select the <b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click to select half of the check boxes in the
<b>Service</b> list.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Click
<b>OK</b>, and then click <b>Restart</b>.</span></p>
<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you
 originally selected in the <b>Service</b> list.</span></p>
<span>
<p><br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Service</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</p>
<p><br />
If only one service is selected in the <b>Service</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</p></span>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft
 service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you
 originally selected in the <b>Startup Item</b> list.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If only one startup item is selected in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem</span></b></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine
 whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 7:</span></b></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a) Press the
<b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the
<b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) On the
<b>‘General’</b> tab, click the <b>‘Normal Startup’</b> option, and then click <b>
‘OK’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click
<b>‘Restart’</b>.</span></p>

            Hi, thanks for the answer but it didn't help very much. I updated the display driver but it seems that it and Metro just don't get along as it left me with very buggy graphics so I just disabled that device.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the restarts continued to persist with no common link between what was causing them. I alternated between playing music, browsing the internet, transferring lots of files between external hard disks and just leaving it idle but the restarts just
 kept happening at random. <br />
<br />
I also checked the system log but the event 41s listed returned nil under all the error codes with no common event pattern preceding each one. Even when I disabled the automatic restart on system failure feature. No BSOD either, just a hard hang.<br />
<br />
It's definitely not a hardware issue either since I can use my windows 7 just fine without any restarts.<br />
