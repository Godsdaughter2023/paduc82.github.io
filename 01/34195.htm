There is some issue that I'm facing in Hyper-V manage. Whenever a make a new virtual machine, configure it and turn it on, I encounter this error:</p>

On another machine that I've tested, it works fine. Has someone faced this before? Is it because there's a problem with Windows installation? Any suggestions are welcomed.</p>

<h2>            Unable to send emails using Windows Live Mail</h2>
                    <p>I recently bought a new Dell laptop and downloaded Windows Essentials 2012 including Live Mail, which is what I really wanted. It installed OK but I can only receive emails. Live Mail will not let me send, reply to or forward emails. I've checked the outgoing
 server settings and all seems OK. Any ideas anyone? I've kept Live Mail 2011 running on my old laptop and it is still working OK.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Frequent BSOD after moving Windows 10 to SSD &#40;minidump files attached&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently moved Windows 10 installation of my Thinkpad L440 to a SSD. But after that I am having frequent BSOD. The BSOD happens without any explicit action within some intervals. To pinpoint what's causing this, I have done the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Ran Lenovo provided memtest which found no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Tried to run verifier. But after enabling that could not boot to my installation. So had to go safe mode and disable verifier.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentStandard">3. Ran 'chkdisk /f /r' but got no violations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here is the link of one minidump, MSinfo file and drivers list: <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/1e073suo51sdrol/dmp.zip?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
link to dropbox</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>For now I only have one minidump because during BSOD OS is not able to write minidump files.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any insight regarding the BSOD will be really appreciated.</p>

            That might be issue. Sometimes its best you just reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />You can try the following to see if it helps:
<br />
<br />		Power on and off your computer three times
<br />On the third time, your computer will boot into the Advanced Recovery environment
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />
<br />If not, boot into the recovery environment, then try performing a startup repair.
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

            No driver was named, so a slight possibility that it might be a hardware fault.
<br />Did Verifier generate any minidump?
<br />You might try sharing all the dumps you have to better analyze your issue.

<p>After enabling the verifier I could not boot into Windows, so I had disable it to boot. Right now I only have one minidump. I will upload other minidumps as soon as I have them.</p>

<br /> 
<br />There was no help at all in the minidump.
<br />
<br />Make sure you have the latest firmware for the SSD from its maker's site.
<br />
<br />Be sure the drive is inserted tight and secure.
<br />
<br />If possible it might be worthwhile putting the old drive back in to see if the problem remains. Especially since it is a new computer. If the issue is still present contact Lenovo Support.

            Hi Protik.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />How exactly did you clone the old install to the SSD?  After cloning did you remove the old drive and set the new one first in Boot Priority in BIOS setup, or if you have UEFI did you make sure Windows Boot Manager remains set first to boot?
<br />
<br />If it's Legacy BIOS then you must make sure the System Reserved partition was cloned, too, and it remains marked Active.  <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/71432-partition-mark-active.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/71432-part...</a>
<br />
<br />Then run Startup Repair from the booted media or Repair disk.   
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered, then on second screen choose Repair Your Computer. then Advanced Troubleshoot options, then Startup repair.  
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<h2>            DVD drivers</h2>
                    <p>Updated to Windows 8.1 from Windows 8 (from Windows 7 - big mistake). With 8.1 upgrade, the driver for the CD/DVD that came with our Gateway (ASUS?) Model DX-4831 did not move with the upgrade. I need to download the driver so I can carry on. Would ultimate
 upgrade to Windows 10 fix all of this and Internet Explorer 11 as well? Please help.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've just upgraded to Windows7 and while the rest of the installation went fine, my 2 DVD drives are not installed properly and both give me this message:</p>
<p><em>Windows cannot load the device driver for this hardware. The driver may be corrupted or missing. (Code 39)</em></p>
<p>Now I've downloaded the firmware from Dell but when trying to run the executable files, I get an error message saying that the device needs to be present before installing the driver. Is there any way I can get the driver on its own to try and install it
 manually?</p>
<p>Would appreciate your help.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Fotis</p>

<p>These steps, to remove the UpperFilters and LowerFilters values, if they exist, at the named registry key may help.</p>

<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 128, 0, 1)">Exactly. People always preferred the normal slow zombies to the enemies we have now. And with Resi 5 especially there were loads of complaints about not being able
 to move and shoot. Now Opp Raccoon City is doing what they fans asked for..Zombies and move and shoot, and still they moan.
<br />
<br />
I've played Opp Raccoon city and let me tell you, it's amazing. Such a good game. You'd think that the style it is would be easy against slow zombies, but it was very easy to get over run (was playing 4 player co-op) Can't wait for the game and I'm hoping that
 they do some sort of collectors edition, as like you REfanboy, I'm a HUGE fan of the series. Resi 2 will always be my favourite though.

<p>No brothers or sisters here so lack of split screen won't be a big deal breaker but one day... when the 360 is a dinosaur in the game console world and the servers for ORC are no longer up and running I may want to play it again, and if I wanted to share
 it with a friend I would be very sad to see that I can't. </p>
<p>Of course by then we'll have emulators and roms to take care of that I'm sure. For now, can't wait for this game ^^</p>

    <title>Re-Activating Windows 10 after major hardware replacement - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Re-Activating Windows 10 after major hardware replacement</h2>
                    <p>For a while now, I've been having issues with my system where while trying to boot it loads for a little while (into the windows loading screen) and then the screen stops displaying, all activity stops, and a loud constant beep starts till i turn off the
 system. This usually only happens after the system has been on and has warmed up. When starting it after a long rest i was able to get into windows and use it for a while. This issue isn't caused by windows as it happens while i am in the bios settings as
 well, and isn't caused by the power supply as i have recently replace it. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, because of this issue, i have not been able to install the anniversary update (requires a restart, where it then errors again while attempting to install the update) so I have not been able to link my license to my windows account.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Last week my 18 month old son decided it would be fun to poke the restart button on my system and now no matter what i do i cant get into windows as windows repair wants to scan the disk, and it ALWAYS errors at 15% (does the freeze and beep). Because of
 this i am looking into replacing the Motherboard, cpu, and ram. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Because of the major hardware change i know i will have to do a fresh install of windows, and with the change of hardware windows wont activate. Is there anything I can do to get my windows 10 to activate, or will I have to spend hours on the phone with
 Microsoft? </p>
<p>
</p><p>OR, is there any way to get my system to NOT load the repair so I can attempt to get into windows to use sysprep to remove all drivers before replacing the hardware? I plan on doing a fresh install later no matter what, but would prefer to activate windows
 with the same HDD to have all the info I need before hand.</p>

<p>It depends on the type of Windows license you originally upgraded from.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM license </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the Windows 10&nbsp;end user license agreement:</em></p>
<span>
<p><strong>b. Stand-alone software.</strong> If you acquired the software as stand-alone software (and also if you upgraded from software you acquired as stand-alone software), you may transfer the software to another device that belongs to you. You may also
 transfer the software to a device owned by someone else if (i) you are the first licensed user of the software and (ii) the new user agrees to the terms of this agreement. You may use the backup copy we allow you to make or the media that the software came
 on to transfer the software. Every time you transfer the software to a new device, you must remove the software from the prior device. You may not transfer the software to share licenses between devices.</p>

            <p>Hello Wright,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community and welcome to the Windows 10 Family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From the description provided, I understand that you want to remove particular Wifi networks from the list of saved networks on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you find yourself on a network profile already created, you may&nbsp;expect Windows to&nbsp;connect to it automatically.&nbsp; Removing the profile for this network is the best way to make Windows forget the network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow&nbsp;any of the below&nbsp;alternates&nbsp;to remove the network profile. Use any of the below alternative ways in order to remove the network profile.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Alternative 1</span>:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Open the list of available networks. Locate the network name on the list and right-click or press and hold on it. Click or tap
<em>“Forget this network"</em> to delete the profile from your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Alternative 2</span>:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Press <strong><span>Windows key + X</span></strong>, select
<strong><span>Command prompt (Admin)</span></strong> to bring up elevated Command prompt.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">In Command prompt type the following&nbsp;</span></p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; netsh wlan delete profile name="<strong>WirelessProfileName</strong>"</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WirelessProfileName </strong>is the name of the network you want to delete.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>After you delete the profile, reconnect&nbsp;and reconfigure&nbsp;the network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the above information is helpful. If you need further information, feel free to write to us and we would be happy to ghelp you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank You.</p>

                    <p>Sorry if this was stated somewhere but I&nbsp;looked everywhere and can't find any answers.&nbsp;</p><p>I really want this game, but I prefer to have it on PC and it seems like it'll be a while until it launches. It says it is available on Microsoft Store alongside Xbox and PlayStation, so I'm guessing that means it won't be on steam or any PC&nbsp;vendors. If I buy it on the Xbox, will I have to rebuy it later for the PC.</p>

<h2>            Diagnostic Policy Service Causing Windows 7 to Lag after Startup</h2>
                    <p>About 3 weeks ago (either March 2 or March 3) my laptop started to lag/freeze after startup (after logging in). It would lag very badly, even freeze, for about 5 minutes, then everything will go back to normal speed (which is not new-laptop fast but not
 slow either).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It runs normal in Safe Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I started eliminating the responsible program using msconfig, disabling and enabling startup programs and services, and found that if I disabled "<strong>Diagnostic Policy Service</strong>", the startup time would be normal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Inter Core i3-2310M CPU @ 2.10 Ghz</p>
<p>4.00 GB RAM</p>
<p>Laptop was bought [new] in 2011</p>
<p>
</p><p>If my memory serves me right, I did not install or update anything else other than those mentioned above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The only significant change I can think of is that on the night of March 1, I started using a new laptop adapter. Would that have an effect on my laptop performance?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, any idea why the Diagnostic Policy Service would be causing such severe lagging? Or is there something else that's causing the lagging?</p>
<p>

            <p>Have you uninstalled Soluto?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The contents of&nbsp; Windows 7 Upgrade Advisor report&nbsp;make a number of helpful suggestions. Your version of cCleaner is historic and should be updated. Investigate all free updates. Updating Cisco software could be helpful:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Cisco AnyConnect VPN Client version 2.5.1025</span></p>
<p><span>Cisco Systems, Inc. Free update available We don't have compatibility information about this version of the program. Get a free update to a compatible version
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We removed Releases 2.5.2001 and 2.5.1025 from the AnyConnect Software Download page because they have a regression issue with VPN load balancing (CSCtk01166). If you are running one of these releases in a VPN load balancing
 environment, we strongly recommend upgrading.:<br />

            <p>Dear Gerry,<br />
<br />
Many apologies for a very late response.<br />
<br />
I've deleted the entries on Autoruns saying "file not found".<br />
<br />
Do I need to disable my antivirus (Avast) when running ADWCleaner?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done Disk CleanUp and deleted Service Pack BackUp Files and Windows Update CleanUp.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm using the disk defragmenter provided by Windows. It was last run on March 20, and 2% of Local Drive C and 1% of Local Drive E are fragmented. For System, defrag was last run on Feb 27, with 0% fragmented.<br />
<br />
Task Manager - Memory Use<br />
Hardware reserved 53 MB<br />
In use 2265 MB<br />
Modified 41 MB<br />
Standby 1720 MB&nbsp;<br />
Free 15 MB<br />
<br />
Could you tell me what this means?<br />
<br />
I can't save the Diagnostics Performance Operational log. It says "The request could not be performed because of an I/O device error (1117)."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best,</p>

    <title>Missing items in my microsoft &#47; xbox account - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kalamity james  say:</h3>
<h2>            Missing items in my microsoft &#47; xbox account</h2>
                    
<p>I am a long time member of xbox live, if I look in my xbox live purchases on the xbox website I can see items in it that do not appear in my microsoft account purchase history. The issue is I want to download and play Undead Nightmare collection. If I look
 in my xbox live purchase history I can see it there along with large amounts of previously downloaded DLC content, however on xbox one marketplace / microsoft it does not have any purchase history for me before 2011.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I previously bought Red dead redemption limited edition pack, I then rebought it through the marketplace last month &nbsp;(I was too lazy to go rooting through my box of 360 items in the attic!). I have neared the end of RDR and wanted to play undead nightmare
 but due to this error between the two accounts I am unable to download undead nightmare collection without having to buy it again.</p>
<p>Is there some way to reconcile the two lists together so that my previously purchased items all register to me?&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Are you signing in with the same account on Xbox One and here on the website?</p>
<p>If not, sign in on Xbox One with the account you used to buy the content and you should be able to see it.</p>
<p>If you are using the same account, on the Xbox One, go to My Games &amp; Apps and highlight RDR and press the View button (two overlapping squares) and select Manage Game. Under Ready to Install on this new page, do you see RDR DLC? If so, hit Install All at the top of the page and it will all begin downloading.</p>
<p>For a visualisation of that last step, finding the DLC for a game, watch this video:</p>

<p>Yes, I'm singing in with the same account details. Looking at that video it seems like it may solve the issue which I will give a try in a few hours time, I did check the whole manage games tab on the homescreen and everything else but it didnt show, so
 this workaround looks like it might work, so thanks for the fresh lead!</p>

<p>Just tried now and it doesnt work, I tried the workaround via the inbuilt marketplace as per the video but none of my extras show as purchased (it is also asking me to rebuy the warhore, golden guns and other items I also own). It is worth mentioning that
 when I follow the link in my profile for undead nightmare collection I get a microsoft error saying "this page has moved"</p>

            <p>Hey kalamity james,</p>
<p>That forum post is in regards to an issue where content that was already owned (and showed as owned) wasn't popping up in the 'Ready to install' list correctly, which has been resolved. This one might need to be treated as a separate issue.</p>
<p>If you're unable to install the content, and you're prompted to purchase it again, that would indicate that the account you're checking with may not own the Undead Nightmare.</p>
<p>Could you check both <a href="https://account.xbox.com/MyGames/Xbox360" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">My Games on Xbox.com</a> as well as <a href="https://commerce.microsoft.com/PaymentHub" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Microsoft Commerce</a> to see if the content shows up there? If it shows up, could you screenshot it and link us to the photo from OneDrive or any other image hosting page? If it doesn't show up, the next step will be to contact our chat or phone support team so they can take a look in your account and help verify which licenses you own. You can reach them through our <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us#4:0:0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Us</a> page.</p>
<p>That will help us a bunch!</p>

            <p>Interesting. Thanks for the screenshot! That helps a lot.</p>
<p>We have seen some issues where purchase history isn't showing the full history, however the My Games page is an accurate representation of what you own (minus some newer content, and we're working on getting that resolved).</p>
<p>As Mister Beep said, the issue of it not showing up in the Manage Game section of RDR has been resolved. I'm not really sure why it's not showing up for you in this case. I would suggest a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">factory reset</a>, but keeping your games and apps. This is called a console restore, and should trigger your console to realize that the content is there. It will remove your profiles, but your game content should not be touched (saves and such should be fine, as well).</p>
<p>Let us know how that goes! We for sure want to help you out and make sure the content you own is playable as designed. :)</p>

<p>I've been to the support chat, but the agents there just seem to not be able to solve, and they keep saying it's a temporary glitch, and they even said that ''Only users who have xbox live gold can log into xbox live''... That is incorrect of course, you

    <title>COA key has faded - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> franasher  say:</h3>
<h2>            COA key has faded</h2>
                    I I bought a HP laptop with Windows 7 Home Premium preinstalled.&nbsp; I had to do a reinstal to factory settings a month ago &amp; am unable to activate because I can't read the Product Key as it has faded.<br />
I've spent a week talking to HP with no success.&nbsp; The told me to do a complete reinstall again or use a key finder program, which totally frustrated me as they should know that would only generate a default key that can't be used for activation,
<br />
I would like to know what I can do about this, as I've been going around in circles between HP &amp; Microsoft &amp; not getting any answers.<br />
Please help<br />
Thank you,<br />

<h2>            External keyboard on Samsung notebook works fine but a few keys on built-in keyboard no longer work - Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit</h2>
                    For ergonomical reasons, I plugged in a Microsoft Natural Keyboard Pro into a Samsung RV520 notebook with Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit. I downloaded and installed the driver, following the workaround provided on&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.blogfeld.com/2009/11/natural-keyboard-pro-windows-7-vista.html?showComment=1324439231793#c1984030764272241050" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

 The built-in keyboard still basically works, but a few keys don't, notably fn+up/down to adjust brightness. At least some of the fn+ combinations work, but those corresponding to keys absent on the Microsoft keyboard don't (brightness, wifi on/off, perhaps
 a few more).<br />
<br />
What can I do to make the built-in keyboard work correctly again?<br />
<br />
Both keyboards are Danish layout. The Microsoft keyboard doesn't have the fn keys.

            Hi Job,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for your suggestions. I'll try them if possible. I'm also waiting for a reply from Samsung support.</div>
<div><br />
<div>1. Changes: it's an almost new laptop, so yes, plenty of software installs, but the external keyboard addition is the latest, nothing changed since. There were no problems before adding the keyboard.</div>
<div><br />
<div>2. No error messages.</div>
<div><br />
<div>3. Basically, all the keys on both keyboards seem to work, except a few. The fn+... are the only ones I've noted don't all work so far. Some of them do, for example volume up/down, probably since that is also supported by the external keyboard driver.
 It seems to be the built-in keyboard key functions (in blue) not found on the external keyboard that don't work. fn+brightness up seems to work like ctrl+z, as it is capable of moving a file back to a previous location in Windows Explorer after a cut and poaste.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I'll try to paste the solution here if I find it.</div>
        </p>

            Ok, the first Samsung link explains that if one has installed a Microsoft keyboard, then the Microsoft IntelliType or IntelliType Pro may interfere with the operation of function keys. To solve the problem, one should end the program in task manager and
 remove it.
<div><br />
<div>Once I ended the task, the function keys started working again. Most of the special keys on the MS keyboard still work, though, except volume up/down, but that's not important.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If I remove IntelliType completely, will the special keys still work after next boot? Apparently, it doesn't need to run for the keyboard to work, but I don't know if it does anything at boot to set up these keys. I think it is needed to reconfigure the
 keys, but what does it do once started and running?</div>
<div><br />
<div>Maybe if I could set up an automatic way to shut down IntelliType a couple of minutes after boot, it would solve the problem. Just don't know how.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Any links to find out precisely what IntelliType does and doesn't would be helpful.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It would be helpful if IntelliType warned about such interference before or during installation.</div>

            The customized MS keys no longer work with itype.exe stopped, e.g. 'My Computer' set to open a specific folder. It just opens 'my computer'. Some standard keys like Calculator still work.
<div><br />
<div>This is a mess. Plugging in an external keyboard is not uncommon on a laptop for ergonomical reasons. It shouldn't be so complicated to make it work. One wonders if the system design is adequate for this.</div>

            Hi Finn,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Thank you for posting the work around for this issue. Microsoft IntelliPoint is the Microsoft brand driver for Microsoft's IntelliMouse series of mice. Microsoft has released versions for both Windows and Mac OS X (including Universal binaries). IntelliPoint
 supports all known Microsoft mice, as well as generic 3/5-button mice. However, advanced features may only be available for the accordant models (button options shown are specific to the selected model). Users can define mouse buttons to run any executable
 program or file they desire (or a control key + letter combination), and can even define them for different functions in chosen programs.<br />
If you stop the IntelliPoint services, special keys like multi-media keys will not work but at the same time basic key will work.<br />

            Hi Job, thanks for your comments, but you somehow got sidetracked into mice, whereas this is all about keyboards and IntelliType, not IntelliMouse.
<div><br />
<div>My first problem was to get the MS Natural Keyboard Pro driver (thus IntelliType Pro) installed on Windows 7, since MS had pulled support after XP for unknown reasons (very disappointing btw). A solution was found on blogfeld.com as initially mentioned.
 The solution is so simple that having removed support can hardly be explained by technical reasons but rather by an attempt to try to force users to buy new keyboards after MS has made the old ones, still in good condition, stop working by the lack of a driver.
 Such behaviour is not very flattering for MS. The thing is, I and many others resist buying if coerced by such manoevers. I'd rather buy if there is a feature I really like.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The second problem was the interference with the fn key functions.Stopping the itype.exe task stops the problem but makes a few functions of the MS keyboard unavailable.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I guess system design makes it impossible to properly separate the handling of two keyboards. I've noticed a similar issue with mouse drivers when one plugs an external trackball into a laptop. One can only hope for future improvements in this area. Laptops
 have been around for many years now, and it is not unknown that many people want or need to plug in external mice, keyboards or monitors for a number of reasons, not least ergonomy, to prevent RSI and other strain. The present handling, where the two devices
 are somehow mixed up, seem inadequate to me in 2011.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Is there a simple way to make itype.exe stop starting up at boot without removing it? I seem to remember that if I untick it in msconfig, I'll get messages about a changed configuration ever after.</div>

            Just fyi, Samsung support is utterly useless. Their first reply was to reinstall the keyboard driver. Duh. They didn't even look into the problem.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>The second reply, translated from Danish, 'This sounds like a Windows problem. We suggest you contact Microsoft support about this'. In other words, they can't be bothered.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I thought support for pre-installed Windows was the responsibility of the hardware provider.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The question remains, is it impossible to make this work because of Windows design or because of poorly written keboard software either by Samsung or Microsoft?</div>
