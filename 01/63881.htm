            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Are you using an external mouse or the touchpad?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does this issue occur when you access a particular program or when you’re on the desktop?</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b><span> Follow
 these steps and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:
</span></b><span>Try to boot into safe mode and check if the issue persists. Refer the following link to boot the computer in safe mode.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Start-your-computer-in-safe-mode</span></a></p>
<p><b><span>Step 2:</span></b><span> If the issue
 does not occur in safe mode then, start the computer in clean boot to check if any third party program is causing the issue. To configure your computer to clean boot refer the following link.</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p><span>Note: After you have finished troubleshooting, follow step 7 in the article to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:
</span></b><span>If the above steps did not help then, update the mouse/ touchpad drivers and check if the issue persists. Follow the steps provided in the following link to update
 the mouse driver.</span></p>
<p><b><span>‘Update a driver for hardware that isn't working properly’</span></b></p>

<p>
<b><span>Method 3:</span></b><span> I would also suggest you to run a full system scan using Microsoft Security Scanner and check
 if the computer is infected with virus.</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Pro 1511 Update results in unable to open some bitmap image &#40;.bmp&#41; files... .. .</h2>
                    <p>Pre 1511 no problem with these files which are extensively used in Microsoft's Flight Simulator X, which is now unplayable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This occurs with all NVidia GeForce WHQL Windows 10&nbsp;64bit&nbsp;approved drivers for the GTC 560Ti graphic adapters.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft Answer Tech claims this is an NVidia problem, but the NVidia drivers all worked properly prior to the 1511 update, and all the NVidia drivers are WHQL approved by Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The tech claims because the files are readable when using Microsoft's driver for the graphic adapters, it is an NVidia problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem is still here after today's KB3214200 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 1511 for x64-based Systems.<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/edb79258-c43b-4567-bf15-bcb73b3372d6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/edb79258-c43b-4567-bf15-bcb73b3372d6" /></a>Try
 to open one of these files and you get this...</p>

 is what you get with Microsoft's Flight Simulator X...</p>

<p>1st: This is NOT and FSX issue, it is an issue with Windows 10 1511</p>
<p>
</p><p>2nd: It involves Windows 10 open a .bmp graphics file, which happened regularlly before the 1511 "upgrade"</p>
<p>
</p><p>3rd I find your reply unhelpful and evasive.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 upgrade error C1900101&#61;3001A from W8.2</h2>
                    <p>Every time I try to upgrade, it reverts to 8.1 and gives me the above error message with is not document on Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you go into windows update history and get more information it says the error number and something to the effect of "click here to find out more about the problem.&nbsp; Unfortunately that page brings up 1 Microsoft and 0 Asus items but you can't click on
 the Microsoft one to "learn more"&nbsp; Asus isn't sure.&nbsp; I have done over a dozen google searches on the whole error number, the first part and the whole thing without the hyphen.&nbsp;&nbsp; No listings anywhere.&nbsp; Trying the same thing on MS site yields 0.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else get this one and found a fix.&nbsp; Cane someone point me to a document or suggested next steps to fix this.&nbsp; 3 times in a row, same issue.</p>

 on my 4th attempt here and see if anything happens...

 work. &nbsp;:( &nbsp;</p>

    <title>Constant Interrupt_Exception_Not_Handled blue screen restart - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> durch881  say:</h3>
<h2>            Constant Interrupt_Exception_Not_Handled blue screen restart</h2>
                    I have a home built PC Which ran fine with random blue screens here and there for about a year. Recently I noticed that the RAM was installed incorrectly meaning two ram sticks equalling 8gb total were in two different color channels. I ran the windows
 memory check and it said that the memory was corrupted one time then never again. I replaced the RAM stick into the corresponding channel of the other stick and the comp ran okay for 3 days then started to blue screen again. I then uninstalled one of the RAM
 sticks and the comp ran perfectly for 2 weeks no blue screens. 2 days ago after a proper windows shutdown I turn on the comp and it blue screens with interrupt exception not handled error after 30 seconds with nothing except the normal background programs
 running. Now the comp does this every time I turn it on approximately 25 to 30 seconds after I log into windows it will crash with the same error same addresses. I tried switching RAM sticks, one stick in a channel, the other in the same channel, then tested
 again in different channels still same error. Safe mode does work and sfc scan indicated no invalid files. chkdsk also indicate okay memory. I have no idea what happened. I tried to access the memory dumps to display on skydrive but the comp crashes too quickly.

            We do need the DMP file as it contains the only record of the sequence of events leading up to the crash, what drivers were loaded, and what was responsible.<br />
<br />
If you are overclocking STOP<br />
<br />
You may be able to get the DMP files without crashing by booting into safe mode (F8) with networking.<br />
<br />
Please follow these instructions to collect data from the crashes and upload them here, to your Skydrive or a file sharing service like Rapidshare.<br />

<br />
<br />If your Windows 10 installation is demonstrating unusual behavior such as built in apps not working or launching, you can perform a repair upgrade to fix the problem. A repair upgrade is the process of installing Windows 10 over the existing installation of Windows 10 on your hard disk, using your installation DVD or ISO file. Performing this can repair broken operating system files while preserving your personal files, settings and installed applications.
<br />
<br />The first thing you will need to do is download the latest .ISO file available for Windows 10.
<br />
<br />How to download official Windows 10 ISO files 
<br />		<a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-download-official-windows-10-iso-files/35cde7ec-5b6f-481c-a02d-dadf465df326">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Starting the installation
<br />
<br />When you download the .ISO file, you can start the upgrade immediately by simply double clicking the .ISO file to mount it. If you are running Windows 8/8.1 and plan to upgrade your operating system, you can also use this method. Windows 7 and earlier will need to prepare install media. If you prefer to prepare installation media and start the installation from that, review the following article (see section Download and prepare .ISO file):
<br />
<br />Here I have my .ISO file downloaded and mounted. All I need to do is double click setup to begin the installation.
<br />
<br />Windows is preparing setup.
<br />
<br />Read and accept the Windows License terms then click Accept
<br />
<br />If you see this screen and it goes by really quick, don't worry, you will get a chance when its dones configuring to choose what you want to keep.
<br />
<br />Windows 10 doing additional configurations.
<br />
<br />At the 'Ready to install' screen you are presented with a summer which includes the task to be completed:
<br />
<br />- Install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />- Keep Windows Settings, personal files and apps
<br />
<br />Click Change what to keep make any necessary adjustments.
<br />
<br />Once satisfied, click Install
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will then change to full screen, wait while setup installs. Your computer will be restarted automatically.
<br />
<br />
<br />After restarting, Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the indicater, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Here you are presented with the new setup experience that provides a spherical progress indicator of the installation process. When complete, you will see the Getting ready notification appear on screen. As noted, your computer will restart during this phase of setup.
<br />
<br />Sign into your account and click Next
<br />
<br />ImageHere you are preseted with the Out of Box Experience. The Out of Box Experience page is where you get to configure detailed settings in Windows, which includes creating a user account, privacy, sync PC settings and install modern applications. For the purposes of this article, I will choose Use express settings
<br />
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows finalizes your settings
<br />
<br />Continue to wait while Windows installs modern applications.
<br />
<br />Sign in if prompted
<br />
<br />Thats it! You have successfully completed a repair upgrade.
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + R
<br />
<br />Type: winver
<br />
<br />Hit Enter on your keyboard to verify the build number
<br />
<br />You can also see this in the build number on the desktop

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Were there any recent changes made to your computer prior to the issue? (Windows update, software or hardware installation, etc.)</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>While it is likely you already have the most recent driver for your keyboard after a Windows update, if you're having trouble with a device, you can try fixing it by&nbsp;updating the drivers or reinstalling them. Here's how:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Open Devices and Printers by clicking the <strong>Start </strong>button, and the, on the Start menu, clicking
<strong>Devices and Printers</strong>. </p>
<p>2. Right-click the name of your computer, and then click <strong>Device installation settings</strong>.</p>
<p>3. <span>Click <strong>Yes</strong>, <strong>do this automatically (recommended)</strong>, and then click
<strong>Save changes</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.
</span><span>If <strong>Yes </strong>is already selected, click <strong>Cancel </strong>
to close the dialog box.</span></p>
<p>4. Verify if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It is best to let Windows install drivers automatically. Occasionally, Windows might not be able to find a driver for your device. If this happens, you might want to check the
<strong>manufacturer's website</strong> for a driver or update for your device, or try installing any software that came with the device.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If updating your device driver didn't help, we suggest contacting the manufacturer of your device for further assistance.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly update us on your progress.</p>

What does Razer support have to say?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>*********************************************Razer Support FAQ**************************</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>My Razer keyboard is out of warranty. Is there any way it can be repaired?</strong><br />
Razer products are designed to work well beyond when the warranty has expired. However, If you feel your keyboard is having issues we first suggest trying the keyboard on another computer to insure the issue is with the keyboard and not something within the
 computer system. If you have narrowed the issue to the keyboard itself there is not really a cost effective repair center that would be able to assist you. Razer does make available some basic external spare parts at http://www.razerzone.com/store/gaming-accessories
 , but we are unable to supply any internal parts or repair guides.<br />
</p>
<p>It is rare, but a light shot of air from a can of compressed air can sometime free debris that may be causing an issue.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>How can I contact Razer?</strong><br />
If you were unable to find the answer to your question(s) in our FAQ, please don’t hesitate to contact us here or call 1-888-697-2037.<br />
</p>
<p><strong>I think my Razer product is defective and would like an RMA/exchange.</strong><br />
If you were unable to troubleshoot and resolve any issues you are having with the knowledgebase (FAQ) and you feel your product is still defective, please don’t hesitate to contact us here or call 1-888-697-2037.<br />

            Hi Marc.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />I would press and hold the power button to shut it down.  Wait 30 minutes for it to cool then start it up to see if it rolls back or finishes.  
<br />
<br />If not then Create Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC:    <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>

<br />Do the vastly superior  Clean Install Windows 10 following the steps in this link to delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>

<br />There is a step to Rescue Files from the booted media Command Prompt first:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br /> 
<br />An alternative is to run Factory Recovery from it’s  hotkey at boot; find yours by googling the “PC make/model + Run Factory Recovery.”    But keep in mind the Factory install is greatly inferior to a Clean Install, a Reset or a Refresh without the crippling factory bloatware.    After Recovery mitigate the inferior factory install with the Checklist steps from earlier.

            Check to ensure there is disk activity (look at the hard disk LED light to confirm. If there is, keep waiting. If setup goes beyond 2 to 3 hours, try the following steps.
<br />Power down the computer. Unplug it, then wait 20 seconds.
<br />If you are using a laptop, remove the battery if the option is available.
<br />Disconnect it from the Internet (unplug Ethernet and/or turn off Wi-Fi).
<br />Plug it again, ensure it remains disconnected from the Internet then start computer.
<br />See if it completes setup.
<br />If setup completes and you see the desktop with the ability to click Start and launch programs, proceed to reconnect to the Internet.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
</b></span><br />
<br />
<u><b>If you don't know where DMP files are located, here's how to get to them:</b></u><br />
<br />
&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Navigate to the %systemroot%\Minidump folder.<br />
&nbsp;2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Copy any and all DMP files in the Minidump folder to your Desktop and then zip up these files.<br />
&nbsp;3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Upload the zip containing the DMP files to Skydrive or a hosting site of your choice and paste in your reply.<br />
<br />
<u><b>If you are going to use Skydrive but don't know how to upload to it, please visit the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Use-SkyDrive</a><br />
<br />
<b>Please note that any "cleaner" programs such as TuneUp Utilities, CCleaner, etc, by default will delete DMP files upon use.</b><br />
<br />
<u><b>If your computer is not generating DMP files, please do the following:</b></u><br />
<br />
1. Start &gt; type %systemroot% which should show the Windows folder, click on it. Once inside that folder, ensure there is a Minidump folder created. If not, CTRL-SHIFT-N to make a New Folder and name it Minidump.<br />
<br />
2. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Performance &gt; Settings &gt; Advanced &gt; Ensure there's a check-mark for 'Automatically manage paging file size for all drives'.<br />
<br />
3. Windows key + Pause key. This should bring up System. Click Advanced System Settings on the left &gt; Advanced &gt; Startup and Recovery &gt; Settings &gt; System Failure &gt; ensure there is a check mark next to 'Write an event to the system log'.
<br />
<br />
Ensure Small Memory Dump is selected and ensure the path is %systemroot%\Minidump.<br />
<br />
4. Double check that the WERS is ENABLED:<br />
<br />
Start &gt; Search &gt; type services.msc &gt; Under the name tab, find Windows Error Reporting Service &gt; If the status of the service is not Started then right click it and select Start. Also ensure that under Startup Type it is set to Automatic rather than Manual.
 You can do this by right clicking it, selecting properties, and under General selecting startup type to 'Automatic', and then click Apply.
<br />
<br />
<br />

The main causes of this issue are the video drivers, memory,&nbsp;or the&nbsp;game. Contact the&nbsp;maker<br />

<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</strong><br />
<br />
Have you updated your display/video or other major drivers lately - check in Control Panel -<br />
Windows Updates to see if a driver has been loaded there. Use the generic troubleshooter below<br />
and when you get to the driver section use the methods in the next message and then return to<br />
the troubleshooter as needed. In rare cases the antivirus/antispyware/security programs can<br />
cause this error.<br />
<br />
Also check with System Maker and Video/Display adapter's&nbsp;Support as there could be known<br />
issues -&nbsp;also check in their forums.<br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode : 116&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x00000116<br />
<br />
Bug Check 0x116: VIDEO_TDR_ERROR<br />
</strong><br />
</p>
<p>The VIDEO_TDR_ ERROR bug check has a value of 0x00000116. This indicates that an attempt to reset the display driver and recover from a timeout failed.
<br />
</p>
<strong>Important Info If You Have Received a STOP Code <br />
</strong><br />
<p>If you received a blue screen error, or stop code, the computer has shut down abruptly to protect itself from data loss. A hardware device, its driver, or related software might have caused this error. If your copy of Windows came with your computer, call
 the manufacturer of your computer. If you purchased Windows separately from your computer, Microsoft provides support. To find contact info for Microsoft or your computer manufacturer,
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Contact Support</a>.<br />
</p>
<p>If you have experience with computers and want to try to recover from this error, follow the steps provided in the Microsoft article
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=183646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Resolving STOP (Blue Screen) Errors in Windows</a>.</p>
<p>These actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.
</li><li>Scan your computer for computer viruses. </li><li>Check your hard disk for errors.</li></ol>
VIDEO_TDR_ERROR Parameters <br />

The inclusion of the 116 error code in the troubleshooter is only coincidence and holds no<br />
specific meaning (other than driver caused bluescreens do occur with some frequency).<br />
<br />
Look in the Event Viewer to see if anything is reported about those.<br />

Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi, <br />
<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7. <br />
<br />
</strong>This is my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update video driver and BIOS).<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : <br />
<br />
DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click
<br />
Update Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right
<br />
Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack. <br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have. <br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset and software updates at System Maker's site while there.) <br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation. <br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed. <br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a><br />
<br />
Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (manually updating using the methods above are<br />
preferred to ensure the latest updated versions of the drivers are found at the system maker<br />
and device maker's sites)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually<br />
be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it)<br />
and then go look for new ones manually if you wish. <br />

<strong>Memory issues are NOT usually the cause of this Bug_Check though it is possible.<br />
</strong><br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for
<br />
sticks that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind
<br />
slower memory. So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all<br />
memory tests fail to show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<br />
The attached DMP file is of the <b>VIDEO_TDR_FAILURE (116)</b> bugcheck.<br />
<br />
<i>(Ensure you have the latest video card drivers. If you are already on the latest video card drivers, uninstall and install a version or a few versions behind the latest to ensure it's not a latest driver only issue. If you have already experimented with
 the latest video card driver and many previous versions, please give the beta driver for your card a try.)</i><br />
<br />
<u><b>The basic definition of a 0x116 bugcheck is:</b></u><br />
<blockquote><br />
<i>There may be a bug in the video driver or video hardware.</i></blockquote>
So, let me now explain what VIDEO_TDR_ERROR means. First off, TDR is an acronym for
<i><b>'Timeout Detection and Recovery'</b></i>. Timeout Detection and Recovery was introduced in Vista and carried over to Windows 7. Rather than putting exactly what Timeout Detection and Recovery does exactly, I'll just directly quote the MSDN article!<br />
<br />
<blockquote><b>Timeout detection:</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>The GPU scheduler, which is part of the DirectX graphics kernel subsystem (<i>Dxgkrnl.sys</i>), detects that the GPU is taking more than the permitted amount of time to execute a particular task. The GPU scheduler then tries to
 preempt this particular task. The preempt operation has a "wait" timeout, which is the actual TDR timeout. This step is thus the timeout detection phase of the process. The default timeout period in Windows Vista and later operating systems is 2 seconds. If
 the GPU cannot complete or preempt the current task within the TDR timeout period, the operating system diagnoses that the GPU is frozen.
</i><br />
</blockquote>
<blockquote><i>To prevent timeout detection from occurring, hardware vendors should ensure that graphics operations (that is, DMA buffer completion) take no more than 2 seconds in end-user scenarios such as productivity and game play.
</i></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Preparation for recovery:</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>The operating system's GPU scheduler calls the display miniport driver's
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff559815%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<b>DxgkDdiResetFromTimeout</b></a> function to inform the driver that the operating system detected a timeout. The driver must then reinitialize itself and reset the GPU. In addition, the driver must stop accessing memory and should not access hardware. The
 operating system and the driver collect hardware and other state information that could be useful for post-mortem diagnosis.&nbsp;
</i></blockquote>
<blockquote><b>Desktop recovery:</b></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>The operating system resets the appropriate state of the graphics stack. The video memory manager, which is also part of
<i>Dxgkrnl.sys</i>, purges all allocations from video memory. The display miniport driver resets the GPU hardware state. The graphics stack takes the final actions and restores the desktop to the responsive state. As previously mentioned, some legacy DirectX
 applications might render just black at the end of this recovery, which requires the end user to restart these applications. Well-written DirectX 9Ex and DirectX 10 and later applications that handle Device Remove technology continue to work correctly. An
 application must release and then recreate its Direct3D device and all of the device's objects. For more information about how DirectX applications recover, see the Windows SDK.
</i></blockquote>
<blockquote>&nbsp;<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff570087%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Article here.
</a></blockquote>
<br />
With this being said, if Timeout Detection and Recovery fails to recover the display driver, it will then shoot the 0x116 bugcheck. There are many different things that can cause a 0x116, which I will explain below:<br />
<br />
<u><b>The following hardware issues can cause a TDR event:</b></u><br />
<br />
<b>1.</b> Unstable overclock (CPU, GPU, etc). Revert all and any overclocks to stock settings.
<br />
<br />
<b>2.</b> Bad sector in memory resulting in corrupt data being communicated between the GPU and the system (video memory otherwise known as VRAM or physical memory otherwise known as RAM).<br />
<br />
<b>GPU testing:</b> Furmark, run for ~15 minutes and watch temperatures to ensure there's no overheating and watch for artifacts.<br />
<br />
<b>RAM testing:</b> Memtest - Refer to the below:<br />
<br />
<span><u><b>Memtest - NO LESS than ~8 passes (several hours):</b></u></span><br />
<br />
Memtest86+:<br />
<br />
<b>Download Memtest86+ here:</b><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.memtest.org/</a><br />
<br />
<b>Which should I download?</b><br />
<br />
You can either download the pre-compiled ISO that you would burn to a CD and then boot from the CD, or you can download the auto-installer for the USB key. What this will do is format your USB drive, make it a bootable device, and then install the necessary
 files. Both do the same job, it's just up to you which you choose, or which you have available (whether it's CD or USB).<br />
<br />
<b>How Memtest works:</b><br />
<br />
Memtest86 writes a series of test patterns to most memory addresses, reads back the data written, and compares it for errors.<br />
<br />
The default pass does 9 different tests, varying in access patterns and test data. A tenth test, bit fade, is selectable from the menu. It writes all memory with zeroes, then sleeps for 90 minutes before checking to see if bits have changed (perhaps because
 of refresh problems). This is repeated with all ones for a total time of 3 hours per pass.<br />
<br />
Many chipsets can report RAM speeds and timings via SPD (Serial Presence Detect) or EPP (Enhanced Performance Profiles), and some even support changing the expected memory speed. If the expected memory speed is overclocked, Memtest86 can test that memory performance
 is error-free with these faster settings.<br />
<br />
Some hardware is able to report the "PAT status" (PAT: enabled or PAT: disabled). This is a reference to Intel Performance acceleration technology; there may be BIOS settings which affect this aspect of memory timing.<br />
<br />
This information, if available to the program, can be displayed via a menu option.<br />
<br />
Any other questions, they can most likely be answered by reading this great guide here:<br />

<br />
You can run it via Windows or DOS. Do note that the only difference is simply the environment you're running it in. In Windows, if you are having what you believe to be device driver related issues that may cause conflicts or false positive, it may be a wise
 decision to choose the most minimal testing environment (DOS).<br />
<br />
Run all tests EXCEPT: Fix All, Long Generic, and anything Advanced.<br />
<br />
<b>To reset your page file, follow the instructions below:</b><br />
<br />
<b>a )</b> Go to Start...Run...and type in "sysdm.cpl" (without the quotes) and press Enter.<br />
<br />
- Then click on the Advanced tab,<br />
- Then on the Performance Settings Button,<br />
- Then on the next Advanced tab,<br />
- Then on the Virtual Memory Change button.<br />
<br />
<b>b )</b> In this window, note down the current settings for your pagefile (so you can restore them later on).<br />
<br />
-Then click on the "No paging file" radio button, and<br />
<br />
- then on the "Set" button. Be sure, if you have multiple hard drives, that you ensure that the paging file is set to 0 on all of them.<br />
<br />
-Click OK to exit the dialogs.<br />
<br />
<b>c )</b> Reboot (this will remove the pagefile from your system)<br />
<br />
<b>d ) </b>Then go back in following the directions in step a ) and re-enter the settings that you wrote down in step<br />
<br />
<b>b ).</b> Follow the steps all the way through (and including) the reboot.<br />
<br />
<b>e )</b> Once you've rebooted this second time, go back in and check to make sure that the settings are as they're supposed to be.<br />
<br />
<b>Run System File Checker:</b><br />
<br />
SFC.EXE /SCANNOW<br />
<br />
Go to Start and type in "cmd.exe" (without the quotes)<br />
<br />
At the top of the search box, right click on the cmd.exe and select "Run as adminstrator"<br />
<br />
In the black window that opens, type "SFC.EXE /SCANNOW" (without the quotes) and press Enter.<br />
<br />
Let the program run and post back what it says when it's done.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
- Overheating of the CPU or GPU and or other components can cause 0x116 bugchecks. Monitor your temperatures and ensure the system is cooled adequately.<br />
<br />
- GPU failure. Whether it's heat, power issue (PSU issue), failing VRAM, etc.<br />
<br />
<u><b>The following software issues can cause a TDR event:</b></u><br />
<br />
- Incompatible drivers of any sort <br />
<br />
- Messy / corrupt registry<br />
<br />
- Corrupt Direct X - <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/179113" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/179113</a><br />
<br />
- Corrupt system files (run System File Checker as advised above)<br />
<br />
- Buggy and or corrupt 3rd party drivers. If you suspect a 3rd party driver being the issue, enable Driver Verifier:<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>What is Driver Verifier?</b><br />
<br />
Driver Verifier is included in Windows 8, 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, Windows Vista, Windows Server 2008, Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 to promote stability and reliability; you can use this tool to troubleshoot driver issues. Windows kernel-mode
 components can cause system corruption or system failures as a result of an improperly written driver, such as an earlier version of a Windows Driver Model (WDM) driver.
<br />
<br />
Essentially, if there's a 3rd party driver believed to be at issue, enabling Driver Verifier will help flush out the rogue driver if it detects a violation.<br />
<br />
<b>Before enabling Driver Verifier, it is recommended to create a System Restore Point:</b><br />
<br />
Vista - START | type rstrui - create a restore point<br />
Windows 7 - START | type create | select "Create a Restore Point" <br />
Windows 8 - <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/4690-restore-point-create-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
<br />
<b>How to enable Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
Start &gt; type "verifier" without the quotes &gt; Select the following options -<br />
<br />
1. Select - "Create custom settings (for code developers)"<br />
2. Select - "Select individual settings from a full list"<br />
3. Check the following boxes -<br />
- Special Pool<br />
- Pool Tracking<br />
- Force IRQL Checking<br />
- Deadlock Detection<br />
- Security Checks (Windows 7)<br />
- Concurrentcy Stress Test (Windows 8)<br />
- DDI compliance checking (Windows 8)<br />
- Miscellaneous Checks<br />
4. Select&nbsp; - "Select driver names from a list"<br />
5. Click on the "Provider" tab. This will sort all of the drivers by the provider.<br />
6. Check EVERY box that is [B]NOT[/B] provided by Microsoft / Microsoft Corporation.<br />
7. Click on Finish.<br />
&nbsp;8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart.<br />
<br />
<b>Important information regarding Driver Verifier:</b><br />
<br />
- If Driver Verifier finds a violation, the system will BSOD.<br />
<br />
- After enabling Driver Verifier and restarting the system, depending on the culprit, if for example the driver is on start-up, you may not be able to get back into normal Windows because Driver Verifier will flag it, and as stated above, that will cause /
 force a BSOD.<br />
<br />
If this happens, do <b>not</b> panic, do the following:<br />
<br />
- Boot into Safe Mode by repeatedly tapping the F8 key during boot-up.<br />
<br />
- Once in Safe Mode - Start &gt; type "system restore" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- Choose the restore point you created earlier.<br />
If you did not set up a restore point, do not worry, you can still disable Driver Verifier to get back into normal Windows:<br />
<br />
- Start &gt; Search &gt; type "cmd" without the quotes.<br />
<br />
- To turn off Driver Verifier, type in cmd "verifier /reset" without the quotes.<br />
・&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Restart and boot into normal Windows.<br />
<br />
<b>How long should I keep Driver Verifier enabled for?</b><br />
<br />
It varies, many experts and analysts have different recommendations. Personally, I recommend keeping it enabled for at least 24 hours. If you don't BSOD by then, disable Driver Verifier.<br />
<br />
<b>My system BSOD'd, where can I find the crash dumps?</b><br />
<br />
They will be located in %systemroot%\Minidump<br />
<br />

    <title>Windows 7 Update Error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jntinney  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 Update Error</h2>
                    <p>
</p><p>Windows Update in Window 7 Home Premium SP 1 is not working on my laptop. </p>
<p>
</p><p>When I run windows update, I get Error Code: 800700E. I have followed the advice in this page,</p>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows7/windows-update-error-80070008-or-8007000e</p>
<p>ie, turned everything off &amp; ran windows trouble shooter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I run windows trouble shooter, I get this error, Windows Update error 80070003. I have followed the advice on this page.</p>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/windows-update-error-80070003#1TC=windows-7</p>
<p>ie. I stopped 2 entries in Service &amp; deleted folders in Software Distribution folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I turned on automatic updates, to see if the computer will update itself.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas to try?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd like to update to Windows 10, hence needing to fix this issue. I did run the W10 updater though it stops at the "updating" screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone piont me to tutorial or have any ideas that could help. Btw, my computer skills are basic, they don't include understanding command prompt.</p>
<p>
<br />
</p><p>THANKS!!!!</p>

    <title>just lost all my saved game data for Ryse, Dead Rising 3, COD and I - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            just lost all my saved game data for Ryse, Dead Rising 3, COD and I can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t even play Peggle anymore&#33;&#33;&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>lost game progress for all games including dead rising 3 and ryse, ghosts and even peggle 2. all achievements are there, however rank and items to pick up are all reset as if I have never played the games. I have tried:</p>
<p>playing on offline and then going online</p>
<p>restarting my router</p>
<p>clearing the xbone's cache by holding the power button (as instructed by Phone support)</p>
<p>unplugged the power cord for 1 minute</p>
<p>I was told by customer service (lol) that at this point in time,&nbsp;I would just have to wait until an update is "pushed" to me. I asked for an ETA and was told, he does not have that information. I asked if he knew what the problem was and he said he'd never
 heard of it before, though I have read one post about a similar issue (no reply there from forum support). Now I can appreciate the fact Microsoft is all very busy figuring out problems on this Beta xbox one they just released, however as a paying customer
 and loyal xbox fan,&nbsp; I would expect much better then a 70% completed product without much help from support.&nbsp;Prove me wrong Microsoft and fix my problem.

<p>Having very similar issues with my Xbox. &nbsp;Having a similar issue where COD Ghosts will not save my local data - I.E. every time I play the game I have to re-do all of my settings, such as contrast, sensitivity etc. &nbsp;This was not an issue until latest update
 of Xbox firmware. &nbsp;Having similar issues in Netflix app (failed to create local data) and Forza 5 will not even play (unknown error occurred). &nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried all the suggested fixes as well - however after just trying to play as a Guest on my console Forza 5 worked just fine - it seems to me, maybe my local data is corrupted for my profile. &nbsp; I like the suggestion to delete and re-download my account
 but I am worried that if I do that I will loose all my saves/progress. &nbsp;They should be in the cloud right?</p>

<p>I can tell you deleting and re-adding your profile doesn't seem to impact the true save files on the cloud, as I had temporarily been able to access DR3's true progress after clearing the cache (holding down the power button until it turned off). I played
 for a bit but once I quit the game and went back into it, all the progress was gone again and I was back to the starting point. so it seems to me that it's some sort of problem connecting to the cloud to access the content, though I don't get any error messages.</p>

<p>Had similar issues with Ghost on multiplayer, was level 23 and got 12 sqaud points from leveling up a bit, about 4 or 5 levels, got a error message and reset down to level 23, Kept playing and hasnt done it since, once again, its probably not your Xbox,
 but something on Microsoft's end. Sadly, theres not really much to do but wait untill Microsoft fixes the issues with their servers. Im sure they got packets of work on thier desk. Just be patient. :)</p>

<h2>            Windows Movie Maker yellow warning triangles</h2>
                    <p>Bonjour. </p>
<p>Whenever we try to use Windows Movie Maker, within the first minute of editing, clips stop working and yellow triangles appear where the thumbnail used to be. It says it will fix if we double click but this just deletes the clip entirely. We have tried searching
 the web and moving the project to a new Movie Maker file but the results are unsuccessful. We definitely have the original clips downloaded so please advise us on what to do now!</p>

<p>I suspect the program you use to download the clips saves them in a format that isn't 100% compatible with Movie Maker. Try converting the problem clips to .wmv or .mp4 and then try again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, you might go to the Options and turn off the preparing steps to see if that has an effect.</p>

<br />
===========================================<br />
<br />
<strong>Consider this an absolute must - manually updating your drivers.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>Vista and Windows 7 love updated drivers so here is how to update the major ones.</strong><br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />
<a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></a></p>
<p>Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above<br />
is preferred to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

<h2>            Xbox One going crazy</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone, last week I wrote a thread because I was getting stuck on the green start up screen, it finally resolved itself, god know why. I continued enjoying playing until today. It got stuck on the green start up screen once again, and this time for good. I tried everything possible before a Factory Reset, nothing worked, so I decided to do a Factory Reset. After the reset, everything was fine, the Xbox was running smooth and way faster! I was happy. I played for hours tonight until now. I was playing Warframe with my friend until suddenly I couldn't join any more online mission (Didn't lose internet connection, I was still in the game and I could still talk with my friend in group chat). I decided to restart the game... the problem is that now it cannot open the game anymore. It keep saying for an unknown reason, the start up was too long... with an error (0x8027025a). I tried Hard reseting the console, didn't help. I tried unplugging everything, didn't help either. I tried to t

            <p>Hey Icarusael! Because the issues are occurring after a factory reset, you will want to get the console sent in for repair. You can do so <a href="http://account.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a> or by contacting support <a href="http://support.xbox.com/contact-us?isChatCallAvailable=false" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>.

    <title>Bitlocker Drive Encryption Option not available - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Bitlocker Drive Encryption Option not available</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>I have a Windows 10 Home edition and connect using my Microsoft Account. Therefore, I should be able to use the Drive Encryption. But I'm not able to access any options (based on different forum, I should be able to find something either in "Control Panel
 -&gt; System and Security -&gt; BitLocker Drive Encryption" or in "System -&gt; About"). But unfortunately, the only options I have is in the System - About (I don't simply have a System and Security option in Control panel) is "BitLocker settings", when clicking on
 it, it just open the market place for me to buy a Pro version. Checking in the Disk Management tool, no encryption is specified in my different drives.</p>
<p>Is there something wrong on my machine or did I miss something ? Thanks</p>

            No, Windows Home does not have Bitlocker, except to read bitlocker'd drives. You can't create bitlocker protected drives in Home.

            <p>Hi, Thanks for the update.</p>
<p>This is correct but instead, I should be able to use the Device Encryption feature that comes with Home edition if you connect to Windows with a Microsoft Account. As I do have a TPM chip, I should be able to have my device encrypted... but not able to check
 if this encryption is enabled or not.</p>

                    <p>A human being who wanted to creep my privacy plugged my&nbsp;mobile drive on a Windows 7 and this person has always been a tech illiterate so this person might have done things beyond my understanding. So I got my drive back and it said "BitLocker encryption
 on this drive isn't compatible with your version of Windows. Try opening the drive using a newer version of Windows." when I was trying to open it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked what's been done with my drive and there was sincerely no answer as this person has no idea what had happened.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am so frustrated and I am asking for help now. Please someone help me, i can't open my drive with Window 10 and iOS.</p>
<p>Let me know if i could do anything to recover my data in this drive or simply open it. I have tried everything that this forum has offered in other posts.</p>

</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Community Forum.<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>BitLocker is a full disk encryption feature included with Microsoft Windows version to protect data by providing encryption for entire volumes. When you turn on BitLocker Drive Encryption on a volume, you will create a BitLocker password which you
 need to enter every time you access the volume. A BitLocker recovery key is also generated. You can use the recovery key to gain access to the volume if you forget your BitLocker password.</span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
</span></span></p>
<p><span>Usually you get that error if the <strong>BIOS</strong> and <strong>TPM</strong> are not updated. Use Windows 7 PC and check if you are getting the same error. If the error occurs, update TPM and BIOS version. You need to contact the PC manufacturer
 to update your BIOS. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>BIOS Disclaimer</span></strong><span>: Modifying BIOS/ complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any
 problems resulting from the configuring of BIOS/CMOS settings can be solved. Modifications of the settings are at your own risk.</span></p>
<p><span><span><span><br />
</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span>Additional Information: </span></strong><span>If your drive has been encrypted with BitLocker on Windows 7, you need to decrypt it by inserting it back to Windows 7. So, kindly use Windows 7 to remove BitLocker encryption if it's not necessary.

            Hi YuryNT, 
<br />
<br />What do you have the HDMI going to, a monitor? Do you have another monitor or TV to test with? 
<br />
<br />Click start and type “Device Manager” - and select it from the list of results.
<br />
<br />Expand Display Adapters, then right-click on your video driver and select Update Driver. 
<br />
<br />Select Search automatically for updated driver software.
<br />
<br />Next, Let’s give windows troubleshooter a shot. Click start, type “troubleshoot” and launch it. Look for hardware and devices, and see if it finds anything wrong. 
<br />
<br />Now, Click start - Settings - Updates and Security - Windows Updates - Let’s see if there are any pending updates that can be installed. If so, install those. 
<br />
<br />let’s start with these and we’ll go from there!
<br />

<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment

<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be a clean Install. This is the best method to perform a clean install of Windows 10. (If you want to rescue your files, there is a section Rescue Files when Windows Won't Start)

            Hi Aniket
<br />
<br />Your best option is to try running the reset operation again, if that does not succeed, then a clean install of Windows 10 will be the best option . ..
<br />
<br />1
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset
<br />
<br />2
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything ! 
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following

            HI.
<br />
<br />That error indicated something is wrong with the boot device (though it could be corruption in the making of the USB).
<br />
<br />See if you can boot with that USB on another computer as a test. If it is OK then it sounds like you have a possible hardware issue (which may have existed before you did the unfortunate reset).
<br />
<br />Be sure you followed the boot directions in that tutorial.
<br />
<br />Rob

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Well you gave me a bad rating which locks me out of helping with my usual Rob B. - MVP account. So I will try to help using my moderator account. Did you mean to give me the bad rating?<br />
<br />
Remember,&nbsp;just as gas and oil can't fix a cracked engine block in a car, you can't fix hardware issue with software.<br />
<br />
The error means either :<br />
<br />
1. The USB drive is either bad or was not properly made (have you tried booting to it as a test?).<br />
<br />
2. The instructions on how to boot to the USB were not followed.<br />
<br />
3. There is a hardware problem with the&nbsp;computer&nbsp;such as hard drive, motherboard, or other issues.<br />
<br />
What have the technicians tried to do? Have they recommended and repairs such as a new hard drive, motherboard, or so on? If they are component techs they should at least have a few thoughts on the cause and fix (or are they just sales folks at a Big Box Store?).
<br />
<br />
Unless the system allows booting from a USB or Disk there is no chance to fix it even if doing so would provide a working solution (which is also an unknown at this point).<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. <br />

    <title>Moving Skype to new computer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spinneyhill  say:</h3>
<h2>            Moving Skype to new computer</h2>
                    <p>I am moving from a Windows 10 Home to a Windows 10 Home computer. I am using Skype 11.19.856.0 on the new computer. Both computers are running the latest update of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a few Skype contacts. They are not linked to my Contacts in any other application. I keep my contacts in Thunderbird.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It appears I can log into my Skype account on the new computer, but the contacts do not show. At first (last night) it could not find the default speakers or microphone, although that appears to be resolved this morning.&nbsp; A test call to me does not come
 to the new computer - it only goes to the old.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried to log into Skype on my laptop. It would not even log in. I am confused about what is going on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What am I doing wrong here?</p>

<p>Q: Can I close one or do I just abandon it? I don't want to close the MS account
</p>
<p>
</p><p>A: You can close the account, however, the associated Microsoft account will be closed as well. Since you are already aware&nbsp;of the log ins, you can either leave the accounts as they are or update your Microsoft and Skype accounts.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Important note</strong>: You can only update your accounts once, make sure you read the articles&nbsp;for additional information.

<p>
</p><p>Based on the description above, you might have used Skype for Windows 10. This version of the application is slightly different from the classic Windows desktop client. The settings are located on the profile so you can easily manage everything in one place.
