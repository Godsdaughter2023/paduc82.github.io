</p><p>So after I did the previous troubleshooting steps, &nbsp;I've actually reset my computer, &nbsp;and I was able to nearly to create a shadow copy of my os system only to get this error:</p>

            <i>"But games weren't running smoothly... So I checked out for DirectX and found that it wasn't&nbsp; installed."</i><br />
<br />
If certain Direct X files are not installed (there are many) or corrupt&nbsp; the game that require those DirectX files will most often not run at all.<br />
<br />
By what means did you find that DX is not installed ? The Web Installer said DX is up to date, so<br />
it would seem they are all installed.<br />
If<i>&nbsp; DirectX Features</i> in <i>dxdiag</i> are not enabled then it can also be due to not having graphics drivers installed, or having a corrupt graphics driver install.<br />
<br />
- When there are corrupt DirectX files the full DX runtime installer is required as it will overwrite<br />
all the DX files with new ones (I think maybe&nbsp; sfc.exe does not fix corrupt DX files).
<br />
The Web Installer only installs 'missing' files and does not overwrite existing files -<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?id=8109" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download Details - Microsoft Download Center - DirectX Redist (June 2010)</a>
<br />
<br />
You have downloaded and installed the latest graphics drivers from the laptop mfg's web site<br />
as suggested by JR ?<br />
<br />
If the games are not running smoothly there is likely another issue. Using too high game settings, or having&nbsp; too many other things running in the background are two examples.<br />
<br />
Some games will&nbsp; install specific&nbsp; DX files in the folder when the game is installed, but sometimes
<br />
a copy from System32 or sysWOW64 is required to be placed in the folder that has the games executable.
<br />
There are other games where placing&nbsp; a specific DX file in the games install folder (or sub-folder with
<br />
the games executable) helps some people, even though the game does not normally install a DX file,&nbsp;&nbsp; (for some reason not everyone needs this done).
<br />
<br />
Give some more detail about what is, or is not happening, and include your system specifications<br />
with make and model graphics card. <br />
Names of games, and whether they are retail disk, Steam or another version, may help too.<br />

<p>Yes I downloaded latest driver. I checked it many times. </p>

            I don't have Win 8, but I would think Win8 has the same DX files as Win7, below -<br />
<br />
Go to the Windows / System 32 folder, (and SysWOW64 if you have 64bit).&nbsp; <br />
The DirectX files are in alphabetical order and will start with d3dx9 - 24 &gt; 43 . Then d3dx10 - 33 &gt; 43
<br />
&amp; finally d3dx11 - 42 &gt; 43.<br />
There should also be - d3d9, d3d10 and d3d11 these come before the D3Dcompilers - 33&gt;43.<br />
There are also three new XInput1 - 1&gt;3 (used by game controllers, etc. ).<br />
There are more DX files, but these are most of the graphics related Direct X&nbsp; .dll's.<br />
<br />
- From what I've read NFS-MW 2012 does have problems of it's own, apparently due to it being yet another sloppy console port to PC&nbsp; ( I'm going to get is sometime soon anyway ).
<br />
Bats - AO is a recent release that may still require patching.<br />
<br />
- However, the minimum cpu requirements for all three games is 2.4 GHz (dual core), so unless you
<br />
have a different variant from the one in the reviews I'm looking at your cpu comes up a
<br />
bit short at 2.1GHz (dual core). <br />
As 2.4GHz is minimum there is not much leeway. When they say minimum for a games specs<br />
they truly mean <i>minimum.</i><br />
- As games vary a lot in their minimum requirements it can be difficult to extrapolate&nbsp; from some of the other games reviewed for your 7670m below, but I would think that&nbsp; even if you had a more
<br />
powerful cpu, &nbsp; Bats-AO would run only with mostly low, with some med settings.&nbsp; <br />
Bats-AA will run at med settings, but when using&nbsp; med-high settings in Bats-AO&nbsp; the system requirements are a bit higher than they are with Bats-AC.<br />

- It may help to free up some system resources if you uninstall any BS software that comes with the machine, especially if it&nbsp; loads with Windows.<br />
If you have not already done so. Go to Run and type&nbsp; msconfig&nbsp; to bring<br />
up System Configuration where you can disable Startup programs that you don't need to have<br />

<h2>            Windows 7 Advisor - can&#39;t reach server</h2>
                    I installed the Windows 7 advisor and both yesterday and today, it can't reach the server for updates - or prior to scanning - so it doesn't work for me.&nbsp; Any ideas? Is the server down? I can access other things just fine!

<p>You can only remove a game from your game's played list if you haven't earned any achievements for it.&nbsp; Deleting a game from your HDD will not remove it from your Achievement's list.</p>
<p>I believe you can go to the Xbox Guide&gt;Achievements and when you're browsing your games, there's an option to remove it from the list if no Achievements are earned.</p>
<p>Not in front of my console so I can't confirm the exact steps for you, I'm afraid.</p>

                    Upgraded from Win 7 to Win 10. &nbsp;Several trusted programs (Carbonite, Malwarebytes, etc. ) all require me to allow a change to my PC. &nbsp;Is there a way to permanently allow changes following a restart or to open on the desktop? &nbsp;I don't want to disable the

            I don't know about Carbonite but Malwarebytes is just one popup asking to verify the program can make changes. I don't think you can change the properties of a specific program because of what the program wants to do.

                    Have Vista Home Premium. Intel Core 2 Duo .Recently had to have a new hard drive installed and W.Vista reinstalled. Have consistently had problems with printing since. After help from HP have found that although spoolsv. is present, there is now no spoolsv.exe
 therefore although nothing wrong with printer, or installation of same, the print spooler has stopped and cannot print anything. Can anyone please tell me how to get it back? Tried to contact Microsoft for help but although I have given the Product ID&nbsp; from
 the original installation disc, Dell's re-installation disc, and the one on the back of the PC itself none of them are accepted and I don't know why. HELP PLEASE!

===================================<br />
<br />
If the above did not help :<br />
<br />
<br />
Use this method to clear the spooler then uninstall and reinstall your printer (check with the<br />
maker for the latest driver).<br />
<br />
Check the Mr Fixits here and if you have to use the other methods go back and try them again afterwards.<br />

                    <p>I just got the Windows 10 Creators Update. Now my computer is refusing to let me open the Start menu or open Settings. Help, please?</p>
<p>NOTE: I was fine just after I got the update. But after a few hours, this started happening. I thought restarting might help, but it didn't. Although it was taking an absurdly, suspiciously long time to restart...</p>

<h2>            Do I need all of these partitions with Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    I did a clean install od Windows 10 on my Alienware Alpha.&nbsp; After the install I noticed that I have a lot of partitions. Some I feel are left over from the Windows 8.1 and maybe Windows 10 made some. What partition do I actually need for Windows 10 to
 function correctly? Can I delete some of these partitions? If so, which ones?<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/89c0c734-7c54-4ab5-a09b-b130e531ecbf" />

<p>
</p><p>Thank you or posting on Microsoft Communities. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The recovery partition used to restore your system to its original factory state becomes inoperable.&nbsp;The recovery partition&nbsp;is used in the event you need to reinstall Windows on your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Some computers that come preinstalled with Windows often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suggest you not to delete the recovery partitions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please post in case you have any further issues, I will be gad to help you further.</p>

            I have to say, that&nbsp;was a really bad response.&nbsp; So, I have reformatted and installed Windows 10 too (Purchased a full version after upgrade failed).&nbsp; Now, I have 4 Partitions.&nbsp; 1 Boot, 3 Recovery, and 1&nbsp;EFI.&nbsp; What is Windows 10 using?&nbsp; This is a fresh
 install and I'm not interested in saving any recovery other than what Windows 10 may need during troubleshooting.&nbsp; I don't want the Factory, I don't want Windows 8 upgrade, and I don't the free windows 10 free upgrade recover previous version.&nbsp; What can be
 deleted?

    <title>Can I reinstall Windows 7 with my upgrade disk without losing all my - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cuulcars  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I reinstall Windows 7 with my upgrade disk without losing all my programs&#63;</h2>
                    I majorly messed up my registry using a registry cleaner to fix other problems I was having (which it did, it just created a different, worse one elsewhere). I tried Windows repair with no results. Windows was unable to repair my system files. So through
 this I decided I would reinstall Windows. My original question was would I even be able to reinstall windows with an upgrade disk, but it seems to me (correct my if I'm wrong) I can, as long as I do a custom (clean) upgrade. I tried selecting the upgrade option
 on the installation DVD just to see if it would work and it seems that that is not a viable option. However, here is my issue. I have purchased many games on Steam, and I have other programs that would be a hassle to reinstall. The custom upgrade indicates
 that it doesn't keep the files, programs, or settings, and I'm a little confused as to the extent of this. I seem to remember when migrating from XP to retain all my old files. I wasn't sure if it was just referring to the system files or all the files on
 the partition. So will I lose my Steam purchases? Does it format the drive when installing? Any advice given is much appreciated.

            <p>The first option I would try is a repair upgrade. </p>
<p>Boot to the Windows 7 desktop.</p>
<p>Insert your Windows 7 Upgrade disc</p>
<p>Click Install Now</p>
<p>When the setup menu appears, click Upgrade</p>
<p>This option will refresh broken operating system files while preserving your personal files and installed applications.
</p>
<p>If copy of Windows 7 you now have installed on the computer is later than the version you have on disc, (example your disc is Windows 7 RTM and you Windows 7 with Service Pack 1 installed, you won't be able to do the repair upgrade unless you uninstall Service
 Pack 1).</p>
<p>A work around for this is to download Windows 7 image with Service Pack 1 and burn it to a blank DVD disc:</p>
<p>Download the edition that corresponds with the edition you have installed:</p>
Windows 7 (English) with Service Pack 1

<p>Note: Always use the slowest burn speed (4x or 2x) if offered a choice.<br />
</p>
<p>----------</p>
<p>If the problem is not resolved and you still want to do the clean install with the upgrade disc, see the instructions below:</p>
<p>If your computer came with a previous qualifying license such as Windows Vista or Windows XP and the Certificate of Authencity is still attached to the machine in good condition, then the COA is reason enough for representing compliance to the software license
 agreement. No actual installation of previous software necessary, which means you can do a clean install with Windows 7 Upgrade disk.</p>
<p>How to do a clean install with the upgrade disk:</p>
<p>Boot from the Windows 7 DVD</p>
<p>Click Install Now</p>
<p>Accept License Agreement</p>
<p>When the option is displayed to select an installation type, click (Custom Advanced)</p>
<p>Click Drive Options</p>
<p>Select the drive/s click Delete</p>
<p>Click New</p>
<p>Click Apply</p>
<p>Click OK</p>
<p>Click Format and click Next to proceed with the installation</p>
<p>Skip entering your Windows 7 product key and complete the installation.</p>
<p>Once you reach the desktop, click Start, right click Computer</p>
<p>Click Properties</p>
<p>Scroll down to Windows Activation</p>
<p>Click the link x days until activation.</p>
<p>Click the link that says 'Show me other ways to activate'</p>
<p>Enter product key</p>
<p>Click Next</p>
<p>Select Phone Activation</p>
<p>Click Next when Enter your key page displayed</p>
<p>Select your country</p>
<p>Click Next, call the number listed</p>
<p>Remember to explain to the call agent your situation.</p>
<p>Provide the generated installation ID when requested by the call agent</p>
<p>They will give you a confirmation ID in return, enter it</p>
<p>Click Next to complete the activation. </p>
<p>The requirements for upgrade media though is that you have a previously qualifying operating system such as Windows XP or Vista installed to use it. From the Windows 7 End User License Agreement.</p>
<p>15. UPGRADES. To use upgrade software, you must first be licensed for the software that is eligible for the upgrade. Upon upgrade, this agreement takes the place of the agreement for the software you upgraded from. After you upgrade, you may no longer use
 the software you upgraded from.</p>
<p>So, if you are still denied, you will have to simply reinstall Windows XP or Vista and let it do the eligibility check.</p>

<h2>            Airplane mode and WiFi issue in WIndows 10</h2>
                    <p>Original Title[Internet and Network]</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also had the Airplane mode active showing in my Action Center, as well as the Bluetooth (I have learned that some applications use Bluetooth to connect so they can update). I am confused on the Airplane mode though. It appears it is just on in the Action
 Center and my WiFi is connected, because I have tested by going into Edge and going to various sites. I was hoping that my WiFi was not turned off and my computer was connecting to another WiFi account that is not secure, because I have noticed that after
 a few minutes of surfing most of the articles and pictures are not created by Associated Press or other medias, but all are listed as being by Taboola. Is that a virus and if so they have infected in the rootkit. I have noticed some files recently installed
 in rootkit. My computer was setup to save system restore points from initial Windows 10 upgrade, but I have noticed it was off when I went to restore back to a safe period.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t install Flight Sim on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>I'm running 2 PC with Windows 10. On one, FSX installed with no problems but can't get it to install on the second PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried re-installing it several time but always get the same error code, I think it was 557. Not certain if that is the correct code, I'll have to write it down the next time I try it again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is not the DVD nor the disks - appreciate any suggestiond.</p>

            <p>Hi James,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community. Your interest in Windows 10 is much appreciated.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the exact error code you get while installing it?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to try installing the game in compatibility mode and check. Follow the below steps:</p>
<p>1. Right-click on the game <strong>setup file </strong>and click on ‘<strong>properties</strong>’.</p>
<p>2. Click on the ‘<strong>compatibility</strong>’ tab and check the box ‘<strong>Run this program in compatibility mode for’
</strong>and select Windows 8 operating system from the drop down menu and proceed with the installation.
<br />
Once this is done, restart the computer and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>I would also suggest you to disable the Anti-virus installed on your system for few minutes and check if you are able to install it.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">NOTE:</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily
 disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>

    <title>Extremely disappointed with Surface Pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daniks  say:</h3>
<h2>            Extremely disappointed with Surface Pro</h2>
                    <p>I bought a Surface Pro (5th gen). Halfway into the year it had terrible issues with random crashes every second day. One day the problem became even worse - it was stuck on the circle looping on the Restart screen. I had to go get the computer wiped completely
 in order for it to work again at the Microsoft store. A few months after, it started having the same problems again. Crashing constantly, and then eventually to the point where I couldn't get it to restart and my only option was to get it wiped.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I used it for a few weeks after, but was faced with the same crashing problems. Since I was on my one-year-warranty, I decided to exchange it for - sadly - a refurbished one. Currently it hasn't been a full month yet and the refurbished one just crashed
 and won't restart. I am stuck on the automatic repair options and it does not give me the ability to repair it myself. (Either shutdown, or be faced with the troubleshooting screen which is useless). I have to go get it wiped tomorrow, but my only option left
 is to get another refurbished computer. I don't know how much longer I have to deal with this absurdness.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a student, and this problem has caused me great stress. I've had to go long distances to the only Microsoft Store in the city, and this has wasted so much of my time and energy to get my computer repaired, set up my computer again every time it gets
 wiped.... I'm extremely disappointed at the quality of the Surface Pro. The price of the computer and needed accessories (keyboard, pen) was not a small amount either. My one year warranty isn't even over yet but it has already caused me so much problems.
 The amount I would be refunded is barely a quarter of the price I've bought it at. (That doesn't even include the accessories that are only usable for the Surface products. I can't even use it for other computers.) That's not enough for me to get a new computer
 suitable for my studying purposes. The poor quality of the refurbished is unreasonable. I'm barely surviving as a broke student.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I am appalled at the quality of these so called, "repaired-to-perfect-order" refurbished computer. The people working at Microsoft are just going to do so-called "fixing up", and then proceed to give future customers the only option of a used computer
 with "hidden" problems - which is what they're doing with my original computer - and then giving them a headaches from getting it fixed again.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
By way, I don't even have a lot of applications installed on the computer. I don't even game. (Only have less then 5 simple apps). It's ridiculous, the computer can't even do it's job right. I've never had crashing problems as serious as this with other computer
 brands. At least other computers can restart in some way. I can't do anything about it when it happens to the Surface.&nbsp;I've used other computers and they have lasted years. In comparison, the Surface Pro can't even last a few months in proper working condition.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This is been the worst experience, I would strongly NOT recommend Surface products to everyone I know or the repair services I was given at the Microsoft Store.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

</p><p>
</p><p>I'm facing a lot of problems right now and I don't know what cause this problems. I already tried to find solutions on the Internet for this problems, but didn't find any solution that can help me fix this problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first problem I met was when I'm playing game and the game keep crashing. The game is called League of Legends. Even the game crashed, I still keep playing that game. Before the game start to crash, the game screen stuck, but the music is still running,
 and I can still hear my character is moving even when my screen is stuck like a pause video. After several crashes, my laptop suddenly got a black screen with blinking cursor mouse. The black screen stop right after my Aero effects and Desktop Window Manager
 got disabled automatically.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I stop playing that game, the problems still persist. I don't think that game cause problems for my laptop. When I play a game called Slender the Arrival, the game always stuck at loading screen, then I press Alt + Tab to get out from that game. Then
 I saw that my Aero effects and Desktop Window Manager got disabled again. After that I press Alt + Tab back again then I can continue playing that game. Every time the game stuck at loading screen I need to press Alt + Tab, so I can keep playing that game.
 When the game stuck at loading screen, I can hear the game music just like League of Legends.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I'm not playing any games and let my laptop open for several hours, my laptop got a blinking black screen. The blinking black screen will stop after my Aero effects and Desktop Window Manager got disabled automatically. After that, when I want to open
 task manager or anything else, I got a messages like this, "Insufficient system resources exist to complete the requested service." and "There is not enough free memory to run this program. Exit one or more programs, and then try again.".</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recieved messages like insufficient resources and not enough memory, but at that moment I got enough free memory, like 50% free, I check it using Task Manager and Resources Monitor. I got 2GB and 4GB RAM installed in my laptop, both of them are Kingston
 RAM. I don't know why the system said I don't have enough RAM, but actually I do have enough RAM. I got virtual memory and let the system manage itself. Sometimes I tried to turn off virtual memory but the problem still persist. I've run Windows Memory Diagnostic
 and no problems or error was found. I also clean up my disc, defragment and checking for errors, also no problems or error were found.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When my Aero effects and Desktop Window Manager got disabled, I tried to open them back using the troubleshooting in Control Panel. Sometimes I can enable them back just for a short moment, then the blinking black screen came again. Sometimes I can't enable
 them, and the troubleshooter say something like "Your video card doesn't support Aero effects.". Actually my video card support it, this must be not enough memory and system resources problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>In November 2014, I got 2 blue screen of death, and both of them are the same blue screen that shows the same information. When I stop recieving messsages like not enough memory and insufficient resources, I can't open any application, program, and I even
 can't open Task Manager. At that time when I try to open anything with force or shut down the computer, then suddenly I got a blue screen of death. The blue screen that I got says something like "Check to be sure you have adequate disc space." Here's the full
 display of blue screen that I got:</p>
<p>
</p><p style="text-align: center">[][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][]</p>
<p style="text-align: left">A problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer.</p>
<p>If this is the first time you've seen this stop error screen, restart your computer. If this screen appears again, follow these steps:</p>
<p>Check to be sure you have adequate disc space. If a driver is identified in the Stop message, disable the driver or check with the manufacturer for driver updates. Try changing video adapters.</p>
<p>Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates. Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing. If you need to use Safe Mode to remove or disable components, restart your computer, press F8 to select Advanced Startup options, and then select
 Safe Mode.</p>
<p>Technical information:</p>
<p>*** STOP: 0X0000007E (0XFFFFFFFFC0000005,0XFFFFF8800F29F9D4,0XFFFFF8800BA47E78,0XFFFFF8800BA476D0)</p>

</p>
<p style="text-align: center">[][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][][]</p>
<p>
</p><p>After that I press the power button to turn off my laptop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have 500GB HDD installed in my laptop, and I have around 50% free from 500GB. I tried to reinstall my HDD but the problems still persist. All of my drivers are up to date, except my BIOS. I dont know how to update my BIOS, but there's one way that I know
 how to update it but I don't want to spend any money to update my BIOS.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes I thought my RAM is corrupted, even the Windows Memory Diagnostic says no error was found. So I take my 2GB RAM out, and start my laptop with 4GB RAM, but the problem still persist. 2GB RAM is my oldest RAM, and it's also came with my laptop that
 my father bought for me in December 2011. My mother bought 4GB RAM for me last year, maybe in December 2013.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can freely enable or disable the turbo boost for my CPU using RealTemp.exe. I can see if the turbo boost is on or not by using the Intel® Turbo Boost Technology Monitor 2.6. If my CPU reach 2.4GHz only, means the turbo boost is off. But if my CPU can go
 higher than 2.4GHz, the turbo boost is on. I already tried to turn it off, but the problem still exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes I thought my GPU is the one that cause this problems, because I overclocked my GPU since last year. Overclocking the GPU will decrease the life span for my GPU. So I set my GPU back to its default clock settings, but the problem is still there.
 I also try to disable my GPU using the Device Manager, but the problem still persist. So I don't think that my GPU is the one that cause all of this problems. Even when my GPU got disabled, I can still play games using my Intel® HD Graphics 3000, but it's
 kinda laggy because it's not optimize for high graphics 3D gaming.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When searching through to the Internet on how to fix my problems, I found something about editing the registry. Yeah, I know if edit the registry in the wrong way will make the computer more worst like I need to format my computer. What I did on my Registry
 Editor is I edit and put something new like, "PagedPoolSize|DWORD (32-bit) Value|ffffffff (hexadecimal)", and "PoolUsageMaximum|DWORD (32-bit) Value|60 (decimal)". The pathway for these pool thingy is, open Registry Editor then go to Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session
 Manager\Memory Management. Even after doing that, my problem still persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run full scan using Microsoft Security Essentials and no virus and malware was found.</p>
<p><br />
That's all I can say for today. I don't know how to fix this anymore, but I'm not going to give up. I'll keep searching answers for my problems. I hope someone can help me how to fix this problems. If you need any more information about this problems, just
 ask me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you for taking your time to read all of this.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern here in Microsoft Community.&nbsp;I would be happy to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>from the description provided, I understand that the upgrade to Windows 10 did not complete and which resulted&nbsp;to a black screen&nbsp;state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to know few more details on the below questions to understand the issue better.</p>
<p>1. Did you try to upgrade to Windows 10 via Windows Update or an Installation Media?</p>
<p>2. Do you see any message during the entire up gradation process if it has failed any where?</p>
<p>3. Are you able to access the desktop by any chance?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If&nbsp;you are not able to login to the computer, I would suggest you to download the ISO file for Windows 10 from the referred link and perform a repair using the same Installation Media and see if the issue can be resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please follow the below steps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Step 1: Follow the below link to create an ISO image for Windows 10.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Step 2: Perform the repair using the bootable media as suggested in the below link.</span></p>

            <p>This happened to me 2x in a row. Install gets about halfway done with the process and blank screen, no activity. Waited an hr and then restarted. Install tries to finish install and cant and then reinstalls old OS. I just uninstalled AVG antivirus and malwarebytes
 and took out my wireless mouse keyboard after initializing install for 3rd time. Will report if that works.

I'm not able to access Windows, not even in safe mode. I can see no way to follow the response you have suggested. I can't access any operating system.

            <p>Hi there. I tried the solutions you suggested above. I downloaded the Win 10 ISO and tried to boot from both USB and DVD. Neither worked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify, I cannot access Windows 7, Windows 10 or any other software on my PC. My PC freezes at the Windows boot-up. it is now effectively a brick.

            <p>This would not have worked for me. Mine was a driver issue. My graphics driver would never update correctly through windows install. Even device manager wouldnt update to the correct driver. I had to roll back the drive and install from the direct file I
 personally downloaded from the Intel website. Once I did that the windows 10 install would go through. Hope this helps anyone with my issue!</p>

            <p>Your keyboard and mouse exchange wireless signals with a transponder, which is wired (connected) to a port on your computer. On the top of the transponder is a button. Press the button and you should see green flashing lights. No lights means no power is
 getting to the transponder or the transponder has failed. Assuming you can see green flashing lights then try resetting the keyboard.</p>
<p>I do not have your model keyboard but look on the underside of the keyboard for a tiny button towards the bottom right corner. On my Microsoft keyboard the words Connect Channel are next to the button. To reset you&nbsp;press down on the Connect button for say
 10 seconds whilst with your other hand pressing down on the button on the transponder.</p>

 discs now. I have tried searching for help on microsoft pages but they are complete rubbish, you just chase your tail round and round. Seems like you buy into their **** then you are on your own.Bill Gates owes me a laptop. Why should you have to ask the general
 public for help when stuff you buy into for &nbsp;lot of money goes **** up..ooops sorry i mean goes wrong.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Cannot right-click on scroll bar on Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Years ago I right-clicked by accident on the scroll bar to find that useful little drop-down menu that lets you jump directly to the point where you click. That was on Windows 7. After upgrading to 10, that function has disappeared although other right-click
 functions seem OK. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I frequently contribute to sites with long comment pages and it's a real pain not to be able to move quickly up and down the pages with two&nbsp;clicks. I am using a Microsoft laptop bought new in 2010.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have scouted the Internet for a solution without luck. Can anyone advise me here? Thanks in advance.</p>

            <p>Thanks for that reply, Lawrence Crumb. I tried to download the Feedback Hub app, but it tells me I need a hardware update to get it. Is it OK to go ahead with it?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Also, is it the case that Windows10 does has removed that right-click function that Windows 7 had on the scroll bar and has no intention of putting it back?

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Cortana&nbsp;does a lot more than search.<br />
<br />
Cortana and Search<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/cortana-search" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/cortana-search</span></a>
<br />
<br />
If you prevent Cortana from running as a Windows Process you also lose all<br />
of Windows Search. So if Cortana is disabled think of what remains as just<br />
Windows without Search (which is what it really is). And I certainly don't <br />
recommend doing it.<br />
<br />
One way is to use a Local Account and Cortana does not run.<br />
<br />
How to Stop Cortana/SearchUI.exe From Running on Windows 10<br />

<br />
There are actually several methods to stop Cortana as a Process - here is a <br />
Search.<br />

<li>Type<strong> Mouse &amp; Touchpad settings</strong> and select the best match.</li><li>Click on <strong>Additional mouse option</strong>.</li><li>Click on the <strong>Device Settings</strong> tab and click on the <strong>Settings
</strong>button.</li><li>From the left side panel, click <strong>Pinch Zoom</strong> option and uncheck the box next to
<strong>Enable Pinch Zoom</strong>.</li><li>Click <strong>Apply </strong>and <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Close the window and check if the changes are effective.</li></ol>

<h2>            W10 Defender Security Centre Damaged after updates 14th June 2017</h2>
                    <p>Does anybody else have this?</p>
<p>Updated&nbsp; W10 14th June - two PC's OK but laptop shows problem with Defender Security Centre App. All looks OK BUT</p>
<p>Icon in system tray OK - open from here or from W10 Settings Window Defender then same -
</p>

<p>
</p><p>All the text etc is missing and nothing seems to work/respond to key or mouse etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are the latest updates and I know one of them is responsible in some way as a system restore&nbsp; to before that makes all as previous OK.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Anybody any ideas. I have checked SFC etc and nothing apart from going back seems to work</p>

<p>Sorry - have done numerous times - always the same.</p>
<p>I did a system restore to before update - all OK and updated Defender to latest signatures - all OK.</p>
<p>Repeating Upgrade returns problem - hence my certainty of one of them caused this problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think Defender is still running OK - can still use it via File Explorer - Scan with Windows Defender.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I suspect I might be able to uninstall particular updates one by one to determine which one - but question as to what is best to do?</p>

<p>I have just come across the same problem on another Desktop PC. Looks exactly the same!</p>
<p>
</p><p>This PC uses an Intel rather than the AMD CPU and Graphics that the laptop use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Plus as it looks like you cannot hide/stop particular updates after the W10&nbsp; Creators Update - all my builds are the latest Windows 10 Version 1703 - there seems little point in determining which particular update may be responsible as it will automatically
 try and update later!</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point I am almost ready to restore things so that I can get back to the security centre. then disable it completely, then setup another known security program instead and carry on from there!</p>

<p>This is obviously a fairly common problem (something similar on hub feedback) and I am suprised it has not been highlighted on the net etc.&nbsp; Perhaps people who have it are completely unaware - as without 'opening' the centre you would not know!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Suspect it was the 2017-06 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1703 for x64-based Systems (KB4022725)&nbsp; as this requires a reboot to finish the update and all was OK until after that.</p>
<p>Suspect an earlier update (about a week or so) 2017-05 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1703 for x64-based Systems (KB4020102) would have caused same - but for some reason this 'failed' to install on a number of occasions (on this laptop anyway)'</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to track closer by uninstalling individual updates - that did not help as uninstalling that one still bad and W10 would not allow me to unistall another suspect. Only system recovery would take be back and I have now repeated this process 3 times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As this has happened on 2 out of 3 PC's have gone back on this one and installed altenative antivirus and reupdating that all works but same problem occurs with Defender Security Centre. If/when Microsoft sort out this problem I may get rid of that but I
 cannot afford to take a risk here. I suspect Windows Defender is still working and updating etc but ?????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Definitely updating signatures as can see no. if not date. I can only assume its still working for now though (added this note 17.53 15th June)</p>

<p>md986 was right about things here - both 'damaged' PC' s have now started working OK - well the Windows Defender Security Centre comes up as normal again and you can read and do things with it etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This happened some time today 16th June - was definitely still bad late yesterday, Only updates since then have been virus signature definitions as far as I&nbsp;can see on both of these PC's - so how/why suspect we will never know!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the help/guidance given here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Now on 28th June </p>
<p>2017-06 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1703 for x64-based Systems (KB4022716)</p>
<p>Has done the same thing again!</p>
<p>Is this something that consecutive W10 Cumulative updates are likely to do every time?</p>
<p>I find it hard to believe&nbsp;that Microsoft are unaware of this?</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It could be that the update did not install correctly or some updates are not yet installed on your device. We suggest that you check if there are updates waiting to be installed on your device.</p>

<p>Supposedly this PC was fully updated after that recent update AND having forced it some 12 hours later to check it still reports it is up to date!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Virus signatures (are as before) being updated by Windows Defender - but there is no proper access to the Windows Defender Security Centre.</p>

    <title>Unable to Install Lifecam HD-5000 using Windows 7 x64 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> fire cat  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to Install Lifecam HD-5000 using Windows 7 x64</h2>
                    Im trying to install Lifecam HD-5000 by following all the directions.&nbsp;During the Lifecam software installation it tells me to connect my USB camera but when I do nothing happens. I continue through the installation and when I bring up the Lifecam software
 it tells me that "There is no Camera connected to this computer. I have unistalled&nbsp;and reinstalled several times wtih the same results. I have installed from the&nbsp;installation disc and also from the&nbsp;Microsoft web site with no change. Tried several different
 USB ports still no change. The camera did work on another Windows XP machine so&nbsp;I know it is not the camera. Once the camera is&nbsp;connected via the USB port there is never in any indication in device manager that it has detected any hardware changes. There never
 is a imaging device listed. Please HELP!&nbsp;
