<h2>            Slimes in minecraft</h2>
                    
<p>Hello community, I have been playing the minecraft xbox 360 edition since it came out. I have been looking for the so called illusive slimes. I'm playing on an older map seed that does not contain clay. The map was mape about a month before the first bug
 update was released. I have wanted to find slimes in preparation for the 1.7 update with pistons, but i have had failure after failure after finding them. I have made multiple rooms in certain areas of the map at certain depths and watched&nbsp;videos&nbsp;as many people
 have had success doing the same thing. (My friend has a map seed the same age as mine and he has no problem finding slimes) What should i do to find these slimes?Multiple have told me that slimes DO spawn on older maps like mine. Any information or help would
 be greatly appreciated.</p>

                </div>

<p>I'm still playing a pre-patch world and I just found slimes yesterday. All I did was dig down to bedrock and started using TNT to clear about a 50X50X6 open space. Lit up the area with torches and after a few minutes they started spawning and they respawn
 just about every time I go back down there now. Might have been just luck finding it in the first area I cleared though.</p>

<h3> hyper0ptiikz  say:</h3>
<h2>            need for speed</h2>
                    
<p>so i want to buy a need for speed game but there plenty of choices availible and im a little confused</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>i like the more street racing style games with lots of car customisation not really into track simulation like games basicly looking for something thats like underground 2</p>
<p>but wichever one i go for it has to have a decent online playerbase or its kind of a waste of money</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>need for speed most wanted - this looks exactly what im looking for but i have no idea what the online playerbase is like</p>
<p>need for speed carbon - like the look of this one aswell but again no idea about the online playerbase</p>
<p>need for speed pro street - dont really know anything about this game</p>
<p>need for speed undercover - i think this is the style i like but i dont really know much about the game</p>
<p>need for speed shift - track simulation so not intrested</p>
<p>need for speed hot pursuit - no idea about this game from what i can gather theres no car customisation so dont think im really interested in this</p>
<p>need for speed shift 2 unleashed - another track simulation so not intrested</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>so yeah if anyone can tell me online playerbases wich games are street racing and feature car customisation that would be a massive help :D</p>

            <p>Ok, thank youi for reply. But,</p>
<p>
Come on.&nbsp;<br />
HD initially empty. I formated it and installed Windows 8.1 Update 1 enterpraise.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Ok Wifi Network works normal. Connected TV, tablet, everything works fine!&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So, I make my first Windows Update: St. automatically downloaded the following KB's:&nbsp;<br />
<br />
KB2949621&nbsp;<br />
KB2939471&nbsp;<br />
KB2938772&nbsp;<br />
KB2937220&nbsp;<br />
KB2919255&nbsp;<br />
KB2919442&nbsp;<br />
<br />
After restarting Windows, the wireless network does not work anymore. However, the TV and other connected devices continue.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Then I came to the conclusion that either of these updates are messing up the wireless network (the wired network works well).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So I decided to remove these updates to test. However, Windows does not allow me to remove (uninstall) these and only these updates. For other updates released this uninstall button.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
The network card is: Intel (R) PRO / Wireless 3945ABG Network. But the manufacturer only has drivers up windows Vista although it works fine until windows 8.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So how to proceed?

H) I remove the wireless driver through Device Manager and install it again the driver from the manufacturer and rebook: Wireless Network will not work.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
So I think you must find a way to remove one of hotfixs above so that the wireless network is working again or, in the latter case, buy a newer network card for Notebook.

Many of these devices such as HP Stream came in a variety of colors with a full copy of Windows 8.1. Attractive qualities include an affordable price and a 11 or 13 inch display. Along with the HP Stream were a variety of 8 inch Tablet devices such as such as the Dell Venue Pro. With the introduction of Windows 10, migrating these devices to Windows 10 might prove difficult because of their low storage capacity, but it is possible to do so. One of the limitations of introductory devices such as the HP Stream or Dell Venue Pro, they come with limited amounts of disk space, sometimes 32 or 16 GB configurations. This makes it difficult to install Windows 10 the conventional way.

<h2>            Appdata Roaming move from SSD to HDD</h2>
                    <p>Hi, recently bought a laptop with an ssd and a hdd. What i noticed was that every time i downloaded something, even though it was located in HDD, the SSD still took up space. I already moved the download, documents, etc. to the HDD.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then i noticed that whatever i download gets into the appdata/roaming folder as well, so is it ok to move the Roaming folder from SSD to HDD?</p>

<h2>            Cannot decrypt previously encrypted files</h2>
                    
<p>I had a folder which I apparently encypted on my old pc, and I moved that hard drive containing that folder onto my new pc as a 2nd hard drive. Now all the file names are green and I can't acess the file nor can I decrypt the files.</p>
<p>When I attempt to move the folder, it says I need permission from Fatso666/Eamon, which is my pc's name and my user name, ie the user I'm currently using....</p>
<p>I still have my old pc and so I exported the security certificate and then imported it onto my new pc, but when I attempt to untick the encrypt file option it says access denied.</p>

<p><span>Hi Fatso666,</span></p>
<p><span>If you get an access denied message when you try to open an encrypted file, the key that was used to encrypt the file is probably not on your
 computer. If you transferred the file from another computer, you need to get the key from that computer. If the file was encrypted by someone else, that person will need to add your certificate to the file before you can access it.</span></p>
<p><span>Try suggestion from the article below. (To add a certificate to an encrypted file)</span></p>

            Had a similar problem after my Windows 7 OS crashed and restored it on the same machine, same user id and could not access previously encrypted folders. The way I fixed I searched for *.pfx files, found one efs backup, right clicked on it and selected
 "Install PFX", then got another screen where I entered the password I used when I encrypted the folder, it accepted it and got the message my certificate was restored. Then went into the encrypted folder's property and select to remove encryption and it went
 trough Ok. Hope this helps........Vic

    <title>Taskbar and Start menu are all white - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ilovewhoseline  say:</h3>
<h2>            Taskbar and Start menu are all white</h2>
                    <p>When I was out yesterday and came back home, my computer's taskbar and start menu were all white and have no idea why that happened. The whole situation happened very recently before and I have tried the usual shutting down and rebooting, but nothing seems
 to be helping me out at all. Even tried force rebooting with no success. Can't even reboot my computer now because of the transparency and aero effects. Troubleshooting the problem did not help also. Does anyone know what is going on with my computer and why
 this is happening?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's really odd for the start menu to have an issue if you haven't done anything with it. There could be some changes happened without you noticing it while you're away. Can you provide us these information:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>What are the troubleshooting steps you've done so far?</li><li>Do you see any icons on your start menu?</li><li>Did you already perform the system file checker and DISM command in command prompt?</li><li>Can you provide us a screenshot of your concern?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your response.</p>

<p>What is "force reboooting?</p>

</p><p>If you don't tell us what troubleshooting steps you have already tried you are likely to get those suggestions again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like the Windows Themes Service might not be running and another symptom of the Themes Service not running is that the Windows Start button orb (bottom left hand corner) has changed to the word
<strong>Start</strong> and looks like this:</p>

            I don't get it though. Why does the Taskbar and Start Menu turn white every single time I either restart or reboot my computer? That should not be happening and instead should be the normal theme every time.

I have downloaded some fonts that I had on my old desktop using a older version of Microsoft Word, but I cannot get them to work on my new laptop. The problem is only with Office Home &amp; Student 2019 (which i purchased with this laptop) as the fonts work in
 other programs such as Photoshop and Paint.</p>

I'm presuming the fonts are not corrupt since they work in other programs? It seems that Office 2019 is the issue rather than the font itself.</p>

            Hi Vicki
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Apps &amp; features 
<br />Scroll down to Microsoft Office
<br />Select it
<br />Click Change
<br />
<br />Now, wait while the repair wizard starts up.
<br />
<br />Choose the type of repair you would like to perform. Depending on the severity or availability of your Internet connection, you could try the first option, Quick Repair, which is much faster and tries to fix the problem without a data connection.
<br />
<br />If that doesn’t resolve the problem, then go back and try the Online Repair option. For my particular issue, I ultimately had to use the Online Repair.
<br />
<br />The repair process is straight-forward following the wizard. Note that you’ll need to save your work and close all Office programs first, and then click Repair.
<br />
<br />Then wait while the repair process runs.
<br />
<br />You will notice the repair experience is similar to a fresh installation. The amount of time it takes will depend on your connection speed and what the issue is.
<br />
<br />You will see your Office apps light up in their respective colors while the repair completes.
<br />
<br />Once the installation is complete, restart your computer just to be sure and launch your apps and verify if the problem you were having is resolved.
<br />
<br />Check if you can now access the fonts.
        </p>

<p>Thank you both for the replies!<br />
</p>
<p>I have tried to do the repair and re-started the computer but it didn't work.</p>
<p>This is how my screen comes up - there isn't a repair wizard that launches and office doesn't show up on the programs list on control panel either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just clicked on repair and it came up with a circular moving cursor and then a tick, so not sure if it actually did anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I clicked on advanced options - and then repair from the reset menu.&nbsp;</p>

            In the left hand image what do you see if you select Advanced options. It should open the Office wizard and have an option to re-install, repair or uninstall Office.

<p>I can see that you're using the centennial office version (Microsoft Office Desktop Apps) - uninstall this then go to office.com/myaccount and download/install the Actual Microsoft office HS 2019 that you have. If your 2019 is installed, you should see on
 list of your installed apps the Microsoft Office Home and Student 2019. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps!</p>

            You are possibly asking two questions. The number of machines that can be in a Workgroup is unlimited. However, this would be impractical from a network bandwidth and computer management standpoint. Once you get more than 8-9 machines, it's time to be
 looking at setting up a domain with a real server.<br />
<br />
What you may really want to know is the inbound concurrent connections limitations to a pseudo-server. Although the limitations exist in Windows 7 just like they do in XP and Vista, I can't find an MS Knowledge Base article stating them. In XP and Vista the
 limits are 5 for Home Editions and 10 for Professional/Business Editions. Googling around I found Paul Thurrott's comparison chart which shows that all Editions of Windows 7 have a limit of 20 connections:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/win7/win7_skus_compare.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.winsupersite.com/win7/win7_skus_compare.asp</a>
<br />
<br />
Please note that the limitations are on c<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">onnections and not computers and/or users</span>
</em>. Each computer can - and often does - make multiple connections to a pseudo-server.<br />
<br />
If you'd like more help, please describe your planned setup and your end goal.

    <title>DVD-R VOB file imported to Movie Maker truncated - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tom von alten  say:</h3>
<h2>            DVD-R VOB file imported to Movie Maker truncated</h2>
                    <p>I have a DVD-R written with a Toshiba standalone recorder off of some old VHS tapes, 4 half-hour segments. I'm trying to import one of these so that I can pull out one segment and post it on YouTube. The DVD plays in full with Windows Media Player.</p>
<p>When I import the 0.98 GB VOB from the title of interest with Movie Maker (version 2011 build 15.4.3502.0922, running on Windows 7 Pro), it shows it as just 17 sec. Reviewing other posted questions, I see some have suggested renaming the VOB to MPG. That
 didn't change anything.</p>
<p>I also gave a try importing it with Live Photo Gallery, which did some weird stuff. Filed as if it were a "picture" rather than a video, and when trying to preview it, complains that "The file you are attempting to play has an extension (.VOB) that does
 not match the file format." But no matter: whether it's .VOB and I tell it to go ahead and try, or renamed to .MPG, it "previews" it with just a 17 sec. timeline.</p>
<p>The Photo Gallery previewer does run past 17 sec. when it plays, however! Not a lot, but some, and then it goes garbly and stops. If I pause and click the timeline, I jump to the rest of the video, as if it were a halfhour timeline! "Play" from there seems
 to give me 20-some sec. from wherever I start, then blargles and stops.</p>
<p>Another answer to a similar question talked about filters and codecs... and the Tools/Option/Compatibility tab, but this version of Movie Maker doesn't have a "Tools" menu, and the Options dialog doesn't have a tab or link for "Compatability."</p>
<p>So my question is...&nbsp; how do I rip my VOB file so I can edit it, etc.?</p>

<p>====================================<br />
Maybe you don't need Movie Maker for this task...the <br />
freeware VLC Media Player can record video as it is <br />
playing and then it will save it in the .mpg format.</p>

<p>=========================================<br />
Sorry...I was just trying to suggest a simple and easy alternative.</p>
<p>Windows Live Movie Maker does work successfully with VOB <br />
files on some systems and not on others. Why? I have no idea.</p>
<p>Anyway it may be worth a try to convert the VOB file to the WMV<br />
or DV-AVI format before importing into WLMM.</p>
<p>The following article written for Vista but still valid for Windows <br />
Live Movie Maker may be worth a look:</p>
<p>From DVD to Movie Maker 6... in Vista's Home Basic<br />
<a href="http://www.papajohn.org/Newsletters/185-DVDtoMM6inVistaHomeBasic.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.papajohn.org/Newsletters/185-DVDtoMM6inVistaHomeBasic.html</a></p>
<p>More info:</p>
<p>From DVD disc to Movie Maker<br />

<p>Actually...you can install Vista Movie Maker 6 on Win7 if you wish:</p>
<p>(FWIW...it's always a good idea to create a System <br />
Restore point before installing software or updates)<br />

<a href="http://noeld.com/programs.asp?cat=video#wmminst" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://noeld.com/programs.asp?cat=video#wmminst</a></p>
<p>And the following freeware converter may be worth a try:</p>
<p>SUPER © Simplified<br />
Universal Player Encoder &amp; Renderer<br />
<a href="http://www.videohelp.com/tools/SUPER" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.videohelp.com/tools/SUPER</a><br />
(the mirror download site is faster...it says:<br />
Download from mirror (direct link) (28.1MB) )<br />
<br />
(FWIW...it's always a good practice to create a<br />
System Restore point before installing new software)<br />
<br />
After installing SUPER...open the program...<br />
you will see two small circles in the upper left<br />
corner of the screen...tick the TOP circle.<br />
<br />
Now...drag/drop your .VOB files into the Active field.<br />
<br />
Output Container...choose...wmv<br />
<br />
Video Scale Size / No Change<br />
<br />
Left click the Encode button.<br />
<br />
Choose: Simple Profile / OK...<br />
<br />
Wait...</p>

<p>Dear Lisa- Support Engineer:</p>
<p>I would love it if you or someone would PROVIDE an answer, but <strong>please do not come by and MARK POSTS AS ANSWERS when they clearly are not responsive</strong> .</p>
<p>Yes, there are many good alternatives for video handling and editing besides Microsoft's Live MovieMaker, but the question has to do with how to FIX or WORK AROUND defects in that Microsoft product.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hi im new at thisforum stuff but im having the same problem. I sent some old VHS tapes off to be made into DVD format and when they came back i&nbsp;got&nbsp;some nice dics all in .vob format. Im not really familiar with all the file types but it played fine on VLC
 and media players. The problem is when i try and edit the vidoe on WLMM.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have windows 7 ultimate on thsi new pc and i have WLMM 2011 latest version which as previously stated&nbsp;IS compatible with VOB content. When i import the 90 min file, it shows up on WLMM but only as a&nbsp;55 second video. its very frustrating because out of
 the 3 discs containing vob files, one worked fine but the other 2 discs&nbsp;when imported, have much abbreviated file lengths. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried the file name change but no difference to the result. I also dont wanna mess around with cionverting files and like the other person , why should i have to, it says on WLMM that VOB is compatible.</p>
<p>Im a bit perplexed because the first disc i tried, and all teh VOB files moved accross to WLMM with no problems at all! i edited them and made a movie. But the other2 discs which were done with the same dvd converter company and taken with the same camera
 etc etc just wont work??</p>

<h2>            Can I use Bose AE2i headphones as a headset&#47;microphone&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have the Bose AE2i headphones (which include a mic). Is there some cable I can buy so that I can connect it to my xbox 360 controller, and have both the audio and the microphone work?</p>

<p>No there isn't a simple cable that would let you do that. From what I can see the Mic is integrated in the inline remote and designed for phones that support the three channel 3.5mm connector setup. Even the complicated methods of getting a PC headset with
 a stereo and mic cable wouldn't work.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>There are several ways to use your Headphones with the 360, but the Live chat would need to be solved using some other method. Possibly a 2.5mm cellphone headset that you could wear under your headphones which would plug into your controller. If you have
 a Kinect it can act as a microphone, but Live chat over speakers has always been incredibly quiet making it almost useless. Really if you want headphones and Xbox Live chat integration it's worth it just to buy a product designed for it.</p>

    <title>slow login and administartor account changed to guest account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            slow login and administartor account changed to guest account</h2>
                    <p>Orginal Title: Two issues with Windows 8:&nbsp; Very slow login and Guest account became administrator</p>
<p>
</p><p>For about two weeks, my daughter's Toshiba Satellite Windows 8 computer has had a very slow login process. It sometimes takes 15 or 20 minutes for the "please wait" prompt to take her to her sign-in screen. We've tried just about every fix for this, including
 disabling add-ins and deleting the One Drive utility that she doesn't use. We still haven't solved the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To top that off, we can't even restore her system because, somehow, a Guest account became the administrator on her laptop and we can't update because there's never been a password for the Guest account. We have tried a variety of things--from creating a
 new account and trying to make that or our two accounts the administrator in addition to Guest. Nothing has worked.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be willing to take her laptop down to restoring the system, but I can't because Guest is in charge. How can we change the administrator back to one of our two accounts so that we can do a system restore?</p>

            <p>Thanks for your help, Ajay. I finally just did a system restore that took it down to the Windows 8 installation and made myself the administrator once everything came back up about eight hours later. Then I deleted all the bloatware that came with the Toshiba
 laptop, especially all the junk Norton programs. I installed the 97 pending Windows updates with a clean boot and--abracadabra--problem solved!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is my daughter's laptop but, like any other college kid, she ends up downloading a lot of junk. Since I'm the administrator, I'll have some parental control over her laptop now.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thanks so much for your help with these issues. </p>

    <title>Resetting desktop folder defaults - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> darshan valia  say:</h3>
<h2>            Resetting desktop folder defaults</h2>
                    
<p>I wanted to change the location of my personal(user) files from the C: drive to another one. By mistake, I gave the location of the desktop folder as D:\. The outcome was not of my liking(instead of the desktop folder, I saw the drive folder(same icon and
 the blue used % bar). I tried to change the registry settings which was advised by another site. They told me to do the following changes:</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>For this, go to Start &gt; Run, enter "regedit" and search the keys listed below. You can create an expandable string value "Desktop" in "User Shell Folders" key, if this value does not exist.
<br />
<br />
Now, double-click the Value Name "Desktop" under "Shell Folders" and "User Shell Folders" keys respectively, to define a new path in their Value Data fields for your "Desktop" folder.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Registry entries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Registry Entry 1 :<br />
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\Shell Folders\]<br />
Key Type :Current User<br />
Value Name :Desktop<br />
Data Type :REG_SZ (String Value)<br />
Enabled Value :<br />
Disabled value :<br />
Other value :Define new path for Desktop folder. </li><li><br />
Registry Entry 2 :<br />
[HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders\]<br />
Key Type :Current User<br />
Value Name :Desktop<br />
Data Type :REG_EXPAND_SZ (Expandable String Value)<br />
Enabled Value :<br />
Disabled value :<br />
Other value :Define new path for Desktop folder.<br />
</li></ul>
<p>"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did this, and it has come back to normal. However, <strong>the desktop folder in the user directory remains hidden</strong> , even when I set the default path(the check-box for the hidden option is greyed). The default icon for Desktop has also changed
 to the default folder icon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I want the Desktop folder as it is. How do I go about doing this?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: All this has been done in the administrator account.</p>

<p>I solved the "hidden folder" problem by changing the attributes of the desktop folder. It was set to RHSD, I changed it to RD, removing the hidden and system attributes using the "attrib" command.</p>
<p>However, there is <strong>NO "desktop.ini"</strong> file in the desktop folder, or it is hidden in such a way that I cannot view it in 7-Zip file manager. Does this create a problem?. How do I go about doing this? All I know is that there is [.ShellClassInfo]
 written on top, and there are two other things, namely LocalizedResourceName and IconResource. What do I have to write in these two?</p>
<p>Do help.</p>

                    <p>I have reached the 10 device limit that Microsoft has nebulously derived and can no longer install apps from the Microsoft store on other computers I use. Sure, there are simple solutions like creating another account, not using apps from the Microsoft store,
 or just not using Microsoft products in general.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But, let's play the game for a minute. Part of the issue is that I've rehabilitated some older computers and upgraded them from Home to Pro via the easy upgrade path ($99) through the Store. In the past, I've had one of these computers crash and needed to
 start from scratch. I was only able to get back to Pro (and with difficulty at that) because the digital license for the upgrade was tied to my account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now the problem: if I play Microsoft's game and deactivate one of these computers, then am I losing access to the digital license which upgraded me to Pro?&nbsp; I have to think it will be a problem because if I tried to reinstall any app from the Store (even
 the upgrade) it will give me the same 10 device limit BS and I'll have to deactivate another device with no guarantee I'll be able to get back my Pro license.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And before you answer this question, please know that I've been working with MS products since back when MS-DOS was shipped on floppy disks. If you haven't actually done the procedure I'm describing above then your opinion is great but is not helpful. I'm
 interested in someone who has actually upgraded a device to Pro with the Microsoft Store option, deactivated that computer from their list, reinstalled Windows Home on that computer, then tried getting back to Pro with their previous digital license.

<p>
</p><p>Thank you and Microsoft, if you're listening: when you make it hard for people to use your products or install apps (why is there even a device limit on free apps?) then don't be surprised that developers don't want to make apps for your store. If you're
 worried that someone will pay for an app then install it on a thousand devices then just set the counter on the app itself (i.e. $4.99 buys you 10 or 20 licenses) rather than setting the limit on the number of devices. If you want people to buy desktops, then
 convince your partners to sell Windows 10 Pro as an option on their lower cost systems.</p>

            The digital license for Windows 10 Pro would be the tied the machine, so reinstalling Windows 10 Home would be redundant. All you would need to do if the machine crashed or you replaced the hard disk would be to reinstall Windows 10 Pro directly.
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Keep in mind, the Windows 10 Pro Pack upgrade from the Store based on my discussions with Microsoft is an upgrade, but it has no transfer rights. So, if you bought a Windows 10 Home retail license and upgrade it to the $99 Pro license, its not transferable to another computer. Its actually stuck with that machine.
<br />
<br />As for the 10 device limit, if you want to decomission a machine and bring another one online, you can always log into <a href="http://account.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://account.microsoft.com/devices</a>
<br />
<br />Remove the registered machine. This will not affect the machines license, since having a registered machine only facilitates easier reactivation through the activation troubleshooter or services such as Find my device.

<p>With all due respect, sir, you are incorrect and have misunderstood my question. As I noted in my original question, I value opinions but was interested in someone who has done the process. I am well-versed in the theory of how Microsoft believes its products
 will work and I am even better versed in the reality.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a computer is purchased from an OEM (e.g. Dell) as Windows Home, then is upgraded to Windows 10 Pro via the Store, there is no process to get directly to Windows 10 Pro if the system completely crashes. What will occur is that you will need to either
 use the recovery disc or original recovery media which will be Windows 10 Home. Then you will need to upgrade to Pro again through the Store. In my experience,
<em>having actually done this</em>, I needed to sign in with my account that had the digital license. Getting the system to recognize the license was a painful process as it took many updates to get to right version of Windows 10 Home, then having the store
 recognize that I had a digital license on that computer. I was not trying to transfer a license to a different system, just recover from a catastrophic crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, thank you for chiming in but I am really only interested in someone who has actually completed the process. I'm wondering whether anyone at Microsoft has actually done this...</p>

<h2>            Folder picture for thumbnails and moving folders </h2>
                    
<p>It bothers me that some of my folders cannot put a folder picture instead of the default one (which include file and pictures in the folder at the same time). It worked for some folders but doesn't for some others.</p>
<p>I don't know why but i can't move the files or folders order anymore as i could in previous window OS. For example, drag picture B in front of picture A. I find that pretty lame that i can only classified them by category (like date, size and such).</p>

Microsoft intentionally removed the option to disable Auto Arrange, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
but it's still possible with a workaround.</span> &nbsp; See the Auto Arrange links below.

<p>Unfortunately when Microsoft redesigned Windows Explorer they made some pretty horrendous decisions - of which many people have complained about. There are many other file managers available, both free and for a price. One of them might be easier to use

<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Most important features to fix or return to Windows Explorer:</span></strong>
<p>1) The option to disable Auto Arrange.<br />
<br />
2) Fix The Left Pane Scroll Bug: If you are viewing a folder and expand it in the left pane to show it's subfolders, the folder is annoyingly auto-scrolled to the bottom of the pane causing the subfolders to not be shown, making it difficult to work with. Double
 clicking a folder in the left pane can also cause this problem.&nbsp; <strong><a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/WindowsServerFeedback/feedback/details/621426/bug-when-expanding-folders-in-explorer-server-2008-r2-and-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Vote to fix it.</a>
</strong><br />
<br />
3) When multiple files are selected they should stay selected when changing the sorting order (ex: Name to Size). Maintaining selected files when sorting should be a requirement and this feature should not have been removed.<br />
<br />
4) The option to remember each folder's view settings (remembering individual folder window sizes and positions).<br />
<br />
5) The option to remove "Full row selection" for details view. "Full row selection" is very annoying when the folder is full and has no empty space to click on. Also, when dragging/dropping files to a different folder - if you release the file on the row of
 a subfolder or .exe/.zip/.rar file "full row selection" causes the file to be moved into the subfolder or .exe/.zip/.rar file rather the the intended folder.<br />
<br />
6) A search window with all the advanced search options. No syntax required.<br />
<br />
7) The option to always show free disk space and folder size in the status bar and/or details pane. Also always automatically show the size of selected files (when many files are selected it will not show the total size).<br />
<br />
8) The option to scroll the pane your mouse is in with mouse wheel even if that pane is not selected.</p>

<p>Left pane scroll bug (and other fixes):</p>
<strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Using Classic Shell To Restore Some Features To Windows Explorer</span></strong>
<p>After installing the free <a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Classic Shell</a> you can customize Windows Explorer closer to how you want it, the quote below is just one way to do so.&nbsp;<a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/features.html#explorer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Click here</a> to see some of the options you can
 customize, and here is the&nbsp;<a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/faq.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">FAQ page</a> for Classic Shell.</p>
<blockquote>A solution which did work for restoring some features.
<p>1) Install the free&nbsp;<a href="http://classicshell.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Classic Shell.</a> &nbsp;This is very customizable, and works as a mod for Windows Explorer rather than a full blown replacement. You didn't need to install the Classic Start Menu
 option, but you can if you want.<br />
2) Reboot the computer.<br />
3) Launch Windows Explorer (Start - Computer) and turn on "Always Show Menus" (Organize - Layout - check Menu Bar). This is just for configuration, you can turn it off again afterwards if you want.<br />
4) Right click on the menu bar and turn on the "Classic Explorer Bar". This adds a series of cut/copy/paste icons to Explorer. Crucially, it also adds the "Configuration" icon.<br />
5) Go into the configuration and from here you can tweak things to your heart's content. To kill the horrible Windows 7 folder-jumping, switch the "Navigation Pane Style" to Vista. You can even knock it back to XP mode if you want (this adds in the lines to
 the folder tree and adds a classic "+" icon for expanding folders). The Windows Vista style folder view looks pretty much the same as the Windows 7 view, but gets rid of the horrible jumping.<br />
6) Tweak any other settings you want.</p>
<p>After this, you can turn the toolbar and menus back off in Explorer if you wish. Windows Explorer looks largely the same, but folders no longer jump around.&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/WindowsServerFeedback/feedback/details/621426/bug-when-expanding-folders-in-explorer-server-2008-r2-and-windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Vote
 for Microsoft to fix this bug.</a> </strong></p>
<p>Now, if only MS could code properly so that we don't have to mess with third party apps to get Windows to actually work properly...</p>
