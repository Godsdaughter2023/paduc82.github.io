    <title>All in One Lenovo &#47; Windows Camera Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> maddygarcia  say:</h3>
<h2>            All in One Lenovo &#47; Windows Camera Issue</h2>
                    I'm not too sure if this is&nbsp;a windows issue or the make of the computer but my camera in the all in one Lenovo b320 does not work at all. I upgraded from windows 7 to 10 and have downloaded drivers said to fix the issue but I still have the same result.
 Can someone reach out to me sometime tomorrow to explain how this works and why the camera that is built in does not function?

            I would recommend that you perform a Windows 10 repair upgrade. Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings. (You will not lose any data while backup is a good idea) Below is a good guide to perform repair upgrade

    <title>Stuck Media Creation Tool - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marcusaquinas  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stuck Media Creation Tool</h2>
                    <p>I have a new Windows 8.1 computer and am trying to use the Media Creation Tool for Windows 10 since I'd like to do a clean install rather than an upgrade. The tool apparently downloaded just fine, but after launching, it sat on a purple screen with grayed
 out Back and Next buttons and a little circle running for about half an hour. I tried to close the window, which took another 10 or 15 minutes, after which it shut down the computer. I wasn't babysitting it, so couldn't say whether anything popped up before
 the shutdown. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thinking that perhaps the tool needed to run with elevated privileges, I ran it as an administrator. This time it asked me whether I wanted to put the installation files on a flash drive or create an iso. I chose the flash drive (16GB and blank) and it once
 again went to the purple screen with the grayed out Back and Next buttons and the little circle running around.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Task Manager shows the Modern Setup Host process fluctuating between 0% and 0.1% CPU usage (mostly zero), which I think would be normal since it's an i7 and this should not be a demanding process. Memory usage sat solidly at 25.9 to 26MB, but there was
 absolutely zero disk or network usage from the process, so it appears to be idling or awaiting input, but there is nothing showing to indicate this. Any suggestions? Thanks.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your response, but I resolved the problem through other means.&nbsp;Andre's suggestions were things that I had already done prior to attempting the installation. The problem apparently turned out to be an OS version incompatibility, although it
 took a couple more attempts to get past it. Once I had the correct installer, the installation was mostly smooth; nothing that I was not able to resolve or work around on my own. I still have no explanation as to why the blank purple screen, but since I have
 worked past that problem, I will leave it to the software engineers and quality assurance folks to puzzle out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A couple of&nbsp;suggestions for improvement, though. First, I was attempting a clean install on a different machine, so instructed the installer to keep no apps, settings or files as I made backups of everything I wanted to keep and made sure that I had the
 installation media for all of the apps I wanted to reinstall. Unbeknownst to me, the installer made a full backup of the old Windows installation, but hid it. Imagine my surprise after the installation to find that my 500GB internal drive was 80% full. A quick
 look at the C:\ drive revealed&nbsp;only about 40 or 50 GB&nbsp;in the root directory, which matched up with what I was expecting. A bit of investigating revealed an additional 350GB of the hidden backup. I suspect that this was done to provide that promised ability
 to roll back to the previous OS within 30 days, but in my understanding of the phrase, "keep nothing" means exactly that.&nbsp;It does not mean "keep everything, but hide it so that it looks like it's not there." A bit of warning during the setup process would
 have been good.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, there was no ability to partition or format drives. I suspect that this will show up when regular installation media becomes available, but would have been nice to have been included. I happen to be one of those folks that thinks installing a new
 OS onto a completely blank drive is the better practice.</p>

            <p>I will add one other tidbit that might be helpful to others with similar issues. For upgrade installations, it is possible to do a clean install, minus the partitioning capability.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, make a backup of your data files, run the normal upgrade and let it do whatever you want to let it do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, after the upgrade has got you back to a desktop, go into "Update and Security" in Settings and select "Recovery" from the left panel. Select "Reset this PC" in the right panel and follow the prompts from there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It will take a while, depending on how big your drives are, but you can reformat them and lay down the OS only. Be sure to have current drivers for all of your hardware and peripherals on hand. You might not need them as Win10 was pretty solid about having
 compatible drivers for everything except my graphics card (it's a gamer thing), but better safe than sorry. You will need to reinstall your apps and restore your data files, but that's about as clean as you can get.</p>

    <title>Computer won&#39;t reconnect to Internet after sleep mode - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> neil shepherd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer won&#39;t reconnect to Internet after sleep mode</h2>
                    
<p>This appears to be a common problem, but I have only recently started to experience it. I have found plenty of suggestions but no satisfactory solution after several hours of research.</p>
<p>I am running a wired ADSL Ethernet connection using a Broadcom Netlink Gigabit network card and a Zyxel 660HW modem. The Internet connection works fine except when I wake the computer from sleep mode. In the past the computer would always reconnect automatically&nbsp;to
 the Internet after sleep mode, but now it usually does not. I stress “usually” as sometimes the computer DOES reconnect, but more commonly I get a red cross over the connection icon and Vista&nbsp;informs me that the network cable is unplugged (which is rubbish).
 I can reconnect by doing some or all of the following:</p>
<p>Physically disconnecting and reconnecting the cable<br />
Going to Device Manager, locating the network card and disabling and re-enabling the device<br />
Turning the modem off and on again</p>
<p>This problem never occurs when I shut the computer down fully and restart.</p>
<p>I have tried the following suggestions:</p>
<p>Unchecking the “Allow the computer to turn off...” box in the network card’s Power Management settings<br />
Disabling IPv6<br />
Using a different cable<br />
Running the ipconfig release/renew commands<br />
Setting a different duplex speed<br />
Updating all relevant drivers/firmware/BIOS<br />
Checking in BIOS for sleep mode options (there aren't any)<br />
Restoring the computer to the earliest possible time</p>
<p>The above are the most commonly suggested “fixes” but none of them solves the problem permanently.</p>
<p>I did wonder if the modem or network card is at fault but I experienced wake-up internet connection problems with a Speedtouch USB modem too. I also know other people who are experiencing the same thing with Windows 7.</p>
<p>I write this more in hope than expectation as the problem has been around for a while and seems to come and go without anybody knowing what causes it. Of Vista’s many bugs this is one of the most annoying as sleep mode is a useful facility and I can’t use
 it while the problem persists. The fact that this problem does not happen every time suggests to me that the sleep/wake cycle is not always functioning as it should – perhaps it has been compromised by a dodgy update.</p>
<p>Any enlightenment gratefully received.</p>

            I had these same problems running Windows 7 with a 3600hgv gateway (Uverse) and an Intel 82562v-2 10/100 network adapter.&nbsp; All suggested solutions did not work until another forum led me to try changing "Link Speed &amp; Duplex" in the adapter's Properties&gt;Advanced
 from "Auto Negotiation" to "100 Mbps Full Duplex".&nbsp; Problem solved.&nbsp; Note: I still have "Allow the computer to turn off..." unchecked, but I don't think that had anything to do with resolving the problem.<br />

<h2>            Skype account hacked &#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello ,<br />
while i was online on my (firewalled/antivirused) desktop skype account a message was sent to all my contacts , containing an ad and a link.<br />
the first thing in mind was that my hotmail linked mail was hacked , BUT ... the message was sent also to contacts who hadn't yet accepted the "friend request" or deleted me from their contact list , to whom skype's application/program prohibits me from typing
 them a message.<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/016ed105-f9db-4bae-8d2c-7306764abf00?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/016ed105-f9db-4bae-8d2c-7306764abf00?upload=true" height="327" width="805" /></a><br />
SO ... i was wondering how it could be possible for such a message to be sent ?????&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Does anyone have any idea or similar situation?&nbsp; <br />
</p>
<p>thnx in advance</p>
<p><br />
P.S. : The "messaging disabled until request is accepted" is so suspicious,do we deserve any advertisment fees from microsoft? :P<br />
P.P.S. : The contacting a "live", microsoft, support, agent service needs fixing.1 user waiting----&gt;45 minutes waiting for response -----&gt; cut off after 10-20 seconds after&nbsp; 2 lines.

<p><span>Also, perform a

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As for the “messaging disabled until request is accepted” - this is a feature of sending one’s initial message that would also serve as a contact
 request. You’d only be able to send a second message once the recipient replies to your message and you’ve been added as a contact.

<p>Hi Cindy,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Active hours only pause necessary restarts when an update installation is complete. Windows 10 will still download and install updates in the background. If you really need to pause Windows Update downloads and installation to maximize the performance of
 your PC, you can simply enable <strong>Pause</strong> <strong>Updates</strong>. With
<strong>Pause</strong> <strong>Updates</strong>, updates will be paused temporarily for a maximum of 7 days. To enable
<strong>Pause</strong> <strong>Updates</strong>, select the <strong>Start</strong> button, go to
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Update &amp; security</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced options</strong>, and then toggle
<strong>Pause Update</strong> to <strong>On</strong>. Please be reminded that this feature is only available on the latest version of Windows 10, Version 1703 or Creators Update.</p>

<h2>            Using the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant to download and install received &#34;Windows 8 installation has failed&#34;</h2>
                    Hello, I am having trouble upgrading my Windows 7 to Windows 8.<br />
<br />
I used the Windows 8 Upgrade Assistant to purchase and download the Windows 8 upgrade. Everything went smoothly until the installation, where it almost immediately gave me a pop up saying "Windows 8 installation has failed". I have tried running the installer
 multiple times with the same results.<br />
<br />
What gives? I was really looking forward to using Windows 8, but now I feel like a sucker for getting it on release day...<br />
<br />
Here is a screenshot of what happens: http://i.imgur.com/9tU5e.png<br />

            <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an attempt to make this thread a little easier to follow, below you will find a list of things that are helping people to get Windows 8 installed
 when you’re receiving the “Windows 8 installation has failed” message.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are numerous things that can prevent the Windows 8 installation and what fixes one computer may not fix another as each computer is different.

            <p>Discovered when I looked under SHARE in Windows Explorer on the Desktop that there was a user account Updatus User.&nbsp; Turns out this is a standard user account created by the install of the NVidia Control Panel.&nbsp; The purpose is to run update checking and
 install the latest version of the graphics drivers, etc.&nbsp; Could also be a security loophole since NVidia software is administering this user account.&nbsp; If you go to Programs and Features, you can remove the NVidia update service, which on a reboot of the computer,
 removes this user account.</p>

            <p>You need to read the documentation that came with your laptop and see what media types your drive supports.</p>
<p>If you're trying to create a set of recovery disks, you'll probably need DVD+R DL 8.5gb or DVD-R 4.7gb.</p>
<p>It will most likely take four or five&nbsp;DVD-R 4.7gb disks to create a set.</p>

            I agree with Charlie, its likely that you need blank DVD media. Its possible the recovery files span more than 1 GB and needs a larger medium to store it. When I was creating recovery disc for my HP workstation, it asked me to provide two blank DVDs.

<h2>            Brightness issue Fallout 4</h2>
                    
<p>Hi all!</p>
<p>I have been having an issue with the brightness of my Fallout 4 game. during gameplay, the brightness keeps adjusting ever couple of seconds. I have checked all options on my TV, and even used another TV. Furthermore, I have reinstalled the game and reset
 my XBOX. Despite all this, the probem persists. I read that this is an issue exclusive to XBOX preview members. Does anyone know a fix or whether this will be fixed in an update?</p>

<p>Kind regards</p>

<p>Ser Bullfrog's fix worked for me! As mentioned before, some TV's may not work in PC RGB mode. Also, everything is slightly darker. This is mentioned when you turn on PC RGB. However, personally I think Fallout 4 look a little better for it. Hope this works
 for anyone else having this problem. And thank you very much Ser Bullfrog!</p>

<p>I FIXED IT! &nbsp;The fix that works for me is: Go to Xbox One Dashboard&gt;settings&gt;Display and Sound&gt;Video Output&gt;Color Space</p>
<p>Change this option to PC RGB This will fix the screen brightness flicker that has been annoying the crap out of everyone! &nbsp;NOTICE: Some displays may not support this setting, sorry for that, I have no other fix; this is just what worked for me.</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;Carefully place your pointer along side edge until it becomes double headed arrow and pull it in to reduce width then do same with top or bottom edge and do the same to reduce height, this will reduce size somewhat but not too much and of course reversing
 the process will make them bigger but I guess you don't want that. Why you can make them much bigger but not too much smaller I don't know. If there is another way to make them smaller than I've said here I'm sure someone will say.</p>

            Hi Louise,<br />
<br />
Were you able to change the size of the sticky notes before? Did you do any updates on your computer prior to this issue? We have replicated the concern on a Windows 10 computer and we were still able to change its size by dragging from the bottom right corner
 of the page. To isolate the concern, can you try doing it on another computer?<br />
<br />
We will wait for your feedback.<br />
<br />
Regards.<br />
<p />

    <title>Xbox One squeaking noise - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> samuel jervis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One squeaking noise</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there,</p>

<p>I was wondering if anyone else has encountered this squeaking noise every now and again coming from the area by the fan? I have already had an Xbox replaced because the noise became constant and louder but the my replacement console started making the noise
 again but a lot quieter and not as often.</p>

<p>Any help will be appreciated.</p>

<p>Try holding the power button on the front of the console until it turns off then unplug it from the outlet for 30 sec then plug back in and power back on. Hopefully the hard reset will work. If this doesn't work I would return the console to the store you
 bought it from. Hopefully you still have your original receipt. It should be making any noises at all. Not like you described.</p>

<p>I did the hard reset and it stopped the noise forma while but from time to time it does it again. Could it be because the Xbox console is getting too warm? I had a day one edition and had no problems up until about a month ago because of a loud squeaking
 noise then had that swapped and now the replacement does it, to be honest I'm getting very fed up with this.</p>
