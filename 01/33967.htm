<h2>            shortcut icons appear as generic icons not company logos</h2>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Does it happen with any particular websites shortcuts or it happens with all the shortcuts?</p>
<p><span>If for any reason, one or more icons are not showing correctly, you can repair by rebuilding the icon cache. Icon cache is a hidden
 file located at the Local Folder. Here is how to do it:<br />
<br />
1. Open Windows Explorer (any folder/drive).<br />
<br />
2. As the IconCache is a hidden file, you need to enable “Show hidden files” option to see the same. To do this, head over to Tools &gt; Folder Options, switch to View tab, and finally enable Show Hidden files, folders, and drives option.<br />
<br />
3. Now navigate to C:\Users\username\AppData\Local&nbsp; folder and then delete IconCache.db file.<br />
<br />
4. Reboot your computer to rebuild the icon cache.<br />
<br />
5. All icons should be displayed correct now. <br />
<br />
But, before rebuilding icon cache, I'd suggest you to <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/System-Restore-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
create a restore point</a> .</span></p>

<p>Chances are the HP computer came with a McAfee free-trial preinstalled. Did you (a) upgrade the free-trial to a paid version on 23 July or did you (b) uninstall the free-trial and then install the paid version?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What has McAfee Support had to say about the compatibility of LastPass with your currently-installed McAfee application (e.g., McAfee LiveSafe)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fact: McAfee (and Norton) applications are <em>notorious </em>for not uninstalling
<em>or upgrading</em> cleanly. The "leftovers" may be your troublemaker here, not "Windows Security."</p>

<p>Roll up your sleeves, cross your fingers &amp; try the following multi-step fix...</p>
<p>
</p><p>ACTIONS</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>[You&nbsp;will want to print these instructions for offline reference.&nbsp; &nbsp;IMPORTANT&nbsp;=&gt; DON'T SKIP&nbsp;ANY STEP &amp; perform all Steps in one, uninterrupted session!&nbsp; If a Step says to reboot,
<em>reboot!</em>]</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Right-click on the following link, select SAVE TARGET AS... &amp; download the&nbsp;McAfee Consumer Products&nbsp;Removal Tool, saving it to your desktop:&nbsp;<a href="http://us.mcafee.com/apps/supporttools/mcpr/mcpr.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://us.mcafee.com/apps/supporttools/mcpr/mcpr.asp</span></a>
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Over the years we've learned that sometimes it's too late for these removal tools to "come to the rescue." This may be another one of those times.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>2. Close all open applications (i.e., anything with an icon on the taskbar).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">After making certain you have a copy of your Product Key handy</span>, uninstall&nbsp;<strong>McAfee LiveSafe</strong>&nbsp;(I assume) via
<strong>Start | Control Panel | Programs |</strong><strong> Programs and Features</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. IMPORTANT! =&gt; Make <em>certain </em>that Windows Defender Antivirus&nbsp;&amp; the Windows Firewall are both enabled (turned on)
<em>immediately</em> after rebooting! [Should happen automatically but I want you to check.]</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>NB: You're "working without a net" now: Don't to ANYTHING <em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">else</span></em> online (e.g., browsing; reading email; chatting) until you've completed&nbsp;Step #7&nbsp;below!
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>5. Right-click on the file you saved in #1 above and select <strong>Run as Administrator</strong> to run the&nbsp;McAfee utility. Don't TOUCH your keyboard until the run completes, then reboot&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>6. Do a clean install of <strong>McAfee </strong><strong>LiveSafe </strong>(or whatever) using your Product ID, if need be&nbsp;&amp; reboot. If you purchased your software directly from McAfee, go to
<a href="https://home.mcafee.com/Secure/Protected/Login.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<p>
</p><p>7. Manually and repeatedly update the McAfee application until you get a "no more updates" prompt.</p>
<p>
</p><p>8. Reset Internet Explorer 11 (not Edge)&nbsp;per the instructions on this page: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/923737/how-to-reset-internet-explorer-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

    <title>Guild Master vs Nightingale - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> adventsoul05  say:</h3>
<h2>            Guild Master vs Nightingale</h2>
                    
<p>So I finally finish the Thieves guild quest line after finding out I could finish it even though I sold the armor...</p>
<p>and I get the guild master armor and decided to take a look at it.&nbsp; It looks like the one you get when you first join but it's black.&nbsp; The stats aren't too bad imo.&nbsp; But I am currently wearing the Nightingale armor and aside from the head enchant I like
 the look of it compared to the Guild Master one.</p>
<p>With that said which would benefit a stealth/archer more?</p>
<p>I know the Nightingale gives 20% more damage to one handed but I rarely use my daggers as is.&nbsp; The Guild Master set just pretty much increases my lockpicking, pickpocketing and gives me better prices as well as a bigger carrying capacity(which is a huge
 thing in my book seeing as a thief is always snatching something up).</p>
<p>I honestly wish the Nightingale had the GM stats because the GM outfit just doesn't look right compared to the Nightingale Q_Q</p>
<p>Really wish one of the outfits gave a bonus to archery damage or something DX</p>

<p>Was wanting input on what others thought would benefit the stealth/archer more. &nbsp;Both give stats a stealth/archer could use even though the GM armor gives an upgraded lockpicking/pickpocketing bonus. &nbsp;Once you reach 100 with those two though then that becomes
 somewhat meaningless doesn't it?</p>
<p>Dunno, just throwing things out there and looking for input mostly. &nbsp;I tend to enjoy the advice others give, non-trollish of course :)</p>

<p>Spending points in the appropriate skill trees, upgrading your gear with Smithing and Enchanting are your best bet. &nbsp;I can craft my own set of armor that blows any armor sets available in the game completely out of the water.</p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Best advice yet. All guild armor in the game sucks compared to what you can make yourself. The absolute best gear I have found so far has been a complete joke compared to my Legendary Dragonscale with all my enchantments.

<p>Hello,<span><br />
<br />
<span>Please visit this page&nbsp;<strong><span><a href="https://commerce.microsoft.com/PaymentHub/PaymentInstrument" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></span></strong>&nbsp;and take a look at your account balance, does it show up in points or currency (this&nbsp;<strong>cannot&nbsp;be
 undone</strong>)?</span><br />
<br />
If the balance is showing as currency then it means the following:<br />
<br />
A.) You or someone that uses your console has registered the console for the Xbox 360 Dashboard Beta back in July. This can be seen with the "Beta" channel on the dashboard. If you don't have this "Beta" channel, then the console you're on does not have the
 dashboard beta.<br />
<br />
<strong>OR</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>B.) You've downloaded your profile to a console that has the beta and your account&nbsp;has&nbsp;been converted from using Microsoft Points to your local currency.</strong><br />
<br />
-<br />
<br />
<span>If it's option B (sounds like it in your case), then this means that<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>you can only make purchases on the console that has the beta dashboard</strong>. This dashboard will be released to everyone later
 this year (<strong>Fall 2013 - no other specific date just yet</strong>). There's unfortunately no way to get the beta dashboard on any other console as beta registration is now closed.</span><br />
<br />
Once you've made any sort of purchases you can then return back to your console and re-download that content using your download history (Dashboard &gt; Settings &gt; Account &gt; Download History).</span></p>

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span>We appreciate raising this concern to us. We may need to ask a few information to isolate the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>*Was the device exposed to any liquid?&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Have you try to connect the type cover to another Surface device and the check if the issue still there?</p>
<p><span>*When did this issue start?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>*Is this working before?</span></p>
<p><span>*W<span>hat are the troubleshooting steps performed?</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>You may try these steps to troubleshoot the issue:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>1.Go to </span><strong>Windows &gt; Power &gt; Restart</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>2.Go to </span><strong>Settings &gt; Ease of Access &gt; Keyboard</strong><span>. Check for settings like
</span><strong>Filter Keys</strong><span> and make sure its off.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>3. Next steps we will perform <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4036280/surface-force-a-shut-down-and-restart-your-surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>Hi Christopher, thanks for the speedy reply.</p>
<p>No liquids, no other devices. It started about a month ago but worked fine since it's purchase (2015?). I disconnected and reconnected the keyboard a few times, ran updates, restarted and checked the filter key setting (off) and none of those have worked
 yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

<div>Step 1:&nbsp; &nbsp; Press and hold the power button on your Surface for 30 seconds and then</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; </div>
<div>Step 2:&nbsp; &nbsp; Press and hold the volume-up button and the power button at the same</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; The screen may flash the Surface logo, but continue holding the buttons</div>

<div>Step 3:&nbsp; &nbsp; After you release the buttons, wait 10 seconds.</div>

<div>Step 4:&nbsp; &nbsp; Press and release the power button to turn your Surface back on. You</div>

<strong>1. </strong>Check with Dell Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their forums<br />
about any known issues. If this is a new computer Dell as OEM is responsible for the proper<br />
operation of both the hardware and Windows. So regardless of the cause it is theirs to resolve.<br />
Update the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the major on-board and separate device drivers<br />
(especially the Atheros Bluetooth drivers - all of those can affect the BT). See driver update<br />
methods below.<br />
<br />
BiosVersion = A04<br />
BiosReleaseDate = 04/03/2014<br />
SystemManufacturer = Dell Inc.<br />
SystemProductName = Inspiron 3847<br />
SystemSKU = Inspiron 3847&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
BaseBoardManufacturer = Dell Inc.<br />
BaseBoardProduct = 088DT1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />

<br />
<strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.<br />
<br />
</strong>This "could" be a power supply problem though it is not the most common cause.</p>
<p>9f is&nbsp;likely a driver issue.&nbsp;Antivirus/antispyware/security programs can also cause these issues.<br />
Have you added devices lately or updated drivers - be sure to check in Windows Updates to see<br />
if a driver was updated prior to this occurring. This could also be caused by a loose card or cable<br />
and even a weak power supply.<br />
<br />
That error means a driver is not handling the power state properly. Check in Control Panel - Device<br />
Manager to be sure major drivers are not shut off during sleep - double click Display Adapter - NIC<br />
and WIFI - Sound and others - Power Management tab - uncheck Allow computer to turn off power.<br />
Maybe only one has an issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
<strong>Start - type in Search box - MSCONFIG&nbsp; find at top - Right Click - RUN AS ADMIN<br />
<br />
General Tab - check Diagnostic Start&nbsp; - APPLY / OK&nbsp; -&nbsp; REBOOT<br />
<br />
Try it now. If it still blue screens think Video Driver. If not think NIC, Wifi, Sound, or......<br />
(and it still could be video interacting with something else). See&nbsp;troubleshooter link<br />
above for my generic driver update methods.<br />

<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244617</span></a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Start - type in Search box -&gt; verifier /reset&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; hit enter to disable<br />
<br />
Use BlueScreenView to see if there is a driver specified in the error message. Also check with<br />
MyEventViewer at the time of the BlueScreen.<br />
<br />
If DriverVerifier creates a minidump upload it and post the link here so we can analyze it.<br />
<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :&nbsp;<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :&nbsp;Run DriverView&nbsp;- set VIEW to Hide<br />
Microsoft drivers -&nbsp;update those without Dump in their names.&nbsp;(Also update the BIOS and<br />
chipset drivers at the System/Motherboard Maker's site.)<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate<br />
Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click -<br />
Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<p>Installing and updating drivers in 7 (updating drivers manually using the methods above is preferred<br />
to ensure the latest drivers from System maker and Device makers are found)<br />
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/43216-installing-updating-drivers-7-a.html</span></a><br />
<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be<br />
older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then<br />
go look for new ones manually if you wish.<br />

            <p>Unfortunately, Asus does not support your motherboard for Windows 10. Asus only supports your motherboard for Windows 8 with a BIOS update. Maybe if you update your BIOS, you may be able to run Windows 10 because the same BIOS update also resolves an issue
 with NVidia GTX cards.</p>
<p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">You could face this issue when the Mail’s message store is unable to locate the database and it is quite possible that the message store has become corrupt.<span>&nbsp;
</span>To resolve this issue, try deleting the message store file of your account. Follow the steps given below.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">a) Open Windows File Explorer.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">b) Navigate to the location given below.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>&nbsp;

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>d) <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
Look for <strong>Mail.MSMessageStore</strong> file name and delete it (right click, delete).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Note</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">:<span>&nbsp;
</span>The <strong>Mail.MSMessageStore</strong> does have a back-up folder and will work to recover your messages but may not be able to view some recently received messages.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you have web based e-mail, Windows Live Mail will sync with the mail server so they are made available again.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If you uninstall and reinstall Windows Live Mail, you will not lose your emails as they will be saved on the server and once you configure your account on
 Windows Live Mail, you will get them back.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Let us know with the status of the issue. We will assist you further.

<h2>            What&#39;s the e-mail address for the MS Flight Simulator 2020 project&#63;</h2>
                    <p>For my fellow FS pilots.<br />
If anyone can get the following letter to the people behind the beta testing <br />
team for fs 2020 I'd deeply appreciate it.The e-mail that I received to <br />
write to in my confirmation letter bounces back in my face.<br />
That address is as follows:<br />
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
I'm not on face book that often because it is tricky for we who access our <br />
pc through a screen reader.<br />
So, I can be reached at:<br />
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
Here's the following letter that I'm attempting to get to Microsoft.<br />
This is why I joined this list.<br />
Subject.<br />
Comments from a Blind and or Visually impaired Pilot AKA BVI Pilot.<br />
Now, here's the letter<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello from Ron Kolesar who can't wait for the new up coming version of <br />
FS.<br />
am blind and here's how I'm able to use FSX, soon to be from what I've been <br />
hearing, now simply as FS.<br />
First of all, here's how a blind person can interact with one's PC.<br />
We use a program called a screen reader.<br />
The screen reader that the majority of us use, at least here in the United <br />
States, is JAWS for windows.<br />
It reads everything that is on the screen to us as we type, or when we want <br />
o read our mail, surf on the internet and so on.<br />
For further info about JAWS, it's web address is at:<br />
<a href="http://www.freedomscientific.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.freedomscientific.com</a><br />
You can down load a 40 minute demo of JAWS 2019 which is the current version <br />
of JAWS.<br />
I would highly recommend that you set a timer for around 30 minutes.<br />
That way you have enough time to save the work you're stress testing JAWS <br />
with and reboot your pc for another 40 minute demo.<br />
Also, if you'd like?<br />
Freedom Scientific's toll free phone number here in the states is at:<br />
800-444-4443.<br />
Now for Screen Reader number two.<br />
There's a free program called NVDA, Which stands for Non-Visual Desktop <br />
Access.<br />
It is completely free, but I don't like it.<br />
But if you'd like to give it a test drive?<br />
The address is at:<br />
<a href="http://www.nvaccess.org" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.nvaccess.org</a><br />
Then last but not least that comes free with Windows ten, is narrator.<br />
One important nice thing about JAWS starting for 2019, is that with one <br />
license, you can have three computers using that same copy of jaws.<br />
Now the original fs had great voice announcement/instructional messages <br />
output via our sound card and headset speakers.<br />
But there was quite a number of areas that wasn't accurate nor were blind <br />
friendly.<br />
Before I get into that, please since hand to eye coordination won't work for <br />
us since our eyes don't work, please think of adding hand to ear <br />
coordination since we have to see and think through our ears.<br />
Let's start with our AI co-pilot/AI First officer program.<br />
Yes because we have to see with our ears since our eyes don't work, we do <br />
have to rely on our AI co-pilot/AI first officer for mainly taxiing and <br />
other areas the sighted take for granted since they can receive their <br />
important conformational feedback via their vision, we have to receive our <br />
important conformational feedback via our ears since our eyes don't work.<br />
also, if you were to add hand to ear coordination we wouldn't have to depend <br />
on our AI co-pilot/AI first officer as much since we would have audio cues <br />
and audio messages coming from the local ATC to keep us on the straight and <br />
narrow.<br />
For a few examples of what I'm talking about:<br />
If the engine sounds are coming out of both speakers and in front of you as <br />
well, or just through both of your headset's speakers at the same time, then <br />
you're going straight and you're on the center line for take off.<br />
If you start to hear it only in one speaker, you can tap and or hold down <br />
the correct arrow key to lightly turn your yoke in the opposite direction to <br />
get you back on course.<br />
Also, before we get off of the ground, will we we have a flight school and <br />
flying lessons and have to prove ourselves by soloing?<br />
Also, for flight school and after we receive our first solo flight and start <br />
to build our career, Would you add not having the AI Co-Pilot do everything <br />
for us, but to prompt us.<br />
For example:<br />
The co pilot would help us with the checklists especially for the correct <br />
take off flaps.<br />
For example, The co-pilot/first officer would tell us what we should have <br />
our flaps set at and either via keyboard keys and or via voice we could set <br />
the flaps ourselves.<br />
Also, especially while ascending and descending for that smooth landing, our <br />
co-pilot/first officer would say speed at 200 not's and we would slow down <br />
via our throttle and or the down arrow keys or if we needed to speed up, we <br />
could use the up arrow keys and or simply pull back on the yoke as well.<br />
But I do like having the AI Co-Pilot/AI First Officer controlling the speed <br />
though.<br />
That way you don't over shoot your assigned level cruising alt.<br />
Also, if the Co-pilot/first officer is controlling the speed, they could <br />
assist us with taking off and a smooth landing as well.<br />
Then after we've made a few flights, we would still like some <br />
assistance/prompting while landing, for that smooth touchdown.<br />
If at all possible?<br />
Let's also have random airport sounds as well.<br />
Also force feedback that would not only bring the sim to life for us but for <br />
the sighted as well, we could fly via keyboard shortcut keystrokes and or <br />
USB plug and play external Flight yokes, twistable throttles and rudder <br />
petals, like our sighted counterparts already can take advantage of, since <br />
they can see their monitors and receive their conformational feedback via <br />
their vision.<br />
I think the force feedback suggestion also could bring the sim to life as <br />
well, but where to find the USB equipment that would support the force <br />
feedback and also support the world of win ten and the faster current 64 bit <br />
processor world at a reasonable price?<br />
Especially for we BVI Pilots, for landing, we could feel our main gear touch <br />
down and then of course our nose wheel, but also taking off, we can feel <br />
when our nose wheel lifts off of the ground and hopefully our main gear and <br />
the rest of the aircraft we're flying also will leave the ground safely as <br />
well. SMILES.<br />
Also, while we're talking about force feedback, we also could use the force <br />
feedback with practice to tell if we're landing to hard and if we bounce.<br />
With a little practice with the force feedback feature, we could learn how <br />
to have a smooth landing and a smooth takeoff as well.<br />
We could use that recommendation/suggestion in our flying lessons in the <br />
flight school requirement.<br />
Also for Military missions, if we had force feedback, we can get the **** <br />
scared out of us when we attempt to take off and land on a aircraft carrier.<br />
Let's take a moment since I'm talking about military missions.<br />
We have a&nbsp; hand to ear Military flight simulator called Three-D Velocity.<br />
It you go to the following address that works on any browser except IE11.<br />
That address is as follows:<br />
<a href="http://www.github.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.github.com</a><br />
set up a free account and do a search for Three-D Velocity or Munawar who <br />
was the designer of the flight simulator.<br />
Stress testing Three-D Velocity might give the Microsoft team who's building <br />
the new FS 2020 ideas on how to make fs 2020 even more blind friendly.<br />
Every book that I've read with our original seven Astronauts, they've all <br />
stated that the toughest assignment they all had was taking off and more <br />
importantly landing on a aircraft carrier.<br />
So, if we had force feedback written into the FS program and the right USB <br />
external equipment, we too could get the **** scared out of us when that <br />
arresting wire catches our tail hook when we land on a aircraft carrier as <br />
well. SMILES.<br />
While we're talking about the Astronauts, let's not forget the sadly retired <br />
STS program, better known as the Space Shuttle program.<br />
I would love to eat my words.<br />
Because I don't see a way a BVI Pilot could launch the proud bird, but we <br />
should be able to fly, dock with say the Space Telescope and or with the ISS <br />
as well, then we also should be able to go through the reentry and land the <br />
proud old bird.<br />
Also, let's not forget the new up coming Space X Dragon spacecraft or the <br />
new NASA MPCV vehicle better known as the Orion project, or the Apollo <br />
missions, The Sky lab missions, and let's also not forget Chuck Yager's <br />
famous flight on October 14th, 1947, when he went mock one to break the <br />
sound barrier.<br />
So, please when you're designing the new FS program, you might want to think <br />
a minute and ask yourself, how do I get the same information that I just saw <br />
on my monitor to some one who can't see via their eyes?<br />
Simple, add a little extra detailed narration from the co-pilot/first <br />
officer, and of from when we receive our clearance instructions, our taxiing <br />
instructions and so on.<br />
Another item that the original FS program didn't have.<br />
It would be nice to hear out of our headset speaker from the ground, when <br />
they give us our taxiing instructions to let us know if we need a push back <br />
or not, how far back to push off from and in which direction to turn the <br />
tail towards.<br />
That way, when our AI co-pilot/AI first officer asks us if we need a <br />
pushback or not, we can have that information in our heads already for the <br />
AI co-pilot or AI first officer, and when we're asked, we simply could tell <br />
the co-pilot/first officer what we heard through our sound card and headset <br />
speakers and with audio navigation clues, after a little bit of practice, we <br />
could do the instructions ourselves, and or also have the co-pilot/first <br />
officer assist us with this procedure as well..<br />
Because the following never was blind friendly.<br />
Here's where the co-pilot/first officer could help us out once again, or <br />
with some practice, say have a plug in that would allow us access to the say <br />
notepad program to be able to write read back instructions down and then we <br />
could still have the co-pilot/first officer read them back to the clearance, <br />
and or ground and so on, or with some practice, we could write them down in <br />
notepad and read them back ourselves.<br />
Of course for copying down the read back instructions, we'll need a way to <br />
adjust the speed so that it's at a speed that we can copy at.<br />
We never could program the FMC or probably now known as the FC nor could we <br />
access the kneeboard to be able to write down notes and or be able to read <br />
back instructions correctly.<br />
Programming the FC would be of some help as well or have keyboard and or <br />
buttons assigned on our flight yoke for programming the FC, or have our <br />
co-pilot/first officer assists us and or program it for us.<br />
They could ask us if we would like some help or would we like them to <br />
program the info after we give them the departure airport four letter ICAO <br />
I.D. code, with our ATIS instructions and the destination airport's ICAO <br />
I.D. Code.<br />
We have to use keyboard commands and or voice commands like clearance copy <br />
and so on.<br />
But maybe if we could have it so it would allow us to have say notepad open <br />
while clearance, or the ground or what have you is giving us instructions <br />
and we have to read the instructions back, to either:<br />
1. Have a keyboard command to acknowledge the read back and have a <br />
synthesized voice read back the instructions back to the clearance and or to <br />
the ground, and or have short command like acknowledge or what have you.<br />
2. Have it so we can adjust the speed so that we could use notepad and write <br />
down the Clearance instructions and or what have you to read them back like <br />
a sighted person would do in the real world.<br />
If you subscribe to the following mailing list:<br />
Blind &amp; Visually impaired Pilots Mailing List<br />
To subscribe, send a letter with the word subscribe in the subject field, to <br />
the following address:<br />
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
Then you'll receive a confirmation letter that you have to reply to and <br />
you're all set.<br />
Once you receive your welcome aboard letter with the rules and what not, <br />
here's the address to throw your pitch on how we can make FS as close to the <br />
real world of flying as possible, but also have it enjoyable not only for <br />
the sighted pilot want to be, but for the Blind and or Visually Impaired <br />
Pilots or BVI Pilots as well.<br />
That address is at:<br />
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
One important item that our co-pilot/first officer can help us out with is <br />
to let us know when we've turned to the new assigned compass heading that <br />
the local ATC will give to us.<br />
They could say we're now at say a heading of 270 degrees, and or we could <br />
learn how fast to tap and to hold down our arrow keys and or how hard and or <br />
light to make a beautiful bank and we could hear our turn as we're making it <br />
like from 180, 185, 190, 200, 205 and so on until we reach the new assigned <br />
of 270, or have it read it out to us in ten miles each and so on, but also <br />
have the co-pilot let us know when we've reached the new assigned headings.<br />
They also could help us to let us know if our turn is way to steep and or <br />
way to shallow or just right to stay up in the air.<br />
Here's another lesson for the flight school/flying lessons recommendation, <br />
we could learn to bank safely and efficiently like our sighted counterparts <br />
can do since they have their important conformational feedback via their <br />
vision as well.<br />
Our AI co-pilot program that is left to us, which I don't like is called <br />
Multi Crew Experience or MCE for short.<br />
Their address is at:<br />
<a href="http://www.multicrewxp.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.multicrewxp.com</a><br />
The one program that was cool that we all enjoyed was a program from British <br />
Columbia Canada called Its Your Plane.<br />
But the designer/owner took the web page down and the program with the web <br />
page.<br />
But if you go out to you tube and do a search for its your plane, you'll <br />
find all kinds of you tube videos to help you come up with ideas on how to <br />
make the new fs project blind friendly as well.<br />
Now That's the first officer/co-pilot program.<br />
Also, one nice thing with the its your plane or IYP program was that once <br />
you reached a flu of 200 FT, your first officer/co-pilot turned into a tour <br />
guide.<br />
About every ten to fifteen minutes throughout the flight it would tell both <br />
you as the pilot, and your passengers what your about to fly over both on <br />
your left or port and right or starboard side of the aircraft that you're <br />
flying over in real time.<br />
We have a member on the BVI Pilots mailing list attempting to design a <br />
flight following program.<br />
If you subscribe to the BVI Pilots list, you will have access to the <br />
archives as well.<br />
So you can do a search or ask to get in touch with the person designing the <br />
flight following plug in program.<br />
We also had a virtual career and all of we BVI Pilots were flying for the <br />
IYP virtual airlines.<br />
One important item.<br />
For private G A flights, I love the Dassault Falcon 7X by Dassault, AKA the <br />
DF7X for short.<br />
They now have a branch of the Dassault company in Little Rock Arkansas as <br />
well.<br />
At this time I'd like to have access to the successor to the DF7X which is <br />
the DF8X.<br />
But it looks like so far, the only sim that has the DF8X is the X-Plane <br />
program and it isn't blind friendly.<br />
It was like don't call us, we'll call you.<br />
Why would one want to jump from the DF7X to the DF8X?<br />
This is a valid question to ask.<br />
1. the DF8X flies 500 NM further than the DF7X.<br />
2. The fuel onboard the DF8X is 35 % more efficient on the DF8X over the <br />
DF7X as well.<br />
It also would be nice to have force feedback written into the new up coming <br />
FS program as well.<br />
I think it would add realism to the flight simulator.<br />
You could feel when landing when your main gear touches down and when taking <br />
off when your nose wheel is off of the ground and you're actually taking <br />
off.<br />
The only thing I can think of at the moment that I almost forgot to me <br />
mention to you is to add some type of passenger mode as well.<br />
Here's what I found that you might one to take a look at for a Passenger and Crew Experience program:
<br />
The name of the company is:<br />
TFDi Design<br />
Their web address is as follows:<br />
<a href="https://tfdidesign.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tfdidesign.com</a><br />
The name of the program is:<br />
PASSENGER AND CREW EXPERIENCE<br />
I now will list the add on programs that we have to use to make flying as <br />
close to the real world as possible, to make accurate date and time and <br />
weather, and to make the sim blind friendly as well.<br />
Again,let's start with the AI Co-pilot/AI first officer assistant program.<br />
Like I said, we only have access to the Multi Crew program, or MCE for <br />
short.<br />
Which I do not like.<br />
I wished that we still had the Its Your Plane or IYP program for our AI <br />
Co-pilot/AI First/Officer assistant.<br />
Now for the weather.<br />
The FSX weather was never ever accurate.<br />
So what we were using was From a company called FS Pilot Shop, we were using <br />
a program called Active Sky for our weather.<br />
Next we were running a ATC program called PF3ATC Program, from a store <br />
called On Course Software.<br />
For AI traffic to fly around us we're using the following program.<br />
Traffic Global by a store called Just Flight.<br />
For the correct date and time, we're using a small program called&nbsp; either fs <br />
real time or fsx real-time.<br />
It would be nice if our AI co-pilot/AI first officer would say something <br />
like we're crossing from one time zone to another, say what the time zone <br />
we're in and what the correct current time is.<br />
For runways being up to date and accurate, we've been using a program called <br />
Make Runways It’s a free program that you can grab from the following web <br />
address:<br />
<a href="http://www.schiratti.com/dowson.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.schiratti.com/dowson.html</a><br />
Also we're using a small com bridge of a program called FSUIPC, which was <br />
designed by Mr. PeterDowson's.<br />
It allows, FS to communicate with third party add on programs so that we <br />
would be able to fly.<br />
His web address is at:<br />
<a href="http://www.schiratti.com/dowson.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.schiratti.com/dowson.html</a><br />
You can use the free version for most items. But I would highly recommend to <br />
purchase a unlock code for it.<br />
Make sure you get the correct version of FSUIPC for the sim that you're <br />
flying in, which in this case would be for FS.<br />
Will you have a good ground support program?<br />
It looks like there's two programs out on the market.<br />
1. is GSX_fsx.<br />
2. is called I can't remember nor can I find the second ground program.<br />
But it would be nice that the Fuel tanker truck would have a different sound <br />
for the engine than say for telling the difference between the Fuel Tanker <br />
Truck and the Luggage Truck and so on with all of the ground support <br />
facilities.<br />
That way we could learn the sounds and that way we would know which ground <br />
service vehicle is coming towards our aircraft.<br />
Well, that looks like everything I can think of to help you to not only <br />
design a awesome Flight simulator not only for the sighted but also for we <br />
BVI Pilots as well.<br />
Please just remember to think and see with your ears, since that's how we <br />
have to live our daily lives since our eyes don't work.<br />
I can not wait to become a beta tester!!<br />
If I can find a valid address to write future letters of recommendations and <br />
suggestions to, I will be shipping this letter to my two friends so that <br />
they too may add their two cents on this surprising project as well.<br />
Again, I deeply Appreciate for you to take the time out to read this letter <br />
and I also can't wait to see your comments on my letter and <br />
recommendations/suggestions on how to improve on your exciting new project.<br />
Very Thankfully Yours.<br />

            1. If using Norton, etc, disable it before using System Restore.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It causes System Restore to fail.<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
2. Try doing SR in Safe mode:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p><span>Restore Point:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Try tapping F8 at startup, and from the&nbsp;list of startup selections, select Safe Mode by using UP Arrow Key to go there &gt; then&nbsp;hit Enter.<br />
<br />
Try a System Restore once there, to pick a Restore Point&nbsp;before your problem..<br />
<br />
Click Start &gt; Programs &gt; Accessories &gt; System Tools &gt; System Restore &gt; pick a different time &gt; Next &gt; etc<br />
<br />
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />
<br />
3. Malware may interfere with System Restore:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<p><span>Besides using an anti-virus, also scan for Malware/spyware:</span></p>

<p>Programs have to be reinstalled from the original Media (CDs, DVDs or downloads)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can try the free version of this&nbsp;Program to recover those files; no guarantees though.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.piriform.com/recuva/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.piriform.com/recuva/download</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It may find&nbsp;all, some or none.</p>

Recovery from damaged or formatted disks

<p><br />
Usually there are 2 types of restore available, a destructive restore and a non-destructive type. The non-destructive type would re-install the operating system, drivers and programs that originally came with your computer but it would leave the files you put
 on the computer alone. You would only have to re-install any software that you added.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>A destructive restore however would reformat your harddrive and reset your computer to the same state it was when it came out of the factory. After a destructive restore all the files and software you added to the computer yourself are gone forever.</p>

<div>For future use you might want to print out the basic rules applying to data storage:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Rule #1 of data storage: A file that is not backed up is a lost file. It is only a matter of time.</div>
<div>Rule #2 of data storage: People will ignore Rule #1 until they suffer a major disaster.</div>
<div>Rule #3 of data storage: &nbsp;There is little difference between "no backup" and an untested backup.</div>
<div><br />
<div>It is actually possible to pull files off a disk that will no longer boot but you need to do this

It is certainly worth a try but since a Factory Restore overlays the existing partition structure, the chances of a successful file recovery are slim.

            <p>FYI</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have had&nbsp;OPs come back to the Forums and thank me for my advice as they were able to recover some or all of their files&nbsp;after reinstalling back to Factory Settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, in some cases, it does and HAS worked.</p>
<p>And even Recuva in their advert pitch, state that it can do that.</p>

<p>-&gt; I prefer to run a solid backup scheme. That's the point I was trying to get across to the OP. His mistake was not so much to perform a Factory Restore (we all slip once every so often) but to run his PC probably for years without
 ever considering how little it takes to wipe all his data. Unfortunately he is in excellent company. Experience is a superb teacher - if only the tuition fees weren't so steep.</p>

            <p>You are correct there; most people never think it could happen to them and then are shocked when it does as they were never advised to do, or thought it necessary,&nbsp;a Backup to External Media/Disk. They think a Computer will last forever :)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am happy though if I can help someone who does find themselves in this mess; especially as it is often old and irreplaceable photos, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And as we&nbsp;both&nbsp;agree, it is worth a try.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>By the way, Recuva seems to work best&nbsp;on the Factory Image reinstall to recover Data, not Microsoft Retail DVD installs.</p>
<p>But most requests I get&nbsp;are after back to Factory Settings anyway.</p>

<p>Contrary to what the other contributors are saying there has been some&nbsp;good reports coming&nbsp;back in the Windows Forums here about using the free version&nbsp;Recuva to recover at least some of the lost Data files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is why it is worth a try.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
Colour me skeptical, but I do conveniently have a re-partitioned and formatted drive complete with different OS installed on the new partition so I gave the portable version of Recuva a quick try.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Upshot&nbsp;was that Recuva did find files from the previous installation that were recoverable (even gives previews where possible). The number of files that were recoverable was only a fraction of 200-300k&nbsp; files identified but if it's a choice between recovering&nbsp;something
 or nothing at all it is at least worth a try.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>In any case there are free&nbsp;versions (installer or portable version, 32bit and 64bit) so there is nothing to lose in downloading and testing it. If it finds files, great, if not, status quo.</p>

            Hi and thanks for getting back to me,
<div><br />
<div>Im trying to save files from any location, be it any web browser, MS office programs, Adobe programs, even the basic programs, note pad, paint ect..</div>
<div><br />
<div>I toggled the AppData folders read-only Attribute in attempt to fix a problem with another program. However that has caused me a whole boat load of problems because it appears to have messed up the cache data for all my programs. Ive had to blow it out
 and rebuild it.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>The clean boot did not fix this issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I tried a system restore to before I made the changes to the AppData folder, and that didnt fix it either.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I created a new Library and was able to save to it, so I deleted all the old library links and made new ones. &nbsp;This has resolved this issue.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for the tips.</div>
<div><br />

    <title>&#91;SOLVED&#93; Activating windows 10 after harddisk crash - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sverrevelten rothmund  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#91;SOLVED&#93; Activating windows 10 after harddisk crash</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>My computer does not activate windows 10 automatically after i had to reinstall it due to hard drive failure (on a new harddrive).
<br />
According to <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/windows-10-activation-hdd-change/1c6e8374-cd68-48e0-a798-e81ff31a2abc">
this </a>thread the change of hard disk should not affect the automatic activation.
<br />
<br />
Firstly: What is the correct version of windows 10 to install?<br />
My windows 8 version was (according to my digital content on the Norwegian&nbsp;microsoft store): "Windows 8.1 Pro N - Studenttilbud", which transelates to "Windows 8.1 Pro N - Studentoffer". Is Windows 10 pro the correct version to install?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I look at the activation page on my windows 10 pro&nbsp;i get the following error on activation: (translated into English) "Cannot reach the servers for Windows-activation."
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/921471" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
The</a>&nbsp;page you come to when you want more info, has no solution when you are not using a proxy. Does anyone know of other causes for this error? Or how to fix it?
<br />
<br />
Solution: Use the N version of windows 10 if you had N version of windows 8/7. </p>

<p>"CPU"?</p>
<p>"CPU" stands for "Central Processing Unit." In modern personal<br />
computers, the CPU is a relatively small electronic chip, an<br />
integrated circuit. It sits on the motherboard, inside the computer's<br />
case. It is not the case itself, nor is it the total computer, which<br />
includes the case and everything within it.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how the incorrect practice of calling the whole computer<br />
the "CPU" began, but here's my guess: when you buy a computer, you<br />
normally get the case and what's in it, along with a monitor,<br />
keyboard, mouse, and perhaps a printer. All of these peripherals<br />
connect to the case. Because everything connects to the case, the case<br />
is "central" to everything else and the term "Central Processing Unit"<br />
was misunderstood and misapplied to it. </p>

<p>Right-click on a file name the search found and choose "Properties."</p>

<p>Thanks for reaching out to us here on the forums with this situation. I understand you're having trouble with earning in game gold currency is that correct? Do you see any error messages or codes pop up when you try and acquire gold? Every time you defeat
 a character they're supposed to drop some gold if I remember correctly. You may want to contact the developers of the game and see if they have more information about in game options. Let us know with a reply how it goes.</p>

<p>Hey there Toxic!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear that you're dealing with this issue. I've actually noticed more and more cases of this happening.
</p>
<p>Since this is specific to the game, I would try the steps outlined in our <a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/troubleshooting/game-freeze-solution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox One Game Freeze Solution</a>. If that doesn't help, then it might be best for you to talk straight up with
<a href="https://www.crytek.com/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Crytek support
</a>directly. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for reading!</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<p>In-game gold for the multiplayer mode is currently available for free on the official Xbox store; hopefully this applies to all regions. My guess is that Crytek can't fix the problem with a patch or server update and have instead generously removed the prices
 (at the time of writing).<br />
<br />
When you select the gold amount and press "buy" it will not show a confirmation purchase page but instead will be directly added to your gold total when you next log into the multiplayer menu of the game. You will then be able to acquire booster packs to upgrade
 your gear.<br />
<br />
At the end of each match you will see an Xbox store connection error, although you will still keep the total gold you have "bought" previously; you can't earn gold by finishing matches within the game.</p>
