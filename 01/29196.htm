<h2>            Surface Pro 4 - Connecting an external monitor drops WIFI</h2>
                    <p>When I connect an External Monitor to my SP4 (i5 with&nbsp;256GB) the WIFI drops and will not reconnect until the External Monitor is disconnected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have an Acer S277HK monitor.&nbsp; I am connecting using a Mini DisplayPort adapter to a Mini DisplayPort adapter on the Acer S277HK monitor.&nbsp; The&nbsp;external monitor works&nbsp;without a problem at 4K&nbsp;but the WIFI&nbsp;drops&nbsp;and will not reconnect until the monitor is
 disconnected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have read that other people are having&nbsp;the same problem.&nbsp; Is this a&nbsp;bug with the Surface Pro 4?</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is very disappointing. &nbsp;</p>

            <p>I did some more experimentation and found that when the Marvell AVASTAR Wireless AC-Network Controller is set&nbsp;to work at only 5GHz the monitor works with WiFi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When the Marvell AVASTAR Wireless AC-Network Controller is set to auto detect speed or at 2.GHz - WiFI does not work when the monitor is attached to the Surface Pro 4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is difficult to determine if the problem is a hardware fault with the Surface Pro 4 or a driver bug.If the problem is hardware related Microsoft should do the right thing.&nbsp; They should provide an update to fix or replace hardware!!&nbsp;&nbsp; If it is a driver
 fault could Marvell provide an updated as soon as possible?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It would be interesting to find out the technical explanation for this problem.</p>

            I have experienced the same problem. When calling Microsoft they caimed that no-one else had had the problem and told me it was my cable. I have tried another cable from a different manufacturer and get exactly the same results.&nbsp;Having now found this thread
 clearly there is a known issue when connecting the surface to an external Monitor using a Mini Display port to Display Port cable.&nbsp;I have seen the broblem of both of my&nbsp;surface 4 Pro's.

            <p>Thank you for your reply. I have since purchased a Surface Dock and to my surprise I am experiencing a similar problem when using the dock. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am starting to think that the problem is more to do with WiFi interference. I do not experience the problem when using 5GHz WiFi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will repeat my testing after applying recently released updates and after installing a newer (more powerful) WiFi modem/router.</p>

            <p>6 months later, I get the same problem connecting either through a Dell USB3 Dock (which connects to the monitor through HDMI) or through the miniDP. &nbsp;And I can't use the plugged in Ethernet on the Dock either (which matches what a number of people have
 said about the Surface Pro dock)</p>
<p>Therefore it's either a hardware or driver problem on the Surface Pro 4, and Microsoft ought to find a solution to it. &nbsp;I will try 5GHz WiFi if my upstairs router has it</p>

    <title>How can I clone Windows Vista onto a hard drive with another OS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kpdonahue85  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I clone Windows Vista onto a hard drive with another OS already installed&#63;</h2>
                    Hi, I have a copy of Vista installed onto a hard drive which has failed.&nbsp; I have made an image of the drive and would like to clone it onto another hard disk.&nbsp; My problem is that new disks are mostly in the advanced format with the larger sector size,
 and so I am trying to clone it onto an older drive to avoid issues with this.&nbsp; So, I am trying to clone my Windows Vista partition and its restore partition onto another drive which already has Windows 7 installed on it. &nbsp; I want to shrink the Windows 7 partition
 on the new drive and clone my two older partitions onto the empty space (I know how to do this already).<br />
<br />
What I need to know is this:&nbsp; Once I have my Windows Vista partition and its recovery partition copied over, how can I perform a system restore?&nbsp; I doubt that the OS will boot on its own, since the image of this partition is full of holes where the original
 sectors crapped out.&nbsp; The restore partition is undamaged, though, so it should be able to restore my OS on a working drive.&nbsp; I am concerned that things will get screwed up trying this on a new drive, especially one with a different partition table than the
 original.&nbsp; How can I configure things to get this to work?<br />
<br />
Thanks.<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>" I doubt that the OS will boot on its own, since the image of this partition is full of holes where the original sectors crapped out"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Vista only allows for a Repair Install from within a running Vista Operating System; which you will not have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And Recovery partitions are imaged by the Manufacturer and are not designed to be copied to another Hard Drive.</p>
<p>They work on a particular F Key sequence to reinstall the OS back to new condition.</p>
<p>Recovery Disks are supposed to have been made from the Recovery partition when you purchased that machine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

            Thanks for the quick reply.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if it matters, but there is actually a chance that the OS might boot, at least sort of.&nbsp; On the corrupt drive, I can attempt to perform a system restore and it gets a little bit into it (shows the windows logo, sometimes reaches a blue screen where
 the desktop should display), but it can't actually repair anything since the sectors are bad and it can't write to them.&nbsp; I was hoping that trying the process on a functional drive might work.<br />
<br />
You said:<br />
"Recovery partitions are imaged by the Manufacturer and are not designed to be copied to another Hard Drive"<br />
<br />
What if I managed to find an older drive on eBay or somewhere that was the same size (or possibly same model) as my corrupt drive?&nbsp; Would this solve the problem about copying the recovery partition to a new disk, since there wouldn't be any extra partitions
 around to confuse the OS?&nbsp; I'm hoping that this would be like working on the original drive, but without the I/O errors.&nbsp; I don't have any recovery disks, unfortunately.&nbsp; Even if I did, the point of this is to recover some old software and files so I wouldn't
 want a factory recovery disk anyway.&nbsp; I am trying to save some money by not ordering an out-of-date drive, but if it is worth a shot I will try it.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.<br />

<p>It is time to buy that new Hard Drive and reinstall the operating System back to new condition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>"What if I managed to find an older drive on eBay or somewhere that was the same size (or possibly same model) as my corrupt drive?"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have already advised you about this:</p>
<p>"Recovery partitions are imaged by the Manufacturer and are not designed to be copied to another Hard Drive"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And Vista only allows for a Startup Repair from a non-bootable System, which would not be sufficient to fix your corrupted Vista.</p>
<p>Here is the guide to using the Repair Options while using a Microsoft Vista DVD.</p>
<p>If a friend or work acquantance of yours&nbsp;has one, you may borrow and use it for Repairs.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/repair-windows-with-windows-startup-repair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><font color="#0072c6">http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/repair-windows-with-windows-startup-repair/</font></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And a Startup Repair or a Repair Install would not fix your 3rd Party software.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can contact your&nbsp;Computer Manufacturer and ask them to send you a set of Recovery Disks.</p>
<p>They should do that for a small cost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some manufacturers no longer have Vista Recovery Disks available.</p>
<p>If that happens, you may have to try this instead:</p>
<p><span>You can also borrow and use&nbsp;a Microsoft Vista DVD, that contains the files for the various Vista Editions (Home Basic, Home Premium, Business and Ultimate)&nbsp;to be installed. The Product Key on your Computer / Laptop case&nbsp;determines which Edition is
 installed. </span></p>
<p><span>Other Manufacturers' Recovery DVDs are not to be used for the&nbsp;above purpose.</span></p>
<p><span>And&nbsp;you need to know&nbsp;the "bit" version for Vista, as 32bit and 64bit Editions&nbsp;come on different DVDs</span></p>
<p><span>Here is how to do a clean install of Vista, using a Microsoft Vista DVD:</span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And once the Operating System is installed, go to your Computer Manufacturer's website and obtain the latest Drivers for your particular Model Computer or Laptop.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>And phone Activation may be required when using the above clean install Method.</span></p>

            Thanks again!<br />
<br />
I already have an adapter for USB/Sata from an earlier effort at saving this drive, but I don't think I will even need it at this point.&nbsp; I have an image of the disk that I made using ddrescue, booting from a Linux cd (SystemRescueCD, I think).&nbsp; The computer
 hardware is fine.&nbsp; I tried to look at the files by mounting the image as a loop device, but I think the MFT is corrupt and many directories return I/O errors when I try to look at their contents.&nbsp; The reason I was hoping I could perform a system restore was
 to try to recover the MFT and at least be able to pull some files off of there.&nbsp; The damage to the disk is actually pretty minimal, only about 200Mb error size (according to ddrescue) on a 200Gb drive, so I was hoping that the problems with booting Windows
 were mostly from I/O errors making it take forever and not from crucial data being missing.<br />
<br />
Any suggestions on how I can access my files or repair the file system?&nbsp; I haven't wanted to let anything write to the disk image yet in case it made any bad changes, and I haven't tried any further restore operations on the physical disk because I didn't want
 to alter it while I was trying to save what I could with ddrescue.<br />
<br />
I am still a little unclear as to why the manufacturer's version of the recovery partition is different than a bit-for-bit copy on an identical drive.&nbsp; I guess it's particularly hardware/firmware-specific?&nbsp; I will try to read up on this more.<br />
<br />
Thank you for the advice on reinstalling Vista, but if I can't get any of my installed software back then I will probably just upgrade to Windows 7 anyway.<br />
<br />
I really appreciate the help!<br />

<br />On that keyboard do you see the forward slash (/) symbol, the ? symbol should be press Shift, then the forward slash should turn to a ? symbol . . .

            Hi Nvfaulkner.
<br />
<br />If you see on the right, on the bottom, you have a Shift key. What you see on the left of that key? It should be / and ? Key. Try that and shift at the sane time.

<h2>            my computer has &#34;other user&#34; account on the start up screen.</h2>
                    my computer starts up and then the log in screen shows a large oversized account user screen that has "other user" listed under the account icon with a password prompt. I'm not able to access my account or anything. My computer will only turn off by me
 holding the power button. I cannot access anything even when it first boots up I have tried the F2 button and everything. It also starts in safe mode in the beginning and you cannot even press enter to enable the safe mode<br />

            If this is a recent problem then System Restore will probably fix it:<br />
1. Keep tapping F8 during the early boot phase.<br />
2. Select Repair from the menu.<br />
3. Enter the Administrator's password when prompted. It is often blank.<br />
4. Select System Restore when prompted.<br />
5. Set Windows back to a point before this problem occurred.<br />

            i was able to get to the advanced boot options. I pressed enter and nothing happened, it stays on the same black and white screen. This is farther than I got before :) thank you. Do you have any other helpful ideas? Could it be possible my computer has
 a boot up virus? I think that is what its called.

<p>It is possible that you have caught a virus. Do you have an up-to-date anti-virus product installed?</p>
<p>You can try and reset Windows to an earlier point like so:<br />
1. Set your BIOS so that it uses the DVD drive as its primary boot device.<br />
2. Boot the machine with your Windows 7 Repair CD.<br />
3. Press a key if prompted to boot from the DVD.<br />
4. Select "Safe Mode Command Prompt" when prompted.<br />
5. Log on as Administrator if prompted.<br />
6. Select Repair when prompted.<br />
7. Select System Restore when prompted.<br />
8. Set Windows back to a point before this problem occurred.<br />
9. When finished, remove the CD before rebooting the system.<br />
In Step 2 you could also use your Windows 7 installation DVD. The subsequent steps are similar to the ones above.<br />

<h2>            Red Dead Redemption - Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t access outfitter</h2>
                    
<p>So this problem has been happening for a few days now. I just recently purchased the Liars And Cheats and Legends And Killers packs and would love to go into my outfitter and view all the new characters I unlocked but alas I cannot. I've tried going into
 Friendly, Normal and Hardcore modes and can't access the outfitter and I've tried to go into Private Free Roam and I cannot access the outfitter there either. I can use it fine in single player though. My friends can use the outfitter without a hitch. This
 is really quite annoying. :&lt;</p>

<p>I receive no error code at all. It simply loads and keeps loading as if in a infinite loop. I've actually gotten up and left my Xbox on for over an hour just to see if it would finally load and it hasn't. I'm using the on-demand Red Dead Redemption if this
 can help. Not using a disc for it.</p>

                    <p>I'm trying to LAN Red Dead Redemption wit an Xbox One and 360. Friend requests from both consoles don't go through to the other, but messages do. I have tried direct ethernet connection as well as wifi connection, but it is as if the consoles don't or can't see each other. This is the short breakdown of my problem, if anyone has answers for me I would happily elaborate.</p>

<h2>            Xbox Clubs &#38;quot&#59;Something went wrong&#38;quot&#59; when trying to join a Club</h2>
                    
<p>Hi there!</p>
<p>Sorry if this is in the wrong place but I wasn't really sure where to ask this in!</p>
<p>A friend of mine created a Club on the Xbox beta app on Windows that I'm trying to join via the Xbox beta app on PC and on the mobile phone app on my phone. On the PC app when I click Accept Invite (when he sents me an invite via
 the Club) or when I click Request Invite, I get no notification/error message, it simply doesn't do anything. On the mobile phone app, when I click the same buttons I get an error message saying "Something went wrong". The only buttons that work on the mobile
 phone app and the PC app are the Follow and Cancel Request/Ignore Invite buttons. Another friend of ours can easily join/leave the Club with no issues, he can be invited to it and he can accept the invite, or he can request an invite and then join it via that.</p>
<p>Is there any type of fix for this/anything that I could try to fix this?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 suddenly does not allow the installation of a windows image - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carstenholz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 suddenly does not allow the installation of a windows image backup</h2>
                    <p>When I purchased my Dell XPS 13 about two years ago I installed all the software I wanted, then created a windows image backup. A year later, I successfully re-installed this first image backup, updated all the software, and created a new windows image backup.
 When I try to install that now (another year later, with the Dell startup taking five times longer than a year ago and various other problems), Windows suddenly does not allow me to install the image backup.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I get the message "To restore this computer, Windows needs to format the drive that the Windows Recovery Environment is currently running on. To continue with the restore, shut down this computer and boot it from a Windows Installation disc or a system repair
 disc and then try the restore again." I am not a tech person, but I did go into BIOS and told it to boot from the recovery disc on the external CD/DVD drive, but that didn't work at all (it said it can't boot). Looking around on the internet, I seem to not
 be the only person with the problem. But I am not a tech person and am not going to explore things that I know nothing about. Windows has a an image backup function and Windows sometime in the last twelve months decided to incapacitate this function while
 still pretending it continues to exist. Does Windows have a fix that I can run? Or is there some little trick that a non-tech person can implement?

<p>Hi Carsten,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might be caused by a damaged recovery partition. Since it can't boot as well even though you set the BIOS to boot from an external drive, we suggest that you delete all the partitions then create new ones. To do that, you need to reset your PC. Make
 sure to back up all your important files before doing so. Refer to this <strong>
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong> and go to the
<strong>Reset your PC</strong> section to reset your PC, then choose the <strong>
Remove everything </strong>option when prompted. You can also try other recovery options on the same link that we've provided if resetting will not work.
</p>

<p>On a Dell computer you may need to press F12 while the computer is restarting to get to the Boot Options menu. From there you can tell the computer to boot from your external disc drive. That's what I do to boot from my image software's recovery environment
 (Macrium Reflect.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The BIOS can only enumerate devices that directly connect to the motherboard, whereas our recovery environments connect to the motherboard through a USB cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Incidentally, why do make an image once a year? It's so easy to make an image every day and it takes only minutes. Reflect makes images automarically overnight, as do most third-party image applications.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For that matter, why are you still using discs when an external hard drive is so much more convenient?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, I think I've made enough trouble for one day.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime I have unsuccessfully tried to boot the Dell XPS13 via a USB drive. (This is after the original, unsuccessful attempt via a CD/DVD drive.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>-- Let me please double-check with you, and this is with an objective of re-installing an earlier (clean) WindowsImageBackup: do you mean I should do a Factory Reset on my Dell XPS13? After the factory reset, is it possible to install my WindowsImageBackup
 (which is dated sometime between when I bought the computer and today, and has all the software that I installed after I bought the computer).</p>
<p>
</p><p>My non-software (private, "my") files are all on an external hard drive, so that's not an issue. But I don't want to re-install each piece of software one by one, and then twist the settings of each piece of software again so things work the way I want.</p>

            Thanks, and I am confused. I am not a tech person. After I bought my Dell XPS13 (6th generation) I installed all the software I was planning to use, and tweaked it so it would work the way I needed it to. Then I did an WindowsImageBackup. About a year
 later, I reinstalled this original WindowsImageBackup, updated all software, and then did a new WindowsImageBackup. Now I want to re-install this second WindowsImageBackup (after having messed around on my computer for a year, and having used it in China for
 several months), and I can't (see my original problem description). I have in the meantime tried to boot from a USB port, using a flash drive, but without success. This is getting way beyond my technological knowledge. -- My one remaining question is: what
 if I do factory reset? Can I, after the factory reset, install the WindowsImageBackup? I don't want to be stuck with the original setup, and have to install all the software again. Thanks, Carsten<br />

<p><span>Hi Carsten,<br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A factory reset will remove most of your files on your computer. See the details below:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>All the personal files and user accounts.</span></li><li><span>Any apps and programs that are not preinstalled on this computer.</span></li><li><span>All changes to your <strong>Windows Settings</strong>.</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>Before you take this action, you need to determine which personal files and programs installed that needs to be backed up and will be removed.</span></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><span>Otherwise, you can select <strong>Reset PC</strong> instead of going on the path of
<strong>Factory Reset</strong> (visit this link for steps: </span><span><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/12415/windows-10-recovery-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Recovery options in Windows 10)</span></a></span><span>. Resetting
 will let you keep your personal files, apps, drivers, changes you’ve made to your settings. However, it will remove third-party applications. You can reinstall them later on.</span></p>

            Thanks -- and sorry it took me a long time to get back to this. The danger of doing something wrong with a Reset PC or Factory Reset are daunting, but I now want to finally act on it. -- I am aware that these measures remove my personal files, user accounts,
 apps/programs that are not preinstalled, and Windows Settings. My question still is, if I do a Reset PC or a Factory Reset, will I then afterwards be able to install a Windows Image Backup that I made of this same computer (unchanged configuration) about a
 year after I bought it and started using it. -- Rephrased: I am currently two years into using this computer. After I had used it for one year, I made a Windows Image Backup. If I now go back to time zero, Reset PC or Factory Reset, can I then afterwards install
 the Windows Image Backup that was created after I had used the computer for one year? Thanks, Carsten<br />

<span>“</span><em><span>No Drive:<span>&nbsp;</span>This feature requires removable media, such as a floppy disk
<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>or USB flash drive. Please insert a floppy disk or connect a USB flash drive,<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>and then try again</span></em><span>”</span><span>.&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span>5. Forgotten Password Wizard will start.<br />
6. Click <strong>Next</strong>. <br />
7. Choose a drive to store the password key file on.<br />
8. Click <strong>Next</strong>. <br />
9. Enter the current user account password and click <strong>Next</strong>. <br />
10. The password will be stored on the disk and a progress <br />
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>will be reporting the current status. Click<strong>Next</strong>.<br />
11. Click <strong>Finish</strong>. <br />
12. <strong>That’s it.</strong> </span><span><br />

<p>Hi</p>
<p><span><span>One way that you can do this is if you have another Administrator account that you can log on with. You can use the second administrator
 account to replace the password in the first account.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Here is another procedure that many have used to recover from this issue. You will need to have a Windows 7 installation Disk to perform
 this procedure.</span></span></p>

<h2>            The data error passed to a system call is too small - Vista</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I was installing a new Zebra printer. It ended up that the driver needed to be updated and when I try to do this I get 'the data area passed to a system call is too small'. The printer driver is from UPS for their Worldship, but, the tech people tell me
 the problem is mine to resolve. I can not find anything on this error except for SQL Server 2000. However, I am running Vista Business. Any help on this would be great as I am now without a printer because of this crazy issue. Thank you and have a great day!</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Home Premium 64&#58; Search &#47; Indexing Not Working.</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>I have seen several posts here with this problem and have tried all the suggestions. The problem is "search" does not work in Explorer or Start menu.</p>
<p>I can have a folder open, for test purposes, and looking at (even highlighted) the file and entered its name in the search box and received the reply "No items match your search." If I choose the "Search again in: [Computer]" it will after a slow search
 of everything find the file but will not find it in regular or start menu search.</p>
<p>Rebuild the&nbsp;Index&nbsp;in "Indexing Options" does not take the promised long time but completes in seconds with a result varying between "7 Items&nbsp;Indexed" and "252 Items Indexed" - it is never consistent and never anywhere near the number of files I have.</p>
<p>If I add new files it will find them for a brief while then they too return a "No items match your search result."</p>
<p>I have attempted the following to repair the situation:</p>
<p>- Create a New User Account: I followed the procedure and on copying from old user profile to new user profile, while in transition user profile, it "found" 24 items and copied them. Logging into new user profile none of the files from the old one are there.
 I tried this several times precisely as instructed and the same result. I then created a new profile and copied some files from an external drive into it to check: exactly the same problem, it would find the files after they had been moved but not after restart.
 Attempting to rebuild index in new profile resulted in the same inconsistent returns.</p>
<p>- sfc /scannow found no missing or corrupt files</p>
<p>- "troubleshoot search and indexing" found no problems and directed me here</p>
<p>- the Hotfix from KB977380 did not work</p>
<p>- restoring my computer to factory settings did not work (When restored to factory settings I transferred some music files from external drive before installing any other programmes, such as Outlook Professional 2010, the search worked when they were first
 moved but then the same problem shortly thereafter "No items match your search" result and inconsistent and low results in rebuild index.)</p>
<p>I'm trying to be as precise as possible, but believe at this stage I have tried everything with no success.</p>

<p>Fixed, for me and I hope others, the problem is McAfee security centre. Once uninstalled search/indexing works perfectly. I note at least one other user has a Dell machine which currently has an offer pre-packaging McAfee with its computers. I have made
 Dell aware of this problem and hopefully this fix will work for the others experiencing this. I have, of course, installed new security programs and they have no impact on indexing/search working as they should.</p>
<p>I post here the link to McAfee support forum's own page on this issue:&nbsp;<a href="http://community.mcafee.com/message/138193" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://community.mcafee.com/message/138193</a></p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>There are many factors that cause AMD Radeon graphics error 43. The most common causes are broken or old version AMD Radeon hardware, and an incompatible or outdated AMD Radeon graphics driver. If you keep on getting this error, we recommend
 trying the methods below:</span></p>
<p><strong>Method 1</strong>: Make Sure the AMD Radeon Hardware Is in the Slot<br />
Check the AMD Radeon hardware on your computer. Take down the graphics card from the slot and then reseat it firmly. Clean the slot if there were any dust.<br />
<br />
If the AMD Radeon graphics card is in an old version, such as AMD Radeon 3000, which cannot be supported by Windows 10 operating system, it is highly recommended to upgrade the graphics card to fix the AMD Radeon graphics error 43.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2</strong>: Use Troubleshooting to Fix AMD Radeon Graphics Error 43.<br />
You could also use Troubleshooting in Windows 10. Here are the steps:<br />
<br />
Step 1: Right-click the<strong> Start </strong>menu.<br />
Step 2: Select the <strong>Control Panel</strong>.<br />
Step 3: Click <strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.<br />
Step 4: Click the <strong>Hardware and Sound</strong> item.<br />
Step 5: Choose the <strong>Hardware and Devices</strong>.</p>
<p>Step 6: Click <strong>Next</strong> to make Windows detect hardware and devices problems.<br />
Step 7: Then click <strong>Apply this</strong> fix to solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Feel free to update us with the results.</span></span><span>

<p>Try going to the AMD website and redownload the 7900 series driver just in case it got disabled with the Windows Update...or did you do this already?</p>

<p>I wonder if uninstalling everything AMD found within the Device Manager, then Restart your device, and reattempt to download the 7900 driver from AMD.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you tried rolling back...assuming there's something to rollback to?</p>
<p>

 if the wipe of the drive allowed for the installation of the AMD 6450.</p>

</p><p>You need at least <strong>1024 X 768 </strong>screen resolution for modern apps to work. The Windows apps will not work in screen resolution less than 1024 X 768. To snap apps, you need a screen resolution of at least
<strong>1366 x 768</strong>. Make sure that the screen resolution meets these requirements. You can check this by:<br />
<br />
<strong>1. </strong>Right-click the mouse from the desktop interface and select <strong>
Display Settings </strong>&gt;<strong>Display</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced display settings</strong>.
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Check the screen resolution shown there. It should be at least 1024 X 768.<br />

<h2>            Can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t disable Parental Control or remember parental password.</h2>
                    
<p>Many years are passed(7 years, actually) since I signed into Xbox LIVE. Now I am almost 19 and still LIVE seems to not recognize i do not need parental control anymore. After the last XboxLIVE contract update i could not reactivate my account and accept
 the new terms, since i can't access to my parental mail anymore(it has been deleted) to change the password or remember it. Is there any way to deactivate parental control without having accepted the new terms or request a remote deactivation through support
 itself?</p>
<p>I have about 6 months LIVE gold on this account and features have been bought for it. Would be a shame to loose it, considering not all my achievement points.</p>

<p>Hello</p>
<p><strong>Forgot your Microsoft account password?</strong></p>
<div>
<p>If you get an in-valid email or password error, the Microsoft account email address or password you entered is incorrect. You may want to check to see if you are using the correct Microsoft account; to do that, see Find your Microsoft account below.</p>
<p>If the Microsoft account email address was automatically entered for you (for instance, if you’re a parent approving a child’s request), the password you entered is not correct, or there might be an issue with your account.</p>
<p>Try the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sign in at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.xbox.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Xbox.com</a>&nbsp;using your Microsoft account email address and password. Signing in at the website may resolve an issue that’s preventing you from signing in on your Xbox console.
</li><li>If you are taken to a sign-up page for Xbox LIVE when you sign in at Xbox.com, you’ve entered a valid Microsoft account email address and password, but the account you entered isn’t currently associated with an Xbox LIVE account. See Find your Microsoft
 account below for help finding the Microsoft account associated with your Xbox LIVE account.
</li><li>If you get an error when you try to sign in at Xbox.com, you have entered an in-valid password or email address. If you can’t remember your Microsoft account address or password, see&nbsp;<a href="https://account.live.com/ResetPassword.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">reset
 your Microsoft account password</a>.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<b>Note</b>&nbsp;If you reset your Microsoft account password, you will be prompted to choose one of several options to validate your identity—use an alternate email “proof,” have a code sent to your phone, or use a trusted PC for validation. For more information
 on these account proofs, see&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/billing-and-subscriptions/account-management/security-proofs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Add and update the security info for your Microsoft account</a>.
</li><li>If you can’t reset your password online, you can&nbsp;<a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">contact Microsoft account Customer Service</a>&nbsp;to request a password reset. You will be prompted for several pieces of identification information to
 help maintain your account’s security. Complete the form and click&nbsp;<b>Submit</b>, and a support agent will view your request.
</li></ol>
<p><b>Important</b>&nbsp;We regret that Xbox Support cannot help reset Microsoft account passwords. Please direct your password reset requests to&nbsp;<a href="https://account.live.com/acsr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Customer Service</a>.</p>

<p>I bought a new xbox from amazon only to find out that there isn't any hard drive and the worst part is the console has a parental control pass code which i do not have knowledge of neither do the sellers. I emailed them and try to ask for the password but
 they told me their's nothing they can do and besides its too late for me ask for a refund or an exchange. &nbsp;now am stuck with the xbox 360 console but cant play games on it. how do I take it off.............</p>

<p>If there is a parental pascode on the console, it wasn't a new xbox. They don't come with a pascode set up on them. I suggest contacting Amazon and reporting them for a fraudulent listing. You might be able to get your money back that way.</p>

                    <div><b>
<div>
<div>Dear Sir / Madam</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>With respect I wish to get help from you. I am a student. I have a netbook and I always use internet with the USB dongle and stick.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I could connect to internet with my USB dongle before and my internet USB dongle or device was installed automatically every time. When I just put it in my netbook USB port.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Now my 3 Network USB Internet dongle does not run in my netbook and does not install automatically.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Windows 7 can not recognise my USB Internet dongle and stick but all files and documents or any other devices are recognised by my netbook. I can install my documents and files using USB port and I checked my netbook USB ports are okay.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I do not know why Windows 7 can not install my internet USB dongle and device.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I tried to solve this problem in the many ways but without success.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>1st &nbsp;I fully scanned my netbook with Norton Anti Virus and Internet Security 2012.</div>
<div>2nd I have done troubleshooting with Windows.</div>
<div>3rd I have updated my netbook Windows and all devices.</div>
<div>4th I restored system and made a restore point&nbsp;</div>
<div>5th I downloaded Microsoft Fix it 50052 software and tried to fix my netbook after installing the software.</div>
<div>6th I downloaded a CCleaner software and I fixed windows Registry problem.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>But these actions could not solve my Internet USB dongle’s installation problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please note that I also downloaded Huawei 3G Application and Huawei 3G Module Driver from the manufacturer support page but I can not set up these Application and Driver. Windows 7 Says Extract Failed ! Please check that data bin is exist. I do not know
 how to install driver and application? I already uninstalled previous driver and application from my netbook. A issue has found after troubleshooting Driver Setup detected as Incompatible Application.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I also tried to fix installation problem with the computer management, Change Drive Letter and Paths. But Internet USB dongle was not installed in the Disk Management.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>My Netbook Model Number is Acer Aspire One A0521 and my Internet USB Dongle Model Number is E160G HSDPA USB Stick. I checked that the dongle works in another machine.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Please could you give me any advice on how I can solve this problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>With thanks</div>

Other than trying it again, I can only suggest you contact Huawei support. &nbsp;This is related specifically to your device running on your netbook... they are the experts you need help from.

            If you got your dongle from your ISP contact them first instead of Huawei.&nbsp; You are more likely to get a swift response from the ISP.

            Hello! I am an Independent Advisor, I would love to help you out!
<br />
<br />I can not gurantee it, but windows 10 generally is able to find the right drivers in most cases. 
<br />
<br />Although it is definitely best to have them on hand just in case. 
<br />
<br />If you go here: <a href="https://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/Z77%20Extreme4/#Download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.asrock.com/mb/Intel/Z77%20Extreme4/...</a>
<br />
<br />The last driver listed is "ASRock XFast LAN utility". I believe this is what you would need. 
<br />
<br />Let me know if there is anything else!
