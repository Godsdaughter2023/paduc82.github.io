<h2>            Accidentally denied myself access to documents folder...cannot change back - access denied&#33;</h2>
                    <span>
                    <span>

<p>Operating system: Windows 7 Professional</p>
<p><span>I wanted to setup my PC so I could share it and wanted to protect my files since other uses don't need to access them so:</span></p>

<p>I went to "My Documents" (this is a separate partition <strong>
A: </strong>drive) went into the folder properties under security and selected under<strong>Group or user names:</strong> the group called
<strong>Users (Computer\Users)</strong>&nbsp;I then selected Deny for "Full control" thus ticking the deny box for every permission, and clicked okay.</p>
<p>A little warning message came up to remind me that Deny permissions override Allow permissions and I clicked Okay. &nbsp;I suddenly thought that since my user account falls into the category "Users" I might be blocking myself from accessing
 my files, and I had, and it was too late to change my mind.</p>
<p><strong>I now no longer have access to my A: drive (My Documents Folder)&nbsp;and cannot change permissions to allow myself to access it since I am denied access.</strong></p>
<p>There is &nbsp;one user account, mine, which is an administrator one (I assume) and if I right click on My Documents and open Properties, there is not even a "Security" tab anymore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can I change it back, this is a disaster and I'm feeling very foolish.</p>

<p>Thanks for the feedback.</p>
<p>OK, you make me eat my words. The disk manager says that 100% of the disk is free, yet you report that your files are there. Very strange.</p>
<p>You should now do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy all files and folders to some other medium while under Ubuntu (which you appear to have done already).</li><li>Format your data drive. </li><li>Give it a name (e.g. Data) and a drive letter other than A:. </li><li>Restore your data files. </li><li>Implement a proper backup process. </li></ol>
Step 5 is what you should have done ages ago. It would have spared you the agony.

    <title>Disk space problems with update to Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jiric  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disk space problems with update to Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to update a newly bought IdeaPad Yoga 300 - 11IBY. It came with 8.1 64-bit version. I got the message described here: http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/a-fix-is-released-to-improve-disk-space/f6c6d3f0-fb27-41e1-b6eb-c6bf4a39aa6e?tab=question&amp;status=AllReplies#tabs</p>
<p>
</p><p>The C: drive is 19.7 GB, the recovery partition about 8 GB. I did not add any new files, I started immediately with the update. I hoped to keep all preinstalled drivers and tools from Lenovo. Adding external hard disk did not help.</p>
<p>System requirements for 64-bit Windows10 is at least 20 GB. Does it mean that I should delete the recovery partition and create just one bigger partition? Or shall I expect that the tool described in the answer linked above will be available for Windows
 8.1 too? Or is there other solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p><br />

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query on Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To upgrade to Windows 10 you definitely need to free up some space in you&nbsp;C: drive. However,&nbsp;we would not suggest you to merge recovery&nbsp;partition and C : drive, because you would not be able to recover your system in case something went wrong which require
 recovery partition.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest you to refer to the section "<strong>How do I free up space to upgrade for the upgrade"</strong> from the article given below and check.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Before you do anything I would strongly advise making a System Image of your drive to the external one... Just In Case...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did this same thing several weeks ago except with 32 bit Windows...</p>
<p>The Backup System Image saved my bacon twice... I would have a useless tablet without it...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you could delete the 8GB Recovery Partition...</p>
<p>Windows 10 will eventually delete this anyway... One reason the backup Image turned out to be quite valuable... I ran into a problem and the Recovery partition was gone...</p>

            <p>I still did not manage to update. I have created a copy of the recovery partition to an external USB flash, but I am not able to delete the recovery partition using standard system tools. I have also tried to clean up again the disk space, but since it is
 a new pc, the only significant space suggested by disk clean up were Windows 10 installation files. I have applied recent OS fixes and tried again (after deleting Windows 10 installation files) the whole procedure with the same result.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I&nbsp; see a contradiction between the space requirements for Windows 10 64 bit edition (20 GB space) and a size of the C: partition (19.7). The difference seems small but may be important (?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have also downloaded a Windows 10 installation on a USB key to install a fresh new system. I did not tried that yet, because I wait for the local Lenovo support (not available during the Xmass holidays).

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know you said you made a copy of the Recovery partition... you need to make a System Image of the entire 32gb... The recovery partition is useless with out the rest...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the size of the partition FREE SPACE, or the actual size of the partition...</p>
<p>You will end up with TWO sets of Windows Files when you upgrade... that is the reason you need so much free space... The old stuff can be deleted later, but that is of no benefit during the upgrade...</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will need a 3rd party tool on a bootable flash drive to delete the 8gb partition...</p>
<p>I can provide more info if you chose to do that...</p>

<p>No do some research before you post. The domain name was already&nbsp;owned by someone&nbsp;before activision had a chance to&nbsp;reserve it&nbsp;and that person chose to redirect&nbsp;the site to Battlefield.com no hacks were done. Mw3's website is callofduty.com/mw3 end thread.

    <title>Two things installing&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> angelkenzie  say:</h3>
<h2>            Two things installing&#63;</h2>
                    When ever I try to download anything of a larger size, such as skype and games, an error comes up saying two things are installing and therefore what ever I'm currently trying to install won't. I've done everything skype has recommended to do to install
 itself, as well as the numerous game I've attempted to download. Clearly since this problem has occurred with different programs it must be a software issue, and I did not have this issue with Windows 8. Is there anything I can do to fix this?

            <p>Thanks Angel,</p>
<p>I have a couple of suggestions.&nbsp; There's a few places the system keeps track of any ongoing installations, so that two can't run at once.&nbsp; Obviously you never want to install two things at the same time, but it sounds like the flag for "in progress" is stuck
 on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on where it's stuck means we may need to check a few places.&nbsp; Here's what I'd recommend first:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Try restarting the Installer service.</strong><br />
To do this, right-click Start and choose Run.&nbsp; Type "services.msc" and then click OK.<br />
Find "Windows Installer" in the list and double-click it.<br />
Finally, stop the service with the "stop" button, then click OK and close the Services list.<br />
Now try installing your program (like Skype or the Sims) again.<br />
<br />
<br />
if that doesn't work, the next thing I'd try is this:<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li><strong>Remove the InProgress registry key.</strong><br />
Right-click Start and choose Run. Type "regedit" and then click OK.<br />
In the left side, open the folders to get to this path:<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Installer\<br />
</em>Look under the Installer folder (expand it to see the folders underneath it).&nbsp; If you see a "InProgress" folder there, right-click it and Export it to your desktop (to save a backup of it), then right-click it again and delete it.<br />
In my example below I do not have an "InProgress" folder (it should only show while an installer is running or just recently ran but is waiting for a reboot).<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2e0c7659-abfa-48e6-8a8b-e18410426e50" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/2e0c7659-abfa-48e6-8a8b-e18410426e50" /></a><br />
<br />
After deleting the InProgress folder, restart your computer normally and then try install your program again.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Please let me know if either of these help, or if you have any questions.</p>

    <title>System Restore failure on Windows 10 PC - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> carol147  say:</h3>
<h2>            System Restore failure on Windows 10 PC</h2>
                    <p>I tried a System Restore on my older Acer laptop which is upgraded to Windows 10 and when things go wrong in most cases a System restore works. This time it didn't change things and the process failed. I tried again with a different restore point and the
 same thing happened. I have had this happen periodically and when it does it calls for resetting my computer. A long process. It means installing my programs all over. The software I use is embroidery and quilt programs and so they are quite large with updates
 to install once again. I am tired of the whole process and the time it takes. Is there anything I can do to make this a much more simple process? I'm not computer savvy with backing my computer and past attempts have failed. Sorry I don't have a system restore
 error number. I need some advice and would be very grateful.&nbsp;</p>

<p>System Restore is a wonderful tool - if it works. Unfortunately it fails far too often. I suggest you do this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run the command&nbsp;<em>SystemPropertiesProtection.exe</em> to open the System Restore configuration panel.</li><li>Turn off System Restore on all partitions. This will delete all existing restore points.</li><li>Turn on System Restore on the system partition. This should fix the restore problem.</li><li>Plug in your USB backup disk.</li><li>Open the <em>Control Panel / File History</em>.</li><li>Click Create a system image.</li><li>Plug in a small flash disk (1 GByte will do)</li><li>Click Create a <em>System Repair Disk</em>. Do NOT copy the system files.</li></ol>
<p>If you ever need to re-install Windows then you can do it quickly like so:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you have a recent backup of your data files.</li><li>Boot the machine with the small flash disk.</li><li>Restore the image from the USB backup disk.</li><li>Restore your data from your backup.</li></ol>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel your pain with system restore. It's not reliable enough to be my only option for backup. Look up different ways to backup your computer. I do recommend having an external drive so that even if your hard drive fails, you have something that you can use
 to replace that drive. I recommend AOMEI backup for that, its free as well. I do have another recovery software that is like system restore, it's called Rollback Rx. I got the pro version now but I started with the freeware. Its basically system restore but
 for your whole hard drive, it will restore all data in your drive when you basically restore to and older restore point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Stay backed up, you never know when you can get a crippling error in your computer and lose years worth of data.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers!</p>

    <title>Where are all the games I purchased&#63; My list is empty&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> alizona327  say:</h3>
<h2>            Where are all the games I purchased&#63;  My list is empty&#63;</h2>
                    <p>About four years ago I owned an Xbox console and I bought a bunch of 
games for it.&nbsp; I sold the console and wiped it clean before doing so.&nbsp; 
Today, I'm now using the PC Xbox app, with my old user account, same 
one, except my games list is empty.&nbsp; Where are all the games I 
purchased?&nbsp; Do I actually need an Xbox console to access my games?&nbsp; Do 
the games I purchased under this account expire after a certain period 
of time?&nbsp; My "Account History" shows one 5-dollar transaction for 
"points" (that's the only description) back in 2012.&nbsp; Where is the 
transaction history showing all my previous game purchases, such as Minecraft?&nbsp; Thanks for any help 
and advice.</p>



<p>P.S. If cannot play any of the games I purchased thru the Xbox console on my PC, then please explain to me - what the purpose of having this Xbox app on my PC?</p>

<h2>            How can I make Cortana talk when asked questions via text&#63;</h2>
                    The official Microsoft pages I've found say Cortana will only respond by talking if spoken to via microphone.&nbsp; I'd like to make it so she talks no matter how a question is asked.&nbsp; It seems this should be an option, if only for accessibility.&nbsp; Is there
 a registry key I could change, or some other way to make her always respond by talking aloud?

            Hi ,
<br />
<br />Sorry to hear you're experiencing this issue!
<br />
<br />I'm Ramzi, an Independent advisor, here to help you.
<br />
<br />I would like to inform that, you will have to use mic to access Cortana or talk to Cortana.
<br />
<br />You may also type your question in Search bar to know the results from Cortana. So unfortunately, there is no other solution.
<br />
<br />Let me know if I can help you further!

<p>I'm trying to get it to work using text-to-speech.&nbsp; Two problems:&nbsp; 1) Cortana nearly mutes the PC audio when listening, so she can't hear TTS commands.&nbsp; 2) It seems I have to train Cortana to recognize my TTS voice, but clicking "play" on the TTS application
 during setup closes Cortana.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I may be able to resolve problem 2 by using a handheld recording device or a second PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Problem 1, however, is a serious problem.&nbsp; How can I make Cortana stop lowering the PC audio?</p>

            Try this:
<br />Head to Control Panel and select Hardware and Sound, and then click on Sound to launch the sound configuration window. Alternatively, if you have Control Panel organized by icon instead of category, you can just choose Sound from the list.
<br />In the Sound configuration window, click on the Communications tab. This is the location where this automatic reduction feature is configured

<p>That had no effect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also tried disabling enhancements and unchecking "allow applications to take exclusive control of this device" in my speaker configuration settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried setting up my microphone again, only speaking very softly, and then speaking very loudly.&nbsp; Neither of those attempts had any effect.</p>

<p>11.1 In Windows explorer, go to your desktop or any convenient folder.&nbsp; Select the folder in the navigation pane [the left-hand pane].&nbsp; Press Shift-RightClick, select Open command prompt here.</p>

<p>which confirms that the system knows it should not "Require a password on wakeup".&nbsp; I believe that a video driver error or system compatibility problem are the only explanations for your problem in this case.</p>
<p>11.5 If the values are 0x00000001 then the system still believes that you have chosen to&nbsp; "Require a password on wakeup".&nbsp; Step 8 in my previous reply should have prevented this from happening. If this is the case then re-check the settings in my original
 steps 1-3.&nbsp; If your settings in 1-3 suppress the password requirement yet this result occurs then the Fixit in my step 8 above has not solved the problem.&nbsp; I would also have expected SFC in my step 9 above to have resolved this.&nbsp; If it hasn't then you have
 a system problem that I don't understand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>11.6 You should be able to fix the values in 11.5 by running powercfg to set these values manually.&nbsp; You can see the almost-full syntax using powercfg /? but, for example, the h in qh is not listed [/q gets you the properties, /qh gets the the full list

I get this error message for all programs I try to install. I found the problem already posted in the forum, but none of the steps outlined to help worked. I really do not know what to do anymore. I did a complete system restore to furthest point available
 ( and at which everything was still working) but that didn't help.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can I do?</p>

<p><span>Hi Akama,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Are you trying to install the programs from the disc or from Internet Explorer?</span></li><li><span>Are you using any third party download manager to download the programs from Internet?</span></li><li><span>What are the steps you have tried so far?</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If this is happening when you try to install the programs by downloading from Internet, try the steps below and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Optimize Internet Explorer and also temporarily disable the antivirus software running on the computer and the then try downloading and
 installing the executable files and check if the issue persists.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
 to optimize Internet Explorer - Method 1: Clear cached data in Internet Explorer</span></span></strong></a></span></span></p>
<p>
 antivirus software</span></strong></a></span></span></p>
<p><span>Warning:</span></p>
<p><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your
 antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to
 attacks.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Place the computer in a clean boot state and troubleshoot the issue and check if it helps. You can start Windows Vista or Windows 7 by
 using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span><span>How
 to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></span></strong></a></span></span><strong><span><br />
(Step 1: Perform a clean boot)</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If your issue is resolved after performing Clean Boot, then follow the steps mentioned in the following KB article to narrow down the
 exact source: <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>Also, see the section on how return your computer to a Normal startup mode by following the steps under “Reset the computer to start
 as usual”, after performing the clean boot troubleshooting.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 3:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If both above mentioned steps fail then, I would suggest you to try a system restore and check if it helps.</span></p>

<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Step 4:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may also unregister and reregister windows installer service on your computer and check if it helps you fix the
 issue. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To do this, follow these steps:<br />
&nbsp;<br />
a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Click on the <strong><span>Start</span></strong> menu, click on<strong><span>Run.</span></strong><br />
b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the <strong><span>Open</span></strong> box, type<strong><span>msiexec /unreg</span></strong><strong>,</strong> and
 then press ENTER.<br />
c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the <strong><span>Start</span></strong> menu, click<strong><span>Run</span></strong>.<br />
d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the <strong><span>Open</span></strong> box, type<strong><span>msiexec /regserver</span></strong>, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Access the link below and follow the steps in the article to fix common Windows installer issues.</span></p>

            <p>Sounds like there's a BIOS password, If so then try Turning off the laptop &amp; removing all external connections (USB devices, Ethernet cables, power cable etc) &amp; the battery, remove the CMOS battery &amp; press the power button to discharge any power residue
 then leave it for 60 minutes &amp; reconnect the CMOS battery, laptop battery &amp; power cable &amp; turn on the device.</p>
<p>This should remove said password.</p>

            <p>Hi Kp,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) No not connected to any domain.</p>
<p>2)Yes I am administrator to my personal laptop. However didnot initiate a 'administrator passwod'.</p>
<p>3) Yes. Logged in to Microsoft account.</p>
<p>4)Yes maybe forgot password. Normally personal used passwords do not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>History; My daughter recieved phone call from some false Telstra representatives saying they could repair our internet 'outage' problem. After giving them remote access to laptop and some of her personal details, they wanted credit card details. Thats when
 we cut the link with them. The whole process up to that stage took about an hour.</p>
<p>Feeling paranoid that they may have installed a 'spyware/malware' program. I decided to 'backup' all my personal data and 'reset/format' my laptop.</p>
<p>However during the 'backup' procedure my laptop 'powered down'.</p>
<p>When I restarted it, it took me to &nbsp;the 'reset menu' and restart password box.
</p>
<p>It rebooted the system after several failed attempts at incorrect password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I did get access to reset menu I decided to 'reset' and with 'keep personal files' option.</p>
<p>Upon rebooting, it does not go into 'reset menu' now but opens up 'restart password' box and then reboots back to this screen after 3 failed attemps. It continues this loop even after I've powered down and removed the battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7 approx. 8 months ago. I do not remember seeing this startup password box or I may have forgotten its unique &nbsp;code???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate any advice you can offer...</p>

<p>Hi Kp,</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) No not connected to any domain.</p>
<p>2)Yes I am administrator to my personal laptop. However didnot initiate a 'administrator passwod'.</p>
<p>3) Yes. Logged in to Microsoft account.</p>
<p>4)Yes maybe forgot password. Normally personal used passwords do not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>History; My daughter recieved phone call from some false Telstra representatives saying they could repair our internet 'outage' problem. After giving them remote access to laptop and some of her personal details, they wanted credit card details. Thats when
 we cut the link with them. The whole process up to that stage took about an hour.</p>
<p>Feeling paranoid that they may have installed a 'spyware/malware' program. I decided to 'backup' all my personal data and 'reset/format' my laptop.</p>
<p>However during the 'backup' procedure my laptop 'powered down'.</p>
<p>When I restarted it, it took me to &nbsp;the 'reset menu' and restart password box.
</p>
<p>It rebooted the system after several failed attempts at incorrect password.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When I did get access to reset menu I decided to 'reset' and with 'keep personal files' option.</p>
<p>Upon rebooting, it does not go into 'reset menu' now but opens up 'restart password' box and then reboots back to this screen after 3 failed attemps. It continues this loop even after I've powered down and removed the battery.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7 approx. 8 months ago. I do not remember seeing this startup password box or I may have forgotten its unique &nbsp;code???</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate any advice you can offer...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Running Windows 10 Home. Upgraded from Windows 8.1. Windows 10 required an administrator.
</p>
<p>I'm the administrator and always use my password in order to access this computer.
</p>
<p>You could have multiple users set up. The email would be different and it would require another password.</p>
<p>Regarding phone calls, My Husband was getting calls from a so called Dell representative requesting a remote access. This is the only Dell computer &amp; I'm the only one that uses it.

<p>You should turn off the PC first, disconnect all USB devices, take power connector out, &nbsp;remove the laptop battery, remove cmos battery, press power button to discharge any remaining power then leave it.</p>

<p>Your guess is as good as mine, but if he is asking about installing via Hard Drive. it is best you install DISC 1 and ONLY Disc 1 on your HDD. Disc 2 should NOT be installed via HDD to prevent "pop in" issues.</p>

<p>Hopefully, this is what you were asking, OP.</p>

<h2>            Microsoft Store version of Skype won&#39;t recognise webcam camera</h2>
                    Hi! Had to re-install Skype and it forced me to use the Microsoft Store version. Hey, ho! Although this version is able to find my Webcam's microphone (via drop-down list of devices), it can't find the camera for teh video. Tested my Philips Webcam on
 third party sites and it is working just fine. On the non-microsoft store version of Skype, it worked with no issues. Anyone have any ideas. Thanks.

<h2>            Performance of my computer is brutal. Computer is very slow. What should I do&#63;</h2>
                    Hi. I've never really experienced many problems with my computer, until recently. Whenever I start up the computer, it runs really slowly. I can barely open anything, and I can play any of the
 games I have. However, when I restart the computer, it starts working again for a bit, and then it will revert back into being dysfunctional. I'm not sure what to do. It's becoming a nuisance, because I'm a gamer, and I can barely play the games I love anymore.
 My computer just downright refuses to work. I also don't understand why restarting makes the computer work for a while.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've done everything to make the computer preform better. I've run virus scans, I've defragged my files, I've made sure not too many things open at my computer start-up, I've cleaned my registry,
 I've run a disk check, and I've deleted useless files. Nothing has worked. I've been searching for an answer, but I haven't come up with any luck. I bought this computer in August, so it is fairly new. I'm out of options here. I also don't want to buy a new
 computer, because I paid good money for this.</div>

<div>I don't know if this will&nbsp;necessarily help, but I can remember a few computer specs that I have. I don't remember them all, though. I also don't know the exact names, either.</div>

<div>Windows 7 Professional&nbsp;x64</div>
<div>Intel i7-3770k Processor</div>
<div>nVidia GeForce GTX 630m</div>

<div>I also have 16 GBs of RAM.</div>

<div>I'm praying that someone can give me an answer. I can go on with a computer like this. Maybe it was a file I downloaded; I'm not sure. Anyway, hopefully someone can respond to this in time before
 I lose my sanity.</div>

"I've cleaned my registry" &lt;- many people will stop you right there.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Have you imaged the computer so you have a complete backup you could restore from scratch with then installed Windows 7 cleanly, updating the drivers from the individual hardware manufacturer web pages manually, updating Windows 7 completely to see if that
 helps?&nbsp; (The image is so you could go back to the very point you were at before - in case the re-install didn't make any difference.)

            I've included both my application and system logs in this reply. Hopefully they will help, as I've seen a few errors in the logs. If I did something wrong, or if this isn't what you're looking for, reply back.<br />

            The anti-virus that I use is Kasperky. I've heard terrible things about it, but I got it mainly cause it was one of the cheapest. In fact, Kaspersky could be one of my problems, but I'm not sure. I've also attempted to use some free things, like Ad-Aware.
 I haven't had much luck with either, and probably for a good reason. If you have any anti-virus programs that I should use other than the ones I'm using, then reply back.<br />

            Alright, I have figured out the main problem, but I haven't the slightest idea how to get rid of it. It appears that my computer hates downloading. If I download something, the computer goes slow. If I even open the downloaded file, the computer goes slow.
 For example, I downloaded a little thing for my game that I was playing. After I finished downloading, the computer refused to work properly. After I got it back up, when I went to play the game, it refused to work and eventually slowed the entire computer
 down. This happens with any and every download I've done over the past week. It's irritating, because I used to do a lot of downloading, and now I can't without a consequence. If anyone can help me, it would be greatly appreciated. If it is important, the
 two games which have given me grief with downloading are Quake 2 and Amnesia: The Dark Descent. Also, programs (or .exe files) that I download give out problems too. I'm hoping that I can find an answer for this.<br />

<p>System Restore is not a suitable tool for file backups. There are several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>System Restore runs when Windows decides it's time to run. You could, of course, create a scheduled task for this purpose but this is not trivial.</li><li>Windows will delete System Restore points according to rules that we do not know, in particular after automatic updates.</li><li>System Restore is designed to back up system files. While it also backs up some user files, we do not know which ones it selects or ignores.</li></ul>
<p>I recommend you set up a robust backup scheme and pay attention to the iron rule of data processing: Important files must at all times be stored on two independent media.</p>

<p>Let me add to Fredrik's excellent advice...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Restore is for SYSTEM restore, not a backup.&nbsp; It can be a saviour in a case when you have installed some miscreant software, but sometimes, if you do not catch it quickly enough, a useful restore point is no longer available.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
<span>The default restore point space allotment in Windows 7 is 1 to 3% of drive capacity. &nbsp;</span><span>Typically, this
 does not allow for more than a few restore points.&nbsp;</span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>In almost all cases,
 the computer is using a very small proportion of the space available. That makes it very practical to raise that 3% to say 8 to 10%.&nbsp; This strategy will yield far more restore points that will give you much more flexibility in recovering a bad situation.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">
To change the allotment, type create in the text box above the start globe.&nbsp; Choose Create a restore point.&nbsp; Click configure.&nbsp; Move the slide to the right as much as you see fit.&nbsp; Setting it at 50 Gigabytes will have no affect if you have a 500 Gigabyte drive
 and are only using about 100 or so, which is highly typical.</p>

                    Hello .... I went to&nbsp;Square One store in my city Mississauga, Canada . One of their manager there told me that Microsoft doesn't update their USB flash drive ( windows 10 Pro ) . He said they've never done so and the version they had were the original
 version . Well, I did some searching only to find what he told me to be a lie. So I try calling other Microsoft stores in my area.&nbsp; The problem with calling is you never actually speak to anyone from within the store but rather you will be redirect to one
 of Microsoft calling center. MY gosh are these people totally clueless . I wanted to know what version build the other stores had and the 2 representative I spoke to only could tell me they have windows 8 pro usb, that is it . Couldn't even tell me whether
 its the latest version or not. They had no clue what so ever of any builds or versions . Truly SAD ... Yes, I know I could download the latest from MS site, its not the point . If I'm buying a software I want to know its the l

</p><p>I finally resolved the problem with the imports. When I connected my phone to my Acer PC with Windows 8.1 and turned it on, it said "charging" and I couldn't upload any photos because my phone wasn't recognized by the computer. On my Toshiba laptop it recognized
 the phone but I still couldn't send pics to the laptop or vice versa. However, after your answer, I tried again on my laptop with Windows 10, and when the phone was blinking "charging" I received a notice on my screen that said "other options". When I opened
 that notice, I saw the option to transfer photos, clicked on it, and the problem was solved. The Acer still doesn't recognize my phone, but no problem since the laptop with Windows 10 does.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm glad I asked the question, because otherwise I wouldn't have found out about the One Drive application. I now have all my phone pics stored on one drive and organized into albums. So, this non-computer-saavy person is happy. Thanks again.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Skype v12 for Window 10, Group call Not able to lock specific user camera</h2>
                    <p>Dear, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using Skype v12 for Window 10 and having group calls. Unlike other version for different window version, I can't lock a certain user camera but instead just keep jumping to ones has noise.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason is we're using skype to attend class but we need to look at the teacher but i can't find the setting to lock on to teacher's webcam but instead skype just keep jumping webcams.&nbsp;

<p>Hi <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/1b566e55-46c1-4578-9d11-9c9c22b7d194" title="LawrenceTsai">
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Skype Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As of the moment, this feature isn't available yet to Skype version 12.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Will make sure to take note about your concern and will forward it to our developer for them to review it and hopefully will be included to the future updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>

<p>Dear Mark,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. &nbsp;Since my kids are using latest version of window and skype, this causes us some troublesome because the class is base on language and kids need to see teacher's mouth clearly so they can learn how to pronounce correctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to downgrade the skype in window 10? &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, I use additional LCD screen on the laptop and therefore, v12 keep popping out a small screen (I think that's the reason why a small screen pops out) allowing me to slide over to another screen. &nbsp;I would say this is a great feature but very hard
 to use. &nbsp;The reason is whenever i click other area, the mini screen pops back out where the main skype screen is. &nbsp;I have to slide it over every time. &nbsp;I would suggest the hover mini screen can be locked where users would like it to be. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>
        </p>

</p><p>We regret that the classic Skype is no longer available for download as it had some issues with the Skype for Windows desktop installer.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are taking note of your suggestions and forward them to our developers. We greatly appreciate them.
