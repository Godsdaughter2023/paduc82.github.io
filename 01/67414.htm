    <title>Keyboard suddenly stops working for SOME open programs but not all. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Keyboard suddenly stops working for SOME open programs but not all.</h2>
                    <p>I have had Windows 10 for a few months now.&nbsp; Several times a day, my keyboard will stop working for SOME applications, but not all.&nbsp; It seems as though when this happens, I can usually open FireFox and have no trouble there (can type in search field or address
 bar).&nbsp; And on the occasion, even that doesn't work and I will have to reboot to fix the issue.&nbsp; Rebooting always fixes the issue, but is a major inconvenience as I am very busy and don't always have time to shut down all of my applications and wait for the
 laptop to reboot.&nbsp; Additionally, when this issue occurs, I still have power to keyboard (have tested this when using my USB keyboard and the laptop keyboard).&nbsp; Also to note, this happens even when I am not using my USB keyboard and only using the laptop keyboard
 (have tested this both ways)---originally thought this could be a USB issue, but I have eliminated the USB keyboard as being the problem----As I am typing this today, I don't even have the USB keyboard plugged in and just had the problem happen (again) using
 the laptop keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sometimes, closing the application and reopening will fix the issue, but that usually isn't the case.&nbsp; Typing in Microsoft outlook will be working, I will leave outlook for a second to check/verify something I am adding to the email and when I return, keyboard
 no longer works.&nbsp; As mentioned above, this is intermittent and unfortunately, I have no way of reproducing this issue until it occurs.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I called HP and the guy I spoke with couldn't stop telling me how great of a laptop I purchased so I eventually just hung up when he told me that there were no other reported issues of this.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any others experiencing this issue?&nbsp;&nbsp; Any suggestions?&nbsp; Thanks in advance.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>I've had the same issue now and then but today it's been consistent. The problem is Firefox and is an ongoing bug with the program made worse by Windows 10 but only on certain websites and certain types of entry.&nbsp; My issue is with Disqus. The only answer
 I know of is to use a different browse. </p>
<p>IE is still a cludge and will soon be unsupported to force us onto edge Edge. Edge appears to be a joke. I'll find something that works and isn't awful but I have no answers for anyone other than the suggestion above made no difference at all</p>

<p>Fireboss(2), thank you for your reply.&nbsp; I spent the entire day yesterday NOT using Firefox as it is the only application that seems to always work when the problem occurs.&nbsp; So I thought I would try eliminating it for the sake of gathering more data.&nbsp; So,
 I used Chrome and the Edge browser and didn't run into the problem.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I will continue using Chrome for the time being and if the problem doesn't occur again----it will be a step in the correct direction for troubleshooting the issue.&nbsp; Once I can confirm that Firefox is the problem, I will open a ticket with them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the reply.&nbsp; Glad I am not the only one struggling through this.</p>

            <p>Google keyboard stops working in Firefox and you'll find several threads going back to 2006. I suspect there are things that make it worse as I haven't had the issue on my desktop but it have on my Asus laptop<br />
There was a time I'd have started dissecting the cause but after reading the threads from years past find other have done tried and now I'm too old to waste my time.&nbsp; I may try Cyberfox or waterfox but for now I languish in Chrome.</p>

            <p>Just an update:&nbsp; I had the same issue happen again this morning when arrived.&nbsp; As mentioned in my previous post, I have taken FireFox out of the equation and haven't used it for the last day.&nbsp; Instead I used Chrome all of yesterday and did not run into a
 problem (yesterday).&nbsp; When I got to work this morning, I had to unlock my laptop by using the touch screen keyboard because the problem happened again----I couldn't use the keyboard to type in my password.&nbsp; Once I gained access using the touch screen, I opened
 Chrome and closed two of the four open tabs before I could finally type something (in any application).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I find it very hard to believe that this is a browser related issue that ISN'T the result of either an issue being caused by HP, or by Windows 10, or by the touch screen option, as I have never run into this this issue before purchasing this laptop (and
 upgrading to Windows 10).&nbsp; I commonly use Chrome and FireFox and sometimes a mixture of the two and never had this issue occur (not even once) before making this change.&nbsp;

            <p>I can rule out the HO side of it, my laptop is an Asus. I think however the issue could be the touchscreen keyboard, I only started using it to add emoji to Tweets and unless my memory is fooling me the typing issue appeared after that.
</p>
<p>Since I have same software on my desktop but it isn't a touch screen it may be that in some way the touch screen is being activated and shutting of the keyboard to certain programs.&nbsp; As my mouse works when this happens I'll fiddle with it and see if I can
 make it stop. </p>

            <p>If someone still encounters this problem - and yes I know its old - I found out this is REALLY caused by Mozilla Firefox.</p>
<p>It seems to take some kind of exclusive access to Keyboard sometimes...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just stop firefox and your keyboard will work again!</p>

<p>Folks, I've been experiencing this problem intermittently and most often have to re-boot the system to fully eliminate the issue. However I can confirm that it's not related to any browser (Fox, Chrome, IE or Edge specifically). I don't have Fox on my system
 at all; Installed Chrome just a couple of weeks ago. However experienced the problem intermittently (once in a week I believe).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

    <title>Problem with Windows 10 Update Assistant - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mohd shadab akhtar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Problem with Windows 10 Update Assistant</h2>
                    I have windows 10 home installed on my laptop. I was facing some problems with several applications and thought about updating it. Initially when I tried to update it from settings, the update stuck at 0% and wasn't moving at all so I tried stopping the
 update using command prompt with the command "NET STOP WUAUSERV" but it showed as it's not responding. So I downloaded windows Update Assistant. &nbsp;After starting it, it downloaded the update first and it started updating windows 10. Till 80% it was going fine
 but after that it was taking time for every percent and finally stuck at 99%. I thought that there might be some problem with the windows so I got it reset. After reset the update in "settings-&gt;Update&amp;Security-&gt;Windows update" was stopped (earlier it was stuck
 at 0% and wasn't stopping). Now again I tried updating with&nbsp;Windows 10 Update Assistant and it again stuck at 99%. Please help me with this problem. I want to update my windows.

            Hi BillFish1981,<br />
<br />
A little more information would be helpful. What game are you trying to play; Why did you do a System Restore? Have you installed anything else on your system prior to this problem beginning?&nbsp;What version of Vista are you running, 32 or 64 bit?<br />
<br />
<br />
If Windows is unable to run applications due to a .dll error, this .dll may be missing or you may have registry error. Such errors can heavily influence the performance of your PC. You can try to re-register the d3d9.dll file in the registry:<br />
<br />
Visit the following link to get instructions on how to reinstall the .DLL<br />

            <p>Thank you for your reply, I did the uninstall and install 4 times no change. I used Microsoft virus scanner (&nbsp;the &nbsp;full scan ) found no virus but it scanned almost 2 million files. That seems to be a large amount for what I have on this computer.&nbsp;Could that
 be the reason it takes so long to scan? Could there be excess files left over from windows 7 when window 10 downloaded. This stared at the time of window 10 upgrade.</p>

<h2>            Challenge phrase requested on every boot up</h2>
                    For the past couple of weeks my computer has been asking for me to type the "A1B2C3" challenge phrase every time i start up my computer. I have found no record of this issue and was wondering if someone had a fix as it is rather irritating to go through
 this sequence so often.

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Just to verify, can you tell us the build version of your Windows operating system? In the mean time, what we can suggest is to disable the log-in screen and re-enable it again. To do this, follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press <strong>Windows key</strong> + <strong>R</strong> to launch the <strong>
Run</strong> command.</li><li>Type <strong>netplwiz</strong> and press Enter.</li><li>On the User Accounts window, select your username and uncheck <strong>Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer</strong>.
</li><li>Click <strong>Apply</strong>.</li><li>Type your Password twice and click <strong>OK</strong>.</li><li>Restart your PC and redo the steps in reverse to enable the sign in with password again.</li><li>Restart your PC again and see if the challenge phrase would still occur.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know the outcome.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Explorer sort by date in filename, character recognition - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> markgoodliffe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Explorer sort by date in filename, character recognition priority and limits on length of filename and path</h2>
                    <p><span>Hi all</span></p>
<p><span>I have a work problem with 1000s of PDFs (letters, minutes of meetings, emails, photos, etc,) for a Construction Project.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>1. In Windows 10 Enterprise Explorer, I need to sort and therefore see and search each file named:</span></p>
<p><em><span>DD-Mon-Year any other text</span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The&nbsp;<em>any other other text</em>&nbsp;might be 3 or 4 distinguishing words, or letter reference, etc. &nbsp;How do I get Windows 10 to do this natively? &nbsp;Or if not possible, any good 3rd party add-ons available
 with a simple UI that integrates well with Windows 10? &nbsp;(I've reluctantly accepted having to rename them individually by the given date and reference, but this is how my work is done universally: everything is in date order so the records of our Construction
 Projects must be the same. &nbsp;I recall is was no problem in XP?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>2. Next, when I am running Windows searches or OCR in multiple PDFs in Acrobat DC, I am getting warnings that certain files are missed out because their filenames or paths are too long but there is no copy
 function to paste, refer back to and correct individually later. &nbsp;What are the length limits for filenames and paths in Windows 10?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>3. Finally in Windows 10, what are triggers or priority of character recognition for the various sorting functions?</span></p>
<p><span>I've scoured the web and this forum looking for a Microsoft Article and our IT Pro is doing the same, but nothing so far. &nbsp;This is key information for all business users, so Microsoft
 should please write a complete article on all these matters, if they haven't already done so.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Many thanks all. &nbsp;I'll revert back.</span></p>

<p>There is really no way to get Explorer to sort the files the way you want. When is sorts it doesn't do any kind of analysis of the names, it doesn't look for month names or anything else, it just sorts everything as text. So "17" comes before "25",.....
 As far as I recall, and I've been doing this for 30 years, it has always worked this way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want to use a naming convention so you can sort the way you want, you have to use a format like YYYY-MM-DD where MM is the month number and is always 2 digits and DD is the day, also always 2 digits.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other alternative is to use the creation dates of the files which is my personal preference, but you have to live with the fact that you can't change the date of a file.</p>

</p><p>The 2nd option is no good to me but I'll look at the revised naming format you suggest, or possibly opt a for a 3rd party add-on.</p>

<h3> tobiasz  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disabling LLMNR in Home Premium</h2>
                    I have been having trouble with one of my computer's internet connections on my home network.&nbsp; It seems to be overloaded with queries and disconnecting for a short time every 30-60 sec.&nbsp; When browsing the web I will have to constantly refresh so that I
 can actually view the web page.&nbsp; I've been watching the Resource Monitor and every time this happens the network is getting spikes of activity to 239.255.255.250.&nbsp;
<strong>This is only an issue if another computer is on the network.</strong> &nbsp; I had been reading that the LLMNR could be turned off using the Group Policy if I had Ultimate and there was a registry key change that could be made (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\WindowsNT\DNSClient\EnableMulticast
 = 0x0)&nbsp; but I didn't have a DNSClient Key.&nbsp; Should I add the key and if I do what type of value would the "EnableMulticast" have to be?<br />
<br />
I've been trying many, many, many things to alieviate the problem and have gotten to this, if their might be a different way I'd try that too.<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />

            I don't see why you could not add the key. Just be careful and make sure you
<strong>backup the registry</strong> beforehand in case you have problems.<br />

<br />
I would expect setting the key to a value of zero (<strong>0</strong> ) would disable it. If not then try one (<strong>1</strong> ). Its also possilbe you would need to reboot the PC after making the change.<br />

    <title>Norton support for Windows Live Mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> meirionydd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Norton support for Windows Live Mail</h2>
                    <p>If you know 'a bit' about Windows Live Mail perhaps you can tell me why Norton does not support it although it does support Outlook Express and Windows Mail. I was compelled to switch to Live Mail because the Windows Mail client does not support Hotmail.</p>
<p>I discovered this because, while struggling with the first problem, my machine was hacked and sent a whole batch of SPAM via my Hotmail account (which is managed via Live Mail).&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Norton did a remote in-depth virus scan which found nothing; then qualified it by saying they didn't include Live Mail.&nbsp;It sounds like a security gap to me. I still don't know but the fact that the SPAM all originated from the Hotmail account suggests it
 was Hotmail that was hacked.</p>

<p>When Norton say they don't support Windows Live Mail, that doesn't mean that their products won't protect you from malware, so there's no security gap. However, it probably means that they don't go out of their way to ensure that their products won't cause
 problems with WLMail, and there's plenty of evidence&nbsp;to support&nbsp;that. I wouldn't allow any Norton product near any of my machines, and I find that the free

<div>After that I decided to try to just go ahead and restore that backup to another drive, get the files I need from it, and then boot back from the main drive. I went ahead and added the drive to the system and booted from the Windows 8 DVD and tried to restore
 from the system image backup. I got that same sort of error which is:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The system image restore failed.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Error details: The requested operation could not be completed due to a virtual disk system limitation. On NTFS, virtual hard disk files must be uncompressed and unencrypted. On ReFS, virtual hard disk files must not have the integrity bit set. (0xC03A001A)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm having a hard time understanding this error. I don't see why it can't just clone that system image over to the hard drive. Or even just open it in Windows. I just need to get a few files out of the backup. I have been able to backup and restore from
 system image backups in the past in both Windows 8 and in Windows 7.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Let me know if you can help me out or if you have any suggestions. Thanks.&nbsp;</div>

<h2>            Doesn&#39;t windows respect privacy anymore&#63;</h2>
                    <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I know windows stopped caring about respecting users privacy ages ago, forcing more advanced users to use custom dlls blocking services and messing up with way deeper settings buried in lost dark places of windows.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;What I cant understand is that after all of that, with defer / paused updates my laptop still turns on at some nights and install updates, not even asking to me if i want to install the f** thing, it only does it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now Im stuck with a windows version who only let me pause updates for 30 days and don't let me row back to the build I was using before, this kinda of thing really makes me want to get rid of windows and get something else, the shackle that makes me stuck
 with this boulder are the games.</p>

<p>If you have the Professional edition of Windows 10, you can sign in to an Administrator account and choose which update branch to join and how long to defer feature updates (i.e., new versions of Windows 10) and quality updates (bug fixes and security updates.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>While you are deferring updates, they will not download to your computer. After the deferral period is over, an update can download at any time and install itself. This is done 'in the background' so as not to interfere with your work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Updates do often require a restart, however your computer won't restart during the Active Hours that you choose.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If Windows 10 notices that you're still using your computer when Active Hours have expired, and it wants to re-start your computer, you'll be prompted and you can tell Windows 10 to either go right ahead or you can delay the restart to a time when you won't
 be actively using the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This system has worked for me since the very beginning of Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the other hand, if you have the Home edition of Windows 10 you are unable to defer any updates.</p>

<h2>            Can&#39;t access Safe Mode - User Profile Issue</h2>
                    <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Fujitsu Lifebook A series laptop is giving me trouble.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try to log in with the one and only account on it I get the message </p>
<p>
</p><p><em>The User Profile Service service failed the logion.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>User profile cannot be loaded.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>A quick search tells me I should boot in safe mode by pressing F8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately this does nothing. The F8 key is a dual key. I have tried pressing it by itself during boot up and using the Fn key. Nether has any effect. I am able to get the laptop to run a diagnostics test on itself and enter the Bios and Boot menu through
 F2 and F12. Neither of these keys are Fn keys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts or ideas are appreciated.</p>
<p />

</p><p><a href="http://supportforfujitsu.iyogi.com/lifebook-p770/safemode-boot-2.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Click ‘F8’ repeatedly. If ‘F8’ doesn’t work then restart your laptop and keep pressing ‘F5’ till the screen doesn’t change. Then you will get
 a screen with different options.</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Usually these things are timing issues where the BIOS has an F8 option that intercepts your F8 tapping to present some options so you need to restart and try F8 again at a slightly later time.&nbsp; Or from the BIOS allow the boot to continue, then start tapping
 F8 again after the BIOS has loaded completely:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Just discovered the true solution - yes, you press f8 key BUT only AFTER the Fujitsu Siemens image has disappeared - pressing f8 while the image is displayed, or before it appears, gives you the option of booting from various sources.</em></p>

<p>-&gt; You can use your System Repair CD to boot the machine into Repair Mode. If you do not have one, ask a friend to burn one for you via the Control Panel / Backup and Restore. It takes less than five minutes.</p>

                    vorrei sapere il motovo che non sempre riesce ad entrare gente nella chat di gruppo o privata, invece le stesse persone con skipe con viber riusciamo a chattare sensa problemi. siccome paghiamo un abbonamento live questo problema nn ci deve assolutamente
 esserci. come ho gia detto con uso di pc o smartphone chattare non è un problema con altri programmi per di più gratis.pagare un prodotto che non funziona non è professionale.risolvete al più presto o mettete un programma di chat sul live che funzioni. ps
 ho 20 mega di connessione auindi non è un problema di rete ma dei vostri server. risp. al più presto grazie..

<p>Il tuo è un discorso condivisibile, ma dal mio punto di vista, solo in parte.</p>
<p>Il pc è stato e resterà (forse per sempre) la console per eccellenza. Grafica, fluidità, numero di giocatori, sono solo un esempio, ma allora cos'è che mi spinge verso il mondo console?</p>
<p>L'immediatezza, la non voglia si smanettare sui settaggi su ogni singolo gioco, il non dover aggiornare ogni quarto d'ora il pc...Accendo la console e gioco. Punto e basta.</p>
<p>In merito all'aprire le porte del router, esistono tante di quelle guide online che anche chi ha esperienza zero &nbsp;può farlo alquanto facilmente. Alcuni Provider (almeno con la fibra) addirittura hanno già preinstallato sui loro router varie casistiche di
 apertura porte, inclusa quella del Live per xbox.</p>

                    Go into Disk management as ADMIN<br />
Identify your device at the bottom. For me the block was black, saying it was unallocated.<br />
RIGHT CLICK THAT BLOCK, then New Simple Volume.<br />
Next.<br />
Next.<br />
Choose drive letter then Next.<br />
Format if you don't mind erasing data with a new Volume Label.<br />
(OPTIONAL) Uncheck QUICK FORMAT if you want to perform a long format.<br />
Next.<br />
Finish.<br />
It may hang for a while but then the black block will turn blue and voila!<br />
You may now use your USB.

    <title>Mute, Mics,Vibrate, Show Offline, and Party Questions... - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Mute, Mics,Vibrate, Show Offline, and Party Questions...</h2>
                    
<p>I'm a little stuck..&nbsp; I have a few questions that I can't seem to figure out..</p>

<p>1.&nbsp; Usually when I play alone, I create my own party and mute all so I don't have to hear a lot of annoying chatter.&nbsp; But, I can't figure out how to do that.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; ALSO, joining a party.. Unless there is a setting the current party I'm trying to join, I don't have the "join party" option I used to on 360.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Vibrate.&nbsp; For example, I'm playing BF4, and I can't find the option to turn off vibrate.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; Sometimes I don't want people to see me online... how do I "appear offline" like I used to be able to.??</p>
<p>5.&nbsp; How do I connect a wireless headset to my One??&nbsp; Nobody I've talked to said they've figured it out, and some say I can't do it at all.</p>

<p>Thank you for the help.. but, I can't seem to find these answers.</p>

<p>Hi there, here are a couple of things to try out:</p>
<p>1. A quick way to start a party is by opening the Party app. You can get there from the My games &amp; apps tile. Once you start a party from there, you'll see a couple of buttons for muting the others folks in the party.
</p>
<p>2. You can join parties in a couple of ways:</p>
<p>a) If you open the Friends app (the tall tile on Home) and scroll all of the way to the right, you can see the parties your friends are in right now. From there you can click through and join.
</p>
<p>b) if you know a certain person is in a party you can go straight to their profile and you should see a Join party button.</p>
<p>4. To appear offline, go to the Friends app, click the My profile button in the top left of the screen. On your profile you should see an "Appear offline" button. Just click that and you're all set.</p>
<p>Not sure about 3 or 5.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

</p><p><strong>Will upgrading from Windows 7 or later preserve my personal files, applications and settings?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, upgrading from Windows 7&nbsp;or a later version will preserve your personal files (documents, music, pictures, videos, downloads, favorites, emails, contacts etc, applications (ie. Microsoft Office, Adobe applications etc),&nbsp; games&nbsp;and settings (ie. passwords,
 custom dictionary, application settings). </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will my existing programs, hardware and drivers&nbsp;work on Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most applications and hardware&nbsp;drivers&nbsp;designed for Windows 7 or later should work with Windows 10. Of course, with significant changes expected in Windows 10, it is best you contact the software developer and hardware vendor&nbsp;to find out about support for
 Windows 10. Windows 10 setup will keep, upgrade, replace and might require that you install new drivers through Windows Update or from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also download the Windows 10 Reservation App and use it to check your system readiness.

<h2>            Windows 10 unable to shut down and open app store</h2>
                    <p>Hello there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been experiencing problems being unable to open the app store - upon clicking, the store pop up window remains white and does not load or respond.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The major issue i have here is i am unable to shut down my windows 10 properly.</p>
<p>It just keeps loading on the shut down page. After which, it shows "sleep mode" and "net framework" running in the background. Many times i chose the "force shut down" option but it still keeps loading on the shut down page. When i switch on the power button
 on my laptop again the next day, it's still at the shut down loading page!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please advice.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Problems with correctly installing drivers for Xbox One Wireless Controller Adapter for Windows 10</h2>
                    
<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>I'm getting at the end of my tether trying to install this Xbox One Wireless Controller adaptor on my Windows 10 PC.</p>
<p>Every time I try and plug it in to install the following occurs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plug and play detects the hardware </li><li>Watching through Device Manager, the device changes from XBOX ACC to Xbox Wireless Adapter for Windows
</li><li>The installation is marked as "complete" </li><li>A yellow warning triangle appears next to the device </li><li>LED power / sync light is not switched on, the adapter is completely unresponsive
</li><li>The following error message is given in the Device Manager: </li></ul>
<p>This device cannot start. (Code 10)</p>
<p>{Operation Failed}<br />
The requested operation was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>No combination of possible fixes I've tried works - every method of attempting to install another driver fails as Windows tells me the most up to date driver is installed. This is when attempting to update via the internet, or update via driver files I've
 downloaded from the Microsoft Software Catalog.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any advice on how to properly fix this, or will I have to bite the bullet and take the dongle back to the shop for a replacement? The only thing I haven't managed to do is to test on another PC to determine if the fault lies with the dongle
 itself or some obtuse incompatibility on my PC. Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>

            <p>I have the same problem... Win 10 x64</p><p>Bought the adapter just today... First didn't got recognized (only XBOX ACC was shown under device manager). after manually download the driver from the ms site (http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=xbox%20adapter - thx to http://mattpilz.com/fix-for-xbox-one-wireless-adapter-not-working-in-windows-10-xbox-acc-driver/), it was available under Network adapters (Xbox Wireless Adapter). After a system reboot, the device got the same message as BlackchiefPrime already said. (operation failed, the requested operation was unsuccessful). No light or any sound when plug in the adapter resp. press the sync button...</p>

<p>Hey guys,</p>
<p>I got a request to join this tracking site from a friend. It says on the website it's an official xbox site but a few of my friends think it may be phishing. Any input as to the legitimate status of this site?</p>
<p>Regards</p>

<p>Hi Skins,</p>
<p>My name is Kieran and I'm one of the creators of Playfire. We are most certainly NOT a phishing site. We're a social network for gamers where you can show off your games/achievements, follow what your friends are buying/playing/wishlisting and see what games
 everyone in the community is playing.</p>
<p>We're an official <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/Community/Developer/Home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Community Developer</a>, have been around for years, are funded by the founders of Skype, EA, Bebo and the former Chairman of Sony, and are partnered with both IGN and
<a href="http://fuse.gamespot.com/faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">GameSpot</a> to provide game tracking. Here's an
<a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2011/09/start/network-gamer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article where WIRED magazine</a> came to our offices in London to write about us.</p>
<p>Anthony, that Xbox America forum thread is complete bogus. Nothing in it is true. It was some guy who was making things up to sound official but none of it is actually correct. We're official partners of Xbox Live and know those guys in person.</p>
<p>If you have any questions at all you can email me (the cofounder/CEO of Playfire) directly on kieran at playfire dot com.</p>
<p>Hope this clears things up!</p>

<p>Its an legit site ( as you can see from my sig, i'm using one of their PSN gamercard), but as for the message i don't know. I have a profile but never got asked to enter in my WLID email or password. Just use a separate email and password to create your
 profile then in settings you enter your gamertag to track your achievements etc.</p>

<p>I'm a member. And nothing was taking from me. I think you are ask for it. So you can track you achievements. there other one outh there. I also member at trueachievement.com. And it diffrent kind of tracking site then playfire. It good to have a guide to
 get them. When playfire is just a tracking site. And no guide at all.</p>
