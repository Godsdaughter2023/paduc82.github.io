    <title>Windows Recovery Environment &#40;WinRE&#41; is Empty - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mike davy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Recovery Environment &#40;WinRE&#41; is Empty</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell Inspiron laptop with Windows 8 pre-installed by Dell. On this system the disk management screen shows four partitions
 in addition to the primary partition; they are the EFI System partition (500MB), an OEM partition (40MB), and two Recovery partitions (500MB and 11.98GB). All four partitions are shown as being completely empty. On reading the Knowledge Base article associated
 with the Microsoft update KB2769034, I note that an error in the Out of Box Experience (OOBE) wizard resulted in the WinRE not being enabled. Can anyone explain the purpose of these four partitions and advise on the action necessary to enable the WinRE capability
 and any other capabilities associated with these partitions that should be present.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for your assistance.</p>

            <p>Hi Vijay</p>
<p>Dell is primarily a hardware system supplier; their support web-site directs one back to Microsoft for Windows support. I understand
 that the enabling of the Windows Recovery Environment(s) is performed during the latter stages of the Windows initial setup process. The Microsoft update KB2769034 states that through an error in the OOBE wizard that this was not done. I am asking Microsoft
 for clear and detailed instructions on the actions I need to take to remedy the matter.<span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>Your help in this matter wou1d be greatly appreciated.</span></p>

<p>Sorry, but the free month is only available by creating a brand new account. Every console comes with a free month for up to 3 gamertags. It's only available during the account creation process by choosing yes to Join Live and then choosing Upgrade Later
 when it gives you the gold options. If the trial is available, it automatically gives it to you.</p>

<p>SMwutches has it on point. &nbsp;Free month of Xbox Gold Live supscriptions are for new accounts only. &nbsp;In addition, the console provides the Xbox Gold Live subscription and can recognize when a total of three (1) month trials have been given out and will cease
 to offer that promotion to any new profile beyond that point. &nbsp;This is important to know as if you purchase a console second hand that owner may have used up those accounts already on that one console.</p>
<p>As for promotions you find on the Xbox dashboard (now called the homepage) is sent out directly to that one specific account, you may not or will not see that same offer on another account downloaded to the same console as the promotion is sent out specifically
 for that specific account. &nbsp;These promotions can last as little as 24 hours up to how ever long the promotion is running. &nbsp;These offers are considerd, dashboard (homepage) promotions only and are must be accepted when presented and are not available via the
 website or phone support.</p>
<p>Passes that come included in your game, such as 48 hour gold trials are designed to be specifically for that game that they came with. &nbsp;Most often they will give you Gold Live whether or not you have used up your free trial before, or had a Gold Live subscription
 on your account in the past and are now a Free Live member. &nbsp;The trade off is it will only work for that specific game and you may find many other Gold Live subscription features&nbsp;locked or not accessable.</p>

<p>Hey there Katern! In order to qualify for this free membership trial, you must create the account on the console, decline the option to purchase a Gold subscription, and then accept the offer for the trial. If you have exited this setup process though, there
 is no way to get back to the option to accept the trial.<br />
<br />
The console can provide up to three of these trials, so if you are the fourth person to create an account, the trial may not be offered any more. Please let me know if this helps, thanks!</p>

<p>Hey devine radiation. Even though you are unable to get the free one month member ship the console is always offering deals for customers looking to go gold. If you have your privacy settings set to adult you can go to the games tab on the dash and the middle
 box that scrolls through advertisements usually has a great deal for people looking to upgrade. Right now I think the popular one is the $2 for 2 months.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Upgrade from a non-genuine Windows 7</h2>
                    
<p>While fixing my hard drive, my friend installed Windows 7 (I had XP previously) on my computer, thinking that his product key was good for 3 licenses. It evidently isn't, and I now have a message that I have a non genuine copy of Windows. To remedy this,
 can I buy the Windows 7 Professional Upgrade? I am eligible for the 29.99 student version, but I am concerned that it will not work because I currently have Windows 7 and not XP or Vista.</p>
<p>Also, I am concerned that I will need to get a new hard drive in the future. In this case, will I be able to reinstall the Upgrade Version?</p>

<p>You can't upgrade from a non-genuine copy of Windows. Your best option would be to reinstall XP, then you could buy the Windows 7 Professional Upgrade at the student price.</p>
<p>However, <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">if he installed Windows 7 Professional Upgrade</span> on your computer from XP you should be able to buy Windows 7 Professional Upgrade and simply enter your new key to activate instead of having to reinstall
 XP first.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">If he installed Windows 7 Home Premium or Ultimate</span> simply entering a Professional key will not work. You would need to buy Windows 7 Home Premium or Ultimate instead so the key will match what is installed.</p>
<p>Change Product Key:</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Hard Drive</strong></p>
<p>If you buy a new hard drive you'd need to either reinstall XP first then install Windows 7, or make an image of your Windows 7 install and put it on the new drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Image Windows 7 And Move To New Hard Drive <br />
<br />
Windows 7 has a built in imaging program, but I would not recommend it when moving to a different hard drive. Connect the new hard drive to the computer (as a slave if IDE, or connect it externally if you can through USB), then partition the new hard drive
 so it has two partitions (or more if you want) - the last partition being a little bigger then the amount of data on your current hard drive. If you have a large amount of data (music/video etc) moving it to an external storage separately will greatly reduce
 the image size. Also make sure that the partition you are moving Windows 7 to is the same size or bigger then the current partition it's on.<br />
<br />
Now make an image of your current hard drive with either of the programs below and save it to the last partition on your new drive. If you have the 100MB recovery partition make sure to include that. After the image is created restore the image to the new hard
 drive - you should restore Windows to the first partition (or second if you have the 100MB recovery partition). But if you have a unique setup then set it up the same as your current drive. You may have to delete/change the partitions you made to the new hard
 drive when restoring the Windows image. Please be aware that in the computer world imaging is not always going to work, but your original data should not be harmed. You may need to reactivate after moving to the new hard drive.<br />
<br />
If you are unable to have both hard drives connected at the same time you can chose to save the image to DVDs. Then replace the old drive and use the DVDs to restore Windows to the new hard drive.<br />
<br />
<br />
Both programs are completely free (and there are others available). Both enable you to make a boot disk to start the recovery, and both programs allow you to divide the backup to multiple DVDs:<br />

<p><br />
<br />
Now only have the new drive in the computer and turn it on and see if Windows boots, if it doesn't:</p>
<p>Try Repairing The Windows 7 Installation <br />
<br />
1. Insert the Windows 7 DVD and restart your computer <br />
2. Boot from the DVD. <br />
3. Choose your language and click Next. <br />
4. Click Repair Your Computer and then select the operating system you want to repair.<br />
5. Click on the Startup Repair link from list of recovery tools in System Recovery Options.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
If that doesn't fix it: <br />
<br />
1. Insert the Windows 7 DVD and restart your computer <br />
2. Boot from the DVD. If prompted, press any key to start Windows from the installation disc.<br />
3. Choose your language and click Next. <br />
4. Click Repair Your Computer and then select the operating system you want to repair.<br />
5. Select Command Prompt and type the following commands (pressing Enter after each one):&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
bootrec /fixMBR <br />
bootrec /fixBoot <br />
bootrec /rebuildBCD</p>

<p>Incorrect.</p>
<p>The OP didn't say which edition of Windows 7 was installed on the computer. If Windows 7 Home Premium or Ultimate is on the computer you can not enter a Professional key for activation - it will not work. The above will only work if the friend installed
 Windows 7 Professional.</p>

<p>TrekDozer, its obvious you obviously came back here for rivalry which I am not interested in.</p>
<div>
<p>While fixing my hard drive, my friend installed Windows 7 <strong>(I had XP previously)</strong> on my computer, thinking that his product key was good for 3 licenses.</p>
<p><strong>The OP had a qualifying license on the computer, although you need to have a qualifying license installed to authenticate the installation of Windows 7, the person still has a qualifying license for the computer, just that their friend haphazardly
 upgraded the computer to Windows 7 for whatever unknown reason. </strong></p>
<p>It evidently isn't, and I now have a message that I have a non genuine copy of Windows.<strong>To remedy this, can I buy the Windows 7 Professional Upgrade?
</strong></p>
<p><strong>And the answer is yes, they can purchase a Windows 7 Professional license, since that is what (based on interpretation) the friend installed on the computer. Even if that is not what friend installed, Windows XP Home, Professional could be used as
 a qualifying product because that is what the OP had. The only recommendation would be to reinstall Windows XP to follow the appropriate approach to upgrading within compliance.</strong></p>
<p>I am eligible for the 29.99 student version, but I am concerned that it will not work because I currently have Windows 7 and not<strong>XP</strong> or Vista.</p>
<p><strong>My point again proven.</strong></p>
<p>Also, I am concerned that I will need to get a new hard drive in the future. In this case, will I be able to reinstall the Upgrade Version?</p>
<p><strong>My suggestion would apply in this case too, since OP would simply be installing Windows 7 Upgrade on a computer with a previous license.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />

<h2>            install HP XP oem on virtual machine</h2>
                    <span>I have Windows Home Premium and I know it doesn't support XP mode.&nbsp; I want to install xp in dual boot mode with Win 7, using an oem recovery set,&nbsp; then make a vhd of the xp partition to use in virtualbox on the Win 7 partition.&nbsp;
                    <span>I have Windows Home Premium and I know it doesn't support XP mode.&nbsp; I want to install xp in dual boot mode with Win 7, using an oem recovery set,&nbsp; then make a vhd of the xp partition to use in virtualbox on the Win 7 partition.&nbsp;
 Will the virtual xp activate? I understand that the vm makes its own virtual bios and motherboard so I would think that it would appear as a different computer.&nbsp; I had previously installed my Win 7 system in a dual boot mode with XP, but deleted the XP installation
 because it kept deleting restore points in Win 7.&nbsp; Now I will install XP after Win 7 on drive D, ( I'm familar with the boot situation) but don't want the aggravation of having to log in and out of Win 7, thus the VM.&nbsp; Also, will XP in a VM run games well?&nbsp;
 I have read that XP mode is mostly only for business type apps.&nbsp; If it doesn't work well with games, I will probably stick with dual boot.

            <p>Hi Eric,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Which antivirus application are you using on your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you receive Windows Update error 80072efe while checking for updates, it might be caused by a connection interruption between your computer and the Windows Update servers. Close Windows Update, wait 10 to 15 minutes, and then run Windows Update again.
 You can also wait for Windows Update to run at its next scheduled time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you still receive one of these errors, you can run the Windows Update Troubleshooter that will automatically find and fix some common problems with Windows Update.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Refer to the “Windows Update Troubleshooter”, run the Windows Update Troubleshooter and check.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/troubleshoot-problems-installing-updates#1TC=windows-8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows/troubleshoot-problems-installing-updates#1TC=windows-8</a></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><strong>Mehod 2:</strong></span></p>
<p><span>I</span><span>f you are using third party security software, disable third party security software, install the Windows updates&nbsp;and check.</span></p>
<p><span>Disable third-party Security Software.</span></p>
<p><span><span>a. </span></span><span>You should see an icon for your Antivirus program in the Task-bar notification area. It is usually at the bottom right corner of your desktop.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b. </span></span><span>Click on the third-party Security Software Icon, you will see a pop up.</span></p>
<p><span><span>c. </span></span><span>In that pop and select the option to disable, click on it.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d. </span></span><span>Now the third-party Security Software will be disabled.</span><span>Important
</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Note:</strong></span><span> Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you shouldn't disable your antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope this information helps you. Please do let us know if you need further assistance, we’ll be glad to assist you.</span></p>

                    I have an empty folder located in C:\Users\&lt;ME&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\StartMenu\Programs that I cannot delete.&nbsp; If I have tried to delete it from Windows Explorer and also from the command line.&nbsp; No luck.&nbsp; If I try to delete it I get the following
 error message...<br />
<br />
"This is no longer located in C:\Users\&lt;ME&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\StartMenu\Programs.&nbsp; Verify the items location and try again."<br />
<br />
The folder is there.&nbsp; I can see it.&nbsp; It even shows un in the Windows start menu and I can even rename it....but I can't seem to delete it.&nbsp; Any ideas on how I can get this deleted?&nbsp; Of coure the folder being there isn't causing a problem.&nbsp; But now that I know
 it's there and I can't delete it...it's bugging me.

<h2>            Using the new start menu&#47;screen as the desktop&#63;</h2>
                    Hi there,&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Setting up the new Windows 8 for my parents. They really like the start menu screen that displays the apps. Is there any way to treat this screen/menu as you would typically use the desktop whereas you have the capability to save files and whatnot to it?
 I'd like to set this up so the start screen is a one-stop shop for them. As it is now, when they use the internet it automatically takes them to the traditional desktop page, even though the app shows up on the start screen and I'm afraid they will be very
 confused with all of the "places" on the computer they have to go in order to select apps, use the internet and their personal files/folders.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thanks!</div>
                </div>

            <p>The best you can do regarding files is pin folders to the Start Screen, unfortunately you can't pin specific files to the Start Screen in Windows 8 at this time. Hopefully in Windows 8.1 they will improve on file discoverability in the Modern UI (Start Screen
 UI). By default Internet Explorer opens in Modern UI mode but at the moment it is a little disjointed and I know MS is working on it to improve the situation in 8.1.</p>

<h2>            &#39;Share with&#39; has &#39;Advanced sharing...&#39; on Win 7. Where are the standard Homegroup choices&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I am running Windows 7 Professional.&nbsp; Ihave defined my user ID to be a member of a Homegroup.&nbsp; However, if I drop down 'Share with' in the explorer, or right click and choose 'Share...', I get 'Advanced sharing...', instead of the standard Homegroup choices.&nbsp;
 Why?&nbsp; How can I get the standard set back?</p>
<p>There's more trouble, too.&nbsp; I have another PC (let's call this one Blue) on this same Homegroup.&nbsp; It has the standard Homegroup choices for sharing (Homegroup- Read, Homegroup - Read/Write, etc).&nbsp; I have set up my user 'Documents' folders on both PCs to
 be shared as read/write.&nbsp; On the one with Advanced sharing (let's call this one Red), I've added my user ID and given it full control permissions to my Documents folder.&nbsp; On Blue, I've given Homegroup read/write access to my Documents folder.</p>
<p>The result is that from Red, I can see the Documents folder for me (an individual user) and can read and write to that folder.&nbsp; From Blue, I can see every directory under my User name except for Documents.&nbsp; I have NOT shared the rest of the folders under
 my user with anyone, so I don't understand why they are visible from Blue.&nbsp; And, in particular, I don't understand why my Documents folder on Red is not visible on Blue.</p>

<p>Ah ha!&nbsp; I finally figured it out.&nbsp; In the Explorer, under Tools/Folder Options, the Tools Tab, scroll down to 'Use Sharing Wizard (Recommended) and check it.&nbsp; If it is unchecked you get the Advanced sharing..., if checked, you get the standard Homegroup
 choices Nobody, Homegroup (Read), Homegroup (Read/Write), or Specific People.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help.&nbsp; I knew it had to be some transferred setting because I remember forcing the Advanced sharing choice when I was on Vista.&nbsp; On Vista, the sharing wizard just wasn't powerful enough.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>

<p>Do we have any updates on this? One of the fabulous chat technicians told me to do a clean boot, but&nbsp;I have no Win 7 CD, and the instructions don't look correct to me. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Win 10 not great for older PCs. Hope to have an
 answer BEFORE the 30 day period.</p>

</p><p>BTW: the file is located in C:\Windows.old .... If I can find it why can't Win 10?</p>

            Use a Live CD with a Partition Management program on it. Set computer BIOS to boot from Live CD. Use Partition Management program to delete Windows 10 partition on main drive. Make a new partition on main drive. Use your old windows installation disk to
 boot to and reinstall windows 7. I tried using my old windows 8.1 installation disk with Windows 10 on my main drive and received the error message that it was the wrong OS. So, my 8.1 installation disk wouldn't boot up UNTIL i deleted windows 10 from my main

<p>That would be wonderful if I had a Win 7 disk. My PC didn't come with one, and a back up file is on my locked external drive I can't open.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I do a reset to factory default, something I read up on, it sounds like it will take me back to Win 10 and wipe my data, if I choose that option. I just want to go back to Win 7 which was working good for me.</p>

            <p>Doing a Windows 10 Reset is basically reinstalling Windows 10. All your apps would need to be reinstalled again. If you have the Windows 7 Windows Key, you can borrow or you can download Windows 7 as an ISO file which you can burn onto a DVD. Reinstall Windows
 7 using your Windows Key that came with your computer. &nbsp;If you do decide to download Windows 7, make very sure that it is the same exact version of the one on your computer before, otherwise your computer windows key won't work.</p>

            <p>I am working through a similar frustration.</p>
<p>I found selection to revert to Windows 7</p>
<p>Following instructions, I deleted all users except me.</p>
<p>Message indicated I had to remove my own account.</p>
<p>Going back and forth through the Microsoft maze, I got approval that my account would be removed in December</p>
<p>Went back to settings and got reminder that I have 30 days to revert to 7. It's October and the account won't be removed until December. Is Microsoft hoping I can't count to 30????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Finally, I had to reestablish my account to post here</p>
<p>

<h2>            It&#39;s been 4 months, still have &#34;Go back to Windows 7&#34;. Can&#39;t get update 1511.</h2>
                    <p>I upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 7 at the beginning of August. I don't recall if I removed the previous OS (Win 7) through Disk Cleanup or it removed naturally after 30 days. But in any case none of the previous OS directories are left over, no hidden
 folders either. But I still have the option to "Go back to Windows 7". When I click it it errors out and says the files aren't there anymore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want to go back to Windows 7, but I do want November update 1511. I've read you won't get it if you have upgraded to Windows 10 in the last month so as to not destroy your OS restore option. But it's been 4 months.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So something's stuck in the registry thinking I still have an old OS to go back to. Anyone know a registry key I could modify to make that restore option go away?</p>

And I set the DWORD <strong>UninstallActive</strong> to <strong>0</strong>. "Go back to Windows 7" is now removed from Recovery.<br />

<h2>            Error 0xc0000098 Your PC&#47;Device needs to be repaired. HELP&#33;</h2>
                    <p>i am a PC enthusiast and i have built many PC's from scratch. so recently i built a new pc had everything but a hard drive so instead of waiting for it in the mail i took the old hard drive in my old PC (the only hard drive on it) formatted it (the long
 way of formatting so that it read zeros across the board) and put it in my new PC, installed windows with a USB flash drive, no problems. but when the new hard drive came in the mail which was identical to the one i had before (western digital blue 1 TB) i
 put it in the old PC and with the same USB i used to install windows on my new computer i tried to install it again on the old PC and i got this message when trying to boot in order to install windows again.</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>&nbsp;The application or operating system couldn't be loaded because a required file is missing or contains errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>File: \windows\system32\boot\winload.exe</p>
<p>Error code: 0xc0000098</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>so i reset the bios to optimized defaults, didn't work, reformatted the USB that i was using to install windows, didn't work. i cant figure out what i need to do in order to repair the PC so that i can install windows on this new hard drive for my old PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PC specs of the PC that i cannot get to work:</p>
<p>Bios: gigabyte AB350 gaming 3 (bios version is F10)</p>
<p>CPU: ryzen 3 1200</p>
<p>Hard drive: Western digital blue 1 terabyte</p>
<p>the USB i am using to install windows is 8 GB, it is formatted in FAT32</p>
<p>the rest of the specs shouldnt matter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>if you know the answer or any suggestion please help im unsure about what to do at this point</p>

            Hi Ethan.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Here are latest Steps to Troubleshoot Install:
<br />
<br />Follow the illustrated Clean Install steps in this tutorial which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />Make sure all other drives and peripherals are unplugged.  Update the BIOS or UEFI firmware to latest, or reset to Defaults, making sure SATA controller is set to AHCI. 
<br />
<br />To create Windows 10 Installation Media install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  If you're using another PC to do this then uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first.  If you can start Windows enter UEFI firmware here:  <a href="http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-methods-to-access-uefi-bios-setup.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.isunshare.com/windows-password/four-...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on first screen press Shift + F10 to open a Command Prompt, type the following commands followed by Enter key:
<br />DISKPART
<br />LIST DISK
<br />SEL DIS # (replace # with the disk # of the Windows disk from list in previous command)
<br />CLEAN
<br />EXIT
<br />
<br />Close Command Box, on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen choose Unallocated Space, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br /> 
<br />
<br />Another thing to try is save a system image backup from the other install externally and then use the rescue disk Macrium will make you to apply it to the target PC:  
<br /><a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-reflect-is-a-free-and-easy-to-use-backup-utility/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/howto/7363/macrium-re...</a>
<br />
<br />Try another USB stick.  Test the USB in another PC to see if it will boot and proceed further.  
<br />
<br />Test the new hard drive with diagnostics:   <a href="https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testing-programs-2626183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.lifewire.com/free-hard-drive-testin...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Windows 10 reset. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> philippagliughi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 reset.</h2>
                    <p>Ok, I've been skimming the forums and nothing has been answering my question. Therefore, i'm here asking my question now. Let's say one day I boot into Windows 10 and something happens, causing me to reset. Let's say that happened after the 1 year deadline.
 Will it bring me back to Windows 8, or will it bring me to Windows 10? </p>
<p>P.S. my system came with a recovery partition and was shipped with 8.1.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Once you have installed these important updates and followed the prerequisite instructions, you should be ready to receive your
<strong>free</strong> update to Windows 10 this summer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will users who take advantage of the upgrade offer for Windows 10 from Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 also be able to obtain recovery media?</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft recently noted the following options available:</p>

            <p>I rec'd the same e-mail and went to the MS site to download the patch/update. Wrong thing to do. After installing&nbsp; the update for Windows Live Essentials Mail 2012 (KB3093594) that the the site directed me to, my Windows Live Mail would&nbsp; open but immediately
 launched a dialogue box telling me there was (now) a problem with the program and that the program would now close. Ended up rolling back my PC to a prior state.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Pardon me but the built-in e-mail app in Windows 10 is really poor (REALLY POOR); it doesn't even have some of the features that were available in Windows 8.1. Truly a step backwards and it appears that despite thousands of complaints about it MS hasn't
 lifted a finger to make the app for Win 10 at least as usable as it was in Windows 8.1.</p>

            <p>Pavan,</p>
<p>Made a slight modification to your procedure as given above, and it worked for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, in your step 5, my system only showed me the standard English keyboard I wanted to keep. &nbsp;There was no sign of the Dvorak keyboard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only after clicking on the standard English keyboard was I presented with the two keyboards I had installed; the standard English and the Dvorak keyboards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Clicking on the Dvorak keyboard, I was presented with the choice to delete it, which I did.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your help in getting me into the right neighborhood, but it took the extra step of clicking on the standard English keyboard before I had access to the Dvorak keyboard.</p>

<p><span><span>Hi&nbsp;
</span></span><span>Robert,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for your response!</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Boot the computer in safe mode:</strong></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><span>To use a Safe Boot option, follow these steps:
</span></p>
<p><span>a. Restart your computer and start pressing the F8 key on your keyboard. On a computer that is configured
 for booting to multiple operating systems, you can press the F8 key when the Boot Menu appears.
</span></p>
<p><span>b. Select an option when the
<strong>Windows Advanced Options</strong> menu appears, and then press ENTER. </span>
</p>
<p><span>c. When the
<strong>Boot</strong> menu appears again, and the words "Safe Mode" appear at the bottom, select the installation that you want to start, and then press ENTER.</span></p>
<p><span>Check how many user accounts are available.</span></p>
