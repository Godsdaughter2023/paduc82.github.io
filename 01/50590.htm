            <p>Hi Dale,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community, I will certainly help you with this question. I would like to ask you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Are you using a wired connection or wireless connection?</li><li>Do you have any other device connected to the same network?</li></ul>
<p>If you are using Wi-Fi,&nbsp;<span>set up Wi-Fi wireless password, refer the steps.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span>Open up a web browser and type in your routers address and then click enter.</span></li><li><span>Once you hit enter you should get a connection box that will request a user name and password from you. Use the default as stated above unless you have changed this in the past.</span></li><li><span>Once you get in the setup click on the WIRELESS TAB and then click on WIRELESS SECURITY. Choose a passphrase anything will do. Then click GENERATE, and will you have your keys. Make sure you save your settings. Save them in safe place.</span></li><li><span>Now to check if your password keys work. Fire up your laptop and right click on the wireless icon, located on the bottom right hand corner of your task bar. Then Click VIEW AVAILABLE WIRELESS NETWORKS.</span></li><li><span>I</span><span>f you did it right you should see your network show up with a lock stating that it is a SECURITY ENABLED
</span><span>WIRELESS NETWORK</span><span>.</span></li><li><span>If you click on the network a WIRELESS CONNECTION PROMPT will appear.<br />
This is where you type in the keys you've generated. Confirm your key and that's it you'll be connected each and every time no retyping the key in over and over again.</span></li></ol>

    <title>Windows Spotlight not working. Is switching back to picture - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> florin adenis  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows Spotlight not working. Is switching back to picture</h2>
                    <p>This problem started a year ago and whenever I try to switch the lockscreen setting to Windows Spotlight it switches back to picture when I click other tabs. The Windows Spotlight setting just doesn't want to stay on.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I must say that I disabled a lot of settings from windows 10 so I don't lag while I play games. I followed a Windows Optimization guide on YouTube (latest by TechYesCity) but I always followed those optimization guides and I had no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also I did do a clean reinstall of Windows 2 times actually and still nothing. I'm running latest Windows 10 version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Specs: Intel Celeron CPU 1007U 1.50GHz (2 CPUs)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 4gb ram</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Windows 10 PRO 64-bit</p>

            Hi Florin.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist, 9 year Windows MVP and Independent Advisor, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Some observations:
<br />
<br />A Celeron isn't really a gaming CPU, so you may be trying to squeeze something out of your PC it can't give.
<br />
<br />Turning off a bunch of services from some guy's Youtube is a recipe for ruin for WIndows.  What's needed is a good solid install using only the tools and methods which work best.  Look over this gold standard Install which compiles the best possible Clean Install of Windows which will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given, has zero reported problems, and is better than any amount of money could buy:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Until then you can go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />Once you have the install sorted out then if Spotlight still doesn't shine follow this fix which often works:
<br /><a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/windows-spotlight-not-working" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/windows-spotlight...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>
</p><p><span>Greetings from Skype!</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Yes, recorded videos are only saved on Skype for 30 days. Recorded videos can be downloaded and will be saved on your device storage. But since you mentioned that it had been corrupted, there's no option to recover it. I know that this is
 not the answer you are looking for, however, I hope that this somehow answer your query.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I would also like to take this time to thank you for notifying us about this particular limitation you have experienced firsthand. The new Skype
 version is still a work in a progress but we are continuously studying through everyone's feedback and input about this new version. Definitely, we acknowledge that there are quite a few features and functionalities we have to constantly work on and fix in
 the upcoming updates. In addition, I would appreciate if you can formally submit/vote this feedback to our website where we get all your inputs and about our software design and limitation. Here is the link:<span>&nbsp;

</p><p>I think it should be not limit for 30 days, It should be clean up on month end (30/31st) day Or Give UI to user that he/she can decide that when it should be clean up. There should be notification before delete it. So we can save it or backup it. Hopefully
 It would be better to notify first to delete some important files. Thank you very much for your prompt response.</p>

            <p>Whoa, calm down there !</p>
<p>You need to set everything up correctly first and in this order&nbsp;:</p>
<p>1) run a stereo cable from the line-out of your tape deck or vinyl player to the line-in of your PC/Laptop</p>
<p>2)&nbsp;in the XP mixer make sure line-in is chosen as the default recording device</p>
<p>3)&nbsp;in EZ Vinyl/Tape converter, make sure that line-in is chosen as the default recording device (if it has such an option)</p>
<p>4) plug in your USB HDD. If EZ whatnot asks you where you want to place the file, point it to the USB HHD.</p>
<p>5)&nbsp;start the tape deck/vinyl player and click on record in the software.</p>
<p>You should now have a signal. I don't have this software so I can only give you common sense help. However, if you have it set up as above it should work.</p>
<p>Personally I'd use Audacity as it is simple to use, freeware and&nbsp;has filters that can get rid of tape hiss, turntable rumble, clicks etc It is set up as the above, also. Once you have the file recorded, you&nbsp;then"Export "&nbsp;it to what ever HHD you want.</p>
<p>Re-post if you need more help, setting out the exact steps you go through to not get a signal.</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>

            Hmm, is there any limitation on the time you can record a track in the software you use ? Check in the options part of it. But it shouln't reboot.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Community, we understand your concern and we will try our best to help you resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest that you try the methods that are mentioned below to narrow down the cause of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>Place your computer in Safe Mode and check if the same issue persist when you restart the computer when placed in Safe Mode.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Open Run Command (Windows button +R)</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>A dialog box will open type “msconfig”</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span>Locate and select the Boot tab and select Safe with Minimal as option.</span></p>
</li><li><span>Restart Computer</span></li></ol>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Follow the same procedure to undo Safe Mode, uncheck the Safe option and restart your system.</span></p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
</p>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">
<span><strong>Method 2:</strong> If the issue still persist in Safe Mode, I would suggest that you run
</span><span>Startup Repair and check if the issue reoccurs.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Go to the “Lock Screen” and press and hold the shift key and click on the power icon located on the bottom right corner of the screen.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">You will have to restart your computer, you will be prompted to click on “Restart Anyway”.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Then you select “Troubleshoot” and click on “Advance Option” and locate and select “Startup Repair”.</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information helps.</p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you for the update.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If the issue does not persists in Safe mode, then you may try the same in Clean boot and check the status of the issue.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows
 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Disclaimer: </strong>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps from section “How to reset the computer to start as usual after clean boot troubleshooting” to reset the computer to start as usual.

<p>
</p><p>The problem of the disappearing user settings was happening to my Domain user, not the local PC user. For some reason, the domain user was being treated as a guest after the update to Windows 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Our network admin set up a new user for me, and that was basically all that had to be done. I had to reconnect a few things, and what was lost remained lost, but going forward, this issue was solved.</p>

                    The windows 10 update assistant automatically showed notification for the latest update. But once the 'Update Now' option was clicked, it seemed that it will take days together to just download 100% of it. As observed, it took 4 hours to complete 20% of
 the download. The downloading process is damn slow. Though my network connection is not very strong, but it&nbsp;is not so slow, as other downloads are&nbsp;fast enough. If I let it go on, it will definitely empty all my internet data&nbsp;recharge.&nbsp;So where does the problem
 lie? Why is it so slow? How can I download it at a faster pace?

<p>Nick, thanks for replying.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I still don't understand.&nbsp; The PC says something like this "UPDATE IN PROGRESS 71% - DO NOT SHUT OFF COMPUTER"&nbsp; What am I suppose to do?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I finally got help from Dell.&nbsp; I turned off the PC and restarted and hit the F12 key.&nbsp; That allowed me to reset the PC and keep all my files.&nbsp; It reloaded Windows 10 and completed that way.&nbsp; I had to reload MS Office and few other programs, like Google Chrome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for trying to help me.</p>
<p>

<h2>            bad image dll error messages</h2>
                    
<p>Shortly after getting my netbook I started getting dll bad image messages. I think there was a windows update or a verizon mobile update before I started getting the message.</p>
<p>Every time I startup there is over 10 of these messages and they all say the image is not a windows image and to check against my installation disk.</p>
<p>There is no installation disk I dont even have a cd drive on the netbook.</p>

"Apoint.exe Bad Image<br />

My operating system is Windows Vista Home Premium<br />

            Most times the GOEC62~1.DLL is related to the Google Desktop software. Uninstall it to see if that stops the error message. If it does, then download another copy, ensuring it's the correct version for your 32 bit OS.

<h2>            Bios Update, Uninstalling Apps&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My HP Pavilion laptop is preparing for the new update, however it is asking me to uninstall some apps that are not compatible.</p>
<p>The thing is, there is nothing on the list that I can tell is an app to remove. The only bullet point is "HP Pavilion notebook - BIOS needs to be upgraded before you can upgrade to Windows 10".</p>
<p>I already have Windows 10 on this, so I'm guessing it means the bigger update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Would anyone have some insight as to what it's asking me to uninstall here?</p>
<p>

<p>You can only have one anti-virus software. This does not mean you cannot have an anti-virus software and Malwarebytes or Spybot. SpyBot and Malwarebytes are malware scanners and are not anti-virus. When installing an anti-virus some are not recognized by
 Windows Security Center and therefore the red shield appears in the system tray. Many times when this occurs the user disables the notifier and chooses to monitor the anti-virus themselves. Additionally, as noted on the link above, some anti-virus software
 automatically change the setting. Personally, you could not give me Symantec or Spybot. Malwarebytes is good along with Avast 5.0 free version.If you uninstall your current anti-virus software make sure you use the respective uninstall tool.</p>

                    I have moved or deleted files from Windows Explorer (under My Pictures). These have been moved into a folder under Pictures. They are still showing in the directory list. Yet when I try to move them or delete them again WE tells me they are not there.
 I have tried to close and reopen the window, refresh the screen and even restarted the computer.

            <p>It sounds like you could have a virus or other malware. Get your antivirus program up to date and boot into
<u>Safe Mode</u>. Note that some viruses can hide themselves from your antivirus program in normal mode, so you really need to scan in
<u>Safe Mode</u>. To get into Safe Mode when you first power up, hit F8 about once a second until you get the menu and select Safe Mode. Then run a full system scan.</p>
<p>Microsoft has suggestions and offerings at </p>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/how-do-I-remove-a-computer-virus</p>
<p>Forum moderator Keith has some suggestions along this line at </p>
<p>http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/windows-explorer-has-stopped-working/6ab02526-5071-4dcc-895f-d90202bad8b3</p>
<p>If that fixes it, fine. If not, use System Restore to go back to a date prior to the beginning of the problem. To run System Restore, click Start -&gt; Programs -&gt; Accessories -&gt; System Tools -&gt; System Restore. Click the box that says
<i>Show more restore points</i>. </p>
<p>You can check for corrupted system files. Open an administrator command prompt and run SFC if the above doesn't help. Click START, then type
<u>sfc </u>in the search box, right-click SFC.EXE and click <i>Run as administrator</i>. Then from the command prompt type
<u>sfc /scannow</u><i>.</i></p>
<p>Finally if all else fails, you can check the rather cryptic system event log. To do so click Start -&gt; Control Panel -&gt; Administrative Tools -&gt; Event Viewer. Once in Event Viewer click on the system log and scroll through the entries looking for those flagged
 "error" to see if you can find hints as to where the problem could be.</p>
<p>I hope this helps. Good luck.</p>

<p>Had a look again and am utterly confused as in the top left hand line (CALL) the term</p>
<p>video calls is "greyed out".</p>
<p>To me it means that video calls are no longer&nbsp; a free part of SKYPE. I have version7.40.01.40</p>
<p>and don't see the prompt anywhere. Only actual telephone calls against a credit to be established</p>
<p>You help is appreciated.</p>

    <title>Surface Pro 3 type cover spacebar does not work reliably when typing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> primeih  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro 3 type cover spacebar does not work reliably when typing &#40;DIY HW-fix&#41;</h2>
                    <p><strong><span><span>Problem Description</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>The spacebar key on my Surface 3 Pro type cover keyboard initially did not work as expected. Key presses were often not registered, even though the button felt like it was being pressed correctly. The problem was especially noticeable when pressing
 on the far right side of the spacebar. The problem is that sometimes the (single) HW-switch, centered under the space bar, is not depressed far enough.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Instead of wasting time trying to get a replacement keyboard, I decided to try to fix the problem myself.
</span></span><span><span>Here is the procedure which solved the problem for me. Use&nbsp;it&nbsp;at your own risk.</span></span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Step 1: Remove the space bar from the keyboard. </span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Under the key a number of plastic clips attach to two metal rods. Carefully lift a corner of the key with a small knife or similar, and carefully pry loose the clips one by one. The image below shows the parts and mechanisms:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/37ba3d1e-f41e-4e94-b12e-ee7ab9fca627" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Step 2: Add a few layers of tape to the center area of the loosened space bar.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>The idea is to make sure the switch under the space bar will be depressed a few fractions of a millimeter more on every key press. Five layers of tape did it for me:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/c35e12c9-6bf3-4e79-908f-7808a3a43391" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Step 3: Reattach the space bar to the keyboard.</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Align the plastic clips with the metal rods, and gently press the key down until it snaps into place.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I hope this brief DIY can be of value to others experiencing the same problem.</span></span></p>

                    My personal user account as"Avinash" got corrupted. (When I click Avinash the screen would go dark and next nothing could be done). So a friend helped me to switch temporarily to Administrator Account. &nbsp;I am facing several permission issues using this
 account e.g. my downloaded files cannot be opened or PDF file download fails etc. How do you create a new user account and migrate all my downloaded files to that account?

<h2>            Can&#39;t purchase&#47;dopwnload free xbox 360 games with gold game</h2>
                    <p>I just recently purchased xbox live gold subscription this November using my CC and it works just fine. Actually I have an existing account that also have an xbox live gold subscription but because I can't download/complete the purchase of the free xbox
 360 games that comes with the gold every month I've decided to create another account. I have a US account before with an Asian unit, it doesn't have any problem with the free xbox one games but if the free xbox 360 games is not region free I can't download
 it so I switched my account to Asian. But still I can't download the free xbox 360 games that comes with it every month. So thats why I created a new account with an Asian Region and purchased an xbox live gold Asian. But the problem is still I can't download
 the FREE xbox 360 game. I already put a credit card details (which works perfectly fine during my purchase of the xbox live gold subscription) and also put up my paypal account. Still it doesn't allow me to download/purchase the game. The error says. "Sorry,
 you cannot complete the purchase right now. Please try again later." but its already been a week for this account. (almost 6 months for my primary account which already cost me 12 free games). I've tried to ask for a refund already but they said its not possible
 cause of the sales and subscription agreement something.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope that this can be fixed. Or just FIX your ad, "Xbox live Gold Free Xbox One Only Games". Thanks...</p>

            Sorry to hear you're having trouble.&nbsp; However, although Xbox One games are region free Xbox 360 games are not.&nbsp; You should make sure your console and gamertag are set to the country that you physically live in so you can purchase and download 360 titles
 that are available to you.

            All the drivers are updated, it only happens when I use some programs that are not Microsoft? it has to be in windows because I had someone duplicate the same thing on their computer.I can&nbsp;use word or Quick books and print but if I use Turbo tax or a software
 I use for work it won't print but if I use my work software or turbo first they will print but my other programs like word or quick books will not print? Strange<br />

<h2>            external hard drive not allowing access to video files</h2>
                    <p>I was given an external hard drive with a bunch of movies downloaded onto it for christmas. The problem is when i plug it into my laptop it shows up fine but there is only the WPSystem folder which has the about 15 Kbytes worth of Data Base Files which I
 assume are the "operating files" which make it possible just to interact with the hard drive. Before selecting the drive it shows that it has about 800 Gigabytes worth of data on it and when i go to my comuter&gt;manage&gt;disk management the drive shows up as working
 fine with all the data on it. Ive tried changing the permissions as well as simply changing the drive letter and yet still when i open the drive it only shows the only folder with 0 video files in it. Please I feel like I've tried everything if someone could
 help me that would be absolutely fantastic and know that you would have made my day!!!! I've been messing with this for far too long my brain is fried. Please help me as soon as possible</p>

</p><p>Can you provide us a screenshot of the exact error message you get when signing in to the Skype application? Can you check if another Skype account can login to the Skype application?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please try to also sign in to the Skype website with your account (<em>Make sure to use the credentials you used to
</em><strong>initially </strong><em>create the account.). </em>Try changing the connection you are using as well and let us know what happens after.</p>

<p>Danida_U,</p>
<p>The desktop app does not give me the opportunity to sign in with different account information. It acts as if there is a default account, but I can't see what that account information is. As soon as it is launched, I get a sign-in screen, but there are no
 like a new account, but was what I believe to be my old Microsoft account. Also, the "problems signing in" page does not seem to address my issue (trouble signing in with desktop app) even though the app sign-in window gives that option. Please see attached
 screenshots. Thank you. <a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f2eee57-c66f-4d4d-a99f-ebf294b2d2dc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>The situation you described above might indicate that you are logging in to a different account when you try to sign into the Skype website. Please make sure that you sign in using the credentials you used to initially create your account. You can use

<p>Thank you for the link. I was able to combine two Skype accounts into my newly created Skype/MS account. The credit balance now shows up in the combined account. However, deleting and reinstalling the desktop app does not resolve the sign-in issue (as you
 directed), and I get the same error message as in the previous post. This happens after I am logged into my web Skype account, and when (1) I attempt to launch the desktop app, or (2) I attempt to initiate a call from the web account, which brings up a window
 to link to an app (Skype), which tries to launch the desktop app, and I get the same error message when trying to sign in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In short, I am unable to make a call from either the desktop app or from the web account. My credit will expire in two days. I am not pleased.</p>

            I also tried to use the Skype web application, in an attempt to retain my credit, but was unable to complete calls or successfully send any messages. I used Safari with the new Skype plugin. FWIW, I do not have the MS browser or Google Chrome installed
 on my system, and have no intention to do so.<br />

<h2>            Installing FSX Delux on new pc - Activated to many times&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Trying to install my FSX Delux on a new pc, but on activation it states 'Activated to many times'</p>
<p>
</p><p>It then gives me a phone numbers, and a very long key, but this did not work and i was put though to someone..
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had to convey this long key to a gentleman on the phone, unfortunately i could not even get him to understand my name (Lee) when he asked for it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>He seemed to be in a different country,&nbsp; and while we both try very hard to understand each other (on a crappy line, with a 3 seconded lag, and my voice and hearing are not the best) it just became to hard.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to find an email (my preferred way of communicating), but its seems they dont have one for my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What are my options? or am i now stuck with not being able to activate my game?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Best regards</p>
<p>Lee.</p>

<p>
 &nbsp;Obviously, the normal course of action would be a phone call, but I believe the call goes to a computer which requests your Product Key. &nbsp;It then reissues a new Key which you use to complete the activation. &nbsp; If however, you are now being directed to a person,
 then I'm not sure how that would work.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
 it as Administrator. &nbsp;I read that this option might help. &nbsp;To do that, go to your FSX directory and find fsx.exe file. Right click on it and go into Properties and then to Compatibility. &nbsp; Towards the bottom, you'll see a box: Run as Administrator - say OK,
 close and try launching FSX again.</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
 try launching FSX again. &nbsp; This too is only a remote possibility. &nbsp; My next suggestion is to give up altogether with FSX and purchase another Sim. &nbsp; The closest one to FSX is called FSX-Steam Edition (by Dovetail Games) and this one doesn't need a product
 key, is downloadable to your media, and is now a 64 bit Sim.</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your reply.</p>
<p>I did the run as administrator for the install, and also the registry fix (change partmgr to PartMgr) to fix the activation issue with the Acceleration key. this all worked.. but its the actual activation now fails with Activated to many times error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did the computer call, and had to enter a long key (about 8 by 5 groups of numbers ie: 56412-78765-78897- etc.) from the screen..</p>
<p>thats when it came back with a message that its been Activated to many times, and to call a number.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But unfortunately English was not their first language, it was also a very bad line, and my voice is hard for anyone to understand at the best of times.&nbsp; after about 10 mins, he put me though to another support section, but we had the same issues. it was
 very frustrating for both of us.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I thought the uninstall from the old pc should of deactivated the key! so i could move and reactivate on a new pc?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess i will have to wait 3 months, and see if that works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>The following is MS' blurb on activation and re-activation of some their products, of which FSX is one. &nbsp; You may have seen this and it may not be of much help to you at this point in time:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/927007/frequently-asked-questions-about-how-to-activate-microsoft-games-for-w</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're right, when you uninstalled FSX from your old computer, the activation registration written within your OS (not in FSX), along with the FSX directory, should have been deleted and you would be free to do a fresh install on a new PC and activate it.
 &nbsp; Obviously, this is not happening for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a correction in your last post: &nbsp;when I mentioned about launching FSX as Administrator, it was to start FSX as Admin., not install as Admin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, you are able to launch FSX and take a flight and then after 30 minutes it quits on you, maybe with that Activation message again? &nbsp; Just confirming that is what you are experiencing at the moment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>A strange fix by someone: &nbsp;he had a similar problem as yours and received this message after trying to do online activation: &nbsp; "<span style="color: rgba(39, 42, 52, 1)">According
 to our records, you have exceeded the number of times you can activate this product with the product key you entered". &nbsp; Finally, his last attempt was: &nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(39, 42, 52, 1)">"I
 Reset my Internet Connection and the activation went smoothly. " &nbsp; I can't understand why this would happen, but if you want to try it and see!!</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Yes i also tried to run FSX as admin.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Each time i load FSXm it asks</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><em><strong>Would you like to activate your copy of Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Acceleration now?</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>With the option to register now or later..</p>
<p>if i try to register, it says its been registered too many times.. etc...</p>
<p>
</p><p>the internet reset, has not worked..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its definitely uninstalled from the old PC, so im a little cheesed... as i cant even run it on my old pc now!.</p>
<p>
</p><p>oh well, i will wait a few months and try again.</p>
<p>
