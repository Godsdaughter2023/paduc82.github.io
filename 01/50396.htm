<h2>            Spotify problems after feature update</h2>
                    <p>Hi, after the 1803 feature update I am not able to use the Spotify app on my desktop and laptop computers.</p>
<p>I first noticed the problem on my desktop computer when I got a transparent window with a shadow edge, all I could do was close it. I tried using the app reset options in the settings menu but that didn't help. I have checked my graphics driver and it is
 up to date and no problems reported.</p>
<p>I have tried un-installing the app and re-installing from the spotify website, ninite website and windows store and it still didn't work properly.</p>
<p>I've gone to the spotify website for advice and one suggestion was to open a command prompt windows and go to the directory when spotify.exe is and run a special 'console' command which gives technical info, this didn't work when I tried it because of the
 graphics problem.</p>
<p>Eventually after trying to run spotify on my laptop I came across the solution to disable hardware acceleration by using ALT to get the window menu up; this did work much to my relief</p>
<p>
</p><p>So my question is, will this problem be fixed in a future update so that acceleration can be re-enabled / is disabling hardware acceleration not a big deal for performance for most computers?</p>
<p>Dave</p>

    <title>Skype Call Problem With Vista - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jack0412  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype Call Problem With Vista</h2>
                    <p>We stay in contact with elderly relatives abroad using Skype. We have had no problem with video calls until this evening when Skype would not operate on their laptop until they run an update.&nbsp; As they have very basic knowledge of computers we used Teamviewer
 to install a Skype update for them.</p>
<p>We then tried to have our usual video call and although video works both ways and we can hear them clearly our end, they can't hear us at all.</p>
<p>We reconnected through Teamviewer, checked their laptop volume (all OK), went into Skype settings (again all OK).</p>
<p>We know the problem is definitely their end. When called on Skype they have the calling sound, there is simply no sound once connected.</p>
<p>If anyone could help we would be really grateful as this is our parents (both aged 90) only form of contact with the rest of the family</p>

            I forgot to mention in the main question that although we are running Windows 7, our relatives are running Vista. Unfortunately we are unable to change their operating system as not only are they living abroad, but they have very very basic computer knowledge
 and would be unable to use anything even remotely different. Thank you :)

<p>I have the same problem. Relatives are running vista, ~10000 miles away, and not capable of an OS reinstall.</p>
<p>Skype 7.33 and 7.36 do not allow audio on the my relatives end.&nbsp; All prgram sounds are fine, even the test option.&nbsp; But once in a call (even echo test) there is no sound.</p>
<p>6.14 seems to allow it fine, but only works for a single log in and then starts a "cannot connect" cycle.</p>

<p>Unfortunately not. </p>
<p>Problem is they have a very old Emachine laptop running Vista. If they went out a bought another laptop they would not know how to use it.</p>
<p>We are currently using Google Hangout. The only way we are connecting is because we installed Teamviewer a couple of years back, so we can call them then connect remotely to answer the call for them as due to their limited computer abilities anything different
 is not an option.</p>
<p>As they are about the visit, we have bought them another identical Emachine that we have installed Windows 7 32 bit on so we can go back to Skype.</p>
<p>We will set it up to look identical to the one they are using and switch laptops.</p>
<p>in short, the only way to use Skype again was install Windows 7 32 bit&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry :(</p>

<h2>            can&#38;&#35;39&#59;t select 5.1 uncompressed for HDMI audio</h2>
                    
<p>I have been using my Xbox One with a Yamaha YSP-4000 sound bar for about 18 months now. Today I got a new Xbox One since the disk drive failed on my day one model. It's actually a re-manufactured console that I got from a Microsoft store since my original
 XB1 was out of warranty. Anyway, my surround sound worked perfect before. Now for some reason it won't let me select 5.1 uncompressed. I keep getting an error saying to check my audio receiver to make sure it supports it. It definitely does as I've been using
 it for some time. The sound bar is also a receiver. It's not just a sound bar.<br />
<br />
My XB1 is connected via HDMI to the receiver.<br />
Receiver is connected via HDMI to the TV.<br />
<br />
Surround sound is turned on in my TV &amp; OneGuide settings.<br />
<br />
The receiver and TV are both set up in the Device control menu.<br />
<br />
No matter what I do I cannot select 5.1 uncompressed and am baffled because I essentially have the same exact set up as before, but with a newer XB1.<br />
<br />
Thank you for any advice.</p>

<h2>            confused about OneDrive and My PC and C&#58;</h2>
                    I have OneDrive on my W10 computer. I'm confused about the apparent different locations of files. File Explorer shows 3 different locations: OneDrive, My PC, and C: ;&nbsp; I think W10 syncs the OneDrive and My PC locations so the documents are the same, but
 not so for C: . So why is C: different and why is it even there?

<p>try going into the Mouse/Touchpad settings/Options and maybe reset them or make a change and save and then change back and save. Could be the pad. But maybe check the drivers and uninstall it, restart PC. After drivers install on sign in, restart pc again
 and see if that fixes it.</p>

            Hi jjoslyn3 
<br />
<br />My name is Fernando.  I am an Independent Advisor.  I am here to guide you with your touchpad issue.
<br />
<br />Sounds like your touchpad drivers either got corrupt and need to be reinstalled and/or need to be updated.  To do this:
<br />
<br />1.	Open Device Manager by clicking on the bottom-left Start button on desktop, type device manager in the search box and tap Device Manager on the menu.
<br />2.	Go to Mice and other pointing devices, and 
<br />3.	Find your touchpad (typically it is labeled HID-compliant mouse)
<br />4.	Right-click on your touchpad and click Update Driver Software.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask me any questions and let me know how it goes. 
<br />
<br />Respectfully,
<br />
<br />Fernando Y.       
        </p>

<p>So it worked and then didn't after windows update ?????</p>
<p>Just right click ????</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go back to driver update and instead of update driver, see if ROLL BACK drive option is available.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can use system restore to the day and time before this started happening and see if it fixes it. If it does,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then you will get new windows updates. If it happens again, then WU is causing it.</p>

<p>To be honest, I'm not sure when it stopped working. I normally use a mouse, but I was at a conference and had to use the touchpad. The laptop is only about a month old. The touchpad used to work, but now it doesn't. I assume it was the updates.&nbsp;</p>

            I am assumin thisis an HP laptop as Microsoft and HP are two different brands.
<br />
<br />I will need a more specific model as the Envy has many models to direct you as to which drivers you need to install.
<br />
<br />If you want to go through the list and look for the specific model you have you can have HP do the look up for you at the following link.

<h2>            Windows Hello not working</h2>
                    <p>Hi all, I've been using my Surface 4 for a while and never had any problem with Microsoft Hello. Last night suddently it stopped working, I did not download any update or did any changes to the computer. It just says Sorry, something went wrong, Please use
 PIN.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do not see the Hello's camera working either. I tried several solutions I found in the forum but so far nothing worked. Does anyone know how I can get it to work again?<br />
Thanks</p>

            Hello ChristopherTJ.
<br />
<br />In case with Windows hello check the steps below:
<br />
<br />1) Turn off Fast Startup: Go to Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Choose what Power buttons do &gt; Change settings that are unavailable &gt; uncheck Fast Startup. 
<br />
<br />2) Reset Facial Recognition and/or Fingerprint Options 
<br />
<br />Go to Settings &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign In Options 
<br />Locate Fingerprint or Facial Recognition options and click Remove under them. 
<br />After that, click Get Started and follow the on-screen instructions to reset Fingerprint and Facial Recognition. 
<br />Reboot your PC if needed. 
<br />
<br />3) Modify Group Policy Settings (for Pro version only) 
<br />
<br />Creators Update might have modified some of the crucial settings of Group Policy. Therefore, we would recommend to launch the Group Policy Editor and check/edit the settings related to Windows Hello functionality. 
<br />
<br />Pres Windows key, type gpedit, and press Enter. 
<br />Click on Computer Configuration and open Administrative Templates. 
<br />Select Windows Components and open Biometrics. 
<br />Click on Facial Features and right-click on Configure enhanced anti-spoofing option. 
<br />Select Edit and disable the Configure enhanced anti-spoofing feature. 
<br />Reboot your PC. 
<br />
<br />4) Update drivers 
<br />
<br />If some of the system drivers, most probably webcam and fingerprint reader drivers, were corrupted during the upgrade process, Windows Hello may fail to perform. To fix that, try to update the corresponding drivers: 
<br />
<br />Right-click on Windows key and select Device Manager. 
<br />Locate the Hello, webcam, and fingerprint drivers individually and right-click on each of them. 
<br />Select Remove driver software and wait for the removal to be finished. 
<br />Repeat the removal with all Windows Hello related drivers and then reboot your PC. 
<br />Once done, open Device Manager, click Action -&gt; Scan for hardware changes. 
<br />The system should automatically detect and reinstall the drivers. 
<br />
<br />5) Run Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooter at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Troubleshoot. 
<br />
<br />6) If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here: <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a> 
<br />
<br />7) If nothing else helps then run a Fresh Start: <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use-the-fresh-start-feature-in-windows-10-creators-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-use...</a> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.

<h2>            Konica Minotlta Vivid 910 scsi scanner does not work for non admin user on Windows 7</h2>
                    We have Konica Minolta Vivid 910 SCSI scanner and connected to windows 7 laptop using U2CSX SCSI to USB converter. We are using Polygon Editing tool to scan the 3D scan. The problem is when normal (non admin) user try to connect to scanner it does not
 connect and does not give any error message. We asked the supplier and they said it is windows 7 which imposes admin previledge to access the scanner. The same scanner works absolutely fine on windows xp for normal user. &nbsp;Is there a way to get it working for
 the normal user in windows 7?

 The screen will show the computer name, that it is connecting, but will never connect. the computer sees the device and shows that it is connected, but then goes away. Other computers are able to connect to the same device.

            Hi Kristopher, I am Rob, a volunteer and a 10 time and dual award MVP specializing in Windows troubleshooting and Bluescreen analysis. Please remember as volunteers we are not responsible for the development of Windows or the computer hardware and drivers. 
<br />
<br />I see you have tried updating drivers, however, please follow these exact methods which usually will work. There will be other options in the next reply however those will not help if these are not done.
<br /> 
<br />Try these for both the WiFi and the Display Adapter.
<br />
<br />Right Click the Start Button - Device Manager - find the WiFi device under Network - double click on the device - Driver tab - Roll Back driver - OK - then go back to the same place and Uninstall &lt;-- this refreshes the driver's stack. Repeat for Display Adapter
<br />
<br />Then if still needed update those drivers from Dell and also check the actual device makers' sites (such as Intel, Nvidia, Realtek, and so on). Only installer the very latest you find after checking all sites for both WiFi and Video/Display Drivers. Also, update the BIOS and chipset drivers.
<br />
<br />Check with System Maker (Motherboard Maker for custom systems) for updates to the BIOS, low-level chipset drivers, and the major onboard and separate device drivers. Run DriverView - set VIEW to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their name.
<br />
<br />DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.
<br /><a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</a>
<br />
<br />For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack.
<br />
<br />Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.
<br />
<br />Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset, and software updates at System Maker's site while there.)
<br />
<br />Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.
<br />
<br />Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.
<br />
<br />Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.
<br />
<br />Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.

    <title>Using a TV as a Monitor - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> creacontech  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using a TV as a Monitor</h2>
                    <p>I have a laptop with an HDMI port, and a TV also with one.&nbsp; Can I connect the laptop to the TV with an HDMI cable and let the TV act as a monitor?&nbsp; I'd like to be able to do this so that when sometimes I miss a program that I didn't record on my satellite's
 DVR, I can access it on the laptop, but the screen is small and the sound is too soft for me (I'm hard of hearing).</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, is there anything else that I have to know about in order to make it work.</p>

<p>Yes you should be able to. Although it may or may not send sound (it might be a display-only connection, check your computer's owners manual to find out). &nbsp;But as for how to use it as a monitor, here's how:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Connect the cable and make sure your TV is on the right input for the HDMI cable</p>
<p>Hold down the Windows logo key and press the letter P (for "project") until the Extend option is highlighted. &nbsp;That will tell Windows you want to use your HDMI screen as an extension of your desktop, so you can drag programs over to it and use it
 as if it as a 2nd monitor.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As the name suggests, the "duplicate" option makes both screens show the same thing.</p>

    <title>XBOX streaming to Win10 constantly disconnects after upgrading to AU - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ruuku  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBOX streaming to Win10 constantly disconnects after upgrading to AU</h2>
                    <p>I've noticed that XBOX streaming to my Win10 constantly disconnects after upgrading to Anniversary Update. &nbsp;I have 2 Windows 10 machines, one is laptop with Win10 x64 and another is a tablet with Win10 x86. &nbsp;Both are experiencing the same constant disconnect
 after upgrading to AU, where I had very good stable streaming before upgrading. &nbsp;I did try streaming with a network cable and did not have the disconnect issue. &nbsp;Nothing else has changed in my home environment. &nbsp;My laptop can hold a very steady 300 mbps connection
 with my wireless router, and I can file copy over WIFI at around 150~160mbps, so there shouldn't be speed issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I run streaming test with WIFI now, it fails at every resolution. &nbsp;I've followed the recommendation in XBOX streaming troubleshooting pages, but no improvement.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've found updates for my XBOX and the XBOX app, and updated everything but still experiencing disconnects. &nbsp;I've checked if there is newer driver for my Intel Centrino Advanced-N 6235 but I'm definitely using latest driver. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Chalk this to another AU problem?</p>

            I had a similar issue, did not seem to correlate to any update, but frequently disconnected on weird and wireless connections. I had the same issues after upgrading a router as well. The only thing that seemed to help (temporarily) was unplugging the Xbox
 one, waiting a couple minutes, then restarting it. Worth a try...I spent two hours with Microsoft support and had them tell me it was my router, never mentioned this as a solution.

<p>Hi Davevet,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</p>
<p><br />
First, I recommend you to Set your printer as the default printer and see if it resets it to online status.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> <strong>To select a default printer</strong></p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Open <strong>Devices and Printers</strong> by clicking the <strong>Start</strong> button.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; <strong>Right-click the printer</strong> you want to use, and then click <strong>
Set as default printer</strong>. (You'll see a check mark on the printer's icon signifying that it's now your default printer.)</p>
<p>For more information visit the following link:</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Change-your-default-printer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Change-your-default-printer</a></p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong> If the above method does not help, check for the following setting:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Open the <strong>Start </strong>menu and click on “<strong>Devices and Printers</strong>”. This will open a window with a list of the printers currently set up on your computer. Now click on the printer that you have under the "<strong>Printers and Faxes</strong>"
 icon.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; Double-click on the icon of the printer you want to change to online. A pop-up window detailing all current print jobs will open.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; Go to "<strong>Printer</strong>" in the menu bar of the pop-up window and uncheck "<strong>Use Printer Offline</strong>". This action will change the printer from offline to online.</p>
<p><br />
Also disable the other printers, if installed any.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Happy New Year!</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I have a brand new (2 weeks) HP windows 8 laptop.&nbsp; A couple days ago, the computer started to crash unexpectedly, at first only once a day
 or so but now it happens approximately every hour, especially if I attempt to download something.&nbsp; This began approximately at the same time as my computer indicated that it cannot activate my windows (do not know if that is related).&nbsp; Unfortunately I am quite
 helpless when it comes to computers.</span></p>
<p><span>However, before crashing my computer identifies the error as DRIVER IRQL NOT LESS OR EQUAL tcpip.sys.&nbsp; I have tried to open the minidump files
 but it states that access is denied.&nbsp; Could you please help me?</span></p>

<h3> oldloggie1  say:</h3>
<h2>            PRINT SPOOLER PROBLEM WITH USB PRINTER CANON PIXMA MP550</h2>
                    <p>I have a problem with the main&nbsp;PC.&nbsp; No printers are shown in the Printer page of Control Panel. When I try to add a printer the&nbsp;message tells me the print spooler is not working. &nbsp;I can also get the error code: 'error 0x000006e'. I&nbsp;have tried all the usual
 fixes (via 'Services' etc) without success.&nbsp; The Print Spooler suggests that it is on; I have reset it several times and it shows ON, but the message I get when trying to add a printer says it is not working.&nbsp; I tied the sfc /scannow process which found no
 corrupt files. I tried a 'restore' with no success. </p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The laptop can find the printer, a Canon Pixma MP 550 and it works well but the main PC just cannot find any printers either in the Control Panel or via individual programs (WORD, etc) and will not let me add any.&nbsp; The home network seems fine and both computers
 &nbsp;recognise each other and I can access files from both on the other computer.&nbsp; But, on the PC, there are no printers showing on the network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, I tried the canon Pixma MP 550 'My Canon' Diagnose routine.&nbsp; This failed to find the printer even when plugged directly into the PC's USB slot.&nbsp; Could this be a LPT 1 problem?&nbsp; I so not know how to access LPTs to reconfigure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have also opened OUTLOOK and WORD and tried to add a printer this way, but I get the message: 'The Active Domain Services are currently unavailable'.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Grateful for any assistance here.&nbsp;&nbsp; All the usual fixes have been tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards</p>

            That's by design. There is no <em>preview </em>pane; it's called the <em>reading
</em>pane because it's a full view of the message just as if it had been opened in its own window. Displaying messages in the reading pane is disabled for the junk email folder as a security measure in case there's some malicious content that would run on opening.
 You have to make a positive effort to open&nbsp;them for reading.

<p>
</p><p>the current implementation (to fully turn off any reading pane / preview pane) is a pretty bad design, as it doesn't add any security, really.</p>
<p>one is forced to either "blindly" deleting the junk emails (by just looking at the header), or fully "open" the email to review the actual contents.</p>
<p>
</p><p>there are much better solutions, such as in <strong>Outlook 2010</strong>: it is displaying the items in the junk mail folder in "<strong>text only</strong>" mode. those items will have a heading such as:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>This message was converted to plain text.</em><br />
<em>Links and other functionality have been disabled in this message. To restore functionality, move this message to the Inbox.</em><br />
<em>Outlook blocked access to the following potentially unsafe attachments: test1.png, test2.png.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>such a feature is missing from <strong>Windows Live Mail 2012</strong> (Build 16.4.3528.0331).</p>
<p>unless such a feature is added to windows live mail it is not "usable" <em>and</em> "secure" at the same time.</p>

<p>There are other options: </p>

<li>Right-click on a message in the message list and select <em>Properties</em>. On the
<em>Details</em> tab, click <em>Message source </em>to see the entire message unrendered.</li><li>Press Ctrl-Shift-O for Options, then on the <em>Read </em>tab select <em>Read all messages in plain text</em>,

<p>
</p><blockquote>

<p>If you run Windows Live Mail in the <em>Restricted </em>security zone and you're careful not to open attachments you're not expecting, your anti-malware software&nbsp;should keep you safe so long as it's properly maintained.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>No features have been added to Windows Live Mail since 2010, when development stopped. I'm not sure why you're using it if you have Outlook.</p>

            <p>@¡Firedog:</p>
<p>you are slightly missing the point, i'm afraid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the initial <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">question</span> was:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>in the spam folder i'm not able to enable preview / reading pane.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>then you gave an <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">explanation</span>:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>yes, it's not possible. this is a deliberate decision for security reasons.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>and then i was stating:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>well, that's bad. it seriously impacts the usability.</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>the security aspect is no sufficient justification to completely disable any "preview".</em></p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px"><em>there are other products achieving both, usability and security.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>the options you have mentioned ("message source", "read ALL message in plain text", "being careful to not open attachments", etc.) are not feasible, as they don't meet the requirements.</p>
<p>
</p><p>so the actual <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">answer </span>to the OP's question would be something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>what you are seeking for is not possible with windows live mail 2012</li><li>you'll have to use a different product, unfortunately</li></ul>

<h2>            Windows 10 default apps&#47;programs not working at all</h2>
                    <p>I have the Windows 10 upgrade on my desktop PC. &nbsp;Recently, the default programs (Photo Viewer, Calendar, Mail) have been failing to open. &nbsp;The photo viewer was letting me see a photo for a few seconds before closing, but that's about it. &nbsp;The others won't
 open at all. &nbsp;To make it even more fun, I tried resetting the photo viewer under Apps &amp; Features advanced settings and now I don't see Photos as an app or feature at all. I'm afraid to reset the Mail &amp; Calendar app, in case that disappears as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've run maintenance checks in the security &amp; maintenance tool, but it finds no solutions. &nbsp;It also reports no problems. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What might I try next that could fix this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any possible solutions, please lay out the steps as I am NOT a computer genius by any stretch, but I can follow instructions.</p>
<p>

</p><p>I've run the Windows app Troubleshooter. &nbsp;It says the Windows Store cache may be damaged. &nbsp;I have no idea what that means and the troubleshooter was not able to fix it even after it closed and restarted.<br />
</p>
<p>I have yet to try the second and third method. &nbsp;Where do I find PowerShell? &nbsp;I don't see it on my apps list. &nbsp;Also, the command you listed is long, so is that all run-on or are there spaces between some of the characters? &nbsp;It's really hard to tell by just
 looking at it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologize for asking questions about stuff that may be obvious to you.</p>
<p>

            I had this same problem, and <strong>running the troubleshooter and clearing the cache didn't work for me</strong>. I went into: Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery&gt; and clicked on Reset this PC. Then, I chose to keep my files, and reinstall windows. You
 keep your files by using this method. This has fixed the problem for me. I hope you can find a solution.

                    I tried to optimize my disk drive and it says I have three volumes: OS (C:), WINRETOOLS, AND \\?\Volume{2e4a4611-1b2-4819-9180-b42451e52b74}\.<br />
I was able to optimize the first two. The third says it's 29% fragmented &amp; needs optimized. When I click on it, nothing happens. Can't analyze either. Dell &amp; McAfee support don't have a clue. See screenshot:

            HI,
<div>&nbsp;My new Asus laptop and desktop did the exact same thing AFTER updating from Win 8.0 to Win.1. Fortunately after notifying Asus &nbsp;about the problem,my desktop is fine. &nbsp;But this involved going into the Bios to make sure that my drives were set to be optimized,
 backing up all my files, re-setting the entire computer to the factory setting, and installing everything. &nbsp;This worked for my desktop but NOT for my laptop. &nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp;It was getting worse after updating for the 3rd time to Win8.1. &nbsp;Since my computers are new, I installed Norton Utilities 16 on my laptop. I de-fragmented and &nbsp;optimized the drives with Norton. &nbsp;Then I repeated the same thing by going to Adm. Tools
 in Control Panel. I did this because I would get different percentages for the same drives using disk management via the control panel. It's fine now but what a pain in patience to get there. &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; I think there is something not quite right with Win 8.1 on that regard to defraging and optimizing. &nbsp;Until then, I would suggest you notify your computer manufacture and a live Microsoft Tech assistant via phone. &nbsp;They were great in helping me and
 ran a diagnostic. &nbsp;In the end, I went ahead and purchased Norton and continued to work on the lap top to keep it running smoothly.</div>

<p>So the weird volume name is the unique name that Microsoft Windows gives to volumes and usually shows up when you haven't been able to give the volume a name (usually happens when it's a system volume). You can see what disk that volume belongs to by running
 this code below in a powershell command as an administrator (Right click on powershell and say 'run as administrator'). When I ran it I got my C:\ drive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>$VolumeId = '\\?\Volume{2e4a4611-1b2-4819-9180-b42451e52b74}\'<br />

$VolumeId = $VolumeId.Replace('\', '\\') #Wmi needs to have the backslashes escaped<br />

<h2>            Windows Automatically Resize After Using Full-Screen Game</h2>
                    <p>I'm running Windows 10 on a Surface 3.&nbsp; When I launch a full-screen application (i.e. a game), I find that any other windows I've left open (web browsers, mail app, etc.) have automatically resized themselves to the upper-left corner of a screen after exiting
 the game.&nbsp; Has anyone had this issue or does anyone know of a fix?&nbsp; Resizing all of the windows every time can get annoying.<br />

            Hi Drew,
<div><br />
Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community.</div>
<div><br />
<div>
<p>In regards to this issue, I require additional information to assist you further:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Did you make any changes to the pc prior to this issue?</p>
<p>2. Have you installed all pending updates on the pc and also updated all device drivers?</p>
<div>
<p>3. Does this issue occur on a local account or the Microsoft account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Follow the steps below and check if it helps:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong><br />
You can also place the system in clean boot state and then check if it helps.<br />
<strong>Perform a Clean Boot:</strong><br />
A clean boot allows the Windows operating system to launch without any additional programs or services running when you turn the computer on. This allows you to determine if computer issues are caused by a program or service that starts up when you boot the
 machine.<br />
Refer the link below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>How to perform a clean boot in Windows:</strong><br />

(The above link also applies for windows 10.) </p>
<div><br />
Disclaimer: After performing the troubleshooting steps for clean boot refer the section “How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting”.</div>
<p>
</p></div>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">I suggest you to update the graphics card drivers/display drivers from manufacturer website and check if it resolves the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">1. Press<strong> Windows Key + X and</strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
</span></span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Open Device manager.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">2. Expand ‘<strong>Display Adapter’</strong>.
</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">3. Locate the
<strong>display driver.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">4.
<strong>Right-click</strong> on the display card listed and click on ‘<strong>Update Driver Software’.</strong></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. Get back to us if you need further assistance.</p>

    <title>Connecting an Older Model Panasonic Viera Large Screen Tv to My - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Connecting an Older Model Panasonic Viera Large Screen Tv to My Windows 10 PC</h2>
                    <p>I've searched existing posts of similar topics as mine.&nbsp; I've been unable to find the information I'm looking for so pardon me if I ask for advice that's already been given to others with similar but not quite the same circumstances.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've recently gone from being a long time Apple computer user to a Windows 10 PC&nbsp; user.&nbsp; Even with my previous Mac computer I was&nbsp;
<em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">unable</span></em> to get that computer to display on my Panasonic Viera TV but at least then I was able to get my computer to detect the Panasonic TV that I had connected to it via an HDMI cable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, with my new Window 10 computer I had high hopes of getting it to work but, no such luck.&nbsp; My new PC&nbsp;will not detect the connected Panasonic TV.&nbsp; The TV itself is an older model but it does have the one lone HDMI&nbsp;port and it appears to be in good working
 order.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>The only thing I can think of that would keep my Windows PC from detecting my Panasonic TV is&nbsp;the chance that&nbsp;I don't have the correct setting established within the TV setup screen&nbsp;itself.&nbsp; I've watched several video tutorials on how it's done online but
 none of them (even ones featuring Panasonic Viera TVs) show the exact same TV setup menus so it's hard to tell what setup details I should be using on my TV.&nbsp; The Windows PC setup menus are pretty straight forward; it's just that my computer isn't detecting
 the fact&nbsp;that I even have my TV connected to it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using a powered&nbsp;HDMI splitter in order to connect my main monitor (ACER) as well as the large screen Panasonic TV.&nbsp; I've tried disconnecting my Acer-Monitor and just using the TV as my computer monitor alone but that doesn't work either.&nbsp; I've also
 tried swapping ports on the splitter thinking perhaps one of ports was bad but that made no difference either.&nbsp; I'm good at a lot of technical things but, working with computers and computer hardware just isn't one of them.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My Windows 10 computer&nbsp;detects everything else that's connected to it, just not the TV.&nbsp; It leaves me scratching my head.&nbsp; Again: it's an older model Panasonic Viera.&nbsp; It only has one HDMI port so it's hard to believe I've connected it incorrectly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any
 suggestions from you more knowledgeable Windows users would be appreciated.</p>

            <p>Greetings; and thanks for the quick reply:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no other TV with which to carry out the tests you've mentioned but I do have another computer monitor that I can carry out a similar test with.&nbsp; At the very least it may indicate if the problem is on the computer side of this equation or the monitor
 side.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In your suggestion, you've laid out some fairly clear instructions.&nbsp; I'm going to give them a try with the monitor I eluded to.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do these steps need to be followed with the Monitor or TV connected or am I just testing the function of my computer only at
 this time?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ask this because when I was using my Mac computer to try to connect so it displayed on the same Large Screen Panasonic TV, I had the very same problem; except that the Mac computer actually did recognize that the Panasonic TV was connected.&nbsp; It's just
 that it would not display.&nbsp; This is why I wondered if I needed to figure out the correct settings on the TV itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At any rate, I'll give it a try and get back to you with the results.&nbsp; (if any)&nbsp; Thanks again for the quick reply.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hey; I'm sorry it's taken so long to get back with an update on how it went.&nbsp; I ran that "<em>Trouble Shooter</em>" method you laid out for me and it didn't yield any positive results.&nbsp; I still couldn't get my computer to display on my HDMI connected large
 scree Panasonic Veira TV.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I intended to connect my extra computer monitor (the one I was using with my Mac computer) but it has a completely different connector that requires an adapter that I don't have right now.&nbsp; I did order one cause I finally got the Old
<em>Mac Mini</em> up and running again.&nbsp; I intend to sell it to recoup some of the money I paid for this new Windows 10 PC.&nbsp; The Geek-Guys that worked on it managed to loose that particular connector so, Anyway;when that adapter comes in I'll try connecting&nbsp;that
 other monitor&nbsp;to my New PC to find out if I can get&nbsp;the dual&nbsp;display&nbsp;that I'd hoped I could get with my&nbsp;large screen TV.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll have to wait till that adapter comes in till I'll be able to test the second method you laid out for me.&nbsp; I'm interested to find out if it's my new PC or the TV itself that's keeping me from getting it to display the images that my desktop monitor displays.&nbsp;
 I'm wondering if I have to have my TV on a certain channel or something like that.&nbsp; I'll be back once I've given that a shot.&nbsp; It should be here next week some time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help; and your patience.</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Kindly get back to us once you already have the adapter. In that way, we can check if the second method works.</p>

            <p>Sorry for the long waits between updates.&nbsp; I've been waiting for the HDMI to VGA adapter I ordered to show up.&nbsp; It came in yesterday but I've been swamped at work so I haven't had a chance to test my other computer monitor to find out if my Panasonic Viera
 TV is the problem or if the problem is in the PC itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "other computer monitor" I'm referring to has only a VGA port on it that connects it to my PC.&nbsp; I needed the adapter just to hook it up.&nbsp; My existing monitor has both an HDMI and a VGA port; and the Panasonic TV has only a HDMI port to connect to.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For a technologically retarded guy like myself, these three variation alone are enough to stifle any attempt at connecting my TV to my computer as a secondary display screen.&nbsp; Rest assured I have not forgotten about this inquiry.&nbsp; I'll update you on any
 progress as time allows.</p>
