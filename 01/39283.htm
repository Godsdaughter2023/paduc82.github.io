    <title>Windows 7 will not restart or shutdown - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jb6100  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 will not restart or shutdown</h2>
                    
<p>I am using Windows&nbsp;7 Home Premium. I recently started having the problem where Windows will not restart or shutdown properly. No matter how long I let it set, it stays at the 'shutting down' screen. I tried using 'clean boot' proceedure but problem persists.
 However, booting in 'safe mode' restart/shutdown seems to work. After power off/poweron, applications seem to work the first time I start them. Some, however, will not restart after closing, and some will stop responding after leaving them open for a while.</p>
<p>I am hoping to avoid doing a full system restore.</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<h3> patrickh.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7 OEM Key - How to activate Windows 7 after reinstalling it 64bit&#63;</h2>
                    <p>So I wanted to reinstall my Windows 7 PC from HP on 64bit (because I updated the CPU and RAM), but unfortunately I cannot activate the product key anymore though reading it out it says "Windows 7 OEM marker in firmware" and showing this specific key. This
 was the key with which Windows 7 32bit was activated before. Of course I used a OEM compatible ISO to install the 64bit version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Checking the key on Microsoft Download Site it tells this:</p>
<p>Error - Message Code 715-123130 and Transaction ID a703a305-335a-42a8-a473-85e3e91ce486</p>
<p>
</p><p>I made a screenshot of the Key when it was installed and activated on Windows 7 32bit.</p>

<p>If it came preinstalled from HP, you can't change the "bit" architecture from 32bit to 64bit.</p>
<p>The OEM license doesn't cover that as it is specific to the bit version it is for..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft does not supply Windows 7 ISO downloads&nbsp;for OEM&nbsp;preinstalled operating system Product Keys&nbsp;for&nbsp;Dell, HP, etc. machines.</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with you wanting a 64bit download</p>
<p>
</p><p>@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either reinstall the 32bit or buy the 64bit Windows 7 which Microsoft no longer sells.</p>
<p>Or ask HP as they are the ones to see about this.</p>

<p>Have you contacted your bank? When PSN was hacked, Microsoft took security measures with banks and the banks would sometimes lock up your card when you purchased anything off of Xbox Live. I'm not sure if they still do that but they did a few weeks ago,
 I would call your bank and make sure your card works fine, if it does and you still have the problem, call Xbox Support at:
</p>
<p>Toll free: (800) 4MY-XBOX or (800) 469-9269</p>

            <p>Hi and thanks for helping,</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; I am using the Windows 10 DVD Player App, v. 3.6.1176.0.&nbsp; With the new Windows 10 installation, it seems the DVD function from my old Windows Media Player was erased and the "new" Windows 10 DVD player app was automatically installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; As for your suggestion to update all drivers using the Device Manager, it has been done but everything was up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your assistance.</p>

            <p>Thanks for this suggestion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The DVD/CD ROM Drives in Device Manager does not list the Windows DVD player. How can I re-get this driver?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop does not have a DVD player built in, so I plugged in an external DVD player via USB port into my docking station.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I received the Windows 10 DVD player after I upgraded this laptop&nbsp;from Windows 7 Pro. At first&nbsp;Windows Update&nbsp;had trouble installing the KB3081704 that gives Windows 10 upgrade users this DVD&nbsp;player&nbsp;driver. After I found&nbsp;KB3081704 on ms-vnext.net/UpdateArchive
 and installed it manually, the rest of Windows Updates finished installing and I was able to use Windows DVD player. Yay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then, I bought a different DVD player that came preloaded with Power2Go and Power DVD. I unplugged the first DVD player from the docking USB port and then plugged in the new DVD player and installed both of these software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I am getting the same error message discussed in this forum when trying to use Windows DVD, Playback Error 0x8004027d. The driver you suggest&nbsp;updating does not exist in my Device Driver.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PowerDVD player works fine. It is the only driver that shows up in the Device Manger under DVD/CD ROM Drives. I'd also like to have the option of using Windows DVD player. What can I do to make Windows DVD player work again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks much.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span> <span>&nbsp;</span> </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You may try the following methods and check if it helps.</span> <span>&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><strong>Method 1:</strong></span> <span>&nbsp;</span> </p>
<p><span><span>a) </span></span><span>Open your movie-making program and create the slide show using your photos. Pick the options you want for changes between photos and for the length of time each photo is displayed. If you need help then refer to the help
 file in your movie making program.</span> </p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Open the import file dialogue box. In Windows Movie Maker it is in the "Movie Tasks" pane, under "Capture Video." Browse through your files to find the mp3 file you want to import, selected and import it. This
 will import it into the movie-making program but it will not place it in the video.</span>
</p>
<p><span><span>c)<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Navigate to the file in your movie-making program and import it into the movie. In Windows Movie Maker you can drag and drop the file into the position in the movie time-line window, where you would like the
 song to start playing.</span> </p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Scroll across the time line until you find the end of the song. Drag the end of the song into position to match the end of your slide show. This will have the song end at exactly the same time as your slide
 show.</span> </p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Play your movie all the way from beginning to end and make sure that everything matches with the song the way you'd like it to. If you're happy with the finished product then export the movie to the correct
 format and the file will be ready to play.</span> <span>&nbsp;</span> </p>

            <p>When attempting to install KB2770917, the update progresses normally thru the first phase, does the restart, then does "wait while you computer is configured".&nbsp;&nbsp; When it gets to 100%, it FAILS and then does the Revert process.</p>
<p>I have done: (1) disabled all non-usoft services (msconfig), and disabled all extra startup (taskmgr), (2) did a System Restore, (3) Removed all non-usoft drivers (printers,scanners)
</p>
<p>Nothing changed or helped.&nbsp; The computer is running Windows8Pro, and was installed from Win7 (inplace - kept applications).&nbsp; It is also running Office 365 Home Preview.</p>
<p>Is there anyway to get an error indication of what is causing the failure?</p>
<p>I have shut off WindowsUpdate to stop it from continually trying to do this install.</p>

            On x64-systems disable the nalpeiron X64 service for installing the update. To disable the service you should take a look at this site:

<h2>            Microsoft Family Kid&#39;s Account Freezing Windows</h2>
                    <p>Recently upgraded to Windows 10.&nbsp; We migrated our kid's user accounts to sign in with a Microsoft account instead of local account.</p>
<p>User accounts work fine for the adults, but computer freezes 30 seconds to a minute after logging in with kid's accounts and needs a hard reset.&nbsp; After changing the child accounts back to local accounts, the problem disappears.</p>
<p>We would like to take advantage of the MS Family protections and monitoring, but it is unusable.</p>

<p>Hi, <br />
<br />
Your PC's specification may meet the requirements of the device but, there's a chance that a specific hardware component may still cause a compatibility issue. We could take the following steps to check if the
<strong>Miracast</strong> is supported by the driver: </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Type <strong>dxdiag</strong> in the <strong>Search</strong> bar, then press <strong>
Enter</strong>. <br />
</li><li>When the <strong>DirectX Diagnostic Tool </strong>page opens, click <strong>Save All Information</strong>.
<br />
<br />
<br />
<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/010b1c27-ad15-4b15-9032-4ce0315ed733?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/010b1c27-ad15-4b15-9032-4ce0315ed733?upload=true" /></a><br />
<br />
</li><li>Save the <strong>DxDiag.txt</strong> that was created.<br />
</li><li>Open <strong>DxDiag.txt</strong> and search for <strong>Miracast</strong>. Use the shortcut
<strong>Ctrl + F</strong> to open <strong>Find</strong> to search it. </li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be waiting for your response.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">Oh I see. Let me check it here on your account. Please allow me a few moments to check it here.</span></p>
<p><span>I can purchase game and other thing wiht no problems</span></p>
<p><span>Just not my live account</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">Thank you for waiting and for the additional information. As per checking your account here, you have a declined credit card on your account. This is also the reason why you can't purchase a subscription on your account.</span></p>
<p><span>that is an outdated card I added a new card and it won't let me use it</span></p>
<p><span>I removed that card</span></p>
<p><span>and turned off auto update</span></p>
<p><span>I already had another card on the account and added a new one will not let me use either one</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">I see. May I know the last four digit of your new card on your account?</span></p>
<p><span>I have two cards on my account the one I have used for the last 6 months is 4771 and the one i just added is 0727</span></p>
<p><span>they both are good cards</span></p>
<p><span>I just purchased a game this morning on 4771 with no problems</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">Okay thank you for providing that to me. As I have check your account here, you have a declined credit card which has the last four digit 4014. Is that the one that you used before on your account?</span></p>
<p><span>I removed that card yesterday as I told you it was outdated. But I had been using 4771 for over 6 months on my account I purchased my xbox live account last year with 4014 and have not used it sence that purchase. I have used 4771</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">Alright, here is we can do here. I will try to remove the 4014 on your account because it is still showing on your account here. Then you will try to purchase the subscription after that.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It does not show on my account as I am online now with my account on my computer and it only shows 0727 and 4771 and when i tried to purchase my renewal I used 4771</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">I see. Thank you for waiting. I was able to removed that credit card on your account here. Please try to purchase the subscription on your account. And also, I see&nbsp;that you are still have an active subscription on your account.</span></p>
<p><span>yes I do but would like to purchase it before it runs out on the 19th in two days</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">That is also a reason why you can't purchase a subscription on your account. What we can suggest here is to wait until the active subscription expired. Then you can purchase a new subscription.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>So you are telling me that I have to wait till my subscription expires before i can renew it?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">Yes that is right or I can also turn on the auto renewal of it since it was already turned off.</span></p>
<p><span>That sounds strange to me. I am very displeased with the whole situation and have spent days trying to resolve this. If that is your policy then why is it not posted when you try and renew intead of letting a customer get frustrated and upset over
 trying to pay more money to your company</span></p>
<p><span>I am not sure at this point on weather I will renew now as this has become a complete utter fiasco. and all I was trying to do is renew my subscription.</span></p>
<p><span>.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">I get your point here Walter, and we do apologize for the inconvenience of this issue. No worries since everything on your account is all good and we can also turn on the auto renewal of your subscription here on your account.</span></p>
<p><span>no thank you. If I decide to keep my subscription going. I will turn it on myself. I do plan on posting this conversation to your support community pages so when other people have this problem they might be able to find a solution without going through
 what I had to go through.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)"><br />
Sorry for that Walter. However, that is also the reason why you can't purchase a subscription on your account because of the declined payment instrument and also it affects if you have still an active subscription on the account.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">I hope I didn't lose you. Are we still connected?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have had no problems purchasing any other games on my account over the last year. Using my 4771 card and when I tried to purchase the renewal I changed the card to my 4771 as this option is available. at any point during my efforts if i was informed
 that I needed to wait till my subscription was over that would have been awsome. but until i have spent another 45 min with you I did not find this out. it really should be posted when you try to renew. As I did remove the old card and tried to use the other
 one on my account. But a lesson learned by me i guess. God Bless and have a great day.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)"><br />
I hope that you understand that Walter. And thank you for your time here also.</span></p>
<p><span>No I do not I am a very unhappy customer. But such is life.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 1)">I understand you Walter about this issue. However, it is the system that is not allowing you because of the credit card that is still on the account that is declined. I hope that this won’t change your mind about our service here.</span></p>

 over 6 months. I an no time used the old outdated card. I removed it with the option I was given via my account. I then tried to renew using the card that i had been using right alone for other purchases through your company. At this point it refused to let
 me renew I notice that auto renew was on using the card i had removed so I turned that off. and tried to renew myself. at not point did i get a message that said i needed to wait until my old membership ran out. ha d i received that i would just have waited.

    <title>Cant Control Anything - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> andrewgrey715  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cant Control Anything</h2>
                    <p>All of a sudden I now have this message telling me that I cant control anything on MY computer and that "my IT organization" has taken over everything on my operating system Windows 10.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't recall having an IT organization nor would I ever allow one on my system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have searched all over for a solution but of course there are none I could find and all of these threads are being locked. Why?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to know why Microsoft is trying to make everyone commit suicide by not allowing them any control over the computer they have bought.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The adminstrator rights BS is the worst thing to come down the pike EVER.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I cant get any of my programs to work because I dont have any FKING access to them</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dont want an apology for my experience. I want a damn answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And why am I selecting through a bunch of menus under this post? Am I being routed to an automatic answer without any human help being involved?</p>

<div>From the very beginning of the PC industry, computers have been designed with maximum security in mind, and for the vast majority of users this is critically important.</div>
<div><br />
<div>If you disagree with this goal, you are welcome to damage your computer in any and every way you wish. It is, after all,
<em>your</em> computer. You will find plenty of instructions on the internet that will show you how to dismantle your computer's security, partially or totally.</div>
<div><br />
<div>However, you should not expect the PC industry to go along with the misguided wishes of an uninformed minority, nor should you expect much sympathy when you complain about all the problems that result from the havoc you caused on 'your' computer, which
 is all Microsoft's fault of course.</div>
<div><br />
<div>"Some settings are managed by your organization" has been explained endlessly so I'm not going over it again. In short, it means that some settings are managed by group policy.</div>

<p>
</p><p>Hardly. All I see is HUNDREDS of THOUSANDS of complaints about this stupid-assed admin rights bullshit. If you were the geniuses you think you are, you would find a more user-friendly way to address these abortions.</p>

<p>Really? I can't even move a file from one folder to the other and you wanna tell me this is "my computer"? This seems more like YOUR computer.</p>

<div>
<p>
</p><p>An "uniformed minority". Bullshit. More like an uninformed MAJORITY, as the dicks at Microsuck have done their best to make it as difficult as possible to fix these admin issues. Mac seems to have figured it out. I have hardly messed with anything to create
 any "havoc". It was from following one of the millions of alleged "fixes" on as many websites, all of which are of no help. My favorite is the instructions telling you to click on this or that and finding no such button exists or all selections greyed out.
 MS people cannot expect the general population, which is their bread and butter, to all become computer programmers getting a computer science degree. We are average "idiots" that need simple ways of fixing things. If you are so smart, how about YOU come up
 with a way to facilitate this? (since we are all too stupid to figure it out, as you probably think).</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>"Some settings are managed by your organization" has been explained endlessly so I'm not going over it again. In short, it means that some settings are managed by group policy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yeah no shit. It's been explained so endlessly finding an answer that pertains to individual problems amidst the 10 billion Hindi websites and videos is nearly impossible. Like I got ten years to read through all this bullshit. A simple fix on MS's end would
 be much easier, since they are all so brilliant, likely according to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Must be nice being the only game in town. Like Greyhound bus, MS products are basically the only choice, so if we want to use the product we have to eat all the horseshit that goes with it.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Account Under Investigation - When Can I Get Back On Live&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Last week, my gamertag was hacked and points were purchased with my Paypal account. I got that all sorted, but Microsoft said that the account was under investigation and I can't connect to Live. When I try it comes up with the following message, even when

<h2>            Samsung 961 NVMe stock drivers in Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was wondering if the stock drivers in Windows 10 are as good as the ones provided by Samsung?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this SSD is an OEM my only option is to run the <strong>SM961</strong> would be using the stock drivers from Windows 10. Anyone knows if these are updated regularly for performance optimization?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any installation issues I should be aware of before I proceed? </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks! </p>

This questions is probably best for the manufacturer of the SSD as the guys there should know if their own drivers offer some benefits over the stock Windows 10 ones and what exact advantages do they offer if any. You should be able to run the SSD completely
 fine with the stock drivers but there may be some additional benefits such as improved reliability, performance or lifespan for the SSD itself that are brought by the manufacturer's drivers.&nbsp;</p>

            appreciate the suggestion bud. I'll post in the forum you sent. The thing is, since this is an OEM SSD, it won't be supported beyond the Win10 drivers.

Being an OEM drive doesn't necessarily mean that it won't be affected by the manufacturer's drivers. It never hurts to contact the manufacturer and see what the guys there can say.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Can&#39;t connect to a Bluetooth device while pairing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> elvisnousiainen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can&#39;t connect to a Bluetooth device while pairing</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I am not able to pair an specific bluetooth mouse - Logitech M557 under Windows 10 in a Macbook Pro 2017.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To reproduce the error I click Add bluetooth device, Windows finds the Mouse for pairing but when I select it it gets stuck on "Connecting" and don't do anything.</p>
<p>Thing is it works perfectly in other computers also running Windows 10 so it is not an issue with the device.</p>
<p>Another thing to note is that while installing Windows I've noticed the same mouse worked before one of the reboot.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Already reinstalled all bluetooth drivers and they are updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts please?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Elvis&nbsp;<br />

<p>Hi Leviozar,</p>
<p>
</p><p>None of the cases listed on the article you suggested are similar to the one I am facing.</p>
<p>My mouse can't be paired even Windows found it as an available device, showing the correct model.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After I click on the device it keeps Connecting and does nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Already ran troubleshoot for bluetooth and everytime I run it a message is shown saying a problem was found for "check Bluetooth radio status" but it didn't help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks and regards,</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The possible cause of this issue is due to missing or corrupted drivers on your device. Let's try to rollback drivers and check if the issue persists. Follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Windows + R</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>on the desktop screen.</li><li>Type<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>devmgmt.msc</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>and hit enter.</li><li>Expand the category you want and right click on the driver and select properties.</li><li>Navigate to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>driver</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>tab and click on<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>RollBack driver</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once you're done, update us with the result.</p>

<h2>            DVD&#47;CD player not playing audio Cd&#39;s &#40;win8 laptop&#41;</h2>
                    Hello,
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I recently bought a new laptop, MSI GX60 with windows 8 OEM.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>However, it will not play any audio cd's. If i insert an audio disc (all legal bought cds), the disc drive makes spinning noise, trying to read the disc, but noting happens.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The audio disc works fine in a regular cd player, and the laptop disc drive can play regular DVDs without any problem. So it's just audio cd's that are a problem for some reason.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I've tried stuff I found on the zeb, tried the microsoft fixit thingy, it says the media is not supported or the disc is blank (which is not the case). I've tried uninstalling the drivers and rebooting, nothing helps. I've removed all CD/DVD burning software.
 Nothing.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The disc drive shows up in the device management fine, no errors.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>I'm a bit lost here .... brand new laptop, but can't play audio cd's. Which is hilarious, because I tried my fathers old Dell desktop (7 years old now), and there the audio disc works without a problem.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyone that can help?</div>
                </div>

            Hi Lezleigh. I am a fellow community member who likes to help when I can. I am not an employee of Microsoft. <br /><br />I have seen many users face the same issue that you describe. Some are able to boot into safe mode and login, then use the User account settings to remove the password requirement.  Some are able to login using their Microsoft online account password.<br /><br />Lastly some are unable to get past the password and need to do a clean install of Windows. If you should decide to take the last route there is an excellent guide here<br /><br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a><br /><br />I hope this helps

<p>Hi Dad of 5, thank you for answering my question unfortunately my problem is the last one you have listed and I have already re-installed windows and still have the same problem of not being able to get past the login screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I try the password reset option I get an error box that says "No Drive the feature requires removable media such as a USB or Flash drive. &nbsp;Please connect a USB Flash drive and try again".</p>
<p>
</p><p>The laptop has two hard drives, I have performed tests on both drives and they both passed 100%.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>
        </p>

<p>I have tried all of the above suggestions nothing works. &nbsp;I am not able to use the command prompt and other advanced options because they want a password
</p>
<p>When I try the password reset option it comes ups with the following error box &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>"No Drive the feature requires removable m:edia such as a USB or Flash drive. &nbsp;Please connect a USB Flash drive and try again".</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I attached a removable drive I got a password rest wizard which told me that this drive is not a reset drive. &nbsp;I don't have a reset drive how do I get one? and why do I need one when the laptop has 2 hard drives.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I performed the disk test on them after this happened and they both passed 100%. Any ideas?</p>

<h2>            &#34;Safely remove hardware feature and eject media&#34; often not working in Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>When&nbsp; I want to disconnect an external USB&nbsp;hard disk by using the "Safely Remove Hardware feature and eject media" function in Windows 8, it often does not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The USB external drive is either a Samsung, a&nbsp;Western Digital or a Seagate&nbsp;drive.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is what happens:</p>
<ul>
<li>No notification is shown that I can safely remove my hardware in the&nbsp;System Tray</li><li>There is "---" &nbsp;in place of the drive name in the "System Tray Safely Remove Hardware feature and eject media"</li><li>All folders of the external hard drive are still&nbsp;shown, even if I removed the USB cable of the disk.</li><li>Sometimes, the machine will not reboot if I restart.</li></ul>
<p>In Windows 7 Home Premium, I had no such issues, so I suspect it is not a controller issue.</p>
<p>Is this a Windows 8 issue that more people experience?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.<br />
<br />
I understand your concern regarding the issue that you are facing.
<p>
</p><div>
<p>Let's try the below methods and check if it helps to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><strong>Method 1: </strong>Try to boot the computer in <strong>Safe mode</strong> and see if the issue still persist.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Safe Mode is useful for troubleshooting problems with programs and drivers that might not start correctly or that might prevent Windows from starting correctly. Safe mode starts Windows with a limited set of files and drivers.<br />
Please refer below link on how to boot computer in safe mode.</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: To exit from safe mode, restart your computer and let the Windows start normally.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p><strong>Method 2: </strong><strong>Perform a Clean boot. </strong>Putting your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned
 below to perform a Clean Boot.</p>

<div><br />
<strong>Note</strong>: After troubleshooting, refer to this section "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting".

            Unfortunately neither of these made any difference. &nbsp;It is as though I have lost permission to delete the files on the SD card and also on my video camera. &nbsp;I can delete files that on on my hard drive. &nbsp;My pc is running extremely slowly now too (it wasn't
 that fast before Windows 10 !).

            They are open in File Explorer and I successfully copied them to my hard drive. &nbsp; When I highlight a file and press delete, &nbsp;nothing happens. &nbsp;The delete icon on the menu bar is greyed out and therefore don't work. &nbsp; It did work before I installed Windows
 10. &nbsp;I can delete from my hard drive. &nbsp;I also can't delete from my video camera, so think it is external files/devices.

            No security tab!! This is mind boggling... does Microsoft have new SD cards that are branded Microsoft and work with Microsoft 10 installations? ;)

            Been running into the same problem. was about to set up old computer to delete files when i noticed the sliding security lock on the side of the reader( the sd card that the mini fits in). i placed it in the other position and was able to delete the files.
 Hope this helps.

            Copy your data off the card and try formatting it. If that too throws an error then the card might have failed.

<h2>            Linx 10 v 64 problems</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>First time posting so im not sure how this works but really need some help. I hope its okay to post here, i saw other posts about Linx tablets here from a few years ago.</p>
<p>I have a&nbsp; Linx 10 tablet, v64 and its just under a year old. The past two months the usb and original keyboard case stopped working for no reason.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Recently i decided to reset my tablet to factory settings after trying a few things to fix it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Only now, its not working at all. I try to open microsoft edge and it closes before it even loads. I cant open any settings. I cant perform a hard reset. The keyboard and usb still dont work. Theres probably loads more wrong that i havent discovered yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any ideas, or is it just a broken tablet now?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help,</p>
<p>Laura</p>

            Hi Laura
<br />
<br />Your tablet is fine, Windows has just become corrupted, your best option is to just clean install Windows 10 on your tablet . . .
<br />
<br />When installing Windows 10, choose to install the 32bit version, not the 64bit version, that will result in a faster system and more space on the tablet
<br />
<br />You will need an 8GB flash drive, and depending on the connections on that tablet, you may need one of those flash drivers with the micro-USB connections to install Windows
<br />
<br />You can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10       
        </p>

            Hi Laura
<br />
<br />How do you charge the Linx tablet, if that port is not working, that device charges through a MicroUSB port?

            Hi Laura, no need to apologize, below is a sample of the type device you are looking for, which, when you get your tablet fixed, will also allow you to transfer data in and out of that tablet:
