<h2>            Windows 10 - Folder Size &#38; Position resets to last Open Folder</h2>
                    <p>I cannot find a setting in the Folder settings where I can set my folder size, type, position to be unique from other folders. When I close one folder and then open another the new folder inherits the same size and position of the last open folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to change this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The icon settings for each folder are saving properly. So if I want to see a list of files in one folder but have large icons in other folder there is no problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So this question is limited JUST to the size and position of the folder when its opened. Seems like XP had a setting where each folder could have its own unique position and size. Does Windows 10 have the same options? If not why not?</p>

<p>It has been this way since I activated the system. Folder is sized one way. I then close it. Next folder to open is sized the way as the folder I just closed instead of its last size. Not sure why this would need an image to help you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Its all about the folder inheriting the last known size and position of the folder that was last closed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want my folders to open to THEIR last known size and position. Not the one I just closed. Hope that makes sense.</p>

<p>I cant believe beta testers made no comment about this during the process of rolling out this latest build of Windows 10. Using the option to remember the last known folder position and size was a basic option in Windows XP. Why was it removed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply put its annoying as all get out. You open a folder and it opens with the same size and position as the last folder that was last closed OR if you dont close that folder then the next one opens in "Cascade" position below it instead of where it was
 closed last. The folders follow each other around the desktop like a faithful hound dog.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do like the Task View button on the Task Bar so that sort of makes up for it. Windows XP really needed something like that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But adding in this option to the Folder options would not be that hard. It was in XP. I never used Vista, 7 or 8 so I have no idea if they had it too. Such a shame to remove something like this that was so basic to Windows.</p>

    <title>WiFi turns off immediately after switching it on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> cfox912  say:</h3>
<h2>            WiFi turns off immediately after switching it on</h2>
                    <p>Anytime I try to switch my WiFi on in the bottom-right corner, it immediately turns itself back off again.&nbsp; I've updated, enabled and disabled, and reinstalled drivers, changed the power options to not be able to disable the driver, checked that the WLAN
 service and dependencies are set to run automatically and restarted them, restarted the computer, reseated the battery and rebooted.&nbsp; Ethernet works with no issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any idea why this keeps happening?&nbsp; I ran a ton of Windows updates the past couple of days, but I am unsure of whether that is the heart of the issue.</p>

<h2>            Why everything i install on Windows 8 marked as Read-only&#63;</h2>
                    I am currently having Windows 8 Pro and i am the only user on this PC.<br />
&nbsp;I want to ask why now everything i install into Program Files Folders for both x86 and x64 are in read-only mode? Or pretty much every single Folders on my system are on Read-only mode.<br />
&nbsp;I hate it when i want to copy something in a folder i will have to click on the "You have to have the administration permission to do this", it is just freaking annoying for a power user. Am i not an administrator or what?<br />
&nbsp;This never happens on Windows 7.<br />
Anyone?<br />

            <p><span>Hi Strike_Eagle,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your Query in Microsoft Community!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I understand that the program files install in the Windows 8 is read only.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>If you make changes to the program file folder or the Windows Folder in the root directory then it will prompt you for the administrator permission, i</span><span>t
 is because for the system safety. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Because making changes to the Windows folder in the root directory will result in the system instability.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>This may result in the no boot situation also.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>So it absolutely for system safety that it asks for administrator permission.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Hope the information was useful, if you need any technical assistance feel free to post. We will be glad to assist you.
<span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>

            <p>The issue seems to go further than just with installing programs. This weekend I did a clean install of Windows 8 on my C drive, and afterwards copied over backed-up files I had on my Win7 desktop to my new Win8 desktop. All of these files, now on my Win8
 desktop, are stuck in Read-Only mode. I go into Properties to change this, click Apply and OK, but the change doesn't stick - they revert back to Read-Only mode.</p>
<p>This is causing problems with some applications that read in and need to modify the data from those files.</p>

            Exactly what Bruce said. In Windows 7, even that the Program Files Folder is marked as read-only but it doesn't have trouble like what i have in Windows 8.<br />
&nbsp;I have a tool , which allow me to type in my language , which have it setting set in a .cfg file. If i move it into the Program Files folder, the setting i make when i interact with the Program won't be saved into the cfg and result in unchanged setting the
 next time i start it.<br />
&nbsp;If i move the application to other partition or somewhere else, it will save just fine.<br />
&nbsp;This could be the trouble for a lot of application/software that need access to files and rewrite them if necessary.
<br />
&nbsp;I have already tried to Take Ownership them and then untick the "read-only" mode in the folder setting but non of them works.<br />
&nbsp;I am not talking about editing files in Windows Folder (which i don't do everyday) , but files in Program Files folder, which i use everyday. I am also having trouble with the Python Tools (which i use for some programming stuffs) which i can't rewrite the
 old files if i put the installation folder in Program Files Folder.<br />
&nbsp;I know that Microsoft are concerned about users safety but don't you guys forget advanced users like us who know about what we are doing more than everybody else?<br />

            It gets worse... All my folders from Users and below are read-only.&nbsp; For some strange reason any Excel file I open will no longer run any of its macros. When I go to select the macros in the Excel ribbon, they don't even appear.&nbsp; Is there a security policy
 I need to set to remove the read-only status?<br />

            In regards to my previous reply... hengels on Devc 27, 2012.&nbsp; I was able to "fix" my issue as follows:&nbsp; My security settings in the files under the User directory root were previously set to include the CREATOR OWNER group.&nbsp; This group appeared to go missing
 after I upgraded to Windows 8 - don't know why although I suspect (hope) it was something i did as opposed to the Windows 8 upgrade.&nbsp; (After the upgrade I did change my settings to remove the Everyone group and may have inadvertantly removed CREATOR OWNER
 as well.) &nbsp; After updating all folder/files to include the CREATOR OWNER group, all my applications are working correctly again.&nbsp; All folders still show a READ ONLY status but this, as I discovered in other documentation, is correct.<br />
<br />
Hope this might help others... Cheers<br />

            I am sorry that i actually forgot about this.  I found the solution myself, a little bit pain in the ****, but it is a work-around.  In Program Files, everytime you installed a program, go to its folder and take ownership that folder, it won't ask you permission the next time you do anything in that folder anymore.  I know it is an unnecessary extra step but it is the only work around i have for now.  But seriously, Windows team will have to address this.

    <title>Failure of Brother Control Center 3 in Win7 x 64 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jim99w  say:</h3>
<h2>            Failure of Brother Control Center 3 in Win7 x 64</h2>
                    
<p>The 2009 forum discussed this problem, with no solution.</p>
<p>Here it is a year later, 2010, I'm using Windows 7 64 bit, brother printer mfc8660dn, USB connection, and I have the same failure of control center.&nbsp; Windows "printers and devices" will tell the printer to scan and receive the image, but will not send it
 to OCR, and is less convenient than the brother control center.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Brother help desk ran through all the options he knew, including altering the value data bit in the registry (entry "enableWIA") from 0 to 1, and gave up.&nbsp; I've installed, uninstalled, and reinstalled the 64-bit brother package<span>8870-INST-WIN7-A.EXE</span>
 with reboots, with no success.&nbsp; He says it's an OS problem, and I believe him.&nbsp; He says the regedit fix has worked on other customers with the same complaint, but not on mine.</p>
<p>Should I try the 32 bit software from brother?</p>
<p>Help</p>

<p><span><span>Hello jim99w,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>The only issue that the control center would have with the Operating System would be that the software compatibility.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest that you try the below methods to fix this issue.</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 1:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>I suggest that you run the ControlCenter3 Update Tool this tool, corrects the issue of being unable to scan on Windows® 7. Here is a link you can
 follow to download the update: </span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://welcome.solutions.brother.com/bsc/public/us/us/en/dlf/dlf/000000/003100/dlf003176.html?reg=us&amp;c=us&amp;lang=en&amp;prod=mfc9840cdw_all&amp;type2=2&amp;os=93&amp;flang=8&amp;dlid=dlf003176" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Click
 Here</span></a></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>Method 2:</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>There is a possibility that the Control Center software is incompatible with Windows 7. I suggest that you uninstall the software and install it
 in Windows 7 compatibility mode. You can follow the below article that will give you information on installing drivers in compatibility mode.</span></span></p>

            Well, the only thing left to try is a repair upgrade:

            Hello, try the below steps:
<br />First of all:
<br />Try re-registering Store and clearing cache:
<br /><a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8239-re-register-store-app-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/8239-re-reg...</a>

<br />If that doesn't help, make sure:
<br />You are not using a proxy server/3rd Party Firewall.
<br />The next step would be to disable metered connection if you have set so.
<br />Microsoft recently released Store improvements update for version 1709:
<br />KB4058043 
<br />If all of these doesn't help, try doing a repair install that keeps everything.

<p>I have an XBOX 360 Wireless Controller for Windows and my problem is that the LT RT buttons cancel each other out when pressed togheter because they`re used on the Z Axis instead of sending 2 different pieces of information making it impossible to use features
 as "Precision dribbling" in FIFA 16</p>

<p>That sounds a little strange. I'd first try uninstalling and reinstalling the drivers for the controller, and see if that helps things.</p>
<p>You can find the latest drivers here: <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/accessories/en-us/products/gaming/xbox-360-wireless-controller-for-windows/jr9-00011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
www.microsoft.com/.../jr9-00011</a></p>
<p>Just scroll down to the bottom, select the drivers that correspond to your version of Windows, and download.</p>
<p>Hope this helps!</p>

<h2>            Remote desktop causing &#34;Your PC will automatically restart in 1 minute&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I have recently upgraded my desktop and home theater computers to Windows 10. I have also upgraded the htpc to Windows 10 Pro so I can manage it using Remote Desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Within seconds of logging into the htpc using RDC I receive the message</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>Your PC will automatically restart in one minute, Windows ran into a problem and needs to restart, You should close this message now and save your work.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>on both the local and remote PCs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried a different local PC and experienced the same problem so I'm guessing it's something to do with the HTPC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have any problems using RDC with another Windows 10 Pro PC on my home network.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions please?</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This might be happening because of over-heating, failure of some hardware component, Windows Update issues or a Stop Error. Here are a few things you could try and see if it helps
 resolve your problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If it is a one-time message, it is fine. On restart, your PC should be fixed. But if your computer gets in a loop then you have a problem.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest you to enter into safe mode and follow the below steps.</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(80, 80, 80, 1)"><span>Start your PC in safe mode in Windows&nbsp;10</span></span></strong></p>

<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Safe mode starts Windows in a basic state, using a limited set of files and drivers. It can help you troubleshoot problems on your PC. For example,
 if the problem doesn't happen in safe mode, you'll know default settings and basic device drivers aren't causing the issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Now navigate to C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download folder and delete its contents. Restart you computer and see if the problem disappears.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            <p>I have been able to resolve this problem by giving the home theatre PC user a password!</p>
<p>
</p><p>No password: remote desktop client crashes (I suppose "you're PC will reboot in 1 minute" is better than the blue screen of death)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Password: no problem logging in remotely with remote desktop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've set the home theatre computer user to log in automatically on start up so we don't have to grab a keyboard to enter the password every time.</p>

            How is this fixed? Why does Windows 10 force a reboot when you log into a computer that does not have a log in password? Windows 8.1 and 7 did not. When will this be fix? Should I go back to Windows 7 to get back Remote Desktop?

<p>
The only solution which helps is to set a password for the user on the remote machine. Then it works reliably. As soon as you try to RDP with a user account with no password, the same thing happens - warning and abrupt restart.</p>
<p>
Anyway, I think this is bizarre behaviour - to abruptly shut down your computer just because you RDP with blank password. When the forced restart happens, it is really abrupt, no proper shutdown and closing programs. Bad glitch from Microsoft and strange that
 it hasn't been fixed yet.<br />

<h2>            Want to uninstall a program not listed in Programs and Features</h2>
                    I accidentally deleted a program from the Programs and Features list after uninstalling it. I've reinstalled it, but would like to uninstall it again (long story). However, it's not showing up in the list. How can I fix this? Is there a way to add it to
 the list?

            <p>Use Revouninstaller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can find Revo Uninstaller at <a href="http://www.revouninstaller.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.revouninstaller.com</a> (freeware). Here’s a quick look at how to use Revo uninstaller.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Launch Revo uninstaller after installing, select the program you want to uninstall or search for it using the built in search tool.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click the Uninstall button on the toolbar</p>
<p>
</p><p>This will start the uninstallation wizard for the particular program you selected. Revo uninstaller will go through a series of steps which include creating a system restore point, creating a backup of your Windows registry.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then analyze the program and run its default uninstaller, click Yes when you see the above dialog. After the uninstall is completed, you have a choice of scanning modes to select from. What this will do is let you scan for any left over files, folders and
 registry items from that particular program. Safe looks in the usual places, moderate in more advanced locations while Advanced does a thorough search throughout the entire computer. After selecting your choice, (I went with Advanced), click Scan.</p>
<p>After the scan is complete, you will see a list of registry entries left behind by the program, select them then click Finish to thoroughly remove the program from your system.</p>
<p>The default uninstaller should work for most persons, but for those troublesome programs, the Force Uninstall feature and advanced scanning options will give you more control.

<h2>            Skype &#40;v 8.16.0.4&#41; problem with display of contacts</h2>
                    <p>Hi. I recently updated and whilst I have zero problems with Skype connecting, displaying itself, chatting etc, I now find my list of contacts down the left side of the main 'page' of the client has changed and I'm not sure whether this is something from
 the new update or something I've inadvertantly done myself or what but where as before it displayed a round photo and name of the person, now for some odd, annoying reason, all I get is a round photo if they have one or just 2 initials - no names at all! Grrrr.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been through help and settings with a fine tooth comb but can't find out how to change this. It was like when you could display just those online or everyone and now everyone is shown regardless. There's another box you can open and sort which includes
 that but not for the contact list which is now seemingly unchangeable and it's SO annoying/frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone kindly advise please?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, Nick</p>

<h2>            SKYPE not running properly</h2>
                    <p>When i try to load Skype the app seems to be active but minimised on task bar but stays minimised no matter what I attempt to do it cannot run anymore, there was a recent MS update so maybe that's the culprit???<br />
What have you done to it Microsoft? It was fine as it was updating it has ruined it imo.
<br />
<br />
Btw the questions below are not relevant to my problem it's nothing to do with signing in, I'm already signed in.

            Which version of Windows 10 is currently installed? See how to verify:
<br />

<br />
<br />I recommend you go back to the classic version, since a lot of the functionality in Skype 8 is still maturing.
<br />
<br />Microsoft has listened to customer feedback and is allowing users who are comfortable with Skype Classic to continue use it for the foreseeable future until all the issues in Skype 8 are sorted out.
<br />
<br />The new Skype is very new and lacking certain features and functionality. You should file this as a bug report, remove Skype 8.25 then reinstall the classic version.
<br />
<br />Please follow the steps below on how to download the classic Skype.

<br />
<br />
<br />Skype is currently in a period of transition and I guess the idea is for Microsoft to invest in restoring functionality 'overtime' it needs to at least get everyone on the newer releases. Skype is being rebuilt from the ground up and this is to ensure features are cross platform (Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android) and are truly in sync when launched. 
<br />
<br />As you might know, engineering resources are always limited; especially to maintain two platforms. Microsoft's future is beyond win32 which classic Skype is built on. 
<br />
<br />Its just that its a rough transition that is under way. What I suspect will happen, starting September, we are gonna start seeing rapid updates with features available at least once or twice per week.

<h2>            Windows 8 stuck in bootloop after update</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows automatically updated on 20th February 2015 and since then it is stuck in a bootloop. I think it was trying to upgrade to Windows 8.1, I'm not very sure. When I power on the system, it just displays a black screen. No error messages are printed on
 the screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to boot into safe mode via F8, Shift+8, etc. But it didn't succeed. I tried to use a live usb to repair/refresh Windows, but it didn't work. I don't have any backups to restore.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried reinstalling windows on the same partition, but it threw an error saying that the partition is of type GPT and that it cannot install in it. I don't want to install Windows again in another partition. Please advise.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

    <title>Stuck waiting for host.. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> xkittyreckless  say:</h3>
<h2>            Stuck waiting for host..</h2>
                    
<p>OK, this has been going on since yesterday. Whenever I try and play a game it loads up like normal until I get in a lobby. It searches like it should until what I assume finds a match and then it holds up on waiting for host for a around 30 seconds before
 searching again. It will go on forever I guess because I leave and try again after about a minute. I've been playing for a month now and I never had this issue.&nbsp; It's always taken a few seconds to be placed in a match before. I already tried changing my NAT
 settings to open ( I was strict before with no problems) and it did not work. Idk what to do now.. I've searched for answers, but could not find much. I found a few topics posted by ppl who were experiencing similar problems and that's what made me change
 my NAT, but like I said it didn't fix it.</p>
<p>I used my 2 day trail from BO2 after my first gold expired , but re-subscribed for another month right after last Friday. Could that be causing the problem? That trial should expire tonight/ early tomorrow morning... Would that even cause this problem, though?
 I also pissed a few ppl off for not living up to their "skill" expectations. So idk if they reported me for not being a good player ( in my defense I was working on my gold **** shield and I am currently working on unlocking the gold RPG. Both weapons aren't
 exactly the most novice friendly in this game.) So am I like under investigation? Would that prevent me from playing? Plz any ideas of suggestions will help.</p>

<p>Just wait in the lobby, it should eventually find you a game. If the lobby empties, then maybe try another. This has nothing to do with your account (if you are Gold). AND dont worry about "skill".</p>

<p>I am Gold, but I've waited over five minutes in some lobbies and was never placed in a game or let alone with another living soul. Doesn't matter what mode I try both in regular multiplayer and in zombies. I'm forced to wait and wait... This is getting really
 annoying and like I said before, I would get placed within seconds! Even when the servers were laggy &nbsp;it never took over &nbsp;30 seconds to be placed and now I can't even connect with even a single person. &nbsp;Do you guys know if Xbox has a tech support &nbsp;line I can
 call? Because I'm kinda paying for a service I can't use here... &gt;_&lt;</p>

<p>I'm not sure what causes this, but this happens to me too - &amp; I usually play with a group, so it doesn't just affect you. However, if you wait long enough, it will find you a match. In the meantime, you can do any number of things: get a bite to eat, go
 to the bathroom, make small talk, or adjust your classes. It'll help keep yourself busy while you wait. ;D</p>

<p>I have had this proble too as of yesterday 1/15/13. I have never had this problem. I can play if i am with a friend but if I search alone it will test games and say waiting for host. This is rather annoying. Other games such as halo 4 work fine, I know its
 not my internet connection because a friend of mine runs the game on 1.5mg dsl and my connection is much better. I am not banned, as I said I can still play if im in a friends party. Its sad because I just really started to enjoy this game. Hope a fix comes
 soon.</p>

<p>&nbsp; I ran into this myself yesterday, but I wasnt waiting for host most of the time, I believe it was trying to force me as host..</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; I tried for about an hour off and on, and it didnt really seem to be searching. It would search for a couple seconds, then load the maps for a vote and said we need x more players. Occasionally someone would pop into the lobby and leave.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; I tried changing my search settings from best to normal, then to any. I tried at least a half dozen different game modes and kept checking to see if any friends were joinable. I tried rebooting my console.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; At one point I did get a "waiting for host" but after a few minutes i backed out, and managed to join up with a couple people on my fl. The one person, anty time I have joined them in the past I have had a decent connection, but this time I played most
 of the match with a red bar, and sometimes would bounce to 2 bar for a brief moment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; I also noticed, if it has any accuracy to it, the spinning globe on the search screen showed plaenty of people online in my area.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;After tha match I just gave up, and when I came back later in the evening it was all normal again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; A temporary issue, but I found it rather annoying at the time. i dont really have time to get on much lately. I finished up work knowing I had a couple hours of the house to myself and expected to take advantage of using the tv without "waiting my turn
 " ( which means after everyone goes to bed).. I wound up going back to work, and wasnt very happy about it.</p>

<p>It did the waiting thing pretty bad just before the first patch, but I havent noticed it too much since then.</p>

<p>Same problem here, with no change in sight. This is day 5 without anything happening. Soooo, any ideas on what to do differently? Already tried the NAT settings... And nothing. Thoughts?</p>

    <title>Windows 10 Developer Updates 1709 &#38; 1803 Installation Fail with - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 Developer Updates 1709 &#38; 1803 Installation Fail with Memory_Management error during a Restart</h2>
                    <p>MS persistently (daily) forced the download and attempted installation of the 1709 Developer update even though it tied up my laptop and the installation consistently failed at the same point for months. The frustration of not being able to stop this process
 until the problem was resolved made me assume that MS was going to force fit their update regardless of whether it worked or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I subsequently spent tens of hours with MS Support Engineers attempting to solve the installtion failure of the 1709 Developer Update to Windows 10 on my HP Laptop. After all diagnosis efforts failed, MS Support suggested that there was an HP firmware problem
 and referred me to HP. Ultimately HP had me reset to the factory setting Windows 8 (after I updated my backup).&nbsp; Then I proceeded to install Windows 10 again and reinstall a dozen apps plus restore all of my backed up data files just to get to the 1709 level.
 Then the 1803 Developer Update came out and the same Memory_Management error code installation failure occured at the same point on my new and different HP laptop.&nbsp; This lead me to suspect one of my apps. The most likely was an encryption product, DiskCryptor.
 I only used this product to encrypt my backup data on a memory stick. It never encrypted any data or system files on any partition on my hard drive.
<strong>However once I removed the DiskCryptor product from my system, the 1803 Creator Update installed cleanly.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate all the efforts of the MS Support Engineers who worked earnestly with me to solve the problem. However it seems to me that I could not be the only person or the first person to encounter this problem. I am replacing DiskCryptor with another
 encryption tool which I have tested with the 1803 update on another laptop to make sure it does not fail.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The cost of this failure in wasted hours spent by MS personnel and my own are significant. Worse, the problem was never resolved by any of these knowledgeable people. Something is clearly wrong with the diagnostic tools for this Windows update process when
 a problem as basic as an installed program (DC) could not be identified as the cause of the failure.
<strong>If MS is serious about this Windows Update process, then MS needs to invest in diagnostic code embedded in the update process that will provide MS Support Engineers with the ability to resolve basic conflicts.</strong> Hopefully this post will help
 someone else.</p>

            Thanks for heads up. Had the same issue with 1803. Removed DiskCryptor and update installed. Tried to reinstall, but DiskCryptor driver install was blocked. Had to get an old Win7 machine to read my discs and recreated encrypted drives with VeraCrypt.
 VeraCrypt doesn't seem to have these problems with Win10. Time to leave DiskCryptor behind.
