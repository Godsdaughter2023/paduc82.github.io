<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply Jannine. </p>
<p>
</p><p>BUT ... this is what is so insane about lousy software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I deal with your first bit of information which is how do I find the cost per minute to call various different countries &amp; I click on the link you gave which is 'calling &nbsp;rates' it takes me straight to the nightmare page I am already having nightmares
 about before you contacted me because it is the page I had previously spent ages on trying to find out to perform the magic trick to get it to give me per minute rates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It doesn't give those rates at all. Your information is wrong and misleading and pointless.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It looks as a though you just have to type in the name of the country to find out but when I do that it absolutely does NOT give per minute rates , it only gives monthly package rates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, to make ten brief five minute calls to ten different countries you would have to buy the monthly packages costing maybe about £6 each for each of the ten countries. What an expensive call each one would be, perhaps about one hundred times more expensive
 than it should be.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My figures are obviously wild guesswork as I don't have the per minute rates because your website is so horrible and awful and designed by entirely illiterate people I cant find the per minute rates at all - even when following your simple instruction.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This indicartes to me it is not even worth bothering with any other part of your post which I can only assume is a similar waste of time and I just can't cope with wasting even more time on utterly, utterly useless websites.</p>

<p>The bottom line in all this is that it is totally ridiculous that anyone (me in this instance) has to ask anyone the question "where can I find out how much per minute the phone rates are for Skype" because that information is deliberately hidden by the
 wickedly devious people selling the product simply because they are inherently dishonest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When a potential customer goes anywhere to buy a product (in this case a website selling a telephone service) it is always essential that the first thing the customer needs to know is what is the cost of the thing they might be buying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sellers of products who deviously try and obscure and confuse a customer about costs are simply being dishonest and crooked and ordinary decent people dislike dealing with crooks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is the reason lousy businesses eventually fail. I understand Skype has already lost millions of customers. They have certainly lost me and I don't think I could even use the service if it was handed to me free because I am already so utterly disgusted
 with my experiences with Skype.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The entire computer and software industry is deluding itself if it thinks it can continue to get away with the grotesque manipulation it inflicts on the ordinary end users of computers with completely manipulative, illiterate, nonsensical, incompetent and
 deliberately difficult to use software and extra-ordinarily badly designed web pages.</p>

 I go to Settings and all that's now available is Scan in Color. There's 5 other options that I should be able to click on, such as Resolution.&nbsp; And I need that.&nbsp; I thought, no problem, I'll just use WIA like before, plus the WIA window came up a lot faster
 than the HP one.&nbsp; Problem 2- In Elements, I can go to WIA but it says "NO WIA compatible devices were detected."&nbsp; What happened?&nbsp; I tried going into Control Panel, Scanners and Cameras, Add a d

<h2>            Widnows 10 bootup stuck after update</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update kb4056892 3rd Jan seems to have messed up boot on AMD64bit system running Windows 10 Pro r3 release 170928-1534 16299.192.&nbsp; Very helpful advice yesterday (thank you) was to uninstall this update, boot normally and install an improved fix kb4058258.&nbsp;
 Got as far as uninstalling the problem update. PC then went into Updating process for 3.5 hours before stopping at "PC ran into a Problem APC_INDEX_MISMATCH" and then powering itself down.&nbsp; Rebooted again and another 3.5 hours later got as far as loading program
 icons before freezing and running all night with some background process.&nbsp; 9 hours later, it had powered itself down again.&nbsp; Don't know what terminal screen it showed as asleep by then.&nbsp; Rebooted today and back to a loop at the Windows symbol.&nbsp; Can only get
 some functionality back by crashing it three times to get into Safe Mode.&nbsp; Cannot install kb4058258 from within Safe Mode so stuck.&nbsp; Help please.&nbsp; I might die before resolved at this rate.</p>

<p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Driver issues, faulty hardware or incorrect software installation can be the reasons why this occurred. We suggest unplugging unnecessary external hardware or device (e.g. printer, webcams, additional
 monitors, etc.), then perform a <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
clean boot</a>. This will start Windows using a minimal set of drivers. This is performed to determine what conflict is causing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(29, 33, 41, 1)"><strong>Note</strong>: Please go through the section:
</span><span>Reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting
</span><span style="color: rgba(29, 33, 41, 1)">of the article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the issue.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to update us with the result.</p>

<p>Thanks for this suggestion, Rachelle</p>
<p>
</p><p>I haven't found out how to perform a clean boot from Safe Mode, which is the only boot I can achieve.&nbsp; I found a Clean Boot article on MS website.&nbsp; It says "If the issue you are having prevents you from booting into Windows, you won't be able to follow the
 steps in this article".&nbsp; Is there a way of Clean Booting from a command prompt, or some other method?</p>
<p>
</p><p>My problem started with Update 1709 which messed up my AMD64 PC.&nbsp; An earlier suggestion was to uninstall this Update and substitute a de-bugged version issued by MS a few days later.&nbsp; I was halfway through this process (Uninstalled 1709) when my machine
 ran into problems, taking all night to reboot after uninstalling before turning itself off.&nbsp; After a few days off it is still showing the same boot-up problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am now without the buggy 1709 update, but have not installed the improved version as I have not yet achieved Normal functionality as a solid starting point.&nbsp; I have tried going back to restore points but not helped.&nbsp; It gets as far as Windows starting,
 getting past the login up to populating the Desktop screen with icons, then everything freezes.&nbsp; Perpetual spinning dots, no mouse, no keyboard.&nbsp; The only way I have found of getting some functionality is to power off boot-up 3x to force it into Diagnostic
 Mode. From that (all other diagnostic options having failed) I am left with restarting in Safe Mode With Networking.&nbsp; No printer, no sound, no document layouts - due the lack of drivers I guess.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows was pre-installed and I don't have an installation disc, but I do have the serial number on the case.&nbsp; I can't make an installation disk from MS website while in Safe Mode, the screen tells me.&nbsp; Update Troubleshooter fails, again because I am in
 Safe Mode, I think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd be grateful for any suggestions.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you or anyone else who can help</p>
<p>
</p><p>Richard</p>

<p>Hi Richard,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your concern regarding the device going into a boot loop error after the update may indicate corrupted update components which interfere with the boot process. To fix the boot error, we suggest that you supersede the faulty update with a patch provided by
 Microsoft. To do this, follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>From the startup repair screen, boot the device into Safe mode with networking.
<em><strong>Troubleshoot</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced</strong> <strong>options</strong> &gt;
<strong>Startup</strong> <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; Press <strong>F5</strong> <strong>
Enable</strong> <strong>Safe</strong> <strong>Mode</strong> <strong>with</strong>
<strong>Networking</strong>.</em><br />
</li><li>Download and install the compatible patch to your device. Click the link below and press the
<em><strong>Download</strong></em> button.<br />
<a href="https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=kb4073291" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">For 32-bit system: Download KB4073291</a><br />
<a href="https://www.catalog.update.microsoft.com/Search.aspx?q=KB4073290" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">For 64-bit system: Download KB4073290</a></li><li>Run the patch and restart the device if prompted.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once you've successfully installed the patch, check if the device will boot properly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll appreciate if you can send us an update.</p>

<p>Thanks for the suggestion.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Downloaded the Update you suggest, but when I click on the file the Windows Standalone Installer starts then puts up "error message 0x8007043C . The service cannot be started in Safe Mode."&nbsp;&nbsp; While typing this reply the Installer has started again twice
 without my intervention, but stopped again with the same message.&nbsp; Is there another way to run the Installer?&nbsp; Thakks for your advice.</p>

<p>We appreciate the prompt response. Our next step is to first fix the boot error and install the manual update in the normal boot/mode. To do this, we suggest that you perform the startup repair. Here the steps on how to perform the repair:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>From the startup repair screen, boot the device into Safe mode with networking.
<em><strong>Troubleshoot</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced </strong><strong>options</strong>.</em></li><li>Under the <em><strong>Advanced options</strong></em> screen, select <strong><em>Startup
</em></strong><strong><em>repair</em></strong>.</li><li>Wait for the process to complete, and check if the device will boot properly.</li><li>If yes, manually install the appropriate update by following the steps provided in the previous post.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Keep us posted with the result of the startup repair.</p>

to add to my annoyance, the mouse cursor is now unstable, trembling and jumping about.&nbsp; May be an unrelated issue but still annoying and inconvenient, and opportunity to install updates or new driver is limited by being confined to Safe Mode.&nbsp;

            Thanks for this.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
Not gone all the way as hit a difference from the instructions. Found WinSxS/Properties/Edit, but the Add and Remove tabs are greyed out so I cannot add Everyone.&nbsp; The box lists apps/users:&nbsp; All application packages, All restricted application packages, System,
 Administrators (Mesh 11-01\Administrators), Users (Mesh 11-01\Users), Trusted Installer.&nbsp; Mesh 11-01 refers to the make of PC.&nbsp; All the boxes are checked for Trusted Installer except the last one Special Permissions.&nbsp; I've also looked at the Advanced tab.&nbsp;
 This shows three headings Permissions, Auditing and Effective Access.&nbsp; The Permission tab shows the same users/apps, with Trusted Installer being allowed Full Control.&nbsp; Is Trusted Installer/Full Control equivalent to your Everybody, or is there a way to turn
 on the Add feature? <br />
<br />
I'm grateful for your help but would like to resolve asap, please, as I need to print something, which means I need to get all the drivers working.<br />
<br />
Thanks again.<br />
<br />

<p>We appreciate the comprehensive response. If the option is greyed out, its possible that you don't have a full permission to edit the folder. To confirm this, open the WinSxS folder by following the folder path in the previous, then locate and delete the
 pending.xml file. The file should be deleted if you have folder permission. If so, restart the device and check if the issue persist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, start the device again in Safe mode and then follow the methods below:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Temporarily disable any Startup items</strong> to rule out any software conflict issues. To do this follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Ctrl</strong> + <strong>Shift</strong> + <strong>Esc</strong> keys to open
<strong>Task Manger</strong>.</li><li>Click the <strong>Startup</strong> tab.</li><li>Right click on the <strong>Startup items </strong>and select <strong>Disable</strong>. Do this for all the applications.
</li><li>Close <strong>Task Manager</strong> and restart the device.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Update device drivers</strong>. If the provided steps didn't suffice, our next step is to check for any driver related issues. To do this, enter
<strong>Safe</strong> mode then follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Type <em><strong>Device Manager</strong></em> in the search box and press <strong>
Enter</strong>.</li><li>Expand each adapter by clicking the drop-down arrow and check if there's a device with a yellow bang (triangle) next to it.</li><li>If yes, update the driver by following the steps provided on this <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4028443/windows-update-drivers-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support article</a></strong>.

<p>No change, I'm afraid.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Couldn't find a pending_xml file in winSys either by looking carefully or using the the file search box.</p>
<p>Disabled all StartUp programs</p>
<p>Checked device drivers.&nbsp;&nbsp; All drivers tested as latest already installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nothing has made any change to the bootup problem.&nbsp; Still having to get into Safe Mode to use the machine, with its limitations.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I noticed that there are over 56,000 files in WinSys, a good proportion of which are AMD..... files.&nbsp; Presumably that's what drives the AMD chipset, and thus where the MS Update has messed up?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>In which case if we could get into that file we would be in the right place.&nbsp; That would take us back to the method you suggested earlier if only we could find out how to activate the "Add" box.&nbsp; If there is a way to do this then that would get us back on
 track, but if this is difficult or impossible is it possible to rename the Permission for Trusted Installer and masquerade as Everyone?&nbsp; Looking under Advanced Permissions, Trusted Installer has permissions for Full Control&nbsp; and Take Ownership along with 12
 other capabilities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you are not despairing as much as me.&nbsp; Very frustrating.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your advice</p>

    <title>Windows 7, BSOD on boot, error code&#58; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hallowyr  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 7, BSOD on boot, error code&#58; 0x0000007B&#40;0xFFFFF880009A9928, 0xFFFFFFFFC0000034, 0x0, 0x0&#41;</h2>
                    Hey everyone. Today I tried booting my computer, only to have it freeze and go into a BSOD during the Windows Startup animation.
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>The BSOD is as follows:</b></div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>A problem has been detected and windows has been shut down to prevent damage to your computer. Etc. etc.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Technical Information:</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>*** STOP: 0x0000007B (0xFFFFF880009A9928, 0xFFFFFFFFC0000034, 0x0, 0x0)</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>After spending 4 hours googling I understand that it's an issue with my primary hard drive (A 80GB Intel SSD) as it boots fine on my second hard drive that has Windows 8 installed. However BIOS detects the drive just fine.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><b>Solutions that I have tried but did not work:</b></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Check that the SSD is properly connected, change SATA Ports</li><li>Windows Startup repair, which fails with the following details:</li></ul>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>(Excuse the slightly hackish translation, my OS isnt in English)</div>
<div>Name of problemoccurence: StartupRepairOffline</div>
<div>Problemsignature 01: 6.1.7600.16385</div>
<div>Problemsignature 02: 6.1.7600.16385</div>
<div>Problemsignature 03: unknown</div>

<div>OS-Version: 6.1.7600.2.0.0.256.1</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Running the various BCD commands, RebuildBcd tells me that it detects 0 Windows installations.</li><li>Run Startup repair from a Windows 7 installation flash, same as when doing it from the boot menu.</li><li>Set the correct drive and partition to active using the command prompt and then running startup repair, same error.</li><li>Restore to my earliest restore point (2 days ago, when the machine was working just fine), the first time I tried this it failed but then worked the second time.</li><li>Running last working configuration, BSOD and crash still happens.</li><li>Change the Harddrive from IDE to RAID and AHSI just in case, neither worked.</li><li>Played around with the boot order to be safe</li><li>Tried doing a regedit thing described in HugoCore's post in this thread:&nbsp;http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en/w7itprogeneral/thread/19c703a4-f52a-4b90-8a8c-fd80cbaf9c7a but on step 12 I found no such keys</li><li>Nor can I boot up in safe mode, there it hangs on&nbsp;<span>CLASSPNP.SYS whic
 to which it responded that it could not find that filepath.</span></li></ul>
<div>Which means I've officially ran out of things to try (at least as far as I can find on Google and what I can think of myself).</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Does anyone know how to deal with this?</div>

            Okay I fixed it myself! Changing the Storage Configuration in BIOS to RAID solved it, which is odd since none of my hard drives use RAID in the first place.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
That is an unusual fix since there is no RAID. Check with Intel Support and Forums as<br />
there may be an issue with the SSD.<br />
<br />
Intel - Support - Community and Forums<br />

<br />
Definitely check for firmware updates at Intel.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

            The Issue I had was related to the RAID issue.. but.. it was actually the Motherboard battery defaulting to the Wrong Hard Drive settings.. replace the battery .. reset the BIOS date and Time , changed the Drive setting from RAID to AHCI and booted right
 up. No BSOD..

<h2>            Windows 10 unable to connect to PEAP network</h2>
                    <p>Since upgrading to windows 10 from windows 7 I have lost the ability to connect to a PEAP network. I click connect then enter my username and password at the prompt.&nbsp;</p>

<p>

<p>
</p><p>Wep and wpa 2 authentication work fine. Its only the Peap network that's giving me issues. I have coworkers also running windows 10 and they have no problems with the wifi so I don't think its a certificate issue. I'm willing to entertain any solution. Is
 there an aftermarket wireless manager for windows 10?</p>

    <title>MTP USB Driver Error from Windows 8.1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jasejohn  say:</h3>
<h2>            MTP USB Driver Error from Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hey Folks,</p>
<p>I am at the end of my line .... I have tried everything that I can find and nothing seems to work.</p>
<p>I have a HP Laptop and have updated (through prompt) to the Windows 8.1 version. I have always previously had no problems simply plugging my iPhone 5s into the USB port on the side and it is recognised - first thing is usually to ask/prompt me to upload
 any fresh photos to my laptop. It is also always recognised in iTunes as well as in File Explorer in Windows.</p>
<p>Since the last update, my iPhone no longer exists. When I try to upload images in Windows Photos, I am told "there is no device found". If I look on File Explorer, my iPhone does not appear anywhere. If I open iTunes, it recognises that my iPhone is connected
 and charging, however I can not manipulate music or anything through there. I have also plugged in different phones and they're also not recognised.</p>
<p>I have followed a million steps online to fix this problem. I have twice now deleted all of the Apple associated programs (as instructed) and reinstalled iTunes. I have reinstalled the MTP USB Driver so many times, however now find an online suggestion that
 is would make no difference, as if it is a driver malfunction that Windows will simply be reinstalling the same faulty driver.</p>
<p>When I look on Device Manager, under Portable Devices, MTP USB Device is there, however with a yellow exclamation mark on it. When I right click and look at Properties, the box in General says "This device is not working properly because Windows cannot load
 the drivers required for this device. (Code 31). Insufficient system resources exist to complete the API.".</p>
<p>Someone must have a solution for this. I just don't understand how everything can work fine and then all of a sudden my phone no longer exists.</p>
<p>CAN SOMEONE/ANYONE HELP ME!!!!</p>

<p>
</p><p><span>To fix this problem, use the following methods in the order in which they are listed. After each method, check if problem is fixed. If the problem is not fixed, try the next method.

<p>
</p><p>

<p><span>d. Expand <strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>e. Right-click every device under the <strong>Universal Serial Bus controllers</strong> node, and then click
<strong>Uninstall</strong> to remove them one at a time.</span></p>
<p><span>f. Restart the computer, and then reinstall the USB controllers.</span></p>
<p><span>g. Plug in the removable USB storage device, and then test to make sure that the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span>If issue persist, proceed to next method. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2</strong>: I would like you to go to the computer manufacturer’s website to download the updated chipset drivers and install them.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Download and install drivers</span></strong></p>

<p>I've no idea if this will help you but if Windows 10 Pro came pre-installed then the key is in the bios.</p>
<p>Open PowerShell (Admin) and enter&nbsp;<strong>wmic path SoftwareLicensingService get OA3xOriginalProductKey</strong> and press return. This should display the key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Either try entering this key into Change product key or read though these instructions to see if it helps.</p>

<p>
</p><p>edit: just another thought, do the Dell devices come with Windows 10 Pro Single Language (if there is such a thing for the Pro edition) and is that the edition you image.?</p>

We found a Windows 10 Pro digital license for this device running Windows 10 Pro. To activate using this digital license, you need to install Windows 10 Pro.</p>

<p>Yes thanks for the link. I did the first one (reset licensing status) same issue. I noticed something odd though.<br />
When I get the product key via powershell, the last set of digits is JFG6P. After I re-enter the entire string and it fails activation, the product key in the activation windows ends with "WFG6P" so some where is an incorrect product key.</p>

            I would say what you have in the bios is correct. That is what the device would have been activated with originally.

            I let the device sit over night. When I got in this morning it was activated with the key that ended in JFG6P. I guess after imaging a device I'll have to just let it sit to see if it activates eventually?

<h2>            Trying to return a faulty XBOX ONE S to get fixed</h2>
                    <p>Hi There,&nbsp;</p>
<p>I bought an Xbox One S for my son for Christmas. I bought it from a shop in Cyprus.</p>
<p>The video signal is not displaying in 1080 even though it did in the beginning and also the joystick on the gamepad is broke.</p>
<p>I took the Xbox 100 miles back to the shop I bought it from and they said they do not do service for Microsoft and gave me a form with instructions of what to do.</p>
<p>So I registered my Xbox One S, I got a Service number but no instructions on how to print the label to send the xbox to Microsoft.</p>
<p>I called the number of the form they gave me which is all in Greek with no English options.</p>
<p>So I had to drive 30 minutes away to get my friend who was in work to call the number and try to find out how and where we send the Xbox too. After 45 minutes of him going through the telephone options, he told us that it had not gone through properly and
 I need a new service number. He then said someone would call me to arrange for the pick up of the Xbox however no one has.</p>
<p>I have tried to login to my account to see the status and it just says waiting for a support person to call me.</p>
<p>I cannot keep driving to my friends work place and spending hours of his time trying to call a support number that has no English options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If I knew I would not get support from the shop I bought it from then I would have never of bought it in the first place.</p>
<p>The support and process from Microsoft is absolutely terrible.</p>
<p>How can Microsoft get away with this? Not everyone has 350 Euros to spend on their sons Christmas present and get this in return.</p>
<p>PLEASE MICROSOFT! I am begging you to try and redeem yourselves and help me get what I paid for.</p>
<p>Paul In Cyprus!</p>
<p>""" Even as I am posting this it does not give me the option of Games Consoles or XBOX One. *** I am crying with laughter in pain!<br />

<p>Alphabet(Google) has no issues with Microsoft … is your version up to date ? You can stay with Edge just changing the search engine using Google instead of Bing if you like hitting the three buttons at top right of the menu bar, settings/advanced and scroll
 down to address bar search … Bing works well but you can choose other providers.</p>

<p>I recently installed a video game (The Witcher) to my computer that also installed Tages drivers (some anti-piracy software).&nbsp; I am running Windows 7 Professional 64bit.&nbsp; The game does not run on a 64bit operating system.&nbsp; I have uninstalled the game but
 whenever I start Windows I get an error message saying that the Tages driver is blocked due to compatibility issues.&nbsp; The Tages software does not show up in Programs and Features or in the drivers list in the device manager (I also tried changing the view
 to show unused drivers and it still doesn't show).&nbsp; I want to remove this driver.</p>

<p>This is a known bug with a fix.&nbsp; It's been a long time since I played the game and visited the forum so I don't exactly remember the details.&nbsp; But I run Windows 7 Ultimate 64 and the game runs fine.&nbsp; I also can confirm that it runs fine on Vista Ultimate
 64.&nbsp; Go to the official The Witchers forum to check for a solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>http://tw1.thewitcher.com/forum/index.php?board=14.0</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's the question I asked regarding the proper order of installation to play the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>http://tw1.thewitcher.com/forum/index.php?topic=30402.msg5444714#msg5444714</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you can see, you are supposed to remove Tages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See here for more info.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>http://witcher.wikia.com/wiki/1.5_patch#Download_links_.28Patch_1.4_.E2.86.92_Patch_1.5.29</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Alternately, you can go here to remove Tages.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does the system error bar you from operating the system properly?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I hope this helped.&nbsp; :)</p>

<h2>            Everything stops with &#34;Not Responding&#34; and then goes - why&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Lately, I've been&nbsp;receiving the (Not responding) message in open window title bars.</p>
<p>After the window freezes, and if I wait 3 minutes or so, it starts up where I left off, plus any buffered keypresses and/or mouse clicks.</p>
<p>This is happening to any software I run. Especially, IE and Windows Explorer.</p>
<p>I might have 3 or 4 windows open, clicking, and I'm typing and working away when suddenly, a window will freeze. If&nbsp;I click on the title bar, the (not responding) will apear. If I click again, it fades to about 50%. Other window may, or may not work. Sometimes,
 everything except the mouse is frozen - not task bar, nothing.</p>
<p>Whatever I clicked on previously, and/or a few keystokes I typed before&nbsp;realizing it's frozen, those will activate when the programs (1, 2 or however many were open and froze) - they catch up.The open programs continue on normally, as if they never seized.</p>
<p>If I click more than once on a (not reponding) window, everything freezes, including the second hand on the sidebar clock. When Windows decides to hand back the computer, even the clock hands spin wildy and catch up to the right time.</p>
<p>This is most annoying as you can imagine.</p>
<p>I have run Spybot, MalwareBytes, AVG (pro version), disabled just about everything in&nbsp;the startup - all except those I checked&nbsp;up on&nbsp;and are normal - no malware, Trojans, or viruses. Rebooted so many times, the reboot key is wearing down :)</p>
<p>I have two terabytes of drives and the boot drive, 320 gigs with about 50 gig free. I can't afford to re-format, re-install, and re-build from scratch.</p>
<p>I just checked, and even the reliabilty and Performance monitor froze with (not responding).</p>
<p>Could this be a RAM chip failure? CPU dying???</p>
<p><strong>Extra info:</strong></p>
<p>CPU 1 Temp = 109.4 F Usage = 4%<br />
CPU 2 Temp = 105.9 F Usage = 15%<br />
GPU Temp = 164.5 F</p>
<p>Of course these fluctuate but are wihin a degree or two.</p>
<p>This is a 2 year old computer with 4 Gig RAM, 2.4Ghz Dual core Processors. It had been runing just fine. Then this began a couple of weeks ago, maybe right after I upgraded&nbsp;from &nbsp;IE 7 to IE 8 (I wish there was an easy rollback to - oh IE5 or 6 even 7!)</p>
<p>Ideas? Will entertain using a .38 or .45 special on it :)</p>
<p>S.</p>

            </span>
            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p><span><span>I'm not sure about those temperatures - the GPU seems a bit high&nbsp;but I'm not certain what is normal for that particular device.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Do you know when this problem began?&nbsp; Try a System Restore to a point in time<strong>BEFORE</strong> the problem began.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:
</span></span><a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/windows-vista/using-windows-vista-system-restore/</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Be sure to check the box to show more than 5 days of restore points.&nbsp; If the first attempt fails, then try an earlier point or two.&nbsp; NOTE: You will have to re-install any software and updates you installed between now and the restore point, but you can use
 Windows Update for the updates.<span>&nbsp; </span>Use the recovery disk if the system prompt doesn’t work. The recovery disk works a bit different from the above procedures but if you follow the prompts from the System Restore menu option with the above
 information you should be able to restore with no problems.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the System Restore doesn't work (or you don't have a restore point or know when it started), do a Startup Repair by booting to the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk
 (or one you can borrow from ANYONE) or from a Recovery Disk.&nbsp; Here's the procedure:</span></span><a href="http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/tutorials/tutorial148.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 To boot to the CD you may need to change the BIOS to make the CD-drive first in the boot sequence.&nbsp; To do that, wait for the screen that tells you the F key to push to access the boot menu or boot setup.&nbsp; Push it quickly. Make the changes, save your work,
 and exit.&nbsp; Put the CD in the drive and reboot.&nbsp; When prompted, push any key to boot from the CD.<br />
<br />
If you don't have either disk, you can make a bootable Recovery Disk using </span>
</span><a href="http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://neosmart.net/blog/2008/windows-vista-recovery-disc-download/</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;along
 with burning software like: </span></span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD (perhaps made on a different computer or perhaps in safe mode with networking if that is working).<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking).&nbsp; Then let's check some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if
 there is such corruption post back here or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using</span></span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will want to schedule itself to run at the next restart.&nbsp;&nbsp; Answer yes and then reboot to run the program.&nbsp;
 It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning&nbsp;shutdown or freezing (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools / Event
 Viewer).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer: </span></span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Look in the System and Application sections.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be infected with malware. Try to run anti-malware programs (in safe mode with networking if<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">necessary</span>).&nbsp;To fix this problem
 (if it is a problem) download,&nbsp;install, and run the following two programs:</span></span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php</span></span></a><span><span>&nbsp;and</span></span><a href="http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.safer-networking.org/en/index.html</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 You may also want to try a free trial of Pandasoft (</span></span><a href="http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.pandasecurity.com/usa/homeusers/solutions/global-protection/</span></span></a><span><span>).&nbsp;
 Before downloading pandasoft, uninstall whatever anti-virus program you are currently using (because installing and running two at the same time can cause conflicts, freezes, and all sorts of problems).&nbsp; Once you've uninstalled your current AV program, download,
 install, update, and scan using Pandasoft.&nbsp; I think you might be amazed at how much it finds that the other software missed.&nbsp; Once complete, uninstall pandasoft and re-install your current AV program (unless you decide to switch which I did when I first tried
 it about 4 years ago).&nbsp; You may also want to&nbsp;try the new, free Microsoft Security Essentials</span></span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/Microsoft-Security-Essentials-Download-131683.html</span></span></a><span><span>
 (with the same caveat that only ONE AV program can be installed and running on your system at any one time). &nbsp;You may also want to try the free Avira at:</span></span><a href="http://www.free-av.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.free-av.com/</span></span></a><span><span>
 and Avast at: </span></span><a href="http://www.avast.com/index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.avast.com/index</span></span></a><span><span>.
 &nbsp;Reboot after completing all the scans.&nbsp; You may also want to try the free OneCare at</span></span><a href="http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/whatsnew.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://onecare.live.com/site/en-us/center/whatsnew.htm</span></span></a><span><span>
 and let it run all the options (except the registry cleaner) because that’s good maintenance (it will take some time to complete but can be done in the background).</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If that doesn't work, try a clean boot&nbsp;</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a><span>.&nbsp;
 If the problem goes away then it's just a matter of tracking down the culprit causing the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; Follow the procedures in the article.&nbsp; Once found, delete, remove, deactivate, or uninstall it.&nbsp; Once done be sure to reset Vista back to normal status as
 explained in the procedures. If the problem occurs in clean mode then just restore the system to normal status and reboot - this solution is not going to work.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Boot into Safe mode with networking and see if the problem occurs there.&nbsp; Either result helps us narrow down the search for the cause.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You may be having troubles with your device drivers, firmware, and/or software.&nbsp;</span><span>Go to Device Manager by going to start / search
 box and type device manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each
 for further details and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (and you should do any you have time to do - they may help in ways beyond just resolving this problem), do so from the computer vendor or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp;
 In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a><span><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span></span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></span></a><span><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:</span></span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></span></a><span><span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Let's test your hard drive and RAM for hardware problems:</span></span></p>
<p><span>To test your hard drive, check the manufacturer and then get the diagnostic utility from:</span><span><a href="http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.techsupportforum.com/hardware-support/hard-drive-support/302602-hard-drive-diagnostic-utilities.html</span></span></a></span><span>
 (and/or get one from your hard drive or computer manufacturer if they have one available – it wouldn’t hurt to try both).&nbsp; If it fails the test, replace it.&nbsp; If it passes the test, then there's probably nothing wrong with it.<br />
<br />
You can also test your RAM at </span><span><a href="http://www.memtest.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.memtest.org/</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 If it fails, test each chip individually to find those that are bad and replace them.&nbsp; If it passes, RAM is probably OK.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, we'll need to do a system repair/upgrade using the genuine Windows Vista Installation Disk (one you own or one you can borrow from ANYONE).&nbsp; To do this you have to also be able to boot normally.<span>&nbsp;</span>Here's the procedure:

 Although this will not affect your data, settings, or programs, you should still backup your data before starting just to be on the safe side. You may have a lot of updates to re-install (including any service packs you had to remove).&nbsp; If the version on the
 system came with SP1 or SP2 pre-installed and the disk is an earlier version, then you'll need to make a slipstream disk as follows:</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/151606-vista-sp1-slipstream-installation-dvd.html</span></span></a></span><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Hopefully one of these options will at least identify if not resolve the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

    <title>can i add wav files to the WMP12 library&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            can i add wav files to the WMP12 library&#63;</h2>
                    I have spent years building up a music library in Windows Media Player, and avoided moving with fashion to iPlayer or whatever the flavour of the month is. Now I want to upgrade the quality of my music and I have been buying 4608 kbps .wav files. I can
 play them in WMP12, but I can't add them to the library. Do I have to change to another player after all of these years?

1. What happens when you try to add the file in the library?<br />
2. Did you get any error message?<br />

<p>I think it could work.</p>
<p>the controllers use wifi direct</p>
<p>(Wi-Fi Direct devices can reach each other at a maximum distance of 656 feet (more than two football fields) away. So, practically, even if it is half of that, it would connect all your devices across home, no matter how big is your place.</p>

<p>you would need an HDMI splitter. from the xbox output and then 1 cable into each TV, would also need some very long HDMI cables and have to run it in walls to make it look clean. you can buy HDMI wall plates and hook the wires form the splitter through the
 wall into the wall plate behind your TV to make it clean then just connect another HDMI cable from the wall plate to the TV.</p>

<p>The range on the X1 controller is about the same as the 360's maybe a half a meter less than a 360 tbh. I know this because when I stand outside to have a smoke, I can stand and still see the TV to play. lol must be about 30ft...ish.</p>

<p>My XB1 controllers' wireless&nbsp;connections barely make it through the kitchen (which is the very next room and ~30 ft. away) before completely sputtering out, so I doubt the OP would get the kind of ranges that Up is talking about unless you had some way to
 enhance the wireless signal, which is doubtful. You're better off just plugging it in, and doing that for 3 separate rooms at the same time for a single console? Not really feasible or practical if you ask me.</p>

<p>@Goatsnatcher, lol, i have also taken my 360 outside to smoke and played through a window.
</p>
<p>but it feels like the X1 controller does not handle going through walls as well as my 360 controllers, because when i took my X1 controller outside so i could continue a conversation with my friend, i was not more than 10 feet away on the other side of a
 exterior wall and the audio would intermittently become super choppy.</p>
<p>but if the OP is trying to connect one X1 to 3 TV's in 3 rooms, could be doable, it would be a pain, i'd imagine that HDMI cables can't be that long, or setting up some sort of media server like LinuxMCE.</p>
<p>...if the corners of the 3 room converge in one spot... maybe bust out that corner opening up a section of the wall and build a big lazy Suzanne and then you can just spin it around to whatever room you're in ;)</p>

<p>@Zero. Yep, you are spot on with the wall issue, I also found while talking to a friend the chat would cut out if I went through to grab a drink. So yes, wall's or maybe wiring? in the walls does not agree with the X1 controllers to much.</p>
<p>As far as long hdmi cables? Not sure of maximum length tbh. I did a quick search but never found a good answer. I did read 25ft and after that length there is no guarantee, but then I also read about people struggling with cable over 15ft with audio/visual
 equipment. I'm sure there is an exact answer somewhere..... I couldn't find it though lol.</p>

            <p>Yes, you can switching them around, you will have to reinstall though, there is no in place upgrade path from either 32 to 64 bit or vice versa.

<h2>            I need a operating system for my new computer, if I Buy Windows 7 Home Premium SP1 will that work, or is it an update&#63;</h2>
                    I have just ordered a new computer, however it comes with no operating system. I want to use windows 7 as my operating system. I was unsure if Windows 7 Home Premium SP1, worked as an operating system on it's own (without needing any previous window installed
 on my PC?&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>If not, it would be most helpful to point me in the right direction, to find a windows 7 os for my computer which is hopefully not to&nbsp;expensive.&nbsp;</div>

<br />
<br />
You can buy a Full version of Windows 7 Home Premium with SP1 - yes it will work and that is what you need for your computer.<br />
<br />
When you buy Windows 7 Home Premium with SP1 it includes Windows 7 plus the Service Pack 1 update - so you will have the complete Windows 7 operating system.<br />

    <title>Why does does Win 8.1 constantly freeze up&#63;. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ednalittle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why does does Win 8.1 constantly freeze up&#63;.</h2>
                    I have a year-old Dell laptop, 64-bit. IE 10 and Win 8.1 came loaded on computer. Win 8.1 is constantly freezing up, for no apparent reason; even the keyboard freezes up. I lose whatever I was working on; I cannot even save it to Notepad. I have to completely
 shut down and reboot in order to "unfreeze" it. It happens most often if I am on Yahoo, if that makes any difference. I never had this problem with Win 7. I do NOT want to update to Win 10.&nbsp; I called the 800 no. for MS Support, and they wanted to charge me
 before they would even talk with me about it.

<div>
<p>If SFC could not fix something, then run the command again to see if it may be able to the next time. Sometimes it may take running the
<strong>sfc /scannow</strong> command 3 times restarting the PC after each time to completely fix everything that it's able to.

<br />
If not, then run the <a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/26512-dism-fixing-component-store-corruption-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

 repeat doing a System Restore until you find a older restore point that may work.
<br />
<br />
If still not, then you can use the steps in the TIP box in the <strong>OPTION THREE</strong> section&nbsp;to manually replace the files that SFC could not fix.
