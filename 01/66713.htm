    <title>Latest Windows 10 update &#40;August &#39;18 Update&#41; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> majic1  say:</h3>
<h2>            Latest Windows 10 update &#40;August &#39;18 Update&#41;</h2>
                    <p>I received the typical "Your system needs to be restarted to finish installing the latest Windows 10 updates".&nbsp; So, I restarted and let it install the latest "August '18 Update.&nbsp; After the update, my VPN client stopped working (resolved), File associations
 with mainly image files have been assigned to an unknown app (resolved), I can't access my NAS backup drive with the sharename of the device, I have to use the IP address instead, And Windows is now telling me my graphics card is not compatible with this version
 of Windows and that I should install a graphics card that support Direct3D.&nbsp; I have an nVidia GeForce GTX 780 card, which has worked just fine until this latest update.&nbsp; I figured it was a driver problem, so I reinstalled the nVidia GeForce drivers and my
 Direct3D apps all started working again.</p>
<p>This morning, I turned on my computer and received the same message again about my graphics card not being compatible with this version of Windows.&nbsp; I had to reinstall the nVidia drivers again.</p>
<p>What is going on with these updates.&nbsp; Every time there is one, several things on my computer either stop working or disappear altogether.&nbsp; I am so sick of this, I am very seriously considering reinstalling Windows 7 back on this PC.&nbsp; Windows 7 never had
 these problems.</p>

            Hi, Majic1
<br />
<br />It is possible that you are not synchronizing Windows Hello settings correctly with your device.
<br />
<br />First, check that your team has up-to-date updates. For this, you can validate the following link: Windows Update.
<br />
<br />In addition to this, you can check from the technical support of the manufacturer of your computer, if you have the most updated driver to use the fingerprint. Then, reconfigure Windows Hello. To do this, perform the following steps:
<br />
<br />1. Go to start, select Settings&gt; Accounts&gt; Login options.
<br />
<br />2. On Windows Hello, select the camera or fingerprint reader.
<br />
<br />3. Select remove to remove the face scan or fingerprint reader.
<br />
<br />4. Reconfigure Windows Hello.
<br />
<br />You can find more information in the following link: What is Windows Hello?

            This is nice information and all...but, I have a desktop PC, not a tablet or laptop.&nbsp; Windows Hello is not available on this machine because there is no fingerprint reader and my camera is not compatible with it.

<p>I updated to the latest August update and after starting the update the monitor display was a gibberish mess...let the PC run over night hoping it would be finished in the AM. Found the PC unable to boot to the O/S, and had to completely wipe the drive and
 restore from a save USB image. This wiped ALL of my installed apps and basically left me with a non working mouse and keyboard. The touch screen was also very unresponsive. I finally had to turn Bluetooth off, restart, and re-enable BT. Had to physically make
 each device broadcast so that Win10 would recognize it. As of now, I have a keyboard and mouse again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The August update isn't showing up anymore, and I'm running with the April update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wish these updates would stop deleting settings or apps, and just function.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since paying over $4K for the surface studio, I don't think it is too unreasonable to expect that (especially this device, which is it's own type of OS) would be fairly simple to apply any MS created updates without crashing or crippling any pc it is designated
 for.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it possible to return this for a refund ? I'd rather get off this merry go ride, and purchase something more reliable.</p>

<h2>            Lost Recovery Image</h2>
                    <p>Is there anyway to restore a system image? Mine seems to have vanished and my boot files say it is completely gone. Can I download/fileshare for one or is there a program I can use to see if maybe the Recovery Image just moved somewhere? I assess the situation
 as completely lost because my Partitions changed and it seems like the file went missing during that change. I don't think my Partitions are supposed to look like this?</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not real sure what you are calling a "Recovery Image"...</p>
<p>
</p><p>An actual Recovery Image made by windows would be called "WindowsImageBackup" and would not be listed in Disk management, but in a folder on the destination drive you selected..</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you possibly talking about the preinstalled software recovery furnished by the manufacturer (Acer) ? That sometimes gets deleted when Windows upgrades to a new build... Especially when going from Win 8\8.1 to Win 10...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that a upgrade resized your ESP and Recovery partitions as well, but what usually happens is that you end up with MORE Recovery partitions, not the existing one getting smaller...</p>
<p>
</p><p>It IS a bit strange that the ESP got that much larger though... I have never seen that happen before...</p>

                    <p>I have been running windows 8 games (freecell, spider solitaire, mahjong etc.) on my surface book win 10 pro i7 successfully until I implemented the 1607 upgrade. They will not run at all now. I have tried compatibility modes for win&nbsp; 8 and vista but they
 will not start. I have uninstalled the games and re-installed them with no change. Can anyone advise please.</p>

 have 2 other machines, although both of these are Win 10 home and not Win 10 Pro and I am not looking to update these until I understand whether The 1607 update is restricting my capability to run software.</p>

            <p>I installed the games under release 1511 yesterday and they worked fine.</p>
<p>Updated to 1607 last night and now games won't run.</p>
<p>Have checked Program Files and only .mui files left in Microsoft Games - it appears that the games have been uninstalled.</p>
<p>Have tried installing them on 2 other machines at 1607 and when I run them, the Location icon pops on briefly in the notification area of the task-bar and then disappears. The games don't run.</p>

            Thanks. I have looked at my installation and it all seems to be present. I will compare with another machine (Win 10 home 1511) later today. It does look like Microsoft may be blocking the installation or running of these games (maybe to force use of Apps
 with adverts?).

            I have now confirmed that the installations between 1607 and 1511 look the same. The upgrade has clearly done something to prevent them from running. Is it just the old MS games effected or are there other apps/installations effected as well.?

            I have now got these games running properly. I uninstalled the package I had, downloaded a new package from winaero.com, scanned it for viruses to check (just in case!), Installed it and Bingo! all now working correctly so all is now well on my win 10
 Anniversary Pro Surface book. Thanks to the few who tried to help.

<h2>            How do you change the email order for the windows 10 Mail app&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have multiple emails on the windows 10 mail app but I can't find the way to change the order of the emails around? (like which one is at the top and stuff)</p>
<p>
</p><p>also is there a way to add the 8.1's # of new email function ? so that I can see the # of new emails next to each email account name before I have to click it</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you</p>

            <blockquote>
<p>What if you update BIOS? that might reflash the entire memory?! (that's jutst a curiosity).</p>
<p>I also have 3 other questions:</p>
<p>1.For example, I've bought a lenovo with windows 8.1 installed. And I also have other 2 laptops.</p>
<p>Am I allowed to upgrade lenovo to windows 10 , and then use the windows 8.1 license on another laptop?</p>
<p><strong>No.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>When I upgrade a preinstalled (OEM) or retail&nbsp;version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 license to Windows 10, does that license remain OEM or become a retail license?</strong></p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM or retail version of Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 to the free Windows 10 upgrade this summer, the license is consumed into it. Because the free upgrade is derived from the base qualifying license, Windows 10 will carry that licensing
 too.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you upgrade from a retail version, it carries the rights of a retail version.</p>
<p>If you upgrade from a OEM version, it carries the rights of a OEM version.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Full version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- Doesn't require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Upgrade version (Retail):</strong></p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>- Includes transfer rights to another computer.</p>
<p>- require a previous qualifying version of Windows.</p>
<p>- Expensive, but cheaper than full version</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>OEM :</strong></p>
<span>
<p>
</p><p>OEM versions of Windows are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What happens if I change my motherboard?</strong></p>
<p>As it pertains to&nbsp;the <strong>OEM licenses </strong>this will invalidate the Windows 10 upgrade license because it will no longer have a previous base qualifying license which is required for the free upgrade. You will then have to purchase a full retail
 Windows 10 license. <strong>If the base qualifying license (Windows 7 or Windows 8.1)&nbsp;was a full retail version, then yes, you can transfer it.
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><em>From the end user license agreement:</em></p>
<p>15. UPGRADES. To use upgrade software, you must first be licensed for the software that is eligible for the upgrade. Upon upgrade, this agreement takes the place of the agreement for the software you upgraded from. After you upgrade, you may no longer use
 the software you upgraded from.</p>
<p>
</p><p>17. TRANSFER TO ANOTHER COMPUTER. a. Software Other than Windows Anytime Upgrade. You may transfer the software and install it on another computer for your use. That computer becomes the licensed computer. You may not do so to share this license between
 computers. </p>
</span></span></span>
<p>
</p><p>2. On my lenovo I have a licensed microsoft office 2013, corel draw x7.5 . Will it still work on windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Office 2013 yes, Corel Draw, not sure.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will upgrading from Windows 7 or later preserve my personal files, applications and settings?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, upgrading from Windows 7&nbsp;or a later version will preserve your personal files (documents, music, pictures, videos, downloads, favorites, contacts etc, applications (ie. Microsoft Office, Adobe applications etc),&nbsp; games&nbsp;and settings (ie. passwords, custom
 dictionary, application settings). </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Will my existing programs, hardware and drivers&nbsp;work on Windows 10?</strong></p>
<p>Most applications and hardware&nbsp;drivers&nbsp;designed for Windows 7 or later should work with Windows 10. Of course, with significant changes expected in Windows 10, it is best you contact the software developer and hardware vendor&nbsp;to find out about support for
 Windows 10. Windows 10 setup will keep, upgrade, replace and might require that you install new drivers through Windows Update or from the manufacturers website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also download the Download the Windows 10 Reservation App and use it to check your system readiness.

<p>
</p><p><strong>Yes.</strong></p>
Can I reinstall Windows 10 on my computer after upgrading? 
<div>
<div>
<div>
<p>Yes. Once you’ve upgraded to Windows 10 using the free upgrade offer, you will be able to reinstall, including a clean install, on the same device. You won’t need to purchase Windows 10 or go back to your prior version of Windows and upgrade again.</p>
<p>You’ll also be able to create your own installation media like a USB drive or DVD, and use that to upgrade your device or reinstall after you’ve upgraded.</p>

<p>Windows XP Professional. I use several different programs that are never running at the same time that require the COM1 port. Now I am in a situation that I can't use any of my applications because they all say that the COM1 port is in use by another application.
 I've uninstalled the COM1 port in the Hardware Device Manager but the problem persists when I restart my computer. How can I release the COM1 port or find out&nbsp;what has it tied up.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Hi rlcrewse,</p>
<p>I suggest creating a new profile to test the software and COM port:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/811151" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/811151</a></p>
<p>If your not on a domain, you can ignore the that part of the instructions.</p>
<p>If the software works, the profile may have become corrupted at some point.</p>

<p>Hello good day!</p>
<p>I pushed the power on, just as I normally do. But found out displaying this:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>"Power-on Password"</strong> </span>
</p>
<p>The last time I use it was like the usual thing I do. I do now know the password and how i ended up with this.</p>
<p>I tried some of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>I tried to remove the battery for a meantime and hoping it will turn on normally but still shows the same result.
</li><li>Everytime I click Enter, it shows the same until 3rd time. </li><li>Everytime I click f11 or any function keys, it still shows the same. </li></ul>
<p>Can anyone help me? I just purchased Windows7 9months ago but havent experienced any negative things until now. Thank you.</p>

<div>It isn't Windows 7 that is causing it, it is the machine. Is this a desktop? If so, you can look in the documentation to find a place to reset the CMOS (a jumper). That should reset the password to being blank.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If it is a laptop, there may be a similar way to reset the CMOS on that.
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>What model/type of computer is it?</div>

<p>
</p><p><span><span>I appreciate if you could answer few questions to narrow down to the issue.
</span></span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>What exactly happens when you try to print the envelopes? Did you receive any error message?</span></p>

<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Did you install any third party security application?</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Is the model HP 5530 or 5530e?</span></p>
</li></ol>
<p><span><span>This issue may arise due to out dated drivers. As an initial troubleshooting step,
</span><span>I suggest you to run printer troubleshooter and check if it helps to resolve the issue.

<p><span><span>4. Click <strong>Printer</strong>. </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>5. Follow the on-screen instructions to run the troubleshooter. </span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>6. Check if issue persists. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persists, I suggest you to download the drivers from the manufacturer’s website and check if that helps to resolve the issue.</span></p>

<p>I recently got a lot of BSOD's from the last 3 days. I already got the 3 most newest DMP files from my Minidump folder zipped into a cloud over here: https://mega.nz/#fm/EYI1CKRL. I also had a virus, so I got a full recovery on my hard disk and everything
 got to a brand new level of brandnewsiticy (I hope that's a word). I also have some .dll files that are missing from my computer, so I can't run Cryengine but I don't know which .dll files those are and what to do. But the BSOD is more important now. Please
 help me, I don't wan't to cry in bed anymore.</p>

            I've reinstalled many engines after recovery. CryEngine, Unreal Engine and Unity. I also had a antivirus with the name of Baidu. I'm not sure if it's because of her or something like that. Other type of changes... no. Pretty much no. I've ran sfc /scannow
 on cmd for the /dll files, nothign happened. I had 2 that I needed to have to run Unreal Engine, but I forgot their names. I basically saw a tutorial and downloaded the same .dll file from the internet, one 32 but, and one 64bit version, the 32 bit I put in
 system 32, and the 64bit version in syswow64 or something like that, maybe it was the other way around, I'm sorry if I get something wrong here. For the BSOD's nothing, for the .dll files, I told you already sfc /scannow and those two .dll files.

 do a clean install, its to fix the driver, either with an updated version or installing a generic audio driver, depending on the device you have recently added or updated on your system. common error with some mics.<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;</span><br />

            This is why I asked if there is another way to do this, it actually didn't really make sense following the recent events with the BSODs. I knew it's something from an audio driver, since it happens normally when I'm in a Discrod server for a long time.
 I didn't do it, and thanks for the comment, I was kind of not sure if I did the wrong think not reinstalling my OS.

    <title>Surface Pro exits tablet mode while keyboard cover is folded back - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bryan david  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pro exits tablet mode while keyboard cover is folded back</h2>
                    Since I purchased the Surface Pro 2017 last year this has been a big problem for me. When the type cover is folded back it turns to "tablet mode" automatically. While in tablet mode, it will randomly jump back to "desktop mode" and the "auto rotate on"
 message pops up, and key presses start to register on the type cover (which again, is folded back). I will slowly tilt the tablet slightly for a bit, and the "auto rotate on" then will return and then "tablet mode" is reactivated. I always keep everything
 up to date. The ONLY third party software I have on my device is from Adobe. Everything else is Microsoft. I have two different type covers and this happens with both. I primarily use the Surface Pro to draw like a sketchbook, so this is a daily frustration.
 Update after update for a year now, I am on the verge of selling this for an iPad. Is there anything I can do short of resetting to factory settings? &nbsp;

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Thank you for the suggestions. Neither of these worked however. No matter which mode I am in, or if rotation is locked, the keyboard will randomly decide to register key presses while folded back.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To clarify, I WANT desktop mode to switch to tablet mode when I fold the type cover back. I use both. It is an advertised feature. I have owned the original Surface Pro as well as Surface Pro 4 before using my current Surface Pro 2017 model. None of my previous
 Surface Pro devices had this issue.&nbsp;</p>

            <div>are you using the typecover that came with your SP4 and/or did you buy a new one</div>
<div>with the SP2017? and if you have 2 typecovers, does this happen with both?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>the keys should not activate with the typecover folded back against the Surface,</div>

            Both type covers (alacantra grey and blue) I have were designed for the 2017 model, and yeah the problem occurs with both. It is strange seeing how so few others seem to have this problem. Thanks again for taking the time to respond. I guess a reset or
 a visit to the Microsoft store is best :/

            I'll officially be taking this garbage computer to a Microsoft Store. I bit the bullet and reset the PC to factory settings (while keeping my files) and now start menu can't be opened, action center can't be opened, settings can't be accessed in any way.
 (win key +I, or right click start&gt;settings) even if the store somehow fixes it I will probably try to sell it.&nbsp;

    <title>Enable Wireless WOL - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> daylef  say:</h3>
<h2>            Enable Wireless WOL</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've asked this question in a different form so will ask more succinctly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Lenovo S5 lap top that is for a client and they need&nbsp;to access it remotely to gather logged data (it's in an office 200km away). While they can get the end user to plug it into a LAN cable they can't rely on that happening every time it's brought
 back from the field. That said, I need to use wireless wake on lan. I have tried MS support, Lenovo and&nbsp;Realtek but have yielded nothing. The tick box "Allow this&nbsp;device to wake the computer" is greyed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried configuring the power settings, checking BIOS, checking the WLAN settings for Magic Packet, updating the driver, updating the BIOS and checking "powercfg" settings (which won't allow you access in Windows 10&nbsp;no matter what your&nbsp;level is).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So Lenovo have thrown their hands in the air other than to say "The&nbsp;Think series of notebooks don't support WWOL" after telling me Intel can't help (I'm not surprised it's a Realtek WLAN) after 8 weeks of deliberation.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>My personal laptop is a Lenovo YOGA 3 which allows me to WWOL&nbsp;so it can be done but what I have noticed is it's a Broadcom device running a Windows driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My only remaining conclusion is that it's an issue with Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can help, I'm all ears!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers...</p>
<p>

<p>Hi Michael</p>
<p>
</p><p>In answer to your questions</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes and not just admin user, I've tried Administrator and still get the same response to the powercfg commands&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>10 home with 1709 update</p>
<p>Yes and it's turned on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just to add a comment. I blew the dust off and fired up my dated Toshiba running XP. I checked the (Realtek) Wifi module and it supports Wireless WOL so&nbsp;it can be done.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Looking forward to your response</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

<p>We appreciate your response, Dayle. We suggest that you perform a <strong>clean install</strong>. By doing this, it will
<span>overwrite all other content on the hard disk and </span>
<span>removes the current operating system and user files during the installation process. You may check and follow the steps provided by
<strong><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-windows_install/clean-install-windows-10/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">Andre Da Costa</a></strong> or

 a hardware issue. </span>You may get in touch with your device manufacturer for an in-depth assistance to resolve this.</p>

<p>Thanks again Michael but in answer to your comments:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a clean install. It's a brand new Lenovo S5. In fact it's the second one after they suggested replacing&nbsp;it may fix the problem.&nbsp;With the replacement machine, the first thing I did was try to get the WWOL working before&nbsp;anything else but it was&nbsp;the
 same outcome.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lenovo have been no help&nbsp;at all and eventually said "we'll give you a refund" which of course is a cop out and is now in the "to hard basket" and of course have not come good with their offer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a few things to consider. Firstly it would have to keep the WiFi alive in order to receive a magic packet and I wonder if that is the stumbling block from a security point of view (remembering that I have two laptops that do work). So far as the
 Realtek driver is concerned I don't know enough about the interaction between their driver and Windows 10 in making it happen, but the Microsoft driver doesn't work either. Realtek won't respond to me but I'm absolutely sure they would respond to MS if the
 question was asked.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Cheers</p>

<p>Driver (Network) update/s are being released by your laptop manufacturer. There are two ways of getting an update or checking if there's any available. First, you can get the model of your computer and search it on the manufacturer's website. Second (the
 most easiest way), you may get in touch to your computer manufacturer's support as they're the ones knowledgeable on what to do in updating drivers.</p>

<p>Hi again</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been down that path, in fact I've tried drivers not designed for that network device under Lenovo's direction. I've tried two later editions settling on the latest driver which was October last year. There has been 8 weeks of dialogue between myself,
 Lenovo and&nbsp;MS with no result. MS directly (not through this forum) have almost been obstructive and the level or arrogance is astounding. Lenovo at least made an attempt until they ran out of ideas. If it turns out that it simply can't be done with this module,
 I'll have to accept that, but someone must know why it doesn't work. </p>
<p>My background is in electrical engineering particularly automation and process control. I've have written countless pieces of code and I can assure you that if someone came to me and said "this aspect doesn't work", I could look at the code and find out
 why and offer a reason and a possible fix. The fact that the tick box is greyed, is just a logical evaluation.&nbsp;Based on the events so far and deductive reasoning, the issue must either be with Realtek or the way the driver interacts with Windows 10.&nbsp;Realtek
 may be able to give me a clue, but I can't get an answer from them.</p>
<p>You will have to excuse my frustration, but at this stage, the lap top has been put into service minus the ability to wake it up, meaning it&nbsp;must be left running 24/7. The risk is that if someone inadvertently shuts it down or fails to plug it in after use
 and leaves site, I have to drive 200km to plug it in. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your efforts Michael, I do appreciate the time and effort&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hi Daylef,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's unfortunate that Lenovo do not currently have the answer to your question, but I imagine that realtek would need to be your next port of call as WOL and WOWLan are normally implemented by the manufacturers of the NIC's and the Motherboards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are a few windows settings that do need to be in place for WOWLan to work however.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you mentioned before: Allow this device to wake this computer needs to be enabled. If it is greyed out, then either you do not currently have permission (I would suggest running Device Manager as Admin by searching for Device Manager, right clicking and
 selecting run as Admin) or the device driver does not expose this ability to windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may also need to enable Magic Packet on the devices advanced settings which you can find by right click -&gt; Properties on the adaptor in device manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As well as this on the Dell machines I work with on a daily basis, I have had to disable S4 and S% sleep states on all PC's that require WOL as when a device is in either sleep state, I have never been able to get it to wake after receiving a magic packet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this helps!</p>
<p>

<p>Thanks Ethan</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've been down all of those scenarios regarding Windows and WiFi settings, including permissions&nbsp;but have come up empty.&nbsp;This laptop&nbsp;is now on site and resides in an office when not in the field which also has two desktops behind a modem router that has
 a fixed IP from the ISP. I&nbsp;have set up access via WOL to the desktops which is faultless.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just this morning I've discovered a later Lenovo driver for the WiFi device which I will try. The laptop appears to have connected to the wrong&nbsp;router so I have to go to site anyhow and will try the new driver when I get there later in the week.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>In regard to the sleep state, were you able to see the WOL feature as ungreyed in the S4 state?</p>
<p>

            Hey Nick.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />yes, Hibernate is under Settings &gt; System &gt; Power &amp; Sleep &gt; Additional Power Settings &gt; Change Plan Settings &gt; Change Advanced Power settings, expand Sleep.
<br />
<br />If Sleep or Hibernate are not present Update the Display driver from the PC maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS, network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hello William,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>It is possible that there is an issue with the Family settings. This can be the reason why you're unable to use Google Chrome. We recommend that you check you family settings by accessing&nbsp;</span><a href="https://account.microsoft.com/family/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>account.microsoft.com/family</strong></a><span><span>&nbsp;</span>to
 see Google Chrome is added to restricted applications.</span></p>

<p>Yes. You can reserve your upgrade at any time on any compatible PC by clicking on the Get Windows&nbsp;10 app or the Windows Update control panel.</p>

</p><p>This update is not required to get Windows 10, you can still get it even though you don't get the notification. Just download it on July 29th 2015 when it becomes available. You will have one year to do so. The Reserve app is just a reminder/notification
 for its availability.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Home - activated using your organization&#39;s activation service</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just a bit of general confusion and questioning regarding what may have caused my windows 10 to prompt this message (which I truly don't understand).&nbsp; After booting up my old desktop, I was prompted with an error message stating that I needed to connect
 to my host organisation's activation server, yet my desktop is and remains at home at all times (really don'y understand what the host organization is referring to). Regardless, after installing and using KMS, my license became activated, and was more-so wondering
 if this would have to be a repetitive process (as I don't the nature of possessing a license under a host organization).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any response/feedback!</p>

<p>The error can occur for a number of reasons. It is possible, the OEM vendor might have used a OEM volume key to mass activate each machine imaged at the factory with Windows 10 Home. Users can
 try recovering the OEM Marker key embedded in the motherboard then use it to update the product key values.

<h3> timsa81  say:</h3>
<h2>            Install Windows 10 on Parallels 11 for Mac on OS X El Capitan</h2>
                    <p>I am installing a fresh Virtual Machine of Windows 10 64-bit on the latest iMac running OS X El Capitan using Parallels Desktop for the Macintosh. I am installing only from an ISO image downloaded from Microsoft through the usual online purchase process.
 I am installing as an Administrator on the Mac and have insured the file permission levels of the downloaded ISO image are correct and accessible. I start the usual Parallels Virtual Machine installation process which invokes a Windows 10 (blue) "Starting
 Setup" dialog window. It processes the installation for about one minute and displays a Windows-style window claiming "No Images Available". Are there restrictions as to how Windows should be installed using ISO images or hard media? Has anyone seen this type
 of error?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any assistance would be appreciated.</p>

<p>You have a couple options:</p>
<p>If you would like to reinstall Windows 8, which means removing apps and personal files and settings, you can use reset and refresh. This is equivalent to a clean install.</p>
<p>To do it, do the following:</p>
<p>· Press <b>Windows key + i</b> on your keyboard to show the Charms bar (If you are using a touchscreen: Touch the right edge of your screen and swipe your finger to the left)</p>
<p>· Click <b>Settings</b></p>
<p>· Click <b>Change PC settings</b></p>
<p>· Click <b>General</b> in the left column</p>
<p>· Under <b>Remove everything and reinstall Windows</b>, click <b>Get started</b></p>
<p>Then follow the instructions that will be provided on the screen to reinstall Windows on your PC.</p>
