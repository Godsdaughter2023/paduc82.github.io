<p>I can see all my friends TENURE icons &amp; I use to be able to see my own TENURE on MY PROFILE on Xbox One.</p>

<p>On 360, the tenure is displayed correctly on my profile. But the TENURE icon is missing on my Xbox One profile.</p>

<p>My friend has confirmed that the TENURE icon is missing on my Xbox One profile page.</p>

<p>I've deleted and re-added my account on Xbox One and checked my Privacy settings.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hey there Sticky!<br /><br /><strong>Here's a couple questions for you to help us better understand the situation:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>When's the last time you were able to see your Tenure on your Xbox One console? (If you don't know for sure, just give your best guess).</li>
<li>Has your membership changed at all lately, even for a couple of hours? For example: Let us know if your Gold Membership expired and an hour later you upgraded from Silver back to Gold again.</li>
<li>What tenure are you seeing on your Xbox 360 console?</li>
</ol>
<p><br />Let us know and we'll be standing by to hear from you! ^_^</p>

<p>1) I can't recollect exactly, but it was within the past week. My friends &amp; other users can't see my tenure either.</p>
<p>2) YES &amp; No. My Gold status in Microsoft &amp; Xbox billing remained active &amp; unchanged. &nbsp;Prepaid 12M Xbox LIVE Gold ending in Sept 2014. Also all my subscriptions since 2005 are present in the billing history.</p>
<p>BUT There was a Xbox Live Gold status outage on Xbox One &amp; Xbox 360 on Mar 13 2014, affecting a select group of Xbox Live users . Both on Xbox One and Xbox 360, Gold status wasn't available for several hours, despite having an ACTIVE &amp; UNCHANGED Gold membership
 status in Microsoft &amp; Xbox Billing. This Gold status problem was recognized by Microsoft tech support and officially fixed by Microsoft engineers within 24hours.</p>
<p>Here is the user forum thread regarding the Gold status outage 
forums.xbox.com/.../1714686.aspx</p>
<p>3) 8 years</p>
<p>Additional Notes:</p>
<p>a) &nbsp;I have tried deleting my profile off both my Xbox 360 &amp; Xbox One several times. Unplugging my systems from the power outlet. Clearing caches. And then retrieving back my profile on Xbox 360 &amp; Xbox One. Xbox 360 properly displays 8 years. While Xbox One
 the TENURE icon "box" doesn't even appear.</p>
<p>b) I would like to add that on March-30-2014, I unlocked an achievement in Titan Fall "Captured Everything" which appears correctly in Achievements and my Gamer-score was updated accordingly. But this achievement was never posted to my Activity Feed (Friends
 app) due to some random bug. My friends confirmed that they couldn't see the achievement being mentioned on their FEEDS within 1 hours after unlocking the achievement. I couldn't see the achievement in my feed either. But they were able to see it in my profile,
 under "Compare Games". Not sure if this is related to the Tenure issues in any way, but it maybe worth mentioning.</p>
<p>I am worried that something has gone very wrong with my account, and would dread loosing my tenure on my Xbox One profile. Perhaps the Xbox One version of my profile got reset by the Gold status outage on March 13, 2014.</p>
<p>Please help me get my cherished tenure icon back on Xbox One.</p>

<p>I believe I have found the cause of the missing Xbox One tenure icons. The March 13 2014 GOLD STATUS OUTAGE, were select xbox live members accounts turned Silver for several hours, seems to be the cause.</p>
<p>As you can see almost all the people that complain in the Gold Status forum thread, if not all of their Tenures are MISSING from their Xbox One profile page.</p>

<p>I [SHaMROCK 73] was also affected by the March 13th Xbox Live Gold outage. &nbsp;My wife [TiNABEANA 7O], Son [JaKEY PuPu 01] and daughter [ALLY BeLLY 03] accounts were not affected. &nbsp;At that time we did not yet own an Xbox One console so we were unaware of how
 this affected the Xbox One version of our profiles. &nbsp;When we purchases the Xbox One on March 26, 2014 and all four of us added our profiles to the console my tenure did not show up [SHaMROCK 73 - 10 Years] despite it displaying correctly on Xbox 360. &nbsp;The
 tenure for my son [JaKEY PuPu 01 - 4 Years], wife [TiNABEANA 7O - 3 Years] and daughter [ALLY BeLLY 03 - 3 Years] all show up fire on both Xbox One and Xbox 360.</p>
<p>I have been in contact with Xbox support several times and I have followed all their trouble shooting efforts, deleting my profile on Xbox One and re-adding, deleting my profile on Xbox 360 and re-adding, clearing the system cache on Xbox 360, unplugging
 the Xbox One power until the power supply light extinguishes. &nbsp;One support agent deleted my Xbox Live Gold then gave me a 1 month code to restart live in a hope that it would reset. &nbsp;Nothing has worked.</p>
<p>I was told to take my issue here to the forums by an support agent on the phone [pathetic customer care] because that is my only hope. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Today I called and my issue has apparently been escalated and I will be contacted via email at some point. &nbsp;Mind you, it has been a week and he felt I should have been contacted already so I have my doubts!!!</p>
<p>The list of affected people is growing, and we have a common occurrence &nbsp;of the March 13, 2014 Gold glitch.</p>
<p>Fix this, I have been a loyal customer for nearly 11 years of not just Xbox but Microsoft. &nbsp;I am even that guy who bought a ZUNE! &nbsp;:)</p>

<p>Not sure if i was affected by the gold outage or not &nbsp;just confirming my gold subscriptiion is fully valid until January 2015. I have only just noticed that my tenure is missing, it was there a few weeks ago but not exactly sure the exact amount.</p>

            <p>Hey again Sticky!<br /><br />Thank you for getting back to me with that information! Let me start off by saying please don't worry. Your tenure isn't stored only on your Xbox One console, it's tied to your account. The fact that you can see your tenure on your Xbox 360 console is proof that you haven't lost your tenure. It's simply not showing on your Xbox One console, which is something we'll need to look into. The "Captured Everything" achievement not showing in your friend's feeds looks to be unrelated and probably a one time issue (if it continues to happen with other achievements though, please let us know)! =)<br /><br />This could certainly have something to do with the outage you mentioned, and I'd be interested to see what your tenure displays as when you pass your renewal date again. For now, please rest assured that you haven't lost your tenure (it's simply not displaying on your Xbox One console) and we'll be looking into why that's happening. Thank you for your patience while we in

<p>Mister Cerb, I am very worried because THE ONLY place my tenure is showing up correctly is on Xbox 360. &nbsp;When I called 1-800 4MY-XBOX they said on their end there are dozens of duplicates entries of their computer terminal of my gamertag and none of them
 are displaying my 10 year tenure. &nbsp;They all say 0 years despite on some of the records they can view transactions going back to 2003.</p>

<p>@Mister Cerb.</p>
<p>Thank you for your continuing investigating of the problem with our Tenure on Xbox One. I hope that Microsoft engineers will resolve this issue soon, even faster with the information we have provided regarding the March 13, 2014 Gold Status outage &amp; list
 of other affected users.</p>
<p>Although I am also curious what my tenure will say at renewal in September 2014, I'd certainly expect that my tenure issue/bug/glitch is fixed much sooner than that.</p>
<p>Although I do feel some relief that my tenure is intact on Xbox 360 and by strictly deductive reasoning, hopefully also OK on Microsoft servers, until I see my tenure back on Xbox One, I won't feel completely satisfied.</p>
<p>I hope we can get some updates from you, regarding your investigation, over the next couple of days.</p>
<p>Thanks again Mister Cerb.</p>

                    <p><em><strong>Original title: </strong></em>Can't restore Windows 10 to a earlier restore point
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I installed Windows 10 and went through a 2 hour tutorial to get familiar with the new system.&nbsp; I am comfortable with how it works and had it set up the way I wanted.&nbsp; I had Excel and Word on my task bar and a lot of other personal files installed.&nbsp; I didn't
 like that I had to use a password so figured out how to log on without a pass word.&nbsp; I was getting comfortable using the new features.&nbsp; This morning I had a note to I needed to install some software.&nbsp; When finished it re-booted and up pops the old&nbsp;logon window
 and required me to log on again.&nbsp; I put in my password and when it started everything is&nbsp;different.&nbsp; My icons all showed up lined up along the left side and many of them are missing.&nbsp; When I click on the start menus the tiles are not the way I arranged them.&nbsp;
 The task bar no longer shows Excel or Word. &nbsp;I click on mail and it wants me to re-enter everything as if I had never used it before.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I was going into Cortana as I normally would and it wanted me to go through a sign up.&nbsp; Everything is now reverted back as if I am a new user.&nbsp; I thought I could go in and find a restore point and found one from 2 days back.&nbsp; I did a search for things that
 would change and there was 1 utility program&nbsp;and that would not cause a problem.&nbsp; I selected the restore point and started it.&nbsp; It comes back with a warning that I have a disk error.&nbsp;A warning window says .. The disk has errors .. windows has detected file
 system corruption on C:...You must check the disk for errors before it can be restored.&nbsp;I said to correct the errors&nbsp;and that meant a re-start....This did not correct the problem.&nbsp; I have&nbsp;gone through the fix disk errors several times with no results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Any ideas what I can do to get everything I have done to be restored?</p>
<p>My Excel is missing and so is Word and I use them everyday.</p>

    <title>Windows freezes and shuts down with no warning. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> parkerbrissette  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows freezes and shuts down with no warning.</h2>
                    I have many Users on Windows 7 64-bit with office 2010. All using Dell Latitude e6520. 3-5 users report that while working on an excel sheet their computer will freeze and in a few seconds go black. They can not do anything once the computer freezes. They
 turn it back on and no warning comes up but everything seems fine. It will only happen once and it happens maybe once every three weeks. I have noticed that we get new Microsoft security updates a few days before the shutdowns happen. The most common factor
 that I can pick up is that they all are in Excel when the computer crashes. The event viewer shows no data other than Kernel Power Warning, indicating the system shut down improperly. I have run MEMtest and&nbsp;diagnostics, all test are clear. I have tested all
 hardware and the CPU usage doesn't seem to be high before the shut down occurs. There is nothing different they are using than my other users. I haven't ran a repair of office but I'm not set on that being the problem. I feel like it has to do more with the
 security updates from Microsoft. The CPU and other temperatures seem fine and it doesn't over heat. Any more information I should try to gather? Any clues on where to dig?

            <p>Event Viewer Reports</p>
<p>1. Normally when an error occurs on your computer looking in Event Viewer should be your starting point for finding a solution. Most system
 related errors are logged and getting an exact copy of the relevant report is important. Unfortunately understanding the reports is not easy and most computer users need help with their interpretation. I have more to say later on interpretation.</p>
<p>2. Event Viewer comprises three main Windows logs. These are Application, Security and System. For troubleshooting purposes System is
 by far the most important.</p>
<p>3. To access the System log select Start, Control Panel, Administrative Tools, Event Viewer, from the list in the left side of the window
 select Windows Logs and System. Place the cursor on System, right click and select Filter Current Log. Check the box before Error and click on OK and you see only Error reports. Click on the Date and Time Column Header to sort. You may need to click a second
 time to see the latest Report at the top. </p>
<p>4. A tip for posting copies of Error Reports! Run Event Viewer and double click on the error you want to copy. Select the Details tab
 and check the box before XML View. Click on the Copy button to place a copy on your Clipboard and close Event Viewer. Now start your message and paste into the body of the message. Make sure this is the first paste after exiting from Event Viewer.</p>
<p>5. There are three types of Report, being Information, Warning and Error reports. In most situations it is Error Reports that offer the
 best information but occasionally Warning Reports provide useful clues. </p>
<p>6. All reports have date and time stamps and when troubleshooting it is important to concentrate on more recent reports. Study reports
 since the point when the computer was last booted and then check whether a similar report appeared in the previous session. If errors do not repeat investigation as to why they occurred is wasted effort.</p>
<p>7. Within individual reports the more important information is Event ID and Source as these help when looking for help on the internet.
 The description is equally important and copying the exact text for use as the search criteria greatly helps getting better results when using Google. Do not paraphrase descriptions when asking others for help.</p>

<br /> Code 43 "Windows has stopped this device because it has reported problems. (Code 43)"
<br />Cause
<br />
<br />One of the drivers controlling the device notified the operating system that the device failed in some manner.
<br />
<br />Recommended Resolution
<br />
<br />If you have already tried the "Try these steps first" section, check the hardware documentation or contact the manufacturer for more information about diagnosing the problem.
<br />
<br />Reinstall the device driver manually
<br />
<br />	1. From Start, search for device manager and select Device Manager from the results.
<br />	2. Right-click the device in the list.
<br />	3. Select Uninstall from the menu that appears.
<br />	4. After the device is uninstalled, choose Action on the menu bar.
<br />	5. Select Scan for hardware changes to reinstall the driver.
<br />Note You may be prompted to provide the path of the driver.  If you are asked for the driver and you do not have it, you can try to download the latest driver from the hardware vendor’s website.
<br />
<br />Refer to the article about: Error codes in Device Manager in Windows:

<br />
<br />
<br />Let me know.

    <title>Windows 10 LAN Network icon in Systray Yellow Triangle of Death - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jetcosys  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 LAN Network icon in Systray Yellow Triangle of Death</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have several PCs, spread across multiple environments all showing this same behavior.&nbsp; All are static IP on LAN connections.&nbsp; Occasionally upon a PC&nbsp;reboot, the yellow triangle of death shows over the network icon.&nbsp; When this happens some applications
 work, some do not.&nbsp; The only fix is to unplug the network cable, then plug it back in.&nbsp; Once that happens, full connectivity is restored.&nbsp; I need to know how to permanently resolve this issue.&nbsp; This is only an issue on PCs upgraded to Windows 10, never happened
 on Win 8.1.&nbsp; These PCs are on different SBS networks, not just one network, so seems to be a systemic Windows 10 issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thoughts?</p>
<p>

            <p>Hi Jet,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you still facing the issue? <span>From your description, I suspect that the issue might be with the incompatible network drivers. You would have tried installing the drivers in compatibility mode. Compatibility mode runs the program using settings from
 a previous version of Windows.</span></p>

            The one item I haven't tried is a reinstall of network drivers post Windows 10 upgrade. &nbsp;I'll try this. &nbsp;I have networks with all the same equipment and one or two of 10 machines will do this. &nbsp;Thanks for the idea, worth a shot.

            I upgraded all network drivers prior to the upgrade and upon checking, those are the latest drivers for Win10 as well. &nbsp;The above is not the answer to this. &nbsp;I had another random system, all with the latest drivers, show the yellow triangle of death upon
 a simple reboot. &nbsp;I still have no root cause.

            <p>I have recently upgraded from Win 7 to Win 10 and am trying to get back to a normal operation.&nbsp; This same triangle appeared on my LAN connection.&nbsp; First I could not Wake on LAN in my home network, so had to go into Control Panel -&gt; Power Options -&gt; Choose
 what the power buttons do then&nbsp; Change settings that are currently unavailable and uncheck Turn on fast startup.&nbsp; This allowed me to Wake on LAN.&nbsp; However, then the triangle began to appear.&nbsp; I have a static address on this computer that I have used with no
 problem until I made the above change.&nbsp; Even with the triangle appearing and saying I do not have an Internet connection ... I do.&nbsp; However, the computer does not show up on the Home Network as it should, looking from another computer.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have tried it without
 a static address and it seems to work fine, but I want a static address on this computer.&nbsp; I have also had problems when Waking on Lan getting on the Internet.&nbsp; All of this worked flawlessly in Windows 7.&nbsp; Is Windows 10 an improvement, or just another way
 of generating income.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This does not seem like an obscure setup, so it would seem that some brilliant person at Microsoft could come up with a solution with a work around and perhaps put it in an update also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried reinstalling drivers, etc with no improvement.&nbsp; Has anyone solved this problem with the Ethernet connection???</p>

<br />
<br />	Frequently regardless of the version of the operating system are the keys: control + toggle and delete (ctrl + alt + delete).
<br />
<br />	In Windows XP, pressing Ctrl + Alt + Delete or Ctrl + ⇧ Shift + Esc directly starts the task manager, unless you have disabled the welcome screen. From a command line, GUI (located in C: \ Windows \ System32 \ taskmgr.exe) or a shortcut "Taskmgr.exe"

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Can you clarify from where you're trying to share? Reading list will only show as an option to share to if the app you're trying to share from supports sharing out links.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Sharing from desktop apps only shares screenshots so if at the top of the share UI you see "screenshot" it means sharing is not supported and the only option you have is to take a screenshot of the screen and share that.
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Reading list should work if you try to share from apps like Bing news or the Internet Explorer app.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Hope that helps,</p>

    <title>Clean Install of Windows 10 not creating a Recovery Environment&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> vyxl1010  say:</h3>
<h2>            Clean Install of Windows 10 not creating a Recovery Environment&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I've performed two clean installs of Windows 10 on my Surface Pro 3, and both times I am unable to turn on BitLocker since it cannot seem to find the Windows Recovery partition. This also means I can't perform a "Reset" of my computer. Does anybody have
 experience with the clean install that can help me with this? I'd like to be able to encrypt my hard drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I did was I booted my activated Windows 10 device from the USB drive, and reinstalled Windows onto the primary partition (232.2 GB) after formatting it. There are three other partitions on my computer that I did not touch:</p>
<p>
</p><p>A 360 MB labeled Recovery Partition</p>
<p>A 200 MB labeled EFI System Partition </p>
<p>and a 5.57 GB labeled Recovery Partition</p>
<p>
</p><p>This all looks pretty normal to me, but none of them seem to be the Recovery Partition (R:) with any of the recovery information&nbsp;that I am familiar to seeing. I would really appreciate any help!</p>

            <p>I resolved this issue by performing another clean install of Windows 10 onto my SP3. Turns out the process I used the first time was slightly incorrect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When booting my SP3 from the USB drive, I first skipped the enter product key step. Then, when asked to select a location to install Windows 10 to, I first deleted all of my partitions until I was simply left with one partition of unallocated space (disk
 0). I selected this single 238.5 GB partition as my installation location. I let W10 install as normal, and skipped entering the product key one last time. At this point, my SP3 was completely set up with W10 properly. Hope this helps!</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
To get Vista disk to load you need to go into Settings (BIOS/CMOS) usually F2 as you boot and set the CD/DVD<br />
drive to 1st in the boot order - don't forget to set it back later. Some computers have another key that allows<br />
you to set boot order as needed usually F12 - watch screen as you boot up to see F keys.<br />
<br />
Can you access Safe Mode? Repeatedly tap F8 as you boot? If so you can try Control Panel - Device
<br />
Manager - Display Adapter - Double Click on - Driver tab - click UPDATE driver - then Right Click<br />
on Device and UNINSTALL - REBOOT.<br />
<br />
First check this thread in case its a simple one and if not come back to this thread.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistaprograms/thread/50247d5e-0ae0-446c-a1bd-11287fd1478a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vistaprograms/thread/50247d5e-0ae0-446c-a1bd-11287fd1478a</span></a><br />
<br />
Black screen issues are extremely tough to repair and any fix is usually on a hit or miss basis.<br />
That there is no information on a black screen like there is on a blue screen just adds to the<br />
difficulty. Often using a restore point nor startup repair will have any effect. You can try a
<br />
google to see suggested repairs some of which have worked however these cover a wide<br />
field of efforts.<br />
<br />
Here is a video of one fix.<br />

<br />
If needed :<br />
<br />
You can try an In-Place Upgrade (hopefully saves programs and data)&nbsp;or a repair installation (hopefully<br />
saves data and will have to reinstall programs). Be sure to do a good backup or three.<br />
<br />
You can use another's DVD as they are not copy protected however you will need you own Product Key.<br />
<br />
In-Place Upgrade<br />

<br />
<br />
If nothing works you can do a repair installation which should save data however you will have to
<br />
reinstall programs. This also requires the correct Vista disks especially for OEM versions. You will<br />
need to know your Product Code.<br />
<br />

<h2>            Cannot connect phone via USB&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi there</p>
<p>I own a Doogee F5 phone, running Android 5.0. I'm trying to connect it to my PC via USB, but I'm not able to view any folders in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've set it as "USB Media Storage" and it does start&nbsp;charging once connected; also, if I open the "Devices" app, it looks like my computer recognizes it as well. However, I can't open any folder within my device in any way.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there something I'm missing? I've always connected my phones (including other Doogee phones, both with and without root access) and they always worked fine, simply "plug and play". This time it does not work, and I've tried it for days. What can I do?</p>

<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To isolate the issue, please provide the following information: </p>

A screenshot of the issue will also help.
</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Furthermore, to troubleshoot the issue, please place the computer in <span style="font-weight: bold">
clean boot</span> mode and check if the issue persists. A clean boot helps to verify if any third party application services or startup item is causing this problem. Click this

            <p>So, to answer your questions:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>My computer was custom-built, so there's not a "model"</li><li>I'm running Windows 10, all upgrades installed</li><li>Yes, I managed to connect my phone once</li><li>Yes, I tried to connect my phone to another computer (a laptop, running Windows 10). It tries to install "necessary drivers", while my computer doesn't, although said installation seems to be never-ending.</li><li>I'm not getting any error, I simply can't access my phone at all.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>EDIT: Looks like I've managed to get my phone detected by my Windows 10 computer, after trying to connect to other devices as well. I now get an "Incorrect Function" error, saying my device is not accessible.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Joycelanyon,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting question in Microsoft Community!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>In order to provide you with a quick resolution, please reply to these questions:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What is the exact issue are you facing?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>What security software is installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p>

</span></span></span><span>What exactly are you referring to when you say “Start and home QW”?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any changes on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile,
<span>I would suggest you to scan your computer with Microsoft Safety Scanner, which would help us to get rid of viruses, spyware, and other malicious software.</span></p>
<p><span>The Microsoft Safety Scanner is a free downloadable security tool that provides on-demand scanning and helps remove
 viruses, spyware, and other malicious software. It works with your existing antivirus software.</span></p>

<p><b><span>&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> The Microsoft Safety Scanner expires 10 days after being downloaded.
 To rerun a scan with the latest anti-malware definitions, download and run the Microsoft Safety Scanner again.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Important:</span></b><span> While scanning the hard drive if any bad sectors are found, the
 scanner tries to repair that sector, any data available on that might be lost.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Hope it helps.

<h2>            wuauserv keeps waking computer where it never used to.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So another new issue.&nbsp; Some background, a while back I reported when waking from sleep (which I sleep the pc each night) that outlook 2010 would hang (even in outlook safe mode) when attempting to check for email.&nbsp; I had been doing that for years with no
 problems.&nbsp; Now the solution is I have to close outlook before sleeping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>About two weeks or so ago, bitdefender updated itself to the Internet Security 2015 version.&nbsp; Shortly thereafter I noticed my monitor turn off time in power setting keep changing itself from 2hr to 15min (seem to be after waking from sleep mode), each day
 I'd change it to 2hr and it would stick for the rest of the day.&nbsp; I reported this to them, and they wanted me to run something and send back, but haven't gotten to it yet.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So now since the last Windows update, my computer won't sleep for more than 20 minutes or so.&nbsp; You sleep the computer, and it wakes up anywhere from 3 to 20 minutes later.&nbsp; The monitor time is still at 2hr now (not 15min) so that may have been fixed (so
 perhaps it was one of the Windows updates that did that??).&nbsp;&nbsp; So runing powercfg -lastwake shows that it's wuauserv that is waking the computer (unfortunately it doesn't have the time/date).&nbsp;&nbsp; The Windows update was set to install automatically, I think I
 always keep it to download but ask, which I change it to, after first I thought that fixed it because it stayed asleep a bit longer (the 20 min) but then still woke up.&nbsp;&nbsp; So I searched the internet and have noticed recently that there are a lot of people saying
 the something from Win7 to Win10.&nbsp;&nbsp; I don't want to disable the wake timers so backups can run when needed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, I've been doing this to the same system for years and years with no issues.&nbsp;&nbsp; So it seems that either Windows update has bugs just introduced,
 or a lot of people are getting some type of super virus, that is waking the computer that nothing can detect?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this issue known and being worked on?&nbsp; You can search "wuauserv keeps waking computer" and see a lot of new recent activity since oct or so.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I have to type this all again, because I hit "mark as answer" before hitting submit, since I thought it was related to this message).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It turns out that it was Bitlocker Internet Security 2015 causing the power configuration issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was previously using either 2014 or 2013.&nbsp;&nbsp; It force the 2015 update and that is when it all must have started.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Their support said to try the 2016 version which was a free upgrade, not sure why they didn't install that when they forced 2015 version on.&nbsp;&nbsp; I did the install and now everything is working (2hr says, no wake from sleep last night).</p>
<p>
</p><p>MS may want to work on what caused the last wake if there is a way to do it, or put a time/date on it so they know it wasn't caused by windows update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>

<p><span>Hi
<span>Metajim,</span></span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft windows vista forums!</span></p>
<p><span>According the game manufacturer you need to install steam. So I would suggest you to install steam first and check
 if it works.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>In the box</strong> –you have a small leaflet explaining you need Steam to install the game. Also, check
</span><span>if there are any patches available from the game manufacturer for steam setup</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important:-</span></strong><span>Using
 Third Party Software, including hardware drivers can cause serious problems that may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the use of Third Party Software can be solved. Using Third Party Software
 is at your own risk.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Check the following steps to fix this issue.</span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Install Empire: Total War from the install disc instead of Steam.</span></span></p>
<p><span>If you have the boxed retail version of Empire Total War and it is trying to download the full game via Steam,
 please follow the instructions below:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Launch STEAM and click the 'My Game' Tab.
<br />
2. Right click on Empire: Total War and click 'Delete local content'. The non-installed information will appear next to the game.<br />
3. Insert Disk 1 into your DVD drive and close Steam (File, Exit).<br />
4. From the Windows Desktop, click on the Start Button, (XP) click Run&nbsp;(Vista) type Run into the Start Search box and choose Run from the list.</span></p>
<p><span>In the window Run box enter the following:</span></p>
<p><span><em><span>c:\program files\steam\steam.exe -install E:</span></em></span></p>
<p><span>- If your CD/DVD drive is not E: please change it accordingly.<br />
- If Steam is not installed within c:\program files\steam, change the path accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span>5. Press OK, Steam should now start the installation from the Disk 1 and will ask for Disk 2 a bit later on.<br />
6. At the end of the installation process, Steam will connect on Internet to download a small update which should take no more than few minutes.</span></p>
<p>If the issue persists,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Try to install the game in clean boot
</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Put the computer in clean boot</span></strong><span>
 (to figure out if any third party software is hindering the process)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></p>

<p><span>Perform a clean boot (check step 1 of the link) and then try to install the game.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Important:</span></strong><span>
 - remember to put the computer back to normal startup</span></p>

    <title>Xbox Crashing - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrgtnoscoper479  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Crashing</h2>
                    <p>I can not do this anymore. My xbox has been working fine for a long time, never has had an issue, and it's clean. But i cannot seem to play popular games anymore. Everytime I play Fortnite or Apex, my game will crash either on the menu, lobby, or in game.
 It will literally just shutdown the whole system for no reason. But every other game I play like NBA Live 19, Madden, TWD, etc works fine with no crashes. But when it comes to the free BR games my xbox just crashes as if it cant handle the gameplay.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If i knew anything about this before i bought xbox, id buy a PS4. It is absolutely ridiculous. Uninstalling and reinstalling both games worked for about an hour and then it would do the same thing. IveI hard reset my console numerous times, including power
 cycle. I've tried doing a full shutdown, i tried deleting big games, i even tried leaving my console off for 24 hours and it still does the same thing. And no one else seems to be having this issue. I am actually aggravated and want to just throw it in a wall
 already. (Expression ofc)</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I don't know what to do anymore so i might quit entirely, idk.</p>

            If I remember right there was some problems with the Original Xbox One and Fortnite making it crash last summer, but you also mention Apex is doing the same thing. Maybe a full factory reset instead of a hard reboot might help. If you do one just make
 sure you know your login info for Xbox Live. Although that would get rid of everything and I know the pain of reinstalling a bunch of games and their updates. Is there a way you can put BR games on a external HDD? But I don't think even that would work.

<p>UPDATE: I think it is overheating, I'm not quite sure however. It was getting hot and i didn't hear anything in the fan, so i put my fan against the top vents and it was working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>But i have seen other xbox owmers with overheating problems get a error message that explains why it shuts down. I have never got that warning or message. Ever. Which is really confusing.</p>

<p>Hello Fellow Gamer,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason could be the console is shutting down before it gets to hot for the message. We recommend to get the console repaired. Most likely, the console will continue to overheat, may be due to fan not working correctly. You can set one up on

<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We don't recommend any kind of self repair or dismantling of the console and we shouldn't be discussing the possibility of that either here on the forums.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you have the original, it's possible that the power supply is the one overheating or malfunctioning causing the Xbox to crash. Generally, if the LED indicator on the power supply turns off after a power cycle and then plugging into the Xbox and it
 does not come back on, then the power supply will need to be replaced. You will have to locate one online or from a local game store.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue is&nbsp;narrowed down to the console and not the power supply then you will need to set up a repair from the
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/devices" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
device support</a> page referenced by Brad or <a href="https://support.xbox.com/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<h2>            Problem with webcam working with camera.app and Skype</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For the past (not sure how long, since its been awhile since I used my webcam) at least week I can't get my cam to work on Skype.&nbsp; My pic shows up on the home page and when the call is connecting, but when you go to turn the cam on, it does its sit and spin
 thing.&nbsp; I've cleaned my PC, uninstalled and reinstalled my cam driver twice, its up to date, modified my registry, blah blah.&nbsp; It still doesn't work in camera.app, altho I do get a different error msg now (0xA00F4244(0xC00D36D5)).&nbsp; I've also checked privacy
 settings and everything's ok there too.&nbsp; I have gone thru just about every solution in this forum and nothing is working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hardware being used: Asus M2N32-SLI Deluxe motherboard, QuadCore AMD Phenom II X4 945, 3000 MHz, all drivers are current as of 12:00pm CST, using latest version of Win10, all up to date as of the same time given earlier.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Webcam: PS3-Eye Webcam, Code Laboratories, Driver Code Laboratories, Inc. Product Version 5.3.0.0341</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see a place where you can add an attachment, I have a copy of DxDiag.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update:&nbsp; after all the tomfoolery, my cam is no longer showing up in skype either....ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh</p>

            No, it did not help.&nbsp; My camera is showing up just fine under Device Manager and is working properly.&nbsp; Thing is, it was working perfectly fine, albeit grainy (as usual due to lighting) at least a month or so ago.&nbsp; I don't know what happened, if it was
 a Skype problem (since it won't show up there at all but yet still uses the audio as having the microphone installed and running and instead of being called PS3 Eye its called microphone (2- USB Camera-B4.09.24.01).&nbsp; Actually, I don't even know if camera.app
 ever did work.<br />

            My Skype problem is getting worse even tho its working on the 'tools' menu, if you try to use the cam during a Skype call it gets all crackly and then you have to change ports or hang up.&nbsp; My camera.app is STILL not working.&nbsp; Just so you know.

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is a PS3 Eye Camera, which is an external cam connected via USB.&nbsp; It works fine using the software supplied with the camera.&nbsp; Camera.app still does not work.&nbsp; I have already tried changing ports so its not that.&nbsp; I've also run the troubleshooter twice
 which didn't help.</p>

            <p>If your other camera is working fine and not the PS3 Eye camera, possible that the issue is with the camera hardware itself. Though if you can try connecting your PS3 camera on a different PC/laptop so we can fully isolate the issue.</p>

            I only have this one camera, I DON'T have an onboard cam anywhere, I have a desktop and I don't have a laptop.&nbsp; Sorry about any confusion.&nbsp; I have my own drivers for the PS3 Eye, which are up to date and it also comes with its own test program, on which
 the camera works fine.<br />

<p>I downloaded the driver in the last couple of days, so that's up to date - and the printer will work when connected to our PC via the old style 21(?) pin type lead - but that won't print using the USB lead either.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks Judie</p>

<h2>            Epson scanner not found</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>

</p><p>I installed a new Epson Expression 345 wifi printer / scanner.&nbsp; I managed to use Windows scan once but it no longer finds the printer.&nbsp; I have reinstalled the drivers - the printer prints fine but it will not scan and the Windows app cant see the printer.

<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
There may be several reasons why your printer/scanner won't work. One of which may be due to a misconfigured setting of your printer's driver. Another reason may be due to driver incompatibility. To assist you with your concern, kindly answer the questions
 below:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>How did you go about reinstalling the driver? Did it come from a CD?</li><li>Are you using a USB cable to connect your computer to the printer?</li><li>What is the current version/build of your Windows 10? To check, type <strong>
winver </strong>on <strong>Cortana's</strong> search field and press <strong>Enter</strong>.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>We'll be looking forward for your response.</p>
        </p>

<p>We appreciate your response. Since you have already installed the latest driver for your device, we recommend that you get in touch with your device manufacturer's support site. This issue may be caused by a misconfigured setting on your printer and it would
 be best to contact them for further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
