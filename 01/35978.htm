                    I got a phone call today from someone saying they were from Windows and that my PC has reported errors?They asked me to type in the 'run' menu to show the errors then they asked me to go to this site http://www.teamviewer.com/en/index.aspx .I had to hang
 up at this point to go out but does anyone know anything about this or had a phone call?

<br />
I think the first answer missed the OPs basic question here. lol<br />
<br />
Yes you can do it.&nbsp;You need to find where the install package was downloaded to, then simply burn them to a CD/DVD, or copy to a second/external hard drive.
<br />
<br />
Finding the files can be tricky depending on which site you bought them from, I've used Steam, EA, and D2D. I find D2D is the easiest to find, right in to my&nbsp;default download folder. :)&nbsp;In fact a couple of games when burned to a DVD actually became the same
 as a retail copy. EA was a bit hard to find, but I was able to locate them as well and back them up. They seem to end up in a temp folder nested in the EA downloader program's folder. I only have one Steam game, and haven't bothered to search for it's install
 files, it wasn't that big a file, so another download won't kill me. For any other services I can't say I'm afraid, but they shouldn't be too hard to find.<br />
<br />
Now as for when you do have to reinstall a game, the first reply was pretty much correct. Things will vary depending on which site supplied the file. In fact if it's a site supplying from different publishers, things can even vary from game to game. For example&nbsp;I've
 bought&nbsp;the lions share of my download games from D2D, Gothic&nbsp;3&nbsp;only needed the one verification the first time I installed it, with the many community patches of the game, I've done about&nbsp;4 uninstall/reinstalls and everything been fine. On the other hand I
 have 2 Ubisoft games, HoMM needs to be reactivated pretty much every time I install new video drivers, as well&nbsp;my account for the game was only allowed 5 reactivations till I e-mailed D2D.&nbsp;The other game, Settlers, only&nbsp;needs reactivation on a reinstall.<br />
<br />
So my advice is check very carefully with each provider, as to&nbsp;what happens if you use a back up instead of downloading again.&nbsp;If they try to tell you&nbsp;that you can't back up any files, you need to explain to them it's your
<strong>legal right to make back ups</strong>&nbsp;. Which it is, your just not allowed to circumvent any copy protection/user verification in the process.

    <title>HELP&#33;&#33; Windows 10 1709 Trying To Force An Upgrade On My 1607 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> donsmith330  say:</h3>
<h2>            HELP&#33;&#33; Windows 10 1709 Trying To Force An Upgrade On My 1607 Pro Computers</h2>
                    <p>So, I have all the known — at least to me — settings in place on all three of my WIN 10 1607 Pro computers to keep MS from force feeding any of them the WIN 10 1709 Upgrade. I’m not going to take the time to list all the settings I’ve made and programs I
 use to accomplish this, but trust me, I have my computers locked down like the gold at Ft. Knox.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Today, on my Desktop Computer, I went to check for updates with my favorite tool, and hide them until the unpaid beta testers have had a chance to absorb the pain of anything that might&nbsp;break, hose or brick my computers, plus wait for&nbsp;any new&nbsp;patches to
 fix broken patches.&nbsp;That's an all-to often occurrence&nbsp;since WaaS reared it's ugly head. &nbsp;Some months we've had two or more Cumulative Updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But today? Surprise, surprise, surprise! After I had hidden all the monthly updates and had updated the Windows Defender virus definitions, but before I could turn Services back off, guess what popped up? Why, it was the good old
<strong>Windows 10 Update Assistant</strong> and the upgrade to WIN 10 1709 was speeding right along!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I cursed a few times, shut down the computer with the ON/OFF Button on the CPU, unplugged the router power cord to shut down the Internet connection, and cursed a few more times.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, right now I have a pretty little shortcut to the <strong>Windows 10 Update Assistant
</strong>on my desktop, and two new folders on the root of my C:/ drive: <em>$GetCurrent</em> and
<em>Windows 10 Upgrade</em>. The <em>$GetCurrent</em> folder is created during the upgrade process. It contains a log file about the last Windows upgrade. The
<em>Windows 10 Upgrade</em> folder has a slew of files and folders and, since it contains
<strong>Windows10UpgraderApp.exe</strong>, I’m guessing it’s the files for the upgrade to 1709.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now mind you, all this is AFTER uninstalling the <strong>Update for Windows 10 for x64-based Systems (KB4023057)</strong>, and running disk cleaners, including&nbsp;the Windows Disk Cleanup program, set to Clean up System Files. I see that the
<strong>Windows 10 Update Assistant</strong> has magically reappeared, also.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But that ain’t all, folks! I checked my other two computers, where both have had settings in place to keep MS from forcing the WIN 10 1709 Upgrade. All I did was turn them on today and boot them up. Lo and behold, the
<strong>Update for Windows 10 for x64-based Systems (KB4023057)</strong> has automagically appeared on the other two computers! Somehow, it’s made it’s way through all the settings to keep MS from force feeding them the WIN 10 1709 Upgrade!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, that’s my story and I’m sticking to it. But I can’t tell you how angry I am right now. I’ve taken my anxiety meds!</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I just don’t know where to go from here. I’ve got that danged <strong>Update for Windows 10 for x64-based Systems (KB4023057)</strong> just sitting there on all three of my computers just waiting to get it’s fat, sweaty palms on the Windows Update Service
 so it can do it’s dirty deed. And as far as I know, you can’t get rid of it. And if you do … it’ll be back. Looks like&nbsp;we’re all going to eventually succumb to WaaS and it’s dastardly ways, or else!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, I’m just going to sit tight right where I am. NO updates, NO upgrades, NO NOTHING until I'm in a better condition to think straight. If anyone has any suggestions, I’d appreciate them. Really. I’m utterly at a loss.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Listen, I don't want to do an in-place upgrade of my computers every six months. It's ridiculous. Besides, in-place upgrades are downright dangerous. Things get broken, bricked or hosed, and it takes two weeks or more to get everything changed back to the
 way you want them. And when you have three computers to deal with, it's even worse.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want the ability to update and upgrade my computers on MY schedule, not forced to abide my MS's nonsensical and untested Monthly Cumulative Updates and semi-annual Upgrades. The promised support period for 1607 hasn't even run out yet and for at least
 two months MS has been trying to force a 1709 Upgrade on us. Heck, they're even doing it for 1703! Why, for goodness sake? We should be able to use our versions of WIN 10 until they're no longer supported, and only have to Upgrade at least every 18 months
 or so. That I could take. What I can't take is FORCED UPGRADES BEFORE MY CURRENT VERSION IS SUPPOSED TO STILL BE SUPPORTED WITH SECURITY UPDATES! What I can't take is MICROSOFT CHANGING AND/OR WORKING AROUND MY UPDATE AND UPGRADE SETTINGS AND FORCING ME ONTO
 THE "LATEST AND GREATEST". Yea, right.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The last "great" version of Windows I remember was WIN 7. Forget viruses and security threats out in the wild, this WaaS and WIN 10 cow manure is a far greater threat to the safe, smooth and secure operation of our computers than any virus&nbsp;or security threat
 that might infect our computers. I've used every version of Windows from 3.1 to 10, and I've NEVER HAD A VIRUS OR SECURITY BREACH!!! I've simply always run security software and&nbsp;observed obvious safe computing practices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've never had broken, hosed and bricked computers&nbsp;until this&nbsp;deranged WaaS and WIN 10 came along. I hated WIN 8, but at least it was reasonably safe to use. Not so with WaaS and WIN 10! Unless MS gets this mess fixed pretty darned soon,&nbsp;I’m getting real
 close to getting this piece of crud off all of my computers and replacing it with, oh, I don’t know, Linux? Vista? XP? Anything but the “greatest Windows operating system ever!” I call bullsh*t on that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Listen, I've always been among the first to upgrade when new versions were released. I love new stuff. But with WaaS and WIN 10 and their break, brick and hose update and upgrade schedule, computing is just no fun anymore. It's just a continuous battle trying
 to protect yourself from&nbsp;the monsters lurking in the next pile of crud to come down the MS Update chute.</p>

<p>Good luck with that - I was actively on the insider programmer for like 2 years or something and the top 10 items on the feedback hub thingy was about 60% complaints about the update behaviour along the lines of what you are talking about and they were COMPLETELY
 ignored in favour if the feedback that fitted with what they wanted to see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An OS should be about enabling the end user nothing less nothing more - the current update system completely fails in that metric - at best you might see another of those, for many users, completely worthless "hours" implementations.

 not yet the case for me. The good folks in Redmond are a giant monopoly that has a stranglehold that will be awfully hard, if not impossible. to break, I fear. Too bad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm still weighing my options on what to do next. Right now I have Windows Update Service completely locked down and protected, though&nbsp;it looks as&nbsp;if&nbsp;MS&nbsp;is finding ways&nbsp;to get around that. But at least it buys me some time to get calmed down somewhat and
 hopefully get my thoughts together. Knowledgeable and helpful folks like yourself can be very helpful in that regard.</p>

            You can disable updates entirely and pick them up from the the Windows Update Catalog when you want them. That's the only option you have, I think.

<p>Don't have a solution for you, but I am having the EXACT same issue. I'm also running the same version of windows and have taken very similar steps to disable and lockdown windows. A few months ago I also completely disabled windows update service altogether
 as well (removed all the tasks in task scheduler for windows update as well). Somehow it's STILL re-enabling itself and trying to update to 1709 without my permission. It's so annoying. Microsoft must have done something recently prompting this, or they must
 have embedded&nbsp;some kind of timed forced upgrade to force upgrades to go out before the end of service date hits... So it may not be possible to use Windows 10 at all without forced upgrades unless you don't use an internet connection, as it can re-enable the
 windows update service by itself. (only possible solution I could think of is using your router to block all&nbsp;microsoft&nbsp;ip addresses to prevent any updates. Cant do it inside windows, because windows ignores the hosts file for microsoft&nbsp;ips....)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm getting pretty close to dumping windows for Linux at this point. I'm sick of forced updates happening at extremely inopportune times, causing loss of work/data as well as interfering with playing online games. I would have long been on linux&nbsp;if it was
 possible to get FFXIV and Overwatch working reliably (but even if you get them working, often large patches will break the game in WINE, and those games update often enough). Going to try and see if it's feasible to run those games on a windows 7 VM or something.
 Also, wIth Windows 10 S (only allowed to run windows store apps, no win32 executables work) now in the mix, it's only a matter of time before its MANDATORY to use that version; So it's probably a good idea to dump windows soon anyway. Seems GabeN was right
 when they seen the windows store on windows 8 that microsoft was eventually going to block all apps that are not in their store. Its all in the name of "security". Sounds an awful lot like trading freedoms to "stop terrorists".... Thanks, but I'll take my
 chances with the botnets and malware and terrorists.</p>

<p>I hear you, <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/05ad034a-783a-4897-8954-6b3df4ceed44" title="Filenotfoundx">
<a href="https://www.mcbsys.com/blog/2018/02/windows-10-forces-early-upgrade-behaves-like-a-virus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
HERE</a>. I followed all the tips and, so far, so good. I doubt it'll last very long though, and you still can't let Windows Update Service run, or the Upgrade will probably start all over again. But at least it looks, so far, that the computers are locked
 down sufficiently enough to hold the Windows Update Assistant at bay until I can get a plan put together on where to go from here.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I booted up the desktop this morning, the Upgrade started immediately again. I unplugged the router and, with the help of the above linked page, got the computers cleaned up&nbsp;again and locked down enough that they've been quiet so far.</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>LanguageComponentsInstaller is associated with Windows 10 to support different languages. When making it available in other languages, Windows will create a different set of program files and a task in order to display user interface elements in another
 language.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it is preventing your system from shutting down, it is possible that a recently installed language pack is incompatible. May we know if a recent language pack is installed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If it happened after an update, you may restore your PC from a system restore point. Restoring from a restore point won't affect your personal files, but it will remove apps, drivers, and updates installed. Here's how to restore from a system restore point:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the <strong>Start </strong>button, then type <strong>control panel</strong>, then select
<strong>Control Panel </strong>from the search results.</li><li>Search <strong>Control Panel </strong>for <strong>Recovery</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Recovery </strong>&gt; <strong>Open System Restore</strong> &gt; <strong>
Next</strong>.</li><li>Choose the restore point related to the app, driver, or update, and then select
<strong>Next </strong>&gt; <strong>Finish</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: If you are not seeing any restore points, it means that system protection isn't turned on. To check, go to
<strong>Control Panel</strong>, search for <strong>Recovery</strong>, and then select
<strong>Recovery</strong> &gt; <strong>Configure System Restore </strong>&gt; <strong>Configure</strong>, and make sure
<strong>Turn on system protection </strong>is selected.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If restoring from a system restore point does not help, you may disable the service or task by using the
<strong>System Configuration</strong> utility. Here's how:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Start </strong>button, then type <strong>msconfig</strong>, and select
<strong>System Configuration </strong>from the search results.</li><li>On the <strong>Services </strong>tab of the <strong>System Configuration </strong>
dialog box, search for the task, then click to clear the check box for the problem item.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If you need further assistance, feel free to ask us.</p>

<h2>            Intel i3 6100 fan running at max speed for no reason&#33;</h2>
                    On December 26th, I moved my PC into a new case. For about a week, my CPU fan kept spinning at max speed for no reason and i couldnt change it in the BIOS or anything. I booted up my PC on January 2nd and for some reason, my fan was normal. A week later
 today, after the new update, my CPU fan is back to spinning at 100%. My temps are very low so there's no reason for it to be spinning so fast; any help? running the stock cooler with an MSI H110M Pro-VH motherboard and a GTX 970. CPU usage in task manager
 is pretty low as well.&nbsp;

<p>Can this be done?</p>

<p>I have found SyncToy 2.1 from MS Download Center, but I don't know if it will work for my setup.</p>

                    <p>I have split an image.wim file using the imagex /split command with success. I wrote the split images to DVD's. When trying to Apply the images from the DVD's i get an error message like " error, no reference data ".&nbsp; This error comes at the end of the first
 DVD write. Any ideas on the correct syntax or cann't you apply an image from .swm files? Some articles suggest that you have to combine all of the .swm files into the original .wim file to apply it?</p>

</p><p><span>Thanks for updating us with your reply. As FH4 keeps taking you back to the home screen, you may want to try uninstalling the game, rebooting the console and following that, then
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/networking/using-xbox-one-offline" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
take the console into offline mode</a>, reinstall your game on disc during this time and once again go back to online mode so that it fully updates. Please don't attempt to launch the game prior to all the updates fully going through. Once everything completes,
 give it a try and see if it then launches correctly.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">To uninstall the game: </p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>From the <strong>Home</strong> screen, select <strong>My games &amp; apps</strong>.
</li><li>Highlight the game title that you want to uninstall. </li><li>Press the <strong>Menu</strong> button on your controller. </li><li>Select <strong>Manage game &amp; add-ons</strong>. </li><li>Highlight the game title and press the <strong>Menu</strong> button again. </li><li>Select <strong>Uninstall</strong>. Once completed, then restart your console.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Now, reinstall the game with the console offline:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Press the <strong>Xbox</strong> button to open the guide. </li><li>Select <strong>Sign in</strong>. </li><li>Select your account, and then select <strong>Sign out</strong>. <br />
<strong>Note</strong> Make sure <strong>all</strong> accounts are signed out so that the console is not connected to Xbox Live for the next step.
</li><li>Insert the game disc into your console. The console will check whether the game is already installed. Since you previously removed this game from your console, you should now be prompted to install the game.
</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Give this a try and let us know the results.</p>
<p>I hope this helps a bit more.</p>

</p><p><span>Thanks again for updating us with your reply and sorry to hear that so far, you're still getting the same issue. You stated that you got a warning page in your original post and I was wondering if you'd be able to provide a bit more detail
 in what you're getting. Is it a specific error message or code you're receiving, and if so, what does it entail?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Additionally, at this point, you have a couple of things yet to try:&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>A <a href="https://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/reset-console-to-factory-defaults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
full factory reset, removing everything</a> to fully ensure any corruption or damaged files are off your console's OS (best if happening to other games as well), or</span></li><li><span>somehow your disc is at fault in this scenario (you may want to fully inspect it to ensure that its clean and has no major scratches on the shiny side or into the printed side by holding it up to a light source).</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the game disc is damaged, then it will need to be replaced. Please see

            Thanks again.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I don't think so is about the disc.&nbsp;<br />
Because I just purchase the Digital version of FH4 and still not working.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
For the error details.&nbsp;<br />
Actually I didn't get any error code or message from the xbox.&nbsp;<br />
I just start the game and after few seconds it will freeze when it load to the warning page about drive safely in real life.&nbsp;<br />
U will see the cycle freeze for few seconds and it will back to the home screen itself.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
That's the situation of my xbox.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
I'm trying to full factory reset now. I will let you know will it works or not.&nbsp;<br />

                    My Dell home computer locks up at least once a day.&nbsp; When I open Task Manager, it shows everytime that the task "Dumprep.exe" is running 3 times concurrently taking up all the computer capability.&nbsp; The instructions I got from the MS Knowledge Area did
 not solve the problem.<br />
Anyone know how to disable or properly delete these three files so my computer will stop locking up?<br />

<p>I understand that dumprep.exe is slowing down and locking up your computer. Dumprep.exe normally is associated with error reporting from Microsoft.</p>
<p>However, malware can disguise themselves by that name. My recommendation is to scan for malware first.</p>

<p><a href="http://download.cnet.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html?part=dl-10804572&amp;subj=dl&amp;tag=button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.cnet.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html?part=dl-10804572&amp;subj=dl&amp;tag=button</a></p>
<p>To disable:</p>
<p>1. Click Control Panel</p>
<p>2. Click&nbsp;System</p>
<p>3. Click&nbsp;Advanced</p>
<p>4. Under&nbsp;Startup and Recovery, click Settings</p>
<p>5. Click "Disable error reporting"</p>
<p>All of&nbsp;the above applies if&nbsp;using "Classic View" under Control Panel&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

    <title>Error 1303 when trying to install STATA 9 &#40;run as adminstrator - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stata user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Error 1303 when trying to install STATA 9 &#40;run as adminstrator does not solve the problem&#41; </h2>
                    
<p>I have tried to install STATA 9 on my new laptop. However, I get "Error 1303 The installation has insufficient privileges to access this directory C:\windows\winSxS\amd_64_microsoft_vc80_openMP... The installation cannot continue. Log on as administrator..."
 I checked the STATA help for issues with Windows 7 and they recommend "run as administrator" when updating but there is no advice for issues with installation. I did try "run as administrator" when installing but I received the same error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can someone please let me know how to successfully install STATA 9 on a laptop running on Windows 7?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>Hello STATA User,</p>
<p>You will receive the above error if either of the following is true for the folder in which you are installing STATA 9:</p>
<ul>
<li>The SYSTEM group does not have Full Control privileges.
<div>-or-</div>
</li><li>The Everyone group does not have Full Control privileges. </li></ul>
<p>Check the permissions for the parent folders because the permissions on these folders may also cause this problem.<br />
The folder is: C:\windows\winSxS\amd_64_microsoft_vc80_openMP</p>
<p>Please reply&nbsp;back and let us know if this helps.</p>

<h2>            Dell Keyboard Malfunctioning</h2>
                    
<p><em><span><strong>When typing with my Dell wired Keyboard the letters run together, fails to seperate when hitting space key, fails in many cases to type letters by omitting the letters, and fails to type at all.. When typing E-mails,
 there has been incidents when the keyboard fails to type at all, and I click outside the e-mail area and hit the space bar and the typed data will appear in the area previously typed. How can this be corrected? lso is there a possibility that a real cold breeze
 could interfere with the keyboard response? I only have had this challenges since the weather changed.</strong></span></em></p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Is this a laptop or a separate keyboard on a PC? If the latter trying another keyboard and yours<br />
on another machine might be telling.<br />
<br />
If the problem persists then check with Dell Support and their forums for possible known issues.<br />

<p><span>Thank you for visiting Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>As per the description, I understand that you would like to change the polling rate of your mouse. I will certainly help you with the issue.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It is ideally recommended that you don’t over clock your USB devices. Hence we don’t suggest you to increase the polling rate for your USB devices. This would definitely increase the rate at which
 your USB devices respond. <br />
</span></p>
<p><span>However, overclocking the devices causes severe damage to the computer as your USB devices might malfunction and would not work in future.</span></p>

<p>work with my millions of entries contained in my Microsoft Money file.&nbsp; I'm very disappointed&nbsp; as usual with Microsoft.&nbsp; They created this entire problem.&nbsp; Hell, is there a way to communicate with them other than this.&nbsp; They outsource their problems to the

            <p>I've managed to find a fix after hours of searching!</p>
<p>
</p><p>You'll need to update an Internet Explorer record in the Windows Registry in order to run Microsoft Money 2003.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll assume that you're a novice (No Offence Intended) and guide you through the steps, one by one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. We'll need to open the registry editor, to do this you'll need to search for 'regedit', this can be achieved in the Windows 10 search.</p>
<p>2. Once open, you'll need to navigate your way through the registry, following the below path.</p>
<p>[Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer]</p>
<p>3. Click once on the Internet Explorer folder and you'll see a list of items on the right.</p>
<p>4. Change 'Version' so that the last digit is a zero.</p>
<p>For example, my current version number is [9.11.10240.16384], I simply changed it to [9.11.10240.0].</p>
<p>5. Once saved, you'll need to restart your PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>From this point on you should be able to run Microsoft Money 2003 with no problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know if you require any further assistance.</p>

<h3> david_s_k21  say:</h3>
<h2>            Have Windows 10  with NVidia Quadro K3100M and intel integrated video cards in mobile workstation - had 3 monitors now only 2</h2>
                    <p>How do I get windows 10 pro&nbsp;to recognise the two external monitors as well as the integrated display&nbsp;, one is connected to the HDMI (wired internally to the K3100M Card) and the other to the VGA (wired internally to the intel Card)</p>
<p>
</p><p>The Internal screen seems to be wired via the Intel Card.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have latest Drivers installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Note Worked perfectly well with Windows 7 Pro</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>ps Use the laptop on the road so can't disable intel graphics as that would Kill Battery Life also need the vga port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't have any display port displays but have this port on the K3100M as well so I should be able to run 3 external monitors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also can have both adaptors running at same time so that not the problem, but if connect vga display when the HDMI one is running , then widows switches the external display to the vga (intel port) and switches the HDMI off.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NVidia Control panel shows that it knows about the HDMI display but windows ignoring it</p>

 have transferred as a load of data files under a folder: 'USMT2.UNC'. I can find no way to open these files! My computer tried to open them with Word Pad, but they just read as gobbledegook (ie nonsense characters). What can I do now? They contain the entire

 any way I can get the previous version of Skype back??&nbsp;
