<h2>            Do I need System Restore enabled on drives other than the C drive&#63;</h2>
                    I've always set System Restore on all internal hard drives and partitions, but, yesterday, after walking through a complete re-install, a Microsoft Tier 2 technician said I only needed it on the C drive. Discuss.

            Even though I already know how to make a restore point when things are working properly, I followed your advice to the letter, and got no better results.&nbsp; When I got to #7, you told me to uncheck the D: drive, and to check the C: drive, however, the D:
 drive didn't have a tick in the box, and the C: drive did.&nbsp; At the same time...it was reporting that there was a restore point on my D: drive, but none on my C: drive.&nbsp; SO..I unchecked the C: drive, (after disabling my antivirus, etc), Then I enabled, then
 DISabled my D: drive, and then I enabled the C: drive again, so that it was the only thing with a tick in the box.&nbsp; At that point, I went ahead and created a restore point. When it finished, it told me that making the restore point was successful. (yeah..right!)&nbsp;

 again, only to have it tell me that I have no restore points made. The same window shows a check mark next to my C: drive, with no restore point, and an UNchecked D: drive..and next to it is the restore point I just tried to make for the C: drive.&nbsp;

<p>System restore points only contain specific system level files such as DLLs, registry files and so on. As these are almost always on the %SystemDrive% which by default is the C including the other drives would be pointless as there is nothing on them which

I'll take "in most cases, yes" to mean keep on including SR on my other drives. Restore points are my first point of call for problems - that's why I've spent the last 10 weeks working out why they were all getting wiped out &nbsp;all the time.

That's fine in theory, but, in practice, you often find it fails to restore to the latest point and you have to try an earlier one

<h2>            Window 10&#58; Random BSOD, Restart Issue - PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA &#38; MEMORY_MANAGEMENT</h2>
                    <p>I have been experiencing BSOD very often and there is no pattern to which I could isolate the problem with.</p>
<p>The two modules which are always crashing my PC is ntoskrnl.exe &amp; bcmwl63a.sys. And the most common bug error is PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA, out of ten crashes 8 will be due to this.<br />
<br />
Occasionally when starting or restarting the PC (more than often it is when restarting due to updates) my PC will freeze at the Windows logo and spinning dot, which I have to manually shut it down and turn it on again.<br />
</p>
<p>I thought my PC will freeze or crash if I play any graphic intensive games, which to my surprise it did not, in fact it worked flawlessly.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>RAM</strong><br />
I have ran memtest+86 for both of my ram sticks. Stick A ran 7 passes in slot 1 with zero error and 4 passes in slot 2 with zero error. Stick B refuse to run in slot 1 but ran 7 passes in slot 2 with zero error.<br />
<br />
<strong>Drivers</strong><br />
I have also updated all my drivers with Driver Booster 3. My graphic card is updated as well.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hello Joan,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for contacting Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We're sorry to hear the inconvenience you have experienced.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Did you made any changes to your PC recently?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The <strong>PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA </strong>bug check indicates that invalid system memory has been referenced.&nbsp;This Stop message occurs when requested data is not found in memory. The system generates a fault, which normally indicates that the system
 looks for data in the paging file. In this circumstance, however, the missing data is identified as being located within an area of memory that cannot be paged out to disk. The system faults, but cannot find, the data and is unable to recover. Faulty hardware,
 a buggy system service, antivirus software, and a corrupted NTFS volume can all generate this type of error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have installed any driver or application recently, I suggest you to uninstall the same to see if it fix the issue. If possible, try to restore your PC to earlier point. This option takes your PC back to an earlier point in time, called a system restore
 point. Restore points are generated when you install a new app, driver, or Windows update, and when you

    <title>Notepad.exe bad image error - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Notepad.exe bad image error</h2>
                    <p>Running Windows 7 on my desktop and just recently started getting this error whenever I start up notepad and do a Save or Save As:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "C:\Users\myacct\AppData\Local\{72d9e87c-9dbe-bb9d-fd1b-b65ffa0bff1e}\n is either not designed to run on Windows or it contains an error. Try installing the program again using the original installation media or contact your sys admin or the s/w vendor
 for support."</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran sfc, full scans with Norton and Malwarebytes and everything came up clean.&nbsp; I looked in the AppData\Local folder for this {72d9e... folder and it doesn't exist. One interesting thing I noticed is that after Malwarebytes finished it popped up notepad
 with the txt file of the scan results. I was able to do a Save As without any error.&nbsp; So I brought up Task Mgr to look at the notepad process.&nbsp; Malwarebytes invoked notepad.exe from C:\Windows whereas the notepad I have pinned to my taskbar and the one that
 is run from Start-&gt;All Programs-&gt;Accessories is from C:\Windows\System32.</p>
<p>Don't know what the diffs are between these 2.&nbsp; Any idea what is causing this problem &amp; how can I reinstall notepad?&nbsp; Not sure if I have the Windows install CD since it was loaded on through Dell.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>UPDATE: went back to the \AppData\Local folder and unchecked the "hide protected system files" feature for it and was able to find the {72d9e... folder.&nbsp; It contained 2 files: "@" and "n" and 2 empty folders: "L" and "U".&nbsp; I took a guess that the {72d9e
 folder got corrupted and renamed it to sav{72d9e...</p>
<p>(created a system restore point first) and then rebooted.&nbsp; Brought up notepad from the taskbar &amp; was able to create &amp; save a file!! woo-hoo! It also worked with running it from the start menu-&gt;all programs-&gt;accessories and also from c:\windows\notepad.exe.&nbsp;
 so...looks like problem may be fixed? maybe just that file was corrupted and needed to be deleted?&nbsp;&nbsp; I would appreciate any input/ideas on whether or not&nbsp;this was the right fix.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The above issue might occur due to temporary glitch in the network, maximum phones or other devices connected to the network or if the password of the network entered is incorrect.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Before we assist further, I would like to ask you a few questions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>What is the make and model of the mobile device?</span></li><li><span>Did you check if the network password entered is not compromised with other caps or numerical characters?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Check if the characters of the network password entered is correct. If the password characters entered is correct, disable Wi-Fi connectivity on the mobile device, reboot the Wi-Fi network device
 and try connecting to the network on the mobile and check if the issue is resolved.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue persists, remove the Wi-Fi network from the mobile device by selecting “forget this network” and configure fresh to check if the issue is resolved. Also check the number of devices
 connected to the network, some of the networks allow limited devices to connect.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Write to us with the answers to the above questions and the status of not able to connect to Wi-Fi on the mobile device in the same post for further assistance. Your reply is most important for
 us to ensure we assist you accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We appreciate the information you have provided and we’d like to get you sorted.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To fix this error, let us perform the following methods:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 1: <span><span>Use the Network troubleshoote</span></span></span><span><span><span>r</span></span></span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>Select the </span></span><span><strong><span>Start</span></strong></span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>symbol</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>button.</span></span></span></span></li><li><span><span>select <strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Network &amp; Internet</strong> &gt;
<strong>Status</strong> &gt; <strong>Network troubleshooter</strong> under <strong>Change your network settings.</strong></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong><span><strong><span>Check</span></strong></span><span><strong><span>&nbsp;</span></strong></span><span><span><span><strong><span>Wi</span></strong></span><strong><span><span>-Fi drivers and settings in Windows 10</span></span></strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Usually, having the latest driver for your device is the best policy because it has all the latest fixes for your device. Sometimes, though, sticking with an older driver is better because the same driver files are used for
 different PC models at times, but things don’t work as expected.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">To check for the latest drivers automatically</span></span>:</p>
<ol>
<li><span><span>in <strong>Device Manager</strong>, select <strong>Network adapters</strong>, press and hold (or right-click)
<strong>Update Driver Software.</strong></span></span></li><li><span><span>Select <strong>Search automatically</strong> for the updated driver software. If a new driver is found, it’ll be downloaded and installed automatically.</span></span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If a new driver isn't found, check the device manufacturer’s website for the latest driver, download it, and then install it manually. To find out how to do this, see Fix network connection issues.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you install a new network adapter driver and your</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span><span><span>Wi-Fi</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>connection gets worse after that, you can
 roll back the driver to the previous version. (To find out how, see Fix network connection issues.) The same is true if you already have the latest driver and want to use an older driver version instead.</span></span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 3: </strong></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">If that doesn’t fix your connection problem, try these things:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>&nbsp; -Reset the TCP/IP stack</span></span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><br />
<span><span>&nbsp; -Release the IP address</span></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><br />
<span><span>&nbsp; -Renew the IP address</span></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><br />
<span><span>&nbsp; -Flush and reset the DNS client resolver cache</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><br />
<strong><span><span>To run these networking commands in a command prompt window&nbsp;</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>1. In the search box on the taskbar, type <strong>Command prompt,
</strong>press and hold (or right-click) Command prompt, and then select <strong>
Run as administrator &gt; Yes.</strong></span></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>2. At the <strong>command prompt, </strong>run the following commands in the listed order, and then check to see if that fixes your connection problem:</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type netsh winsock reset and press Enter.</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></span><span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><br />
<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type netsh int ip reset and press Enter.</span></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><br />
<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type ipconfig /release and press Enter.</span></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><br />
<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type ipconfig /renew and press Enter.</span></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><br />
<span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Type ipconfig /flushdns and press Enter.</span></span></span></span></p>

            Hi Marcus, my name is Martin and I'm an Independent Advisor. I'll try to help you here.
<br />It is set by default that the app has a save location and you are unable to change it. There are only a few apps that can give you an option to set the path. The Windows Update will not alter these app specific settings.

    <title>Windows 10&#58; Audio and video files won&#39;t play. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> metalsqueak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10&#58; Audio and video files won&#39;t play.</h2>
                    <p>Upgraded to 10 a few days ago. Having a few problems with it, but not sure what is my computer (it's an older laptop..I think almost 6 years old now). &nbsp;It's an HP Pavilion dv7-3057nr.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, I tried playing music in iTunes. No song would play. It won't even start. I checked to make sure that my files are still where they're supposed to be, and they are. Having read that maybe iTunes hasn't updated to be fully compatible with 10, I tried
 the Windows music player, and still nothing. Just says it can't play it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Second, I have no sound. I've done every fix I could find. From checking for new drivers, to uninstalling them and reinstalling them, to checking settings and testing to make sure things are working. I can sometimes get sound on headphones, but that's iffy.
 I see that thos is a common problem with the upgrade.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thanks!</p>

            I just updated to windows 10, based on the promise that all your files will be just as you left them. I wasn't aware I needed to ask if I could still open or use any of them. Since the update, I can no longer watch any of the video files I have on my PC.
 Which is almost the only reason&nbsp;I own my PC. This makes me feel like I was coerced into updating to an inferior product, that renders my PC into a substantially oversized paperweight. I would like to know how to fix this please. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

            1.Yes, I've already install Japanese language pack.
<div>2.No , Internet Explorer can display Japanese letter.</div>
<div>3.Yes, I've already done that.</div>
<div><br />
<div>More info - At first Japanese language was display properly but it was not working after some Windows Update about a week ago.<br />
(I didn't install program or messing with language setting in that time so I think it was Windows update)<br />
<br />
Thanks for assisting me.</div>

    <title>Dead Xbox One Controller - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stunningtube420  say:</h3>
<h2>            Dead Xbox One Controller</h2>
                    
<p>After trying to update the controller it was up to 4% then the console rebooted. Now the controller does not work at all, how do you say it's "Bricked" of essentially a "paperweight". Tried all of the standard suggestions i could find. Take the batteries
 out, restart the console, plug in the cable to the controller any other suggestions? I hear that Microsoft will not support the controller after 3 months, that is actually bad for business when it's their fault that the update did not work. Really MAD at this
 point of even the thought of spending more for another controller that they essentially BROKE.Anyone from Microsoft want to Chime in.</p>

<p>All this before you got a single achievement. </p>
<p>You really were robbed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you put the batteries back in... and the right way? &nbsp;Are you sure they're charged or fresh? &nbsp;It doesn't make sense that it doesn't turn on suddenly.</p>
<p>Also what did support say?</p>

<p>Yep batteries are in the right way(Duh) and brand new. What is strange is that it hung at 4% for a while asked to be plugged in then restarted. Couldn't get them on the chat not phone, hoping to rake them over the coals this week.</p>

 are simply going to their job that involves helping other people to the best of the ability within that job.<br />
<br />
I also have another question. You have it a little confusing but did you plug the Controller in with a USB Cable while Updating or before you even started the process? In addition what does it do when it is plugged in via a USB Cable to the Xbox One?</span></p>

<p>yea, what good would it do and yes i do understand the difference. Just frustrated like I said( knowing that I'm a software support specialist too dealing with this all the time). No confusion on the plugging in the cable. It asked that the cable be plugged
 in, so it was done at that time right after it started the update. Box is on, plugged the cable into the controller and it has done nothing.

<h2>            WINDOWS&#47;SYSTEM32&#47;MPR.dll corrupt file error.</h2>
                    <p>When I sign in on&nbsp; Windows 10 I get a 'critical error' message telling me that the Start menu and Cortana weren't able to launch. If I try to work around anything, like when my Dell tech support tried to install Gotoassist to take over my computer I get
 a further error message regarding a file called C:/WINDOWS/SYSTEM32/MPR.dll telling me that it either isn't a windows file or that it is corrupt and has to be reinstalled. I would like to avoid resetting my computer and erasing 300GB of programs. Is there
 any help?</p>

<p><span>I would like to&nbsp;inform you that the&nbsp;issue might occur if some of the system files got corrupted.</span></p>
<p><span>As of now, I suggest you to try the below methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Method 1</span><span>: </span></strong><strong><span>Perform System File Checker (sfc) scan.</span></strong></span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Method 2</span><span>: </span></strong><strong><span>Run DISM commands.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>Deployment Image Servicing and Management (<strong>DISM</strong>) is a new command line tool that you can use to service a Windows image or prepare a Windows PE image. The DISM tool replaces the Package Manager (pkgmgr.exe), PEimg, and Intlcfg tools.

<p><span>Follow the steps to Run <strong>DISM</strong> Commands:</span></p>
<p><span>1) Press <strong>Windows + x</strong> on your keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>2) Select <strong>Command prompt (Admin)</strong> to open <strong>Administrator Command Prompt</strong> .</span></p>
<p><span>3) In the <strong>Administrator: Command Prompt</strong> window, type the following commands. Press the Enter key after each command:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /scanhealth </strong></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>dism.exe /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</strong></span></p>

            <p>I ran dism.exe scanhealth and the remote procedure failed. I'm trying to run restorehealth right now. &nbsp;I ran the file checker and the window didn't stay open long enough to read, but it did say that some files were corrupted.

<p>Here is a part of the restorehealth log which failed. It's the final lines.</p>

<h2>            Alcatel X080S 3G USB modem refuses connection</h2>
                    <div>Dear members of Microsoft Community,</div>
<div><br />
</div>
I am running Windows 7 32-bit SP1 Ultimate Edition on Compaq Presario CQ61.&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>The modem mentioned in the title worked flawlessly some weeks ago. After some maintenance activities (unfortunately I don`t remember ALL the activities performed for an UNDO :-( ) modem refuses connection to the Internet. Among the operations done are
 blocking Internet access to some unknown executables in Zone Alarm (the&nbsp;ModemListener.exe&nbsp;which monitors the modem has all the access rights), stopping some&nbsp;services from msconfig and disabling some startup programs to run - again the program ModemListener.exe
 is started. A couple of weeks after the maintenance I tried to connect to the Internet using the modem and failed. &nbsp;I mention that on Dell Inspiron 6400 running the same OS the modem works well. I have also tried to connect using some Huawei 3G USB modem on
 the same Compaq Presario CQ61, it worked well also.</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any suggestion would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance !</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Roman</div>

            <p>Hi Roman, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you get any error message when the modem refuses to connect to Internet? </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a network problem occurs in Windows 7, the Network troubleshooter helps to diagnose and repair the problem. For example, when you see some error messages such as “<strong>Page cannot be displayed</strong>” or “<strong>Server is not available</strong>,”
 you have the option of using the Network troubleshooter to identify the problem.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong> Run <strong>Network Troubleshooter </strong>and see if it helps.
<br />

<div><br />
<strong>Method 2:</strong> Un-installing and Re-installing Software</div>
<div>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><font color="#0563c1"><strong>Uninstall or change a program(Windows 7)</strong></font></span></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then go ahead and install the program. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Please reply if you have any questions. </span></p>

            Hi Jessen P,
<div><br />
<div>In the first place thank you for your time and effort to answer my question.</div>
<div><br />
<div>There is no error message when the connection is refused. The program - HSPA USB Modem.exe which makes the connection has 2 buttons: Connect and Reset Counter. After pressing the "Connect" button system suddenly disconnects the modem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The modem does not appear under the Network Troubleshooter, it appears only when connected in the Network and Sharing Center - the link between the laptop and the internet is named after the modem.</div>
<div><br />
<div>My assumption is that I have accidentally blocked some Windows service or program under the firewall - "application control" in Zone Alarm used by the modem. I have tested another 3G USB modem by Huawei company and it worked well.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have already tried uninstalling the program with no positive results.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Regards,</div>
<div>Roman&nbsp;</div>

<div><br />
<div>Thank you for the proposed solutions, in the first place. Here is the outcome for each one:</div>
<div><br />
<div>1) Yes, the modem works correctly on a different computer.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>Method 1:&nbsp;</b><span>I have performed a clean boot following your link, after that the modem was not identified at all, the "Connect" button was greyed. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Method 2: &nbsp;</strong>Didn`t find any driver update from Alcatel on this issue, also searched the last link provided.</div>
<div><br />
<div><b>Method 3:</b>&nbsp;Un-installing the device gave no positive result.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div><strong>Method 4:&nbsp;</strong>Disabled Zone Alarm firewall, antivirus and "application control" feature, still with no positive result.&nbsp;</div>

            Hello Shalini,
<div><br />
<div>Thank you for the answer. I have some ideas to continue the investigation, I need your advice to see if I`m on the right track. Maybe some windows services are not started/blocked on the laptop with the connection issue, maybe it`s a good idea to compare
 the running services with the ones from the laptop where the modem works and start the services that are not running. &nbsp;Please tell me your opinion about this.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks and regards,</div>

 installed,but it did not.I assume it has loaded over the top of the original. There is no previous date available to System Restore. It takes ages to load and even longer to close down,and for Mail to load up.I am a techno moron and should not mess,so have
 no idea what to do to get myself out of trouble. Please help. Thank you </p>

            <p>Hi Bishen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand that you installed Windows 8.1 update on a Windows 8.1 installed computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We need more clarity on the issue in order to understand the issue better.</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the make and model of the computer?</li></ol>
<p>Windows store will not provide the update to a computer with windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You also mentioned that “it takes a long time to load” are you referring to computer start up and shutdown?</p>

<h2>            Wireless, Open NAT, UPNP enabled, ports forwarded, no double NAT, STILL CANT CONNECT TO XBL&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>I'm so unbelievably annoyed with XBL and this awful connection issue I'm having. I have gone through the entire post located here:&nbsp;http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/xbox_360_support/f/9/p/1625236/4199656.aspx#ARMnoIdea&nbsp;
 to try and fix my problem and not a single thing has worked.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So I recently obtained a new router, an ****/Xfinity&nbsp;TG862G Router which works GREAT for everything else in my *** house EXCEPT this stupid xbox one. I have done the following:</p>
<p>Ports Forwarded:</p>
<p>88 - UDP</p>
<p>3074 - TCP/UDP</p>
<p>53 - TCP/UDP</p>
<p>80 - TCP</p>
<p>500 - UDP</p>
<p>3544 - UDP</p>
<p>4500- UDP</p>
<p>All of these are active and going to the Server IPv4 of the Xbox one,</p>

<p>I have checked for a double NAT, cannot find one.</p>

<p>In my actual Xbox it says the NAT is OPEN, yet I still CANNOT connect to xbox live in any fashion.</p>

<p>I tried using the DMZ function on my router, it did nothing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>UPNP is enabled, yet I still cannot connect to xbox live.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I am so unbelievably annoyed at this moment I can't believe this crap is happening. I get the error code "0x87DD0017" when I try to sign in which is supposed to signal an issue with the network.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Can someone PLEASE help me before I throw this <strong>[Mod Removed]</strong>&nbsp;thing away and buy a PS4.</p>

<p>so it's a wireless problem. </p>
<p>I read somewhere that port Forward sometimes give you trouble on wireless. &nbsp;The only port you should forward is 3074 udp (game port of xbox). Then try again.</p>
<p>If this doesn't help maybe you should try to turn off WMM if your router supports it. If this also doesn't help you can try to factory reset your xbox.</p>
<p>If you run the multiplayer network test on xbox what error Message do you get? Do you run the latest Firmware for your router?</p>

<p>That's odd, but seriously, comcast older gatewAys blocked certain ports, and unless you have a tier 3 password for getting into the GUI, the thing has them firewalled. &nbsp;As for the wmm,I have no clue. &nbsp;If it is similar to the gaming application you can enable
 in Cisco routers then this makes sense in an opposite sort of way.</p>

<p>@IgoTSondabrain.</p>
<p>don't know why it works - it seems the way it is implemented in some routers causes more problems then helps. Most times apple devices get problems if WMM is enabled. If you google there are many people with Problems with WMM enabled.
</p>
<p>But you are right the WLAN is slower if WMM is disabled. But if you have Problems you should try to turn off WMM.</p>

<p>Yeah, I know "they are aware" of deck corruption, but I just wanted to post my dissappointment and report a possible different bug</p>
<p>The "Avoid deck corruption bug"&nbsp;talks about it occuring by leaving your deck manager without saving, but that's not how my bug started. I was playing Tezzeret's deck and after I had won a match in the single campaign it didn't show a card unlocked for the
 deck. I went to the deck manager to see what the card was and it said I have 643 cards in my deck. Now my other decks are showing all red with no pictures on the cards. It's almost unplayable and certainly not fun when you can't tell wich cards are which without
 zooming in.</p>
<p>What a waste of money. They shouldn't have released the game if it wasn't going to work properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Are all your decks bad? Same thing happened to me, I won a game, didnt get a card unlocked. went to deck manager and card count was in the hundreds. Tried the deck manager again and card count was in the thousands with red bordered cards and no pictures.
 &nbsp;Only my U/G deck is corrupted but its still aggravating that I paid money for something that broke for me on day 2.</p>

                    I bought a new laptop yesterday and the download speed is 10 times worse than my old laptop. The new one is stated to have more ram and faster processor. I have connected to a wireless router which is fading in and out of connection.

            Hi Don.  
<br />
<br /> There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />You can also install the Updates manually that fail to install which are logged at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Installed Update History, and then search for those to download and install from this Catalog:  <a href="http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=windows%207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/sit...</a>
<br />
<br />If they continue to fail and interfere, then you can block them using one of these methods:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent-windows-10-from-automatically-downloading-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/224471/how-to-prevent...</a> 
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.
<br />

            Have you tried installing it manually.
<br />So go to the update catalog and download and install it from that site.
