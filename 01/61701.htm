<p>
</p><p>9) went back to device manager</p>
<p>10) clicked on the indel hd 4600 driver</p>
<p>11) then uninstalled the driver</p>
<p>12) then went to the file for the download softpaq driver</p>
<p>13) then attempted to install the driver again</p>
<p>it failed again</p>

            <p>yes I completely uninstalled the driver.&nbsp;Then i rebooted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All of this was done again today 12/12/2016.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I attempted to install the driver from the Intel web site.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The windows error message reappeared:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows encountered a problem installing the driver software for your device&nbsp; Intel HD graphics 4600.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I went to the HP web site and downloaded the driver.&nbsp; SP 77559.exe</p>
<p>
</p><p>The following file is already on your computer.&nbsp; do you want to overwrite?&nbsp; I clicked yes to all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It then displayed that it was extracting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then it displayed error:&nbsp; The setup program failed to install one or more device drivers.&nbsp; Setup will exit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I opened troubleshooters then view all then chose video playback</p>
<p>
</p><p>It ran then displayed:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 8 video cards require a signed video driver for your hardware to play content without restrictions.&nbsp; Go to your PC or Video card manufacturer website and search for the latest windows 8 video driver for your video card.&nbsp; Basic video driver is installed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the windows 10 troubleshooter is displaying information about windows 8.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In summary the 8/2015 video card was uninstalled.&nbsp; It required reboot.&nbsp; When it rebooted all of the icon on the desktop and task bar were huge.&nbsp; Then within minutes it changed on its own back to normal sized icons.&nbsp; In device manager I was that it was displaying
 the 8/2015 version of the video card after the full install and the post reboot spontaneous refresh.&nbsp; So I uninstalled the driver again.&nbsp; This time it did not prompt for a reboot.&nbsp; Using device manager and then action then scanning for hardware updates it
 then displayed Microsoft Basic Display Adapter.&nbsp; It no longer displayed Intel HD 4600.&nbsp; The other graphics card NVIDIA Quadro K3100M did not change.&nbsp; The Intel web site was then used and a zip file was then downloaded for the up to date driver.&nbsp; This driver
 was then installed and produced the error message:&nbsp; Windows encountered a problem installing the driver software for your device&nbsp; Intel HD graphics 4600.&nbsp; Then I downloaded the driver from the HP web site and it produced the error message:&nbsp; The setup program
 failed to install one or more device drivers.&nbsp; Setup will exit.&nbsp; Then I ran the Windows 10 troubleshooter for video playback and is displayed information about Windows 8:&nbsp; Windows 8 video cards require a signed video driver for your hardware to play content
 without restrictions.&nbsp; Go to your PC or Video card manufacturer website and search for the latest windows 8 video driver for your video card.&nbsp; Basic video driver is installed.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>So currently I no longer have installed the Intel HD 4600 video card driver from 8/2015 and was not able to install the critical update from either the HP or intel web sites.&nbsp; Now with the basic video card drive the icons are huge.&nbsp; The older driver was
 better than the basic driver.&nbsp;&nbsp; The goal is to install the up to date critical video driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate help in getting this driver installed for Windows 10 professional version 1607 (OS Build 14393.222).</p>

<h2>            computer goes to sleep immediately when ethernet cable is plugged in and will not wake</h2>
                    <p>When the ethernet cable is plugged into my pc it immediately goes to sleep and will not wake without a hard boot. As long as the cable is connected, the computer will not load windows, immediately going to sleep before my desktop shows up. My laptop is connected
 wirelessly with no problems at all, and when connected with a cable, no problems there either. ISP says it's a pc issue not a modem issue, there's a conflict, but they don't know&nbsp;where.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm running windows vista home basic, a cisco modem, don't know what model.</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
<p><strong>Setup/Settings (BIOS/CMOS) often F2 as you boot so watch the screen - set the boot<br />
order to CD/DVD first to use a Windows 7 boot disk. Be sure to set it back to hard
<br />
drive first when done using the boot disk.<br />
</strong><br />
If you do not have a Windows 7&nbsp;disk you can borrow a friends as they are not copy<br />
protected. Your&nbsp;System maker will also sell the physical DVD cheap since you already<br />
own Windows. Also you can make a repair disk on another computer with a CD burner<br />
running XP, Vista, or Windows 7 as the process uses no files from the host computer.</p>
<p>Try Startup Repair - (If at ANY point you gain some&nbsp;but not full access to Windows come<br />
back and try Startup Repair again.)</p>

<p>Hello jacvc, thanks the repair of Microsoft.Net Framework 4 Client Profile "worked".&nbsp; (1) I went to the add/remove program, right click on Microsoft.Net Framework 4 Client Profile, which gave me a choice of Uninstall/Change, when I right click it. (2) Then
 when I clicked it, I was giving a choice to <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>repair</strong> </span>the Microsoft.Net Framework 4 Client Profile and I did.&nbsp; Took a little while to complete the repair about 4 to 6 minutes.&nbsp; Finally, it asked me to check for the newest update.&nbsp; (3) I checked the update center and the update was
 successful.&nbsp; Now, my Secunia Personal Software Inspector state, that pc was 100% up to date.&nbsp; Thank you everybody for all your input to this issue.</p>

<h2>            Windows Update Problems 10.0.17713.1002 &#40;rs5_release&#41; &#40;2&#41;</h2>
                    <p>For last two weeks my computer has failed to update. It just simply "restarts" when asked to "update and restart."&nbsp; It fails to note any error; it is as if I just restarted computer without a pending update. It is now hourly requesting a restart, but fails
 to actually even try to update when restarting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is failing to update to Windows 10 Insider Preview 10.0.17713.1002 (rs5_release) (2).&nbsp;&nbsp; The system Information and an "Update History" screenshot&nbsp;are noted below, if helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run&nbsp;two different troubleshooters that attempted to diagnose or fix.&nbsp; I have chatted with a Microsoft help person. Nothing has helped.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The "in-built" troubleshooter for windows update seems OK except for one result:<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <em>"Problem with BITS service : The requested service has already been started. More help is available by typing NET HELPMSG 2182."&nbsp;
</em><br />
<br />
Typing in &nbsp;"NET HELPMSG 2182" at the CMD line just returns "The requested service has already been started." (which&nbsp;I do not think provides me much of the promised "more help" :-)&nbsp;&nbsp; )</p>
<p>
</p><p>The downloadable troubleshooter <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/F/2/4/F24D0C03-4181-4E5B-A23B-5C3A6B5974E3/wu170509.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
wu170509.diagcab</a>&nbsp;was run three times.&nbsp; It appears to run its courses (e.g. repairs update database) but does not offer diagnostic hints and does not actually fix the problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for any attention</p>

            Sorry, unfortunately, no way. One thing you can do- Wait for some time when MS releases new Insider preview ISOs that would offer more stability than the current one and Redstone 5 builds are almost ready for public release.

            I do machine embroidery and I purchase designs from various websites.&nbsp; The designs are downloaded from the sites and usually download in zip form.&nbsp; Until a few days ago I would just highlight the zipped design and then click on extract and the design(s)
 would then also appear on my computer as unzipped files.&nbsp; The zipped files would have a zipped file icon and the unzipped would just have a file icon.&nbsp; Suddenly all I could download were files that showed the icon for the program I defaulted to (Smart Sizer
 Gold) for the format I use and I could no longer extract the zipped files.&nbsp; I would then have to open the files in another program (Amazing Designs Apps) and do a save as for the files in the format I need (PES).&nbsp; None of the PDF files (instructions and color
 charts) that were supposed to download from the website would download.&nbsp; After purchasing WinZip I can now just right click on the file and pick the WinZip option to unzip the zipped file to whatever fi

</p><p>Why on earth would Windows suppport Computer Music Makers throughout the years, and then in one single upgrade (8.1), delete the years and years of Midi Keyboard Support; and</p>
<p>Not create a fix for this error despite it being on the forums for over a years now.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Really could use a fix please.</p>

<p>Hey there BastingLegolas,<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to hear this happened. Let's take a look at the save folder for this game on the hard drive though and see if any corrupted files are listed. If not, let's try
<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/clear-system-cache" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
clearing the cache</a> and <a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-360/settings-and-initial-setup/profile-move-delete" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
redownloading the profile</a> to see if that is able to help. Let us know what you see. Thanks!</p>

<p>Unfortunately if the save file is gone then there is no way of recovering it. &nbsp;Unlike a PC the Xbox 360 uses a proprietary file system on the HDD and there are no tools that can be used to recover the bits that the FAT lost. &nbsp;You can always use Cloud Saves
 and USB storage devices in the future to create back-up saves.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A word of caution: &nbsp;data being suddenly deleted off of a HDD is usually symptomatic of HDD failure. &nbsp;If these issues continue in the future it would be wise to invest in a new HDD.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 slow boot, black screen and cursor. safe mode fails on classpnp</h2>
                    <p>I installed a new ssd a little over a month ago (corsair force g's 128gb) and have been having a minor problem. randomly with no reason after a reboot the icon cache will play up, it will display both of my other hdd with a question icon and all icons will
 lose their path locations.<br />
<br />
today when I booted up I noticed a increased load time and got the icon cache error again, so I ran the the Icon cache script which deletes the icon cache and restarted my computer. only this time I had about a 5min wait on the Microsoft logo and then it loaded
 a completely black screen with only the cursor. I am able to use Ctrl +alt + delete function to bring up the task manager and everything seems fine there. once I try and open the source file of any process it will just freeze and I have to restart it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the second part to my problem is I try and then boot in safe mode and it get stuck on classpnp.sys driver to which nothing happens.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
computer specs<br />
OS: windows 7 ultimate 32bit<br />
motherboard: gigabyte ga-h61m-ds2<br />
cpu: Intel i-3 2100 @ 3.10ghz<br />
gfx card: radon hd 7700<br />
memory: 8gb ram<br />
corsair Gforce gs 128gb<br />
samsung 160gb ( is backup os which still work at a very slow pace compared to before I had this problem. so I can still perform basic trouble shooting)
<br />
<br />
methods tried so far <br />
<br />
boot in safe mode (see above) <br />
boot in low resolution (black screen and cursor) <br />
reset bios to fail-safe (black screen and cursor) <br />
reset bios to optimised (black screen and cursor) <br />
unplugged Ethernet cable to see if it was programs trying to acess the internet (didn't work)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ran antivirus software ( no results)</p>

            <p>Hello Sam,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community Forum. I appreciate your efforts towards resolving the issue.</p>
<ol>
<li><span>What is the <strong><em>complete </em></strong>error message that you get when you boot in safe mode?</span></li><li>When <strong><em>exactly </em></strong>do you get the error message?</li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I understand that you get a black screen when you boot your system, which possibly seems to be due to the graphics card driver update. However, to get past through the black screen I would suggest you the following methods to
 give a try and check if the issue reoccurs:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 1:</span></strong></p>

</p><p><em><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;Step 3:</span></strong></em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"> If you are able to boot the computer in step 2, then try to update the graphics card driver from the system manufacturer's website and then try rebooting your
 system.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">If Method 1 does not help, proceed to method 2.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Access the Advanced boot options menu by turning on your computer and pressing the F8 key before Windows starts.</span></li><li><span>Try to&nbsp;open <strong><span>System Recovery Options</span></strong>.(To open the menu refer to the section:

<p><span>nothing is working,thankyou for your response,my question again is what would be different in windows 8 than 7 to make such a differenc to the running if all visual content,if the video in media is just sound and no picture and a seperate app power
 dvd 12 is doing the same,with the video app and camera app doing it as well and kids tube and youtube then surely it can only be something in windows 8 that is missing,all drivers are up todate i have a codec pack installed what would be the only thing to
 make it not work,i downloaded prism file converter and my videos work in that,please can you suggest what might be missing/?kind regards paul&gt;</span></p>

<div>I solved it! Hopefully my solution also works for you.. Let me know if it works!<br />
<br />
1) Deinstall all drivers through ATI at the control panel (ati has an option to remove EVERYTHING)</div>
<div><br />
2) Download and run Driver Sweeper Delete display drivers of ATI *you'll get the option to reboot don't click ok yet LEAVE THE WINDOW OPEN</div>
<div><br />
3) Go to Device manager delete te display drivers if they are still shown.</div>
<div><br />
4) Download and Run CC cleaner remove all ATI stuff (you could just remove everything and save a backup which it will give you)</div>
<div><br />
5) Reboot through Driver Sweeper window<br />
<div><br />
<div>6) Install&nbsp;10-8_mobility_vista_win7_64_dd_ccc.exe which is about 75mb! (YES THIS SPECIFIC DRIVER) Wish I could post a working link but can't find any atm ;-\<br />
<br />
Enjoy working video working Catalyst Control Center<br />
<br />
plz again let me know if it works :)!<br />

    <title>When I print, I get the blue screen of death. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zsignor  say:</h3>
<h2>            When I print, I get the blue screen of death.</h2>
                    I'm running an Asus U47A, intel i7, 8 g of ram. &nbsp;Bought a cheap printer for college, the HP Deskjet 1000 J110a ($30 dollar printer). &nbsp;Please don't tell me I'm cheap and I should've bought the model up, that would not be helpful. &nbsp;Every time I print either
 the print job will be completed successfully or during the print job, my PC will crash and give me the blue screen of death. &nbsp;What do I do?! I've uninstalled the printer drivers, reinstalled them, checked for updates, installed them directly from the HP website...
 you name it. &nbsp;I'm ready to throw my head through the wall because I need to print frequently and having my computer crash in the midst of a paper isn't what I need. &nbsp;&nbsp;
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks a lot.</div>

            <p>Also, the issue may be the iusb3xhc.sys:</p>
<p><br />
<em>BugCheck 1E, {0, 0, 0, 0}</em></p>
<p><em>*** WARNING: Unable to verify timestamp for <strong>iusb3xhc.sys</strong><br />
*** ERROR: Module load completed but symbols could not be loaded for <strong>iusb3xhc.sys</strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The iusb3xhc.sys, which is dated&nbsp;Dec 5, 2011,&nbsp;is an Intel USB 3.0 driver.</p>
<p>Try updating the iusb3xhc.sys by installing the following update:</p>
<p><a href="http://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx?DwnldID=21129" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://downloadcenter.intel.com/Detail_Desc.aspx?DwnldID=21129</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same error has been reported by other users such as in the following link:</p>

<p>If the error persists try the printer&nbsp;in another USB port such as the USB 2.0 port.</p>
<p>You could&nbsp;also&nbsp;uninstall the Intel&nbsp;USB 3.0 driver and let the USB ports run at 2.0 speeds as that seemed to stop blue screen errors&nbsp;in the above link for a user.</p>
<p>Also, another printer, not necessarily a more expensive one, but a different make or model may not exhibit the same problem.</p>
<p>You could test by borrowing a&nbsp;printer if possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It would be great if you can answer the following questions:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Did you update the drivers for all the devices?</span></li><li><span>What is the make and model of the computer?</span></li><li><span>What happens when you try to play online videos? Do you get any error message? If yes, what is the exact error message?</span></li><li><span>Did you try opening the videos through Internet Explorer?</span></li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Method 1</strong>:</span></span></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow these steps and try to run the Hardware troubleshooter:</span></p>

<p>
</p><p>Worked straight on chrome that I hate of course, ex-MSFT... :)</p>
<p>Didn't work on Edge and IE but when I added youtube to IE compatibility view settings...groovy works perfect now on IE, but Edge still needs a bit of CPR....tried the driver updates already....</p>

            Why do you keep asking people to provide those details when it is clear from a cursory google search that regardless of make and model of the computer, this is happening to a lot of people! Why doesn't Microsoft just provide a fix for their faulty Windows
 10 upgrade? Most of us have spent hours/days attempting to fix this.

            Ok so it works with the "open with Internet Explorer". Now. How do I get it to work in Microsoft Edge? As that is where it refuses to play sound. Microsoft Edge. Drivers are all up to date. Works on Internet Explorer. Just not the default of Microsoft
 Edge. Thank you.

            Microsoft does not have a fix. I have called Microsoft Tech support and they informed me to do a system restore before the update and them go into services and disable updates.......Really disable updates&nbsp; come on microsoft.&nbsp; You forced the update on everyone
 and now you have no answers for the problem.&nbsp; Step up and be the company you USED to be...

<h2>            Mediacenter remote won&#39;t work after waking up from sleep mode</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After waking up from the sleep mode, remote doesn't work for the FIRST channel change.&nbsp; Second time and after works fine.</p>
<p>I'm sure it is Windows 8 issue because it's happening on 2 different PC and never happened on Windows 7 PC I used to have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's the configuration,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1 x Cable box, 3 digits channel (like 008, 015, 207, no "Enter" or "OK" needed)</p>
<p>External IR receiver but not USB.&nbsp; There are 3 mini plugs in the back of the PC.&nbsp; 2 x receiver, 1 x blaster</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To record a program, I have to leave the PC on.&nbsp; Otherwise, it will record the wrong channel.</p>
<p>Cable box was working fine until I swapped Win7 PC to Win8 PC, one day apart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>TJ</p>

    <title>No sound after windows update 1809 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            No sound after windows update 1809</h2>
                    Hi there, my windows installed the 1809 update, not a new installation, and since then I have no sound? I run the troubleshooter which resolves the issue until i turn off/restart the computer then no sound again? Can't seem to find the option to roll back
 on the update.

            thanks i tried the three methods which you had shown, the only one that worked was the trouble shooter but again once the system was shut down and re-booted still no sound? I thinks i might have to do a clean install of all the driver software and see
 how it goes as I have not a clue what else to do?

<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I have Windows 7 Home Premium and I have been using some gadgets that require internet connection (weather and gmail) for a while now, but suddenly after I restarted my computer one day, both gadgets can no longer connect, even though I am connected to the
 internet. I have tried restarting my computer and disabling and enabling the gadgets, but neither method worked. Please help!</p>
<p>Thanks a lot!</p>

<p>When you say you're connected to the Internet, do you do it using Firefox by any chance?<br />
It looks like the gadgets use the same Internet Options as Internet Explorer, so check if IE works.<br />
If it doesn't, here's a fix from the 'competitor' :D sevenforums.com:</p>
<p>"control panel - internet options - connections tab - LAN settings<br />
then <em>uncheck </em>automatically detect settings"</p>
<p>This problem seems to appear to many users all over the win7 forums. Other hints:<br />
- UAC disabled (especially since you mention it happened after a reboot). Type "uac" from Windows search box and press Enter, reset to the default value and reboot.<br />
- Antivirus software. Try disabling or uninstalling it to see if the problem repros. Did you install a new antivirus recently, or was it updated automatically?<br />
- Incorrect firewall configuration for inbound connections. Type "firewall" from Windows search box and press Enter, check your settings.<br />
- Did you change your regional settings recently? Although that would probably return a different error message.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I get each year £500 from my job to buy a PC for my work, I would love to buy myself a new laptop so I can do things more quickly, but I am working at work, I don't have the time to learn new trick on an operating system everyone hates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know you guys are proud of it, but from what I have seen, and from talking to colleagues, it would be very bad idea &nbsp;to buy it now. Everyone is turning to ebay to buy an old and maybe better machine with 7's. Do I have to do the same, or is there a chance
 to go back in time soon?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just wanna work, not to do any tablety foolery on it, for that I got Android, and that does it better.</p>

            <p>Microsoft has not&nbsp;released a development schedule for the successor to 8.1, there is a developer conference in April where they may provide some details but even that is conjecture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been a number of rumours about the changes that will be included but as we don't even know if it will be a full release (9?) or a further step up (8.2?) you cannot depend on what&nbsp;will be&nbsp;in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although heavily&nbsp;criticised Windows 8.1 does work and how much the new user interface would affect you depends on what you use the computer for. The Start Menu is only one part of the operating&nbsp;system and the same core desktop interface is still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead&nbsp;of taking rumours at face value I would recommend trying to get access to Windows 8 if you can (and I don't like it much either) and see if it is that much of an issue.&nbsp;If you have a suitable test pc or can set up dual boot you can download a limited
 life trial version from TechNet.</p>

            <p>High expectations for a peer-to-peer volunteer based worldwide forum, eh?</p>
<p>[<strong><em><span style="text-decoration-line: underline">Not Microsoft</span></em></strong>.]</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I personally do not expect to see a native return to the classic start button menu system. &nbsp;There may be a modified version in Windows 9, but I expect it to be more of a cross between old and new menus and likely unable to be turned on/off - just available
 when in desktop mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I expect Windows 9, despite anything else said elsewhere, to be available for general consumers (full release) about mid-to-late 2015. &nbsp;Whether or not it has the hybrid menu system I mentioned is, of course, unknown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, it is not like using Windows 8.1 and configuring it to work like Windows 7 (perhaps without a few prettifications of Windows Vista/7) is all that difficult and accomplished with or without third party assistance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Microsoft has not&nbsp;released a development schedule for the successor to 8.1, there is a developer conference in April where they may provide some details but even that is conjecture.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There have been a number of rumours about the changes that will be included but as we don't even know if it will be a full release (9?) or a further step up (8.2?) you cannot depend on what&nbsp;will be&nbsp;in it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Although heavily&nbsp;criticised Windows 8.1 does work and how much the new user interface would affect you depends on what you use the computer for. The Start Menu is only one part of the operating&nbsp;system and the same core desktop interface is still there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Instead&nbsp;of taking rumours at face value I would recommend trying to get access to Windows 8 if you can (and I don't like it much either) and see if it is that much of an issue.&nbsp;If you have a suitable test pc or can set up dual boot you can download a limited
 life trial version from TechNet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you. You see, I just don't have time and especially mood for this. I have been burned by Microsoft and other software developers so much in the past, that any kind of tinkering is very upsetting. To me Windows isn't a thing I wanna play with, it's
 a tool I have to work with, and I am happy the way it was working, and I don't wanna new tool. If the PCs lasted long time, there would be no problems, but they just day after 2-3 years, and then you can't get the same one, and always have to learn and conquer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just like the start orb not being there, I am trying to avoid the libraries like a plague, and I had spent many hours trying to figure out how to stop skype ringing from 2 locations at once and not stopping after you pick up one, and I could go on and on.
 The answer is clear, let's just try to buy some well preserved windows 7 laptop on eBay, and hope for the better future... :(<br />

<p>Money:<br />
Nothing.&nbsp; Nada.&nbsp; Zilch.<br />
&nbsp; </p>
<p>Time:<br />
Depends on you and what you want and your ability to perform some tasks.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>Although you can install a third party utility to give you the functionality of the "Start Button Menu" back - it may or may not be something you need to do.&nbsp; Given you said you don't own it yet, what *you* will need to do is still an unknown.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>As for the "utility" alluded to/mentioned - there are many of them.&nbsp; Here's a good list ...<br />
<a href="http://www.eightforums.com/customization/12971-list-start-menu-replacements-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.eightforums.com/customization/12971-list-start-menu-replacements-windows-8-a.html</a></p>
<p>... of such utilities to get you started.&nbsp; Some cost, some are free, etc.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>However, I personally haven't seen the need for such a utility.&nbsp; Nor have many people I have upgraded to Windows 8/8.1.&nbsp; Many have found that they seldom utilized the "Start Button Menu" and thus they in-turn seldom utilize the "Start Screen Menu" in the
 same manner.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>For Windows 8.1 users who aren't quite ready for a "modern UI start menu" look/feel - I have found a few things quite useful in their initial setup:</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>The desktop mode is still (other than a start button menu and a few "prettifications") the same.&nbsp; The search is still the same as as Vista/7.&nbsp; Some interactions (like managing wireless network profiles, accessing certain "power-user" level features and the
 likes) may be a bit different dependent on how you utilized Vista/7, but not really a show-stopper...</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>Truthfully - making Windows 8.1 work in a manner that allows you to learn the new stuff at your own pace (if at all) could be here...</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
1. Create and utilize a LOCAL user account for most of your activities, no need to tie yourself to a Microsoft Live Account if you are not worried over "Cloud Storage" and all the synchronizing between Windows 8.1 devices, etc.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
2. Change it so it boots and returns to the desktop by default.&nbsp; A lot of people complain the new Start Screen Menu is overwhelming and difficult to navigate with a mouse (or even touch screen for some) - so booting into and using the familiar desktop by default
 helps them adjust.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
3. Utilize the taskbar in desktop mode in the same manner you could in prior versions of Windows.&nbsp; Use the built-in Internet Explorer QuickLaunch Toolbar taskbar and create a couple of taskbar folders to quickly access the old "Start Menu" structure you may
 be missing (it takes two folders to do this, but you could make a Library out of these two folders and then just have one Taskbar folder for accessing all that old structure.)<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
4. Install all the same applications you are used to and USE them!&nbsp; Those that you can, of course.&nbsp; You aren't moving Outlook Express if you are coming from XP, really old software,different architecture dependent software, etc.&nbsp; However, if it ran on Windows
 Vista/7 - most of it runs on Windows 8/8.1 as well.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Sound difficult?&nbsp; Sound like it will take a long time?&nbsp; It isn't and it won't.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>(1)<br />
Many people didn't even know you could use Windows 8/8.1 with a non-Microsoft account - but you can.&nbsp; Make the switch to/back to a local account:<br />
<a href="http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/windows-and-office/quick-tip-change-microsoft-live-to-a-local-account-in-windows-81/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/windows-and-office/quick-tip-change-microsoft-live-to-a-local-account-in-windows-81/&nbsp;

[ Why the web page link?&nbsp; Why re-invent the wheel.&nbsp; The instructions are there, straight-forward and fairly simplistic. ]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
(2)<br />
Booting to the desktop is probably the most immediate gratification/relief that someone who is just irritated/confused or otherwise disjointed by the Windows 8.1 Start Screen Menu.&nbsp; This does not make it go away nor does it bring back a start button menu, etc.
 - but it does get you back to a familiar look.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
First change to Desktop Mode.</p>
<p>Right-click the taskbar, choose Properties --&gt; Navigation and then check "When I sign in or close all apps on a screen, go to the desktop instead of Start," and click OK.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fasset3.cbsistatic.com%2fcnwk.1d%2fi%2ftim2%2f2014%2f02%2f02%2f02_03_14_Windows8_4.jpg" /></p>
<p>&nbsp; <br />
Seriously - that's it.&nbsp; Reboot and prove it to yourself.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Now that you are booting to the desktop, maybe you want a little more familiarity.&nbsp; Put some shortcuts on the desktop itself to the applications you installed/use often or pin them to the taskbar.&nbsp;
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
I personally like to make my taskbar twice as tall as normal and use the Internet Explorer Quick Launch toolbar as it lets me put more in a smaller space.&nbsp; I've used this since Windows XP, at least.&nbsp; It's easy to setup.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
For more information on the taskbar fro Windows 8, check this out:<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/use-the-taskbar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/use-the-taskbar</a><br />
[ Things I have found useful over the years and still in Windows 8:<br />
"To unlock the taskbar" under "Move the taskbar"<br />
"Combine when taskbar is full" under "Change how taskbar buttons appear"<br />
"To minimize all the open windows on the desktop" under "Take a look at the desktop" ]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Resizing its height is still just making sure it is not locked (see the last section of this post) and clicking/dragging.<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/resize-taskbar#1TC=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/resize-taskbar#1TC=windows-7</a><br />
[ Yes - Windows 7 link because the methodology is still the same for the task at hand.&nbsp; As it was in Windows XP and Vista as well. ]<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Adding the Quick Launch toolbar is easy, but there are nuances (Showing Text, Showing Titles, moving to the left or right side, etc.) so again I am deferring to a link.&nbsp; While this particular link is for Windows 8 - the same instructions work for Windows Vista,
 7 and 8.1.<br />
<a href="http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/5069-quick-launch-add-taskbar-windows-8-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/5069-quick-launch-add-taskbar-windows-8-a.html</a><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Now I don't personally miss the "Start Button" or "Start Orb" menu system, but some people swear by it (although I have found many can live without it once they have the links either on the desktop, taskbar or in the Quick Launch toolbar from above) so - here
 is how to create a library that contains the folders that really made up the content of the "Start Button" menu anyway: the list of applications and shortcuts that almost every application you install will likely still put there for a while to come.&nbsp; This
 is probably the most <em>complicated</em> thing you might do to bring back some part of the older version of Windows, and truthfully, it's more lengthy in step-by-step instructions than complicated in my opinion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Making the library.&nbsp; We'll keep this simple.&nbsp; From anywhere in Windows 8.1, press the Windows Logo Key + S (or Q) on your keyboard and that should open the "Search" bar on the right side of the screen.&nbsp; It's probably looking "Everywhere" and that is fine.&nbsp;
 Type in the word:<br />
&nbsp; libraries<br />
and press ENTER.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
That should bring up the Windows Explorer window in "Libraries" view.&nbsp; At the top find "New Item" and click on it to drop the choices down and choose "Library".&nbsp; You can name it what you want, for this demonstration I kept it simple and called it "Start Menu".<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Now right-click on the new library you just created (should see it alongside the "Documents", "Music", "Pictures" and "Videos" libraries on the lower right part of the window you opened) and choose "Properties" from the menu that comes up.&nbsp; This is where you
 can add the multiple folders that this library will contain.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Click on the "Add..." button.<br />
In the top address bar type in:<br />
&nbsp; %appdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs<br />
Press Enter.<br />
At the bottom-right part of the window, click on the "Include folder" button.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Click on the "Add..." button.<br />
In the top address bar type in:<br />
&nbsp; %programdata%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs<br />
Press Enter.<br />
At the bottom-right part of the window, click on the "Include folder" button.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
Click OK.<br />
<br />
Now you have a Library that contains the two main list of programs the old Start Button menu used.&nbsp; You can now create a pseudo and simplified version of that Start Button menu list of installed programs on your taskbar if you like.&nbsp; Here's how.<br />
<br />
These instructions will look familiar to a certain extent if you did the Taskbar Toolbar tip earlier... I am copying and pasting because, again, there's no need to re-invent the wheel here.<br />
<br />
Right click or press and hold on an empty space on the taskbar, click/tap on <strong>
Toolbars</strong>, and click/tap on <strong>New toolbar</strong>.&nbsp; In the top address bar, click and type in (replacing whatever is there):<br />
&nbsp; libraries<br />
... and press enter.&nbsp; You should see the list of libraries, one of which is the one you created above.&nbsp; Double-click on the one you created from before and then click on "Select Folder" at the bottom right section of the window.&nbsp; Now you have a taskbar toolbar
 that has the text from the name of the Library and possibly two folder icons in it.&nbsp; If you resize that/move it around per the instructions from the "Quick Launch Toolbar" from above, it can look like a button menu-system.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>The last thing I suggested was installing and using the same applications you used before.&nbsp; That's an important one.&nbsp; If you used and liked Mozilla Thunderbird or Windows Live Mail 2012 before - install and use them now.&nbsp; If you used Skype - download and
 install the desktop edition for Windows.&nbsp; If you have always used Adobe Reader for PDFs, download and install it now.&nbsp; Google Chrome?&nbsp; Mozilla Firefox?&nbsp; Google Earth?&nbsp; Paint.NET?&nbsp; OpenOffice or LibreOffice?&nbsp; Microsoft Office?&nbsp; iTunes?&nbsp; VLC media player?&nbsp; Etc.
 and so on.&nbsp; This is still Microsoft Windows - don't start treating it like a tablet because one screen and some gesture capabilities give you that OPTION.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; <br />
Those three to four pages of text should get you to a place where you are comfortable using Windows 8.1 without *ANY* third party applications, fancy registry hacks or anything other than, really, stuff you could have done in Windows Vista/Windows 7.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; <br />
<strong><em>Here's also a couple of random tips</em></strong> - the lower-left section of Windows 8.1's main screen (the Windows Logo icon) has a lot of surprises when you right-click on it; if you have a bar pop-up or the start screen come up and you don't
 want it there - press the ESC key, really; DON'T PANIC.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
&nbsp; <br />
In case anyone was curious what a Windows 8.1 system with the above modifications could look like (sans any fancy background image) - here it is:<br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4b379c06-4abd-44a1-9458-338b8052fdc4" /><br />
<br />
All Windows 8.1 and no third party applications to change the look or feel; all built-in options, many of which were there in Windows Vista and Windows 7 as well.
<br />

<p>We are aware of the issue wherein customers using Skype on Android are either unable to send instant message or having connection issues. As a workaround, please try signing out and signing in to Skype. Kindly uninstall and reinstall Skype again. But this
 time, make sure to clear the data and restart your device before reinstalling.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Update us on what will happen.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

            <p><span>Como agregar una impresora Citizen GSX-190 o cualquier otra parecida&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>en Windows 7&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>Paso a explicar:&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<span>Ir a INICIO – Dispositivos e impresoras&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>Agregar impresora – agregar impresora local&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>Elegir un puerto de impresión&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>Usar un puerto existente * por defecto aparece LPT1*, abrir el desplegable y elegir “ USB001 (puerto de impresión virtual
 para USB)” siguiente&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>Instalar el controlador de imprenta:&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>Fabricante: “Generic” – Impresora – “Generic IBM graphic 9 pim”&nbsp;</span><br />
<span>Siguiente – LISTO – tea aparecerá, “hacer una copia de control”, después podrás ver el icono de la nueva impresora,
 a esta altura la calidad de impresión de textos es medianamente buena, pero si quieres una mejor impresión – hacer sobre el icono clip sobre el botón derecho del mouse, te aparecerá una lista de opciones – abrí- “preferencias de impresión” –“presentación”
 – “opciones avanzadas” – “gráfico” – “calidad de impresión” y elegí la mayor definición (240 x 216 dots per inch), ahora si LISTO.&nbsp;</span></p>

<div>Within "Network &amp; Sharing Center" it shows (This computer) connected to (Unidentified network) and then has the red X between that &amp; (internet). It shows signal strength is excellent and ackowledges the name of my wireless network. (PATRICK) - &amp; w/in "status",
 everything is a GO but there's a big fat ZERO under "Received".</div>

<div><br />
<div>"<span>Is your computer connects to wired network without any issue?"</span></div>

</span></div>
<div><span>"</span><span>Have you installed wireless adapter network driver on your computer?"</span></div>
<div>--I've been trying via the&nbsp;integrated&nbsp;wireless which does have the appropriate driver installed. Since my initial post, I have installed a USB wireless adapter, &amp; after installing the&nbsp;drivers&nbsp;for that one, I AM able to connect to my wireless &amp; internet
 with no problems.</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Was it working earlier?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to try these methods and check the issue status.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>You cannot connect to a wireless network on a Windows Vista-based computer.</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/935222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/935222</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>I would suggest you to check the issue status by disabling antivirus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>You may also try to temporarily disable security software from the computer and check.</span></p>
<p><span>Disable anti-virus software</span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Disable-antivirus-software" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><b><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Disable-antivirus-software</span></b></a></p>
<p><span><strong>Note: </strong>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you should not disable your antivirus software. If you do have to temporarily disable it to install other software,
 you should re-enable it as soon as you're done. If you are connected to the Internet or a network during the time your antivirus software is disabled, your computer is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>

            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>It's fully updated &amp; has no virus protection installed.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>"<span>Was it working earlier?"</span></div>
<div><span><br />
</span></div>
<div>I'm just about positive that it was working earlier. I'm a little foggy on it because I was working on 2 laptops at the same time and at the time that I noticed that this one wasn't connecting, I do believe that I had already downloaded some updates before
 that. But since I was working with another one concurrently, I can not clearly recall.</div>

It didn't do a thing. Still in the same condition.

<div>Without me using the USB adapter, it does not get wireless.</div>

            <p><span>Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I would suggest you to try the following method and check the issue status.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You may reset the Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) and check if it resolve the issue.<br />
</span></p>
<div><br />
<br />
The reset command is available in the IP context of the NetShell utility. Follow these steps to use the reset command to reset TCP/IP manually:<br />
<div><br />
<br />
Access the link below and run the ‘Fix it’ tool to automatically reset TCP/IP:<br />

            The reset didn't work either. No connectivity at all unless the usb adapter is plugged in.&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>I appreciate the replies but it seems that nothing is going to get this thing connected.</div>
