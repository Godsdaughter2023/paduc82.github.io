<h2>            Problems with updates - keeps reinstalling</h2>
                    <p>Since the Windows 10 Creators update my pc is almost unuseable. Microsoft keeps installing the same updates 3 times (none of them fail)</p>
<p>Always a day apart. The pc just grinds to a halt and is non repondsive. I often just kill the wifi to free up the pc. How do I stop this and how do I clean up the mess its making. Any help most appreciated.</p>

            Hi Michael.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />There's a lot of turmoil with Windows Updates right now.   So unless it's interfering with performance I'd give it a few weeks to sort itself out. 
<br />
<br />If it is interfering or you don't want to wait then there is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />You can try installing Updates manually from Microsoft Update catalog by searching for them here:  <a href="http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Search.aspx?q=windows%207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://test.catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/sit...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also install this tool to tell you exactly your level of protection needed for the CPU threat, how it may affect performance, and what you can do about it:  <a href="https://www.grc.com/inspectre.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.grc.com/inspectre.htm</a>
<br />
<br />You can get more control over Windows Updates with some new features in the last two versions at Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update under Restart Options and set Active Hours when you don't' want to be bothered.
<br />
<br />You can block Windows Updates and Version Updates using this tool:   <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />Explained here:  <a href="http://www.thewindowsclub.com/block-unwanted-windows-updates-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.thewindowsclub.com/block-unwanted-wi...</a>
<br />
<br />You can set a Metered Connection or turn off Windows Update service and only install the Version Updates twice a year when you are ready via the most stable method - which isn't Windows Update anyway, but by running it from Media Creation Tool or the media it creates:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  All previous Updates are rolled up in the Version Update.
<br /> 
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>Hi Greg</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disaster last night the system crashed. Suddenly it was unrepondsive after installing the last update and then black screen. Lucky I had previously made a system repair usb stick (as advised by yourselves) that I was able to use. It spent the last 12+ hours
 repairing my hard disk. The system is now working but it already whats to load updates and after running the diagnostics tool it states that<strong> windows update components must be fixed</strong> but cannot fix it. I dont know what components are incorrect
 or how to find out and or fix them. My fear is that without a fix the system might crash again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>
<p>MIchael</p>

            Test your hard drive with bootable diagnostics long test:  <a href="http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seatools-off-of-a-usb-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://blog.nowherelan.com/2013/04/04/boot-seat...</a>
<br />
<br />If HP you can press ESC at power on, or Dell it's F12 or these.
<br />
<br /> If it's good then do the guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>.  Try running that first.
<br />
<br />Try installing some of the failing Updates manually from steps above.  
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This solves many problems and will also bring it up to the latest version which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Refresh that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>

<p>Hi Greg</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your reply and a lot of useful info/links. My Hard disk seems to be okay but the ram usage is constantly maxed out. This is really only something that has appeared after the fateful update. I need to leave early tomorrow for a weeks workshop (taking
 the mac) but I have got the pc up and running without too many problems at the moment. I think I shall try a fresh start when I return and see if that resolves the problem.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for your help and will let you know what happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Michael</p>

    <title>Bluetooth Icon Permanence - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sschoi  say:</h3>
<h2>            Bluetooth Icon Permanence</h2>
                    <p>1) I have been looking to keep the Bluetooth Icon on the tray even when set as off. I would like the option to turn Bluetooth on and off from the icon, however, when I turn it off via the icon, I have to manually go to Settings then Bluetooth &amp; Other Devices.
 Is there a way to keep that icon in the tray permanently?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) Also there seems to be no way to toggle Bluetooth on and off directly from the icon. I still have to go to the Bluetooth Settings page. Is there a way to simply turn Bluetooth on and off from the icon directly?</p>

            Hi there, thanks for your question.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, there's no way to keep the Bluetooth icon in the system tray when it's turned off. When it's on, you still need to visit the Settings app to switch it off.
<br />
<br />You can, however, pin the Bluetooth settings icon to your Start menu.
<br />
<br />- Press Windows Key+I to open the settings app.
<br />- Click Devices
<br />- Right-click Bluetooth &amp; Other Devices on the right, then pin to Start.
<br />
<br />I hope this makes it slightly easier! I feel the same - I wish the Bluetooth icon would stay in the system tray too. You could leave some feedback to Microsoft in the Feedback Hub. Press Windows Key+F to open it.
<br />
<br />Please let me know if you need more support! Thanks!

<h2>            Windows 7 starter, HP notebook, no  audio output, code 39</h2>
                    I have an HP notebook. It operates on Windows 7 starter. I have had a long standing issue with code 39 with my audio drivers. It is so bad, anything I do, whether searching for new software updates or driver updates, etc results in "an unexpected error
 has occurred". I had IDT realtek audio and suddenly after some windows update there is an x by the speaker and it says no audio device is found. I tried a to do a system restore but apparently I don't have that capability on my notebook.<br />
<br />
I went to geek squad, and had my drivers updated, no dice;&nbsp; <br />
then uninstalled and re-installed; no dice, <br />
Finally I was told to buy an external USB sound driver. I bought a Creative Go-Pro external audio USB.
<br />
My notebook doesn't come with a CD drive,&nbsp; so I downloaded the drive via creative's website. No dice.<br />
&nbsp;I still get code 39 errors, despite trying to go into BIOS and making sure my sound is enabled, half part of the time, the options in the device panel such as "configure" are greyed out. I am at my wits end. I also tried looking for some "registry key" but
 when I look I don't see any of the Binary numbers they give in this tutorial about code 39 errors: http://pcsupport.about.com/od/findbyerrormessage/a/code-39-error.htm<br />
<br />
I am about to just get a Dell and make sure it has XP. My desktop is exactly that and after almost a decade it runs like a dream<br />
&nbsp;Please help

    <title>LaserJet 4M Installation on Windows 7 64-bit - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ejgnyc  say:</h3>
<h2>            LaserJet 4M Installation on Windows 7 64-bit</h2>
                    <p>I recently upgraded to a new Dell with Windows 7 Home Premium/64-bit. Among my more ancient pieces of hardware is an H-P LaserJet 4M; old and a little clunky (much like me) but it still works fine.&nbsp;After purchasing a parallel-to-usb cable and connecting&nbsp;it
 to the computer, I proceeded to the installation using Windows Update.&nbsp;I found several 4M versions, but none which was just&nbsp;the&nbsp;simple 4M I have, so I selected the LJ4 driver and completed the installation. The driver installed, the test page was successfully
 printed, and I was happy.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The next day, the 4M wouldn't print. The computer showed it as installed, but there was no communication between the printer and computer. After several attempts to fix the problem, without success, I deleted the printer, disconnected it from the computer,
 and rebooted. I reinstalled the printer and driver, and the printer again worked flawlessly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Unfortunately,&nbsp;the same situation arose the following day. While I'd like to keep using&nbsp;this printer, if possible, I'm almost at the point of throwing in the towel.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell tells me this is an HP matter; HP says the machine is too old and out of warranty for assistance, and that I should follow-up with Dell and/or Microsoft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions?</p>
<p>
</p><p />

            <p>Thanks for the input, and my apologies for the delay in responding.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The computer is&nbsp;a Dell Inspiron 3847: 8GB dual-channel DDR3 1600Mhz, 1TB 7200 rpm SATA 6Gb/s hard drive, Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit. I have used the Windows printer troubleshooter without any success. The original software for the printer was lost ages
 ago, and probably would not be in a usable form (I seem to recall 5.25" floppies...!) The printer is connected to the computer using the USB001 virtual port.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I already was aware of the first article you mentioned and had reviewed it before posting my original "help" request because the article was of no help whatsoever. While the HP website appears to have a Windows 7 driver available for the LJ4M which I downloaded,
 I cannot get it to install.&nbsp;As to&nbsp;the "other printing questions" link you suggested, I had found it as well before posting, and also found it to be less than helpful.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>As to installing a new driver, I would love to install the correct LJ4M driver. The problem is that when I clicked on the Windows Update button to locate the correct driver, what came up were drivers for the following:</p>
<p>LaserJet 4</p>
<p>LaserJet 4 Plus</p>
<p>LaserJet 4/4M Plus PS 300</p>
<p>LaserJet 4/4M Plus PS 600</p>
<p>LaserJet 4/4M PS</p>
<p>LaserJet 4/4M PS (300 dpi)</p>
<p>
</p><p>There was no driver listed for a simple LaserJet 4M. I still have the manual which came with the printer, which is for the LJ4 and 4M, so I installed the LJ4 driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The printer works so long as I don't turn off the computer;&nbsp;if I shut down, the next time I turn on the computer and printer, the computer says the printer is installed but the printer will not function.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope I've given you sufficient information for your review purposes, and truly hope you can assist. Thanks in advance!</p>

            <p>Hello Ejgnyc,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I apologies for the late response.</p>

            <p>It is more likely to be a problem with the USB to parallel adapter than the printer/PC, never found them very reliable</p>

</p><p>I would be inclined to fit a PCI parallel card to give the PC a parallel port. Keeping something as rock solid as a LJ4 going is well worth it.</p>

            <p>My thanks to all of you for&nbsp;all your suggestions, from the simple to the complex. I may surprise you, but there is a solution which is the simplest of them all, and which was told to me by an old friend.&nbsp;I mentioned to him the problems I was having, and
 he told me that he had experienced the same problems when he upgraded to a Windows 7 computer but kept his own LJ4.</p>
<p>
</p><p>His simple and elegant 3-step solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Turn on the printer BEFORE turning on the computer.</p>
<p>2. Let the printer cycle fully through the startup routine, and wait until the display says "READY".</p>
<p>3. Turn on the computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Believe it or not, this worked without a single hitch! I have used the LJ4M since then without any problems whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I guess the LJ4M is&nbsp;a little&nbsp;like some of us older folks, you may have to give us a little more time to get ready, but we can still get the job done!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Again, my thanks to all of you for your help and support.</p>

    <title>Software Restriction Policies causing &#34;freezing&#34; in Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the_d0lph1n  say:</h3>
<h2>            Software Restriction Policies causing &#34;freezing&#34; in Windows 8.1 Pro x64</h2>
                    <p>As a safety precaution against various viruses that save their files to the AppData/Local folder, I decided to enact a Software Restriction Policy that disallows any executable files from executing from the AppData/Local directory (I'm running Windows 8.1
 Pro x64 with all Windows Updates; this is a home PC that isn't linked to a Group Policy server or domain controller&nbsp;or anything like that). This policy works, however there is one troubling side-effect.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now whenever I log in for the first time after a cold boot, there can be a several-minute-long period where I cannot launch desktop programs by normal means. Icons on the Start Screen and the Taskbar do not work; I click on them and nothing happens. I think
 I am able to run programs by launching their executable files directly, so it's just the shortcuts that don't work. The system will remain in this state for up to several minutes before everything returns to normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yet this is not a full system freeze. During this freeze period, my mouse is responsive, system UI elements like the Start Screen are responsive, and all Windows Store apps launch just fine. Additionally, my clicks on links to desktop programs are not lost;
 they are just delayed until that freeze period ends. So if I click on the Microsoft Outlook tile 3 times during the freeze period, 3 instances of Outlook will immediately open up once that period ends. So it seems all link accesses are queued up internally,
 waiting for some process to finish before continuing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disabling Software Restriction Policies and rebooting will make these problems go away; the system starts up and does not encounter a freeze period. However I would like to use this security feature (though I haven't gotten a virus in many years) and I have
 not seen this issue reported anywhere else. Has anyone had this issue in the past?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Troubleshooting this issue is difficult since all normal ways of launching desktop apps (including Event Viewer) are blocked during the freeze period. I only noticed that around the same time the freeze period ended, the Software Protection Service also
 stopped. The SPS started about a minute prior according to Event Viewer which is around the same time as the start of the freeze period. Does anyone know if the Software Protection Service has components that are affected by Software Restriction Policies?</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have performed further tests concerning this matter. I first created a new user account and logged into that account. No freeze happened. Then rebooted and logged into my own account and no freeze happened either. Since the Software Restriction Policy
 (SRP from now on) applies to all users, the new account should have been affected by the SRP as well. However, one difference I noted between the 2 accounts is that my personal account is set to log in to the Start Screen while the test account was set to
 log in to the desktop. I changed my personal account to go to the desktop when I sign in rather than the Start Screen and did not encounter any freezing when I did so. I then removed the test account, rebooted, and then signed into my personal account with
 desktop sign-in. No freeze. I reset my account to Start Screen sign-in, signed in after a reboot, immediately went to the desktop, and no freeze was encountered.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I rebooted, signed in, immediately launched the Mail app from the Windows Store and stayed there for several seconds, then brought up the taskbar (did not click the Desktop tile on the Start Screen, I just moved my mouse to the bottom of the screen to activate
 the taskbar), and clicked on Internet Explorer. This time it froze. The interesting bit is: the File Explorer and Control Panel icons on the taskbar were unaffected by the freeze. I could launch File Explorer and Control Panel from the taskbar just fine. But
 things like Event Viewer and secpol.msc could not be launched from either the Power User menu (Win+X menu) or from searching in the Start Screen. Additionally, Outlook and Word could not be launched from Start. But through File Explorer, I was able to start
 IE manually by navigating to its folder and starting iexplore.exe. </p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, I created a new test account, rebooted, and then signed into my personal account, NOT the test account. I started the Mail app, then went to the desktop and started IE. No freeze.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now my testing methodology is very incomplete, but my observations have led me to these findings:</p>
<ol>
<li>This is an issue with links. I was able to start an application (Internet Explorer) by manually starting its executable rather than clicking on its links.</li><li>This is not just an issue with taskbar/Start Screen links. Trying to start secpol.msc through the Search Charm resulted in the same queuing effect seen with other desktop apps.</li><li>This is where things get interesting: the File Explorer and Control Panel links still worked though nothing else did. I found out that both applications run within explorer.exe. Thus clicking those links doesn't actually start a new process, it just loads
 things into an existing process.</li><li>Another strange fact: this link freeze occurs despite the fact that most links on the Start Screen and taskbar are not located in AppData/Local. They are in AppData/Roaming which is not blocked by my own path rule SRP.</li><li>Link files were listed (by default it seems) as a Designated File Type so it is considered to be an executable file. However, my path rule is written as: "C:\Users\[username]\AppData\Local\*.exe" which is meant to only block exe files from executing. SRPs
 seem to use the Designated File Types in rules rather than just the path rule entry. Could someone with more experience in SRPs confirm this?</li><li>Despite link files being considered executable code, this doesn't prevent the links to File Explorer and Control Panel from working, despite the fact that they are stored in the same directory as the Internet Explorer link.</li><li>The 2 default SRPs are for the System Root and Program Files directories to be unrestricted. These paths are (for me) C:\Windows and C:\Program Files, respectively. I use 64-bit Internet Explorer, so IE should have been able to run. However, this could
 explain why secpol.msc did not run from the Search Charm since it is a plugin for mmc.exe which is in the C:\Windows\System32 directory, not C:\Windows itself.</li><li>This issue has something to do with when the desktop environment is initialized. I read some material from before the Windows 8 release that stated that the desktop environment is not initialized until it or an application that needs it is run. This correlates
 with how these freezes only occur when I launch a Windows Store app first and then go to the desktop later. This might also be the reason why the test account and my personal account did not freeze when I set the accounts to sign in to the desktop. Thus the
 problem might be some other process interfering with desktop initialization.</li><li>From my experience, simply adding another user prevents freezes. I haven't tested enough to confirm if this is the case, but adding another user account and then rebooting back into my personal account resulted in no freeze even though I launched a Store
 app first.</li></ol>
<p>I'll perform more tests and get back to you with more information.</p>

<h2>            Xbox one won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t detect&#47;read any of my game discs</h2>
                    
<p>No matter what game disc I try it will not read it, when I select the game it just asks me if I own that game. Everything else on the console works including my digital games, wasnt sure what to do and didn't want to pay Microsoft $115 to have my Xbox repaired
 if I could do it myself</p>

<p>iWar, give these things a try first</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure your Xbox power supply is plugged into the wall, and not into another surge protector (your Xbox PSU is a surge protector, and you can do a quick Bing search to learn about all the reasons you shouldn't chain surge protectors)
</li><li>On your console, go into Settings -&gt; All Settings -&gt; Disc and Blu-ray -&gt; Blu-ray -&gt; Persistent Storage -&gt; Clear (these are temporary files saved each time you put in a disc)
</li><li>Power drain your console by turning it off, unplugging the power supply from the back, then plugging it back in and turning your console on. &nbsp;If you use Instant On power mode, your console normally 'sleeps' instead of turning off. &nbsp;This makes sure it actually
 turns off and clears the storage files. </li><li>Make your Xbox do some work. &nbsp;Eject your disc, and this time when you put it in, instead of letting your Xbox lazily accept it, hold on to it just a smidge, so that the Xbox has to wake up and actually take the disc. &nbsp;This helps make sure everything inside
 aligns to the size of the disc (did you know game discs can actually be different thicknesses? &nbsp;This can affect how well the console reads them!)
</li></ol>
<p>Usually doing these four things clear up disc read errors, as long as it's not a completely broken disc drive. &nbsp;There's a couple more solutions, as well as information on how to set up a repair, at this link, in case the steps above don't help:&nbsp;<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/disc-error" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/console/disc-error</a>&nbsp;
 &nbsp;I'm pretty sure from your post you already checked it, though.<br />
<br />
Hope it helps. &nbsp;:) &nbsp;Let us know.</p>

<p>=================================================<br />
Something to try...</p>
<p>Insert your SD card in your media reader...if any windows open...ignore them.</p>
<p>Go to...Start / Computer...</p>
<p>Your media reader should be recognized as one or more Removable Disks <br />
and one of them will be the slot your SD card is in. Just left click each <br />
Removable Disk until you find the card.</p>
<p>Now you should be able to open the folders on the SD card and delete any <br />
file/s you wish.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>

            So, no Wi-Fi in the list of adaptors means that there is no Wi-Fi driver loaded.&nbsp; Then your problem is not the icon for it but the fact that the device is not being detected (e.g. by Plug-and-Play).

<p>I am having the same exact problems as Terry. Wi-Fi connections are not even showing or an option in network settings. I can only connect VIA ethernet cord, which doesn't work out for me because my office is away from the router.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried downloaded and installing driver and yet no luck. I am absolutely frustrated with upgrading from windows 7 to windows 10. I even downloaded driver repair softwares and nothing has been able to solve my issues.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            My Windows start screen is in Chinese. How do I change it to English&#63;</h2>
                    To be clear, my start screen (the tiles) and apps are in Chinese, but everything else is in English. How do I change it back to English? I've already tried language preferences and changing the region to the U.S.<br />
<br />
Edit: Okay, I lied. The apps somehow reverted back to English, but the tiles are still in Chinese.<br />

                    <p>I am trying to make a few new user profiles on my Windows 10 Home system, and every new profile I attempt to create is corrupt: There are no Icons, only the names, and the File Manager system is inaccessible: it does not read correctly, or otherwise does
 not function, and I can't run any of the "personalize" type apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried creating with a Microsoft Account and Without (Local User), both as normal user and administrator. None of them worked.</p>
<p>My main user account (as administrator) is OK on all of my machines. My wifes' profile is also OK on the other two machines.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are more than one account on my other systems, and I had no problem creating those, but on this system... let's just say it doesn't seem to want me to have any other user accounts.</p>
<p>
</p><p>An (admittedly cursory) search for anything similar did not yield any subject that seemed even close to what I am experiencing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Input is appreciated! If I need to package and send files for analysis, please let me know and I will happily do so.</p>

</p><p>As a work around, I suggest you to enable the built-in administrator account, log-in with the admin account to create a new user profile and check if you are able to check. This will let us know if the issue persists with user account or the operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Follow the steps to enable Built-in admin account.</p>
<p><strong><span>Enable Built-in administrator.</span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Press <strong><span>Windows + X</span></strong> key together on your desktop screen.</span></li><li><span>Click on <strong><span>Command Prompt (admin)</span></strong> to open <strong>
<span>Command Prompt</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span>Type the following command and hit Enter:</span></li></ol>
<ol>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>net user administrator /active: yes </span></strong><span>(Check for the spaces)</span></li></ul>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4.&nbsp; Now log off from the current user and try to login to the administrator account that is enabled.</span><span>　　</span><span>
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> Please follow the same steps and type net user administrator /active: no to disable admin account after the troubleshooting is done.</span><span>　</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2: </strong>Refer to the articles to create a test user account/ Microsoft account respectively.</p>
<p><strong>For Local account: </strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/create-a-local-user-account-in-windows-10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 108, 216, 1)"><span>Create a local user account in Windows 10</span></span></strong></a></p>

<p>
</p><p>I followed your instruction, and was able to log in as the Administrator.</p>
<p>My trash bin icon was there and functional, and I could access the file manager.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I went to create a new user account, there was a brief flash of a window opening, then closing immediately, and I was unable to actually create anything. This was consistent, so it would not go any further.</p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            <p>As much as I appreciate the advice currently being offered, I have one aspect of this that I find truly unacceptable as a "Remedy" for my current situation: I do&nbsp; not wish to go through All of my installed "apps" and programs to save off my data and settings,
 then essentially wipe my system clean and start from scratch yet again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me make this plain: I do do trust and will not use the "web-based" or Cloud based programs and system that have become intrinsic to the new and "Improved" Windows 10 core code. No amount of empty promises of how secure it is will ever convince me that
 it is even remotely a consideration to have my personal, sensitive and confidential data stored anywhere but my own secure system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the best and most effective "repair" for something as seemingly simple as the inability to create a new, uncorrupted user profile is to wipe my system, then the operating system is deeply flawed and in desperate need of an overhaul. Again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Why is it that there does not exist a basic digital tool for restoring just a corrupted user profile?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How about a repair tool for the core OS that does Not require a reinstallation of all the other programs and data used by them to fix something in the core itself?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seriously, that was what I was looking for when I came to the community for an answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apparently, I will have to suffer through with my single user profile on this system until I get yet another system later in my next upgrade, and Cortana will remain unexplored as an option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously, the whole Microsoft answer to everything is to have all your precious data stored with them, and your system is nothing more than a dumb terminal to access Office, Outlook, email and favorites (as well as all of your web history for every single
 thing ever searched for or viewed).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yes, it may be convenient to access everything from any device you have all from a central database. Of course, that is exactly what Big Brother wants. If your data gets breached, you would never be the wiser unless it is somehow tampered with or lost.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will wait for something that can actually Fix my problem without having to completely reinstall Windows yet again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Something that I have done entirely too many times already on this workstation. BTW, it's a refurbished Dell wx6600 Workstation with shotgunned graphics cards, maximum memory, and a LOT of installed Apps and programs that I use for learning and production
 of animated bits, as well as 3D design.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Oh well. I tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next upgrade I shall simply build in a number of extra user profiles for later use, should the need arise.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the Snark factor. I have work to do and spending the next week rebuilding my system after a "repair" is not an available option right now.</p>

            <p>Well, it has been over a week now, and no feedback. More than a month since the original post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Obviously, this is a more unique problem than I though, and nobody has an answer that goes beyond "Reinstall Windows! That'll fix everything!"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know why I got my hopes up. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe one day, I'll have an OS that gets the support it deserves.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is it wrong of me to miss the days of Windows 98se?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I one of the few that thought Windows XP was the best they ever put out?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is anyone else furious about having Windows 7 absolutely Neutered out from under them with the White Elephant forced down their throat?</p>
<p>
</p><p>What sayest thou, oh diverse Microsoft Community? Anything?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anything at all?</p>

            <p>Just looking at this for the first time. No one seems too have suggested a system file scan, so.....</p>
<div>Method 1: <br />
System file checker is a utility in Windows that allows users to scan for corruptions in Windows system files and restore corrupted files.</div>
<div>Run system file checker (SFC) and see if it helps. Please follow these steps:</div>
<div>a. Press Windows + X keys and click command prompt (admin).</div>
<div>b. Type the following command in command prompt and press Enter.</div>
<div>sfc /scannow</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>If it does not help, use method 2.</div>
<div>Method 2: </div>
<div><br />
Run DISM tool and check the issue. Please follow these steps:</div>
<div>a. Press Windows + X keys and click command prompt (admin).</div>
<div>b. Type the following command in command prompt and press Enter.</div>
<div>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth</div>
<div>after the scan is complete type the following and press Enter.</div>
<div>
<p>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</p>
<p>
</p><p>If that doesn't change anything then there is the in&nbsp;place upgrade. Review this link.</p>

<p>Hey Dante,</p>
<p>
</p><p>You're welcome for the response :D. Thank you for keeping me updated on this scenario. I have played the game as well. It is a great game! It reminded me of the Devil May Cry series. Dante's Inferno is a
<a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/backward-compatibility?xr=shellnav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
backwards compatible game</a>. Thus, the game should contain the same content as the Xbox 360 version. Any in game issues would be addressed with the
<a href="http://help.ea.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">EA Support Team</a>. Was the game last played on an Xbox 360? It is possible to upload the saved data from the Xbox 360 hard drive to the Xbox cloud. The article,
<a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/games/game-setup/game-saves-in-the-cloud-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Xbox Cloud Game Saves on Xbox 360</a>, will provide instructions on how to upload the data. Once the content is uploaded to the cloud, the Xbox One will read that information when the game is launched. Be sure to keep us posted Dante!

<h2>            NTFS5&#58; How to get hardlinks in MFT &#40;Master File Table&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I do scan of MFT to catch some files by condition like extention or attributes.</p>
<p>That is exellent technology. It works so fast and accurate.</p>
<p>But I have one problem - it doesn't see hardlinks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My questions are: </p>
<p>- does MFT table contain records to represent hardlinks?</p>
<p>- if YES. How to call "DeviceIoControl" function to get it? I use it with
FSCTL_ENUM_USN_DATA in parameters and full range of USN (0 to max) starting from 0. Is there other way to go through MFT?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>FindFirst\FindNext and NtXx or ZwXx for every file entity is very slow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Alex.K.</p>
