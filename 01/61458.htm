<h2>            Laptop overheating even after a clean install of windows 10</h2>
                    <p>since I upgraded to windows 10 I ve been having overheating issues (often ending up with the system shutting down), memory usage too high.... that all started about a year ago (with the upgrade from windows 8.1). I did a clean install today following the
 suggestion in another forum and.... it didn't change anything, it may have made things even worse (i don't know). I updated all the drivers one by one from toshiba's website&nbsp; and i still haven't installed anything besides steam and NCsoft launcher.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the worst part is that heat monitoring softwares will make me seem like a liar, Toshiba health monitor says its at 52°c currently and the fan is running at 70%. I swear I can feel the heat from pretty much 3/4 of the outer surface of the laptop so it must
 be burning hot inside.</p>
<p>before the upgrade the temperature displayed was around that value and the heat wasn't that noticeable. also when the fan starts making sounds (working at high speed) its speed on the monitor doesn't seem to change much.</p>
<p>&nbsp;one last thing about the temperature; when my computer shuts down the temperature is usually not&nbsp;above 60-70°c.</p>
<p>
</p><p>the clean install fixed most of the other issues though which makes me even more confused and curious about the cause of the overheating.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>with Microsoft edge and&nbsp;steam working and reinstalling my games in the background(those are the only 2 apps used); my CPU is at 4-7%, my memory is at 19%, and disc usage(or writing speed or whatever) is at 15-25%</p>
<p>either way it doesn't justify all the heat coming up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>with a fresh install i really can't see what can be causing such issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I double checked on Toshiba's website&nbsp;and my laptop is supported for the upgrade.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Overheating laptop could be due to performance issues. It might also happen if the power plan settings are not appropriate for the system’s processor.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><strong>Method 1:</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Please follow the steps to run the system maintenance troubleshooter:</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>a) Press<strong> Windows and X</strong> key together and select
<strong>Control Panel</strong>.</span></span></span></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><strong>Method 2:</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Let’s change the power plan settings to use minimum processor state to prevent overheating.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Reducing the maximum processor state for your laptop (both when it is on battery or when the power cable is plugged in), reduces the processor’s performance a notch (depending on your settings) and prevents it from
 being used at optimum potential by an application or game, which will reduce thermal heating. For example, if you are playing a game that is consuming 100% of your processor’s capacity, then it may also result in heating up your system, whereas reducing the
 battery power state to, say 80%, can resolve this problem, and also result in battery power conservation.</span></span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Follow the steps to do so:</span></span></span></p>

<strong>Power options</strong>.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>c) Go to <strong>Processor power management</strong>. Expand the icon and expand
<strong>maximum processor state.</strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>d) Reduce the processor state (for both
<strong>Plugged-in</strong> as well as <strong>On battery</strong>) to a certain level to verify if it makes any difference.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>e) Click on<strong> Apply</strong> and then

    <title>Why can&#39;t Mail download attachments&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> damon.russel  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why can&#39;t Mail download attachments&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I'm using Windows 8 and the built-in Mail app, and I frequently run into errors when trying to download email attachments such as in-line graphics or PowerPoint presentations.&nbsp; It gives me an error that says:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One or more files couldn't be downloaded.&nbsp; <strong>Try again</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try again does in fact try again, but it always fails.&nbsp; There have been a few attachments that I can open, but most give me this error.&nbsp; This makes the Mail app a poor replacement for Outlook.&nbsp; In fact, if I can't even download my attachments, the Mail app
 is pointless.&nbsp; I should mention, I've run into this on my desktop with Win 8 Pro (RTM) and my laptop with Win 8 Enterprise (RTM) and my Surface RT and this problem exists on all three devices.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is using my work email which uses Exchange 2003, so I'm wondering if there are some issues between Mail and Exchange 2003.&nbsp; Has anyone else run into this problem?&nbsp; If so, do you have any advice on how to fix it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Aaaah, as a matter of fact yes! I DID solve my problem. Hopefully it works for you too. I discovered that when I started Task Manager and looked under "Processes" there was a dllhost that was gradually consuming more and more of my memory. It would slowly
 increase until eventually the whole system would crash and I would have to restart. So I solved it by simply ending the process of the dllhost. Every once in awhile, however, I notice the same problem occuring and I have to go back into Task Manager to check...
 and sure enough, that same dllhost will be eating up all of my processing power. So I just "End Process" on it again. Not a big deal since it happens less frequently than once a month to me, and its an easy fix. So start up Task Manager and see if you've got
 a dllhost using up an insane amount of memory. If so, that's probably what is causing your problem. I really hope this solves your problem as it was a huge pain in the **** for me. Very frustrating. Also I should note that the first

<h2>            Windows 7 64 bit e-studio 45 drivers</h2>
                    I am trying to configure a printer Toshiba e-studio 45 to Windows 7 64bit machine, but I cannot determine what driver would work with the printer.&nbsp; I have tried several drivers from the printer list and the printer is still not working.&nbsp; (A lot of trees
 are in fear of all the paper that is coming out of the printer after a print a simple document)

<p>Hi joecoolrd2k,</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft answers!</p>
<p>I visited the Toshiba Copier drivers website and found that Windows 7 compatible drivers aren’t available for the e-STUDIO45 model.</p>
<p>e-STUDIO45 is not listed in the Windows 7 compatibility center well. So, the compatibility of the same is unknown with Windows 7. Refer the link below for details:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?type=Hardware&amp;s=Toshiba e-studio 45&amp;page=1&amp;os=64-bit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?type=Hardware&amp;s=Toshiba%20e-studio%2045&amp;page=1&amp;os=64-bit</strong></a></p>
<p>You may also refer the link below for Frequently asked questions (FAQs) related to Windows 7 Compatibility and the steps you could carry out in case the software/hardware is not listed in Windows 7 Compatibility Center.</p>

<p>For now, I’d suggest you to download the Windows Vista drivers and install the same in Vista compatibility mode on Windows 7.</p>
<p>To install the software (drivers) in Vista Compatibility mode, <br />
1. Right click the installation file and select Properties.<br />
2. Click the Compatibility tab.<br />
3. Under Compatibilty mode, check the “Run this program in compatibility mode for:” option.<br />
4. Select Windows Vista (Service Pack 1) or Windows Vista (Service Pack 2) from the available options.
<br />
5. Click Apply and OK.</p>
<p>Refer the link below for more information on compatibility mode:</p>
<p><strong>Make older programs run in this version of Windows<br />

<p>If you do a factory reset and choose to keep all it will not delete anything off your console. Everything will be right where u left it. Also&nbsp;if&nbsp;you downloaded Battlefield 4 from the vault in EA Access then u do need to be a member to pay those games as
 long as your an EA access member. If you didn't buy the game through EA Access and bought it on the actual Xbox store or have the physical disc then u don't need to be a EA Access member. Hope this helps</p>

            <p>For the benefit of others, this is the referenced post:&nbsp; <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-files/windows-script-host-other/78ff3f88-5150-4eb4-b224-8fc4ab54c8c4">

<p>
</p><p>With regard to the "whole bunch of files are listed, some of them when clicked says, Windows Script Host," you need to be a bit more specific.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First, however, what antivirus and/or antimalware software do you have installed?&nbsp; Scripts that can be executed by the Windows Script Host can be useful but also can be malware.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide the names of these files (if there are more the 5 or so, you don't have to provide all of the names).&nbsp; Please include the file extension (the 2, 3, or 4 characters after the dot in the file name).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are the files in your "My Documents" folder or are they in a sub-folder that is contained within "My Documents"?&nbsp; If the latter, what is the name of the sub-folder?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please provide some more detail for "some of them when clicked says, Windows Script Host" --</p>
<ul>
<li>Are attempting to open these files by double-clicking?&nbsp; And if so, what is the message that you get?</li><li>Do you mean that you right-click on them, select Properties, and then see "Windows Script Host" somewhere in the Properties sheet?</li><li>Other?</li></ul>
<p>********************************************************************</p>
<p>Your other problem may or may not be related (if some of the scripts are malware, your browser home page may be hijacked).</p>
<p>
</p><p>What do you mean by "whenever I recharge my mobile phone or internet online"?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does "whenever I tried to open any website, the website that opens is airtel" mean that when you start your browser, it opens to the airtel site or do you mean that whenever you type in the address of any web site, you go to the airtel site instead?&nbsp; What
 browser (including version) are you using?&nbsp; What version of Windows do you have?</p>

            &nbsp;
<p><span>Hello, LemP</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks for answering my questions and putting the link (reference post) for my previous Post.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Following are the answers to your questions:</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I have Avast antivirus installed on my Windows 7-32 bit laptop computer, occasionally, I download and run Malwarebytes Anti-Malware on the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>These Files are under Document Folder under Libraries section on Left Pane.</span><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Name of several files starts with some kind of yellow symbol with letter S written in the middle and then some description like (11.96a48dc5165136542e80.mn) that follows the yellow S symbol. File
 Type is “JScript Script File”. There are no 3 or 4 characters extension at the end of the File Type. &nbsp;There are almost 20 or 30 of these kinds of files.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Then there are other files, name of these files starts with Google Chrome Logo followed by ATT00001 and different numbers for different files. Under File Type it says, “Chrome HTML Document”.&nbsp;</span>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Some of the other File Name shows some kind of symbol in front followed by “ccsetup520” after the symbol and under File Type says Application.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>When I Left click to open JScript Script File, a small box titled, “Windows Script Host” appears and among other things, it says, Error: Object expected, Code: 800a138F, Source: Microsoft Jscript
 runtime error.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Other File types are CRDownload Files.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>These above described files are interspersed with my other documents.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I just want to know would it be safe for me to delete the above described files from my Document Folder?</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To clarify my second question about airtel site.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>No, airtel website does not open when I try to open any website.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>What I was trying to say/write was, whenever, I recharge my mobile phone or internet online whether it is on airtel website or bank website, (some banks offer mobile and internet recharge service
 on their websites, you maybe aware of this). After the recharge is completed and then when I try to go to any other website, (by typing the web address of other websites, in address bar), airtel site opens up.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To correct this situation, I have to turn off the computer few times and then I am able to go to the websites, I want to go to.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I use Google Chrome version 52.0.2743.116 and Internet Explorer version 11.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Thanks.</span></p>

            <p>It sounds as if Chrome is saving temporary files to your "My Documents" folder,l but I have no idea why it would do that.&nbsp; You might try asking in the Google Chrome help forum --&gt;

<p>
</p><p>I misunderstood what you meant by "recharge your phone."&nbsp; You mean to add more minutes.&nbsp; Sorry, I don't know why airtel appears to hijack your browser after you do that.</p>

</p><p>About my first question, &nbsp;as suggested by you, I will ask Google Chrome Help Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For my airtel problem I will have to ask airtel. </p>

<p>Anyone from Texas? I'm just looking for a group of people to play Black Ops with, would be cool to meet other people in the same state or same time zone. I got my XBOX 360 about two weeks ago. I'll give you my other gamer tag or something.</p>

<h3> trinityassembly of god  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to turn off &#8220;Restricted Mode is enabled by your network administrator&#8221; in YouTube, but I AM the administrator too.</h2>
                    <p class="contentStandard">I don't understand what changed about two weeks ago! I was able to view YouTube in full access, and I didn't know there was a restricted mode. We have about 10 computers on our network varying from XP to Windows 10 and for some
 reason mine is the only one on restricted mode for YouTube! We use a Fortinet FortiWiFi-60D Router/Filter and my computer and one other is using the Forticlient software for Antivirus and etc. I have checked all through the Router and the Forticlient trying
 to find something blocking my computer with no luck yet. Besides if that was the issue then more computers should be blocked too! Since this is seemingly blocked by the administrator the settings on YouTube do not give the On/Off switch to restricted mode

            Hi.
<br />
<br />Go to those steps, from the Start menu or by pressing the key combination Win + I open the Configuration and click on the option Networks and Internet. Once there, we select the option Status of the left side menu and within the settings and options that are loaded in the right panel we have to look for network restoration.
<br />Clicking on this option will show us a new window from where we will be able to perform the network reset in Windows 10. In this way, all the network adapters will be removed and reinstalled and the original configuration of other components of the network will be re-established. net. This implies that if we were using some software such as a VPN client or virtual switches, we will have to reinstall them.
<br />A process that is carried out automatically by the system by clicking on the Reset button now shown in Network Reset in the Windows 10 configuration. It is normal that the process does not take too long, although we must wait until the end completely and restart the computer again to proceed with the network configuration in Windows 10 as we had until now.

            Hi Michael.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Check for a newer Display driver on the PC or Display adapter Support Downloads webpage.  While there check if there are other newer drivers to Update, including BIOS, Chipset, Sound, Network, USB3, Bluetooth and all others.  Compare to the one present installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu..  You can take your time until they are all updated.  
<br />
<br />There is a known issue of incorrect Display driver being pushed by Windows Update which requires rolling back the driver.  Right click Start to open Device Manager, choose Display device, then Driver tab, then Roll back.  
<br />
<br />If there is no Roll Back or that doesn't help choose Update Driver on Display device Driver tab, then Browse Computer, then Let Me Pick to see a list of all previously installed Display drivers, work backwards trying each to find one that works.  
<br />
<br />If necessary you can also go to Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update to look for the driver under Installed Updates and Uninstall it form link there.   Then you can hide the driver so it isn't pushed again using the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If none of those work try to System Restore to a point before the problem began:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>.  Make sure System Restore is always enabled for C with plenty of disk space apportioned (5-10%) in its Configuration settings.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Ctrl P Dialog box delay - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> denwall  say:</h3>
<h2>            Ctrl P Dialog box delay</h2>
                    <p>We recently purchased 3 PC's to process our UPS/FedEx shipments. They all have Windows 7 (32 bit, I believe). Out of the box, the Ctrl P function (which we use hundreds of times a day to print our packing slips) responded quickly and the dialog box would
 open within&nbsp;a few seconds. We changed the toner settings and now the time between hitting CTRL P and the dialog box opening is about 10-15 seconds. It used to be instant! And because we print hundreds of times a day, this delay really kills production. We
 reset the printer setting back to factory, but the delay is still there. There is also another delay between selecting OK to print and the document actually printing (another production killer). Does anyone have any suggestions on how to get it to respond
 like it did originally?</p>

    <title>Xbox 360s controller - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> unbiasedmean85  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 360s controller</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have an xbox 360s. Today I noticed that the console was not connecting with the controller. The console was on, teh controller was displaying 4 flashing green lights. I contacted xbox supprt and after teh usual text book fault diagnosis was carried out.
 the issue still persisted. I then suggested some extra basic diagnostics to the support guy and I discovered the following;</p>
<p><br />
1.&nbsp; If turn on your console and it is not plugged into a TV this this issue will occur - both controller and xbox will come on. but the controller and xbox will not communicate and you will have four flashing green lights on the controller.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; If you turn on your console and your TV was previously turned off manually using the on/off power button, senario 1. (above) will occur.</p>
<p>3. If however you turn on your console and the TV was previousl put into standby mode, then, both your console and controller will link quite happily.</p>
<p>Conclusion; the console will not communicate/link with the controller if there is no power being detected through the HDMI cable.</p>
<p>Has anyone else experienced, or even noticed this issue? I can not see any reference to this in the manual under any trouble shooting guide. And I think, this minor detail, needs to be mentioned by Microsoft.
</p>
<p>Thanks </p>

<p>Yes, your controller will not connect without the HD lead connected to the TV.</p>
<p>The xbox loading screen will not progress without the HD lead connected, so the console never gets to the "connect controller" section.

<p>Yes, this I understand. But, even with it connected to the tv, it still will not connect to the controller if the tv is complertely powered down and not in standby mode,which is odd. It therefore must follow that there is no power going through the HDMI
 lead, hence why I disconnected the HDMI lead, and was to be expected. But, why has microsoft not publicised the fact that some tv's may, when completely powered down, prevent the console form linking with the controller, as if the HDMI lead is diconnected.</p>

<p>Why would you want to use your xbox or controller without the tv connected?</p>
<p>I imagine most people don`t know about this feature, or will ever have it cause them any problems.</p>
<p>Hd leads have &nbsp;5 volts flowing through them in use, a powered down TV will not allow that voltage and thats why it won`t connect.</p>
<p>The only reason i know this exists is that i was using a HDMI splitter with a manual switch, i forgot to switch it one day.</p>

<p>That is why people should know, so they dont waist their time contacting xbox support. Sometimes I just turn on the the xbox to boot up before turning on thne tv. But can get distracted and when I return, why is the contorller not connected?. For some, this
 may appear to be a fault. And, I did not know this, till I noticed it today, but, after a lengthy chat with xbox support, who also were unaware. I realised the issue. They were quite happy to RMA it for a new one. and mine is 18 months old. A nice gesture,
 but totally unecessary.</p>
<p>Hence my post. A simple, not even an issue, but can cause a lot waisted time and hastle if unaware.</p>

<p>So if you turned on your console and noticed your controller had not connected, you would call support before turning on your TV??</p>
<p>When you get distracted just after turning on your console, then return, you notice the controller not connected but don`t notice the TV isn`t turned on and call support??</p>
<p>I bet 99.9% of players will never be affected by it in any way.</p>

<p>That is not what I meant, and as you have taken my comments out of context. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If this scenario only occurs if the tv is powered off using the on/off switch and not when powered down in standby mode. Therefore, if, all cables are correctly connected and batteries are fully charged, but the controller fails to connect to the console
 it would be reasonable to look at the possibility of a potential software or hardware issue.
</p>
<p>In your earlier previous posts you acknowledge that the technical attributes of current passing through the relevant connections during different power states of a tv, would affect the console ability to connect/link with the controller. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course not everyone can be as all knowing as and as knowledgeable you. And as a precaution, when something does not look or work as it has been, asking a few questions is not good practice.</p>
<p>I have to question your assumption that 99.9% of other xbox users would, in this scenario, be as all knowing and knowledgeable as yourself. And, they would, of course, not question any uncharacteristic software or hardware behaviour. Would it also be reasonable
 to conclude that the figure of 99.9% is possible based on one person.</p>
<p>There are different forums full of posts, where people ask legitimate questions. Sometimes to seek clarification, solutions etc., and sometimes to exchange, information, so there is no need for others to ask.
</p>
<p>Patronising comments to any issue, simple or otherwise is neither helpful nor constructive and does nothing to promote the community spirit of this or any other forum.
</p>
<p>If xbox support had felt this was odd behaviour and have escalated, then I would say that makes this is a relevant topic.</p>

<p>My point was quite simple and not patronising at all.</p>
<p>Are you honestly telling me that you or anyone else would call support to report a hardware issue BEFORE turning on their TV to try and see whats wrong??</p>
<p>When you saw the 4 lights flashing on your controller and see it hadn`t connected,what was your next move?</p>
<p>Did you turn on the TV or did you go straight to calling support?</p>
<p>Look at any trouble shooting guide, the first thing it will say is are all cables connected are all items powered on, your problem would be fixed instantly as the answer would be no.</p>
<p>Xbox support escalate anything that they can`t answer right there and then, and judging by some of the threads on this forum that`s just about every call they receive.</p>

<p>Simply out of curiosity I just tried an experiment.</p>
<p>My console is connected to my TV via HDMI, if I power up my console with the TV turned off the wireless controller connects just fine!</p>
<p>This is the first time I have ever turned on my console with the TV off in all my 20 years of gaming.</p>
<p>Conclusion - No problems, no issues, no further action required. </p>

<p>This is getting very tedious. You still do not appear to be evading my point. </p>
<p>Yes, I checked the power to both console, controller and tv. Yes, not an issue for me to solve or anyone else, even for someone with basic knowledge of xbox.
</p>
<p>My point at the time it happened was; is it normal behaviour for the the console not connect to the controller, when the tv is powered down completely via the on/off button. And not the case if the tv is powered down in standby mode.</p>
<p>Not a complicated question, but, neverless, valid. As you correctly pointed out, ''Hd leads have &nbsp;5 volts flowing through them in use, a powered down TV will not allow that voltage and thats why it won`t connect.''
</p>
<p>But, this is not commented on in xbox literature and to be honest, the techinical details are not necesarry. But, as I had not noticed this behaviour pereviously, I therefore sought clarifiction on this, for curiosity sake. Which would also be useful, especially
 to those who are less technically adept, should someone else experience this. I feel that you may prefer a forum for the more xbox aware, who's posts would be more technically demanding. And that maybe this forum is the wrong place for support, but more for
 massaging egos.</p>
<p>I am concerned at your apparent assumption that everybody who owns an xbox is techwise, which is not the case and is what gives those at technical support a reason for being.</p>

<p>All tv manufacturers and models have differnet configurations. This bears out my question. I could conclude that, as my console does not connect with the controller, does this mean my xbox may be faulty? Or that, my HDMI port just has no power to it, if
 the tv has been powered down using the on/off switch, therefore no connection is detected with the console.</p>
<p>I take it your tv was not in standby mode, but powered of by the on/off button?</p>

I would try two more things -- just download and install the basic print and scan driver ( OJP8500vA909_Basic_13.exe) available at the same link; it was released on 11/4/2010 so hopefully won't see a newer version. Note that the instructions say you may get
 some error messages and tells what to do about them. Hopefully that will work but if not, the next step I would try would be to run the "HP Officejet Pro Software and Driver Removal Utility" which is also available in the same area and then reboot and then
 try reinstalling the Full Feature Software and Driver Package.

I am still not having any luck - I still am getting that message about Newer version of software already exist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I ran the diagnostic uninstall thru all 4 levels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did the remove thru the add/remove utility for what I thought was there for the printer - but you have to consider that I have an HP computer - so there are other HP components there that I do not want to remove.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Are you using the "USB" connection or "Wireless Network" connection - I am trying to do this using "Wireless Network".&nbsp;</p>

<p>it did though it was not registered and never bothered to input the key it came with&nbsp; so currently the win 10 installed is unregistered&nbsp;</p>

<p>We'd like to clarify if the Windows 10 license that you have is a pre-installed that came with your laptop, and if you also bought a retailed license key that you'd like to use on another computer.</p>
