<h2>            Dissapointing performance and hard drive for &#36;4100</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I purchased the top end surface studio and all the literature around the HD was a hybrid drive but no real specs around it (prior to purchase). I opened the machine last night to see that it only has a 128 gb SSD and the remainder of the storage is on a
 standard old school hard drive.&nbsp; I am perplexed on why Microsoft wouldn't just installed a 2 TB SSD that you can buy at any retailer now for less than $500.&nbsp; The stability, efficiency, speed, and numerous other reasons to not have an old fashion hard drive.&nbsp;
 I've never had an SSD drive crash on me but i have had plenty of HD's crash...ugh...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I love the idea of the machine but do i now want to go find a way to replace the HD with an SSD and then spend a day reinstalling windows and all the other drivers needed and spend another $500 on a $4k plus computer is daunting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am very disappointed and perhaps have learned my lesson about being an earlier adopter. My surface book out performs my surface studio.&nbsp; I have also run benchmark test on the Studio and my sons $1400 desktop that he built himself out-performs it on every
 level.&nbsp; I am looking for an all in one to move away from the Dell XPS 27 but I am not sure $4000 surface studio is the answer.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>On the pro side the screen is amazing, best screen I've ever seen on a computer. The surface dial is somewhat confusing which I'm sure will get easier in time.....The fan is quite loud but this could be the early start of the system downloading and multi-tasking,
 we'll see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am guessing it is a two week return period for the Surface Studio which i have to strongly consider giving some of the specs and performance.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I am wrong on the HD or you can shed any more light on this hybrid drive, that would be very helpful. Also, the email you send with the dedicated phone line is not a dedicated phone line at all&nbsp; and is merely Microsoft's Support Line "Microsoft Device's
 and Hardware and Support" ....Definitely not the concierge type support line i was expecting from the Welcome email.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice suggestions on the above would be helpful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thank you,</p>
<p>

            <p>Apple had and still does use the hybrid drives on some of their models and those drives are junk!&nbsp; They do tend to fail for which I found out with a Mac mini.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, as for upgrading/replacing RAM and hard disks on the Surface Studio?&nbsp; Forget it!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Everything including the CPU is soldered in and are non-replaceable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can't say anything about the Dell model coming out and it should be out now and it will most likely be upgradeable like all their other models.&nbsp; I saw a picture of the machine and looked like the computer is built into the monitor and not the base unit (more
 or less an overgrown all-in-one).&nbsp; There will most likely be other models coming out from other PC makers as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By the way, if you can tolerate the somewhat slow performance of the drive, stick with what you have.&nbsp; The hybrid drives do not all fail and mine was just probably a lemon.&nbsp; I haven't heard anything negative about them so far plus you can use the Surface
 Dial with the Studio (I don't think you can with the Dell model).</p>

            <p>That turns out to be true with both the hard disk and the SSDs may also be replaceable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't think the machine can be too slow for operation since the operating system goes onto the SSDs and the hard disk is used for storage.&nbsp; I am looking at saving up to get one myself and will see for sure then.&nbsp; It was reported before that they were soldered
 in like what Apple does with the newer iMacs and Mac minis.</p>

            <p>Hi Damon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to hear about your experience. As it is mentioned in other replies the SSD will handle your everyday work load and HDD is used for storage purposes. Undeniably the hybrid configuration would not replace a 2TB SSD in terms of performance, but it is
 quite capable of handling a wide range of work loads easily. Regarding</p>
<p>replacing your HDD, please keep in mind that the SSD and HDD are interacting under Intel RST (Rapid Storage Technology). HDD and SSD in Studio are physically replaceable (HDD--&gt;SATA cable--&gt;Mother Board, SSD--&gt;M.2 connector--&gt;Mother Board) and it is a personal
 decision to change them or not. Just the new configuration might not work due to RST. There are ways to disable RST first and replace the HW and re-enable it, but that is pretty involved. I just wanted to let you know about this, so you won't end up surprised
 if your device would not boot after the rework.</p>
<p>Have you noticed any slow response running&nbsp;any of your applications? The benchmark testing although might be a good throughput indicator however they usually don't represent a real time application data pattern/utilization, that's why I personally don't
 rely on them too much. Although I respect the fact that, it might be important for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you,</p>
<p>
</p><p>VV.</p>

            <p>Do not mess around with Intel RST - the software only lets you use up to 64GB SSD for caching. I experimented with it, and now half of my SSD caching was gone on my Surface Studio. See me
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfstudio-surfdrivers/ssd-caching-broken-half-of-my-ssd-was-gone/a3798bbb-b571-4fa8-a5c0-41c9be88afd5">
recent thread</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you disable RST, and re-enable RST (like I did), you are going to cry because Intel won't let you use more than 64GB SSD as cache. Also the system became very slow and unstable. The RST software reported itself broken after Surface driver package was
 installed. Potentially MS did not use the conventional Intel RST implementation and that's why it is not 100% compatible. You are warned (I suppose I am the first victim/experimenter) on this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think either MS or Intel should release a fix for this problem ASAP as people will get confused or break their computer if they are trying to implement their own hard drive solutions.</p>

            <p>You should be getting much better read/write speeds out of your Surface Studio than that! My out-of-the-box i7 Surface Studio was getting nearly 2000 MB/s read and 630 MB/s write speeds. Sounds to me like you messed things up when you were tinkering around
 with the acceleration cache on your stock "rapid hybrid drive" setup (as per <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfstudio-surfdrivers/ssd-caching-broken-half-of-my-ssd-was-gone/a3798bbb-b571-4fa8-a5c0-41c9be88afd5">
your other thread</a>).<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>That being said, you can get much better read/write speeds out of your Surface Studio by simply upgrading its storage. I'm getting nearly 3000 MB/s read and 2000 MB/s write speeds out of my own Surface Studio now. It's a total screamer!</p>

            <p>I dunno. I can tell the acceleration is still working (even though on 64gb), but the benchmark does not. I think when I was filling up the HDD, the SSD no longer cached everything (apparently), resulting in ultra low testing scores.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The testing score does not translate well into real life usage however, given your most recent files (read or write) are cached by the SSD. So the system actually feels very responsive compared to those awfully low scores.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the test again just now. This time it resembled more like when it was shipped. To me, the benchmark software is a complete failure/mystery at telling my hard drive performance.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e2b7d643-8ca4-4f6c-9927-499a267dcfd6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e2b7d643-8ca4-4f6c-9927-499a267dcfd6" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Note that I ran the test at 50MiB, and the guy in the Know-How Surface Studio Hard Drive Replacement video said you could only get very slow speed at 50MiB. This only proves that the benchmark is ridiculously inconsistent from day to day depending on how
 empty the cache drive is.</p>

            Actually, what you're seeing there is completely normal behavior for a "rapid hybrid drive". Once you've filled up your machine with more than 128 GB (119 GB actual) of data, then the Intel Smart Response Technology has to start making (somewhat educated)
 guesses as to what to cache onto the fast SSD, and what to leave over on the slow HDD. Your two benchmarks are simply showing the cases where the cache either hits its mark, or misses it terribly. That's the bummer about using a caching setup (and why it would
 be better for you to upgrade your storage to full SSD and get rid of the "rapid hybrid drive" completely). Obviously, the caching will get better over time as it starts to understand what files you use the most (i.e. what to keep cached on the fast SSD), and
 what files you use infrequently (i.e. what to keep stored over on the slow SSD). In "real world" use, I'm sure that Microsoft found the "rapid hybrid drive" to have acceptable performance for the "average" user. However, benchmarks are never gonna show that.<br />
<br />
I completely understand why Microsoft went with the "rapid hybrid drive" setup on the Surface Studio though. Basically, it's already a really expensive machine, and they most likely didn't want to further increase the cost of it by installing expensive 1 TB
 or 2 TB SSDs into it (for which the cost would ultimately need to be passed along to the end user). That puts them in a bit of a dilemma seeing as a desktop PC isn't like a laptop/tablet where you can get away with smaller amounts of storage space (i.e. most
 users expect a modern day desktop PC to have at least 1 TB of storage I would imagine). Thus, Microsoft took a "best of both worlds" approach and went with using Intel's Smart Response Technology in order to speed up the storage with a small SSD while still
 allowing them to use a big (and less expensive) HDD. You certainly can't fault them for doing that. And to Microsoft's credit, they made the storage in the Surface Studio fully upgradable (instead of soldering the SSD to the motherboard as other companies
 would do). The storage upgrade is certainly not easy, but it's definitely doable.

            <p>I have the mid-range model of the Surface Studio and LOVE it, with the exception of the performance when editing in Adobe Lightroom.&nbsp; I am attributing&nbsp;the perceived slow performance in&nbsp;Lightroom&nbsp;to the fact that I am coming from a faster hard drive in my
 previous PC because everything else seems to be optimized as well as it possibly can be.&nbsp; With all of the mentions here of the Intel Rapid Storage Technology, I decided to poke around my Surface Studio and cannot find any install of IRST on the PC at all.&nbsp;
 Being that I just had some firmware from November pushed to my PC yesterday, as well as a few Intel drivers, seemingly a couple months after they probably should have been made available to my PC, I am curious if maybe my PC is missing the IRST software.&nbsp;
 Would anyone know if I should be seeking out an installation of the IRST software?&nbsp; Perhaps that would help to optimize my hard drive and improve performance when I am editing photos in Lightroom.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts?</p>

This happens in both Chrome and Firefox. I have reinstalled both browsers several times. Anti-virus and AdAware does not show any problems. I've tired reinstalling the keyboard driver and changing every setting for the keyboard I can.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
For reasons beyond me, the error is not happening as I type this message. Error does not occur when I am in Notepad, Microsoft Word, etc - only the Chrome/Firefox when I am in Gmail/Blogger.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
Any help would be seriously appreciated!!</span></strong></p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>My space bar is doing the same thing (acting as an Enter key) in AOL,&nbsp;Microsoft Word, and just now my cursor jumped back a few words for no apparent reason. I'm not sure how to apply the questions you asked, but I'd love some direction.</p>
<p>Thanks so much,</p>

<div>I've noticed this too.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I was just composing a letter via an online answer window ( although this does occur in the email program, as well...but intermittently) and, in editing my post. I hit the space bar. The message was sent...incomplete. Very unprofessional looking (I can
 only imagine) to see a partially written /edited message come in to one's inbox. Unfortunately, the message came from me and the receiver is going to attribute the error to me, not to a computer "glitch".</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I worked very hard in these couple of days trying to solve the following problems in my computer:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; I could not install window updates with the error message: "Failure configuring Windows updates. Reverting changes. Do not turn off your computer".</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; I could not install or uninstall Silverlight with the error message: "The feature you are trying to use is on a network resource that is unavailable."</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; I could not install Microsoft.Net Framework as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried many&nbsp;ways as suggested in the Microsoft Community&nbsp;with no luck and nearly want to give up.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fortunately,&nbsp;today I&nbsp;found the following tools which could&nbsp;solve all my problems:-</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; First of all, I used System File Checker which helped me to install most of the Window updates except Silverlight and Microsoft.Net Framework.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; Then I used the Microsoft Fix it 50747 as suggested by Jose to fix the installation problem caused by corrupted registry.&nbsp; Now I can install Silverlight and .Net Framework.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you to Jose and all those who provide suggestions in the Microsoft Community.&nbsp; I really appreciate your help!</p>

    <title>Disable Caps Lock on Windows 10&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mickey segal  say:</h3>
<h2>            Disable Caps Lock on Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>On previous versions of Windows there have been easy ways to disable the Caps Lock key to avoid typing text thAT SUDDENLY TURNS TO Caps when you accidently hit the Caps Lock key.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>These approaches do not appear to work for a Surface Pro 2 running Windows 10.&nbsp; One registry-based approach that no longer works is&nbsp;
<a href="http://www.askvg.com/how-to-disable-annoying-caps-lock-key-in-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.askvg.com/how-to-disable-annoying-caps-lock-key-in-windows/</a>.&nbsp; Another program that doesn't work is the ancient PC Magazine utility TradeKeys that worked on Windows 7:
<a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,19645,00.asp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,19645,00.asp</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This problem is particularly annoying on the Surface Pro 2 because there is almost no space between the keys on the keyboard and one frequently hits an adjacent key by mistake.&nbsp; There, Caps Lock is adjacent to the letter A key</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone know a good way of disabling Caps Lock on Windows 10 that doesn't involve using glue?</p>

    <title>OneDrive - Video Playback - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stephen emerson  say:</h3>
<h2>            OneDrive - Video Playback</h2>
                    
<p>Hello to the community!</p>
<p>I was wondering if someone could shed some light on something that has bothered me for some time now.</p>
<p>When playing video on&nbsp;the Xbox One through the OneDrive app, they seem to take forever to keep buffering before playing. So for me it normally takes about 5 minutes to watch a 30 second video clip. I've noticed that the same video when viewed on a tablet/desktop
 computer through IE&nbsp;can stream much in the way YouTube does. There is no waiting for it to buffer. I understand there would need to be some sort of encoding or something going on in real time to facilitate this, so does this mean that the OneDrive app for
 Xbox One does not have this functionality? Or have I messed up a setting somewhere?</p>
<p>Any comments would be most appreciated.</p>
<p>Kind Regards</p>
<p>WolfStar85</p>

<p>I had this issue for a while, but it seemed to resolve itself eventually. &nbsp;I still have issues with OneDrive on Xbox One, though. &nbsp;I often watch videos which are an hour or more long, and they always, always, stop playing at almost exactly one hour, then
 restart. &nbsp;Its very frustrating.</p>

<p>Hi Mohamed</p>
<p>
</p><p>Not sure of your problem with Microsoft but I can tell you Curry's were completely wrong to tell you to got to Microsoft, you purchased the item from Curry's therefore your contract is with them, it is up to Curry's to sort it, they have can have one chance
 to repair the device or exchange for new. I would follow this up with Curry's, please check the Which website, which covers this topic, web address below.</p>

</p><p><span>You have the legal right to a refund if you return your faulty good within 30 days of receiving it, regardless of what the store's return policy says.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>With regards your tracking issue, the only thing I can suggest it to get in touch with them, providing you have proof of delivery that they received it in Germany you should be ok.</p>

            <p>I know this is an half year old thread but I've the same issue and go..*cough* bing! brought me here.&nbsp;So I hope I can get any help here to keep windows stable and running on my system. It's a fresh and clean install with the recommended nvidia driver (used
 their java plugin on their website to chose the driver). </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm sure my sound card driver isn't installed, but this isn't the problem here I think.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've collected the requested data, you can have a look here: https://1drv.ms/f/s!ApLxkqWswMBmjFqS4a1qZ-8u8q_-</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reply, wouldn't like to change back to Ubuntu because I need some specific software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

<p>
</p><p>The Blue Screens or Stop Errors can be caused by both hardware and software problems. If after installing the update, your Surface produces a series of Stop Errors, you may consider removing the recent update. If you're able to boot into normal mode, search
 for <span>View Installed Updates</span> and select the control panel result.&nbsp; Identify the recent update or updates; you may have to uninstall one at a time to see if it improves the performance.
<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I</span><span>f you can't get to the desktop and </span>your device has restarted several times, it will&nbsp;begin automatic repair.
<span>After automatic repair, on the <strong>Choose an option </strong>screen, select
<strong>Troubleshoot</strong> &gt; <strong>Advanced options </strong>&gt; <strong>System Restore</strong>. This option reverts your device to an earlier point, called a system restore point. Restore points are created when you install a new app, driver, update, or
 when you <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4027538" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
create a system restore point manually</a>. Choose a restore point created before the error occurred.
</span><span>Restoring your PC to an earlier point will remove updates and drivers installed after the restore point was made. It won't affect your personal files.</span><span> If restoring your PC to an earlier point fixes the stop error,
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
temporarily block the update from automatically installing again</a>.</span></p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p><span>You can also start Windows in safe mode to uninstall recent updates.</span> After a<span>utomatic repair</span>,
<span>on the <strong>Choose an option </strong>screen, select <strong>Troubleshoot
</strong>&gt; <strong>Advanced options </strong>&gt; <strong>Startup Settings </strong>
&gt; <strong>Restart</strong>.</span> After it restarts,<span> you'll see a list of options. Press the 4 or F4 key for
<strong>Safe Mode</strong>. To access the Internet, press the 5 or F5 key for <strong>
Safe Mode with Networking</strong></span>. In safe mode, s<span>elect the <strong>
Start </strong>button &gt; <strong>Settings &nbsp;</strong>&gt; <strong>Update &amp; security</strong> &nbsp;&gt;
<strong>Windows update</strong>.</span> Once there, identify the problem update, and remove it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In some cases, this is due to a recently added new hardware. Try shutting down the device, unplugging the new hardware, and restarting as this is often caused by the connected hardware devices and their associated drivers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>If you have additional questions, or if the issue persists after the troubleshooting steps above, please let me know by replying to this thread. This way, I'll get notified and respond back to you as soon as I can.</span></span></p>

<p><strong><span>Hi hey123hey,</span>
</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span>

<ul>
<li><strong><span>How did you delete the Administrator Account?</span>
</strong></li></ul>
<p><strong><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers!</span>
</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>I would suggest you to perform a system restore from the Windows Recovery Environment.</span>
</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>To do this, you need to have the Windows Vista Operating System DVD.</span>
</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Also, to use System Restore option, there must be a System Restore point at which the logon was successful.</span>
</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span>Insert the Windows Vista or Windows 7 DVD, and then restart the computer.</span>
</strong></li><li><strong><span>When you receive the following message, press any key:</span>
</strong></li></ol>
<p>
<strong><span>Press any key to boot from CD or DVD.</span>
</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span>
</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong><span>Set the following preferences, and then click
<span>Next</span> :</span> </strong>
<ul>
<li><strong><span>Language to install</span>
</strong></li><li><strong><span>Time and currency format</span>
</strong></li><li><strong><span>Keyboard or input method</span>
</strong></li></ul>
</li><li><strong><span>Click
<span>Repair your computer</span> , select the operating system that you want to repair, and then click
<span>Next</span> .</span> </strong></li><li><strong><span>Click
<span>System Restore</span> , and then click <span>Next</span> .</span> </strong>
</li><li><strong><span>Click the restore point that you want to use, and then click
<span>Next</span> .<br />
<br />
<span>Note</span> Click a restore point that will return the computer to a state where the logon is successful. After you use the System Restore feature, reinstall any programs or updates that may be removed. You will not lose any personal documents. However,
 you may have to reinstall programs. You may also have to reset some personal settings.</span>
</strong></li><li><strong><span>Confirm the disks that you want to restore, and then click
<span>Next</span> .</span> </strong></li><li><strong><span>Click
<span>Finish</span> , and then click <span>Yes</span> when you are prompted.</span>
</strong></li><li><strong><span>When the System Restore process is complete, click
<span>Restart</span> to restart the computer.</span> </strong></li><li><strong><span>After the computer restarts, click
<span>Close</span> to confirm that the System Restore process has finished successfully.</span>
</strong></li><li><strong><span>Use an appropriate method to log on. For example, log on by using an older password, or log on by using another computer
 account.</span> </strong></li></ol>
<p><strong><span>&nbsp;</span>
</strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Check out this link which talks about How to use System Restore to log on to Windows 7 or Windows Vista when you lose
 access to an account</span> </strong></p>

            Hi 5Coronas , that will be no problem, you can reinstall Windows 10 at any time and it will not cost you anything !
<br />
<br />Since you previously had Windows 10 installed and activated on that PC during the installation process skip the steps which ask for a product key and select the option 'I am Reinstalling Windows 10 on this PC', and activation will not be an issue, your PC will have a digital entitlement stored on the Microsoft Activation Servers 
<br />
<br />Make sure you install the same Edition of Windows 10 (Home, Pro . . . etc.) you previously had installed to avoid Activation issues 
<br />
<br />Click this link: 
<br /><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-downlo...</a>
<br />to download the Media Creation Tool (Click on Download Tool Now), with that you can download the latest Windows 10 ISO (Select Create Installation Media for Another PC), you can create a bootable USB flash drive (min 8GB) using that tool
<br />
<br />Then, Boot your PC from the Installation Media you just created (change Boot Order in your BIOS) to begin installing Windows 10 
<br />
<br />If you have problems booting from a boot disc, you may have UEFI BIOS:
<br />Insert the Bootable Installation Media, then go into your BIOS and make the following changes: 
<br />1. Disable Secure Boot 
<br />2. Enable Legacy Boot 
<br />3. If Available enable CSM 
<br />4. If Required enable USB Boot 
<br />5. Move the device with the bootable disc to the top of the boot order 
<br />6. Save BIOS changes, restart your System and it should boot from the Installation Media

            If you had your Windows 10 license activated previously, you got a digital license. You will never need the product key again once you get digital license. Since, you have a digital license, hence when you do clean install, the license information is automatically picked up from Microsoft activation servers. Windows will activate your Windows license from this information.
<br />
<br />Make sure the version installed is same as it was previous. For example, if it was Windows 10 Home, you need to install Windows 10 Home only not Windows 10 Pro. If at any point during installation it asks for the key, choose you will do it later on / skip.

            Hello,
<br />
<br />License is usually tied to motherboard, not hard drive.
<br />
<br />So you can reinstall Windows 10 and it should automatically activated.
<br />
<br />If it is not activated automatically, refer following fix:

<h2>            Laptop monitor doesn&#39;t turn on after disconnected to HDMI connection for mutiple display mode</h2>
                    My laptop is currently only functioning through an external monitor via an HDMI cord to my television screen. I don't think anything is wrong with my hardware or lights behind my screen, but I don't know how to fix it. I've gone through Intel graphic settings
 and Windows display settings and there isn't a place to fix this issue. The intel settings seems to only have my Samsung telelvision screen listed under the monitors. It's as if my computer uninstalled its own screen. Please help, because I can't use my laptop
 without a screen unless I am home and that defeats the purpose of having a portable computer.

    <title>Surface Pen tilt not working in most apps - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jvincent417  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface Pen tilt not working in most apps</h2>
                    <p>I recently purchased a 15 inch Surface Book 2 and 2017 Surface Pen. It's a great device, but I'm having a problem where almost every drawing app I try refuses to create different lines when I tilt the pen. Pressure sensitivity and accuracy are fine, it's
 just the tilt. I'm lead to believe this is a software/driver issue because tilt DOES work, but only in the Windows Ink Sketchpad app. All other apps I've tried that supposedly support tilt, seem to not, regardless of brush and pen settings within those apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Programs I've tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Krita</p>
<p>Photoshop CC</p>
<p>Autodesk Sketchbook</p>
<p>Rebelle 3</p>
<p>Paint 3D</p>
<p>Windows Ink Sketchpad (the only one where tilt works)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As far as I know, Windows and drivers are fully updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance.</p>

            Hey, thank you for replying, but I already solved it. It turns out tilt was working the whole time; I just had to edit the brush settings in Krita some more, as the effect was barely noticeable.

    <title>MS Sans Serif font almost unreadable - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> computerbug  say:</h3>
<h2>            MS Sans Serif font almost unreadable</h2>
                    The MS Sans Serif font looks ugly in Vista.&nbsp; The dialogs of many programs use this font, especially the MS Sans Serif Regular 8 point.&nbsp; The font is grainy, very narrow and hard to see.&nbsp; Since I have no control of program specified fonts, I would like to
 know if there is an update to this font available that would improve its appearance.&nbsp; I have been unable to find an update in searches on the Microsoft Web site.&nbsp; The font worked fine in XP where the same program on that OS displays the characters very clearly,
 but in Vista they are almost unreadable.<br />
