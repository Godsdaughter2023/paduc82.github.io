            Hi,
<div><br />
<div>thank you for your reply.</div>
<div><br />
<div>To find where the error was located, I started Windows in Safe Mode and see that with Safe Mode the F10 key was running regular.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also with the normal mode the F10 was running a few moments after desktop was loaded.</div>
<div><br />
<div>So I thought that a program locked the key.</div>
<div><br />
<div>After some analysis I discover that a program called&nbsp;<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Intel</em><span>® Trusted Platform Module
</span>something so (I don't have anymore the computer with me) has the F10 key setted as the "disconnect key" and this program locks every key putted in these field.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The computer is an IBM Thinkpad T510, with OEM Windows installation.</div>
<div>It is not mine, so I couldn't know that the owner setted this key a few days ago. The system restore I runned wasn't able to change this option.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thank you again for the answer.</div>

<p>I'm having a problem with my F9 &amp; F10 keys. Volume up &amp; volume down buttons! It's a brand new computer. 2 wks. old. It was working now it's not. I had a wireless mouse hooked up to it and when I unplugged it...it worked. Then it stopped working again but
 I haven't had the mouse hooked up to it again. I need help and any kind of help would be appreciated.</p>

<p>Hello Dadof 5,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for your prompt reply - amazing. So, I already have an account. I don't know what my Skype ID is though.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Is my Skype ID the name above the email on the Skype page? Is this what I give to people who need to contact me?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Do I need to open a different account for my partner? If so, how do I do this because every time I try to open a new account, it goes back to mine?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I really hope you can help. I've been trying the 'support' Microsoft 'offers' and it's a joke. Thank goodness for people like you. I hate Microsoft!!!</p>

<p><span><span>Hi mustang53,</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>• Since when are you facing this issue?</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>This issue may occur if you set a higher amount of space for the Shadow Copy to use.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> You may try to&nbsp;<strong>restart Volume Shadow Copy service</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Click Start, type services.msc in Start Search.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Look for the Volume Shadow Copy service.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. Right click on Volume Shadow Copy service (VSS) and select Properties. Check if it is started.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d. If it is stopped select Start or Restart. Make sure that the service is started and set as Automatic.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>e. lick Apply and OK, if you make changes.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 2</span></strong><span>:<strong>Try turning off System restore and delete the restore points</strong>.
 Now restart the computer to enable system restore again and allocate 15% of disk space. Refer the below mentioned links.</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-System-Restore-on-or-off" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Turn-System-Restore-on-or-off</span></a><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Delete-a-restore-point" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Delete-a-restore-point</span></a></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 3</span></strong><span>:</span><span>Since Volume Shadow Copy
 service is already enabled, you can also perform the following steps to&nbsp; <strong>
change the settings to increase the limit of the size of the Shadow Copy Snapshot.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Click START<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Type 'cmd' (without quotes)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. Right click the result in the start menu (there should only be one) and select 'Run as Administrator'</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d. Type 'vssadmin Resize ShadowStorage /For=C: /On=C: /Maxsize=10GB' (without quotes) and press enter.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You should then see command prompt reply with this statement:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>vssadmin 1.1 - Volume Shadow Copy Service administrative command-line tool</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>(C) Copyright 2001-2005 Microsoft Corp. Successfully resized the shadow copy storage association</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>e. Close the command prompt window. Restart your computer</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>f. Try and re-run the backup and see if it allows you to complete it</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Step 4:</span></strong><strong><span>You may also</span></strong><strong><span>
 boot in safe mode and try creating restore points.</span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>To boot to Safe Mode</span></strong><span>, you may refer the following link:</span></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Advanced-startup-options-including-safe-mode</span></a></span></p>

    <title>File share copy speed slow - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nullrefrenceexception  say:</h3>
<h2>            File share copy speed slow</h2>
                    Hi.<br />
I have a Windows Server hosting some shares.<br />
The server has an 10GBPS network card and hosts connected through a 1GBPS ports.<br />
<br />
When copying files down from server the copy speeds dont pass 10 mbytes per second.<br />
When copying files up to server the copy speeds passes 100 mbytes per second.<br />
<br />
I have used iperf to test network speeds and it easily shows that the network speeds are indeed 1gbps.<br />
I also tried non-smb reliant file transfer tools and they all was able to reach 1 gbps speeds with no problem.<br />
<br />
All other file copy tools using SMB was capped at same speed.<br />
<br />
So the problem is quite strange and i am not sure where i should look next to resolve this :(<br />
Any ideas anyone?

<h2>            Help me get level 81</h2>
                    
<p>Alright I'm level 78 and I'm attempting to get to level 81. I'm trying to do it the legit way and I only have a few more skills to level up.</p>
<p>The last skills I have to level up as well as their levels are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heavy Armor (level 91) </li><li>Light Armor (level 93) </li><li>Alchemy (level 66) </li><li>Destruction (level 90) </li><li>Restoration (level 85) </li></ul>
<p>Any insights on how to get these to level 100 quickest would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Heavy armor &amp; light armor: get hit a lot by lower level enemies</p>
<p>Alchemy: collect lots of plants that match effects and buy/find them in wild and create potions</p>
<p>Destruction: use it on anything and everything you can</p>
<p>Restoration: use it while leveling light/heavy armor</p>
<p>Why you even asked about this is beyond me TBH as its obvious. You took the time to level it to where it's at and seems like you just gave up.</p>

<p>The armor and Restoration ones can be done at the same time. Go find a Bear or Tiger and stand there and let him hit you. When you get down a little on your life, heal yourself up with restoration and continue. It takes a while, but it will get you there.
 The only 'legit' way though, is to just play the game and use those skills. Good luck to you.. I could never stick with one character that long, by level 50 I'm ready to start over.</p>

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Alteration - Transmute Matter. Go buy a bunch of Iron Ore and cast Transmute over and over again. Turn it all into Gold Ore, forge Gold Necklaces and sell them. Make money and up your Alteration Skill.<br />
<br />
Illusion - Muffle. The Muffle spell increases your sneak for a minute and a half, but you can just keep casting it over and over. When you're sneaking through a dungeon or something, just cast Muffle every few seconds and your Illusion will shoot through the
 roof. </p>

<p>Farengar (The Mage in Dragons Reach) will sell the Muffle spell, so will Drevis at the College of Winterhold. Muffle is an apprentice level spell and might not appear for sale until you have an illusion skill of 25 or higher.
<br />
<br />
It's a common spell, usually very easy to find.</p>

<p>Using my desktop, I can see my laptop but the only Users listed are ADMINI~1; Default; and Default.migrated. I don see the username of my laptop from my desktop pc in order to access files. Tried many things over the months. Maybe too many MS&nbsp; accounts or

            Hi Rac.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br /> Homegroup is removed in Version 1803.  
<br />
<br />What's working most for network detection issues caused by Version 1803 is here:  <a href="https://windowsunplugged.blog/2018/03/27/network-computers-no-longer-present-in-file-explorer-on-windows-10-1803/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://windowsunplugged.blog/2018/03/27/networ...</a>
<br />
<br />Go over these steps to make sure File Sharing is set up correctly:  <a href="https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sharing-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sha...</a>
<br />
<br />There are Changes to file sharing over a network in Windows 10:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4092694/windows-10-changes-to-file-sharing-over-a-network" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/409269...</a>

<br />
<br />This is the latest fix that's working for Version 1803 breaking networks.  Please try it and report back:   
<br />
<br />- shut all computer and network gear down then start again. 
<br />- Try browsing to some of the computers manually, press Windows key + R, type: \\computername, hit Enter
<br />- Press Windows key + R
<br />Type: services.msc
<br />Hit Enter
<br />
<br />1. Start the "Function Discovery Provider Host" and "Function Discovery Resource Publication" services, and then set them to Automatic (Delayed Start).
<br />2. When you open Explorer Network, enable network discovery when you are prompted.
<br />
<br />If not then start over and set it up again:  <a href="https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sharing-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://pureinfotech.com/setup-network-file-sha...</a>

<p>Thanks so much for your excellent suggestions and resources. I was able to perform file transfers using the "public" folders. I have previously avoided them because the "public" moniker scared me. I'm hoping "Public" means LAN onl. I'm still working on the
 direct conn ection via File explorer/Networks. Appears I had created a user name on my laptop that my other computer can't access. That username appears alongside the computer name which I can access, but that username doesn't appear in that file. I n sharing
 that user folder to "everyone" but resulting dialog said it can't be done. I've considered deleting that username, and hoping the username defaults to my computer name, but not sure what affect that would have on accessing my laptop account. Having possible
 multiple MS signin accounts makes ie.; 2 Outlooks (I don;t use Outlook), one Live, and one MS very confusing to me. I started on a VIC20, programmed on VB6(they killed that and all my programs), directories became folders, folders becam e libraries...now I'm
 lost. Is there still a real computer world or only "user friendly" social media? Excuse me, I digress.</p>
<p>Thanks again,&nbsp; I can only keep working on it, time permitting.</p>

<h2>            Disconnected from xBox Live Every Night</h2>
                    
<p><span>I've been a member of xBox Live Gold since April of 2011.&nbsp; From April of 2011 until November of 2012 I had no issues whatsoever.&nbsp; Then they started.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>What typically happens is that after a few minutes of watching Netflix I am prompted to upgrade to xBox Live Gold.&nbsp; Then it will not connect to xBox Live at all, until I power down the system
 and restart it.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
Sometimes I can run the test to connect to my router and then it will connect again to xBox Live.&nbsp; I believe there are no issues with my Internet connection.&nbsp; I use a wireless connection with Comcast and a Linksys E1000 router.<br />

</span></p>
<p><span>I have tried the following:<br />

<p><span>Nothing has changed with my connection or my router.&nbsp; I live alone so I know that nobody has tampered with anything.&nbsp; I am able to use a laptop and access the wireless connection with no
 problems, but my xBox 360 seems to be having issues.&nbsp; I can't tell if it's the connection, Netflix, xBox Live or the xBox 360 itself which is causing me issues.&nbsp; Since I can use a laptop and access my wireless connection without any issues I am hesitant to
 think that the connection is the problem.<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>If anyone can assist in any way please let me know as this is driving me insane.&nbsp; I like to watch Netflix before bed and lately all I can do is watch for five minutes, then spend five minutes
 restarting things and then I have another five minutes of watching before it stops.&nbsp; Thanks!</span></p>

<p>There may be an issue with you router settings, or service provider. Is it just your Xbox disconnecting or is it your whole internet? If it is the whole internet then contact your ISP. But if its just your Xbox then you should definitely visit the post&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-CA/xbox-live/connecting/network-ports-used-xbox-live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a>
 and check your router settings and see if that makes any difference. Another thing you could try is deleting your system cache (Go to system settings&gt; memory&gt; press"Y" on hard drive &gt; Clear system cache.) Hopefully this can solve your problem.</p>

<p>@Hobb1, Is it only with netflix that this starts to happen? Can you do all of the other things a gold member can do? If that's the case I'd say its just an odd issue with netflix and xbl. If someone else doesn't chime in I'd suggest calling xbox support
 and see what they suggest.</p>

<h2>            KB3211320 broke my wireless display adapter.</h2>
                    <p><span>After Windows Update installed KB3211320 on January 25th, I can no longer connect to my Microsoft Wireless Display Adapter. It worked fine before, but the day the update rolled out, the Connect button in Action Center no longer does anything when clicked.
 So, I used Settings&gt;Connected Devices to add the display adapter, but it will not connect. I have restarted the device and the PC I'm connecting with. I have removed the adapter and plugged it back in, with no success. Can anyone help me find a workaround
 for this?</span></p>

<strong>2017</strong>. Messed that date up.</p>
<p>2. Defender is turned OFF.</p>
<p>3. Windows Firewall is being managed by McAfee Personal Firewall. It shows in Control Panel that "Private Networks" are Connected and "Guest or public networks" are Not Connected.</p>
<p>4. It was originally installed on 1/25/2017, but I rolled back to a System Restore point to see if that cleared up the issue (which it did not). The update was reinstalled on 2/13/2017.</p>

<p>I said nothing about "uninstalling all McAfee components," I just asked you to pick #1 or #2. That being said...</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 broken after HDD died.OS on SSD</h2>
                    My HDD crashed my computer when opening an application. when i tried turning the computer back on it was sticking at the windows logo. after a few hours fighting with it trying to get it into safe mode unsuccessfully i went into by bios on my Mother board.
 when i was in the bios i noticed the HDD wasn't registering in the bios but my ssd was and was still set for the boot drive. i shut the computer off and went inside and unplugged the HDD completely. when i started the computer back up in a matter of seconds
 i was at the desk top. The problem now is when i try to open any application from microsoft already on the computer it refuses to open with the exception of Microsoft edge, settings, and file explorer. I tried to do a fresh install of windows 10 to see if
 the os was corrupted in some way and when i tried it error saying that there is no recovery point and i needed a windows 10 install disk to continue. i cannot find my windows 10 disk so i tried using the windows media creator but

<p>Hi Rozzic,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Removing the HDD on your computer can be considered as a significant change on your PC, since it is possible that most of the System Reserved Partition was saved on it. Note that this partition stores all the system files necessary for your Windows to run
 without any issues, without it, most of the functionality on your computer will not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Coming up to the idea of resetting or a fresh install of Windows was just the right thing and the most easiest step to resolve this after changing critical hardware on your PC. If you are receiving the error regarding the directory not being found, then
 it might be that your installation media is somehow corrupted. This can be resolved by recreating the installation media. Kindly visit the links provided below as it will guide you in resolving this whole concern:</p>

            Not helpful. I want to take a backup / image of my computer to disc not to a usb. I'm not interested in a Windows 10 iso on disc but my computer image. I used to be able to do this with my previous version of Windows 7 without purchasing additional software.
 Is there a way to get a blue ray writer appear as a usb drive?

<h2>            Cannot remove my old payment options or purchase anything on Xbox Marketplace</h2>
                    
<p>My xbox live account was set up for an auto renewal, but&nbsp;I was using a temporary card. Now, the new card is unable to be used due to an "outstanding balance" of 0 US dollars on the former. All I want to do is use a different debit card. The auto-renewal
 payment (for the temporary) did NOT go through, and in turn I did NOT recieve ANY&nbsp;extention to my previous Gold subscription. Such a hassle!</p>
<p>Why are they saying I owe them? Better yet why can't I remove it and use my new card?</p>

<p>You will need to contact phone support for your region if you are unable to solve the payment issue by visiting the billing site located
<strong><a href="http://billing.microsoft.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>. The account would need to be in good standing before being able to continue using it, and in order to do that you would need to add your new payment method on the billing site and pay whatever
 balance is saying is owed (if it's bugged and says $0 contact phone support).</p>

            Well, I found the settings, so that's ok.&nbsp; But the computer has an issue "waking" and I can't exit screen saver without hitting control alt delete. &nbsp; All this after the recent update.&nbsp; I see that others have similar issues like this after updating. But,
 I'll try the restore and see if it helps.

            <p>You can't "upgrade" Windows XP to anything other than Vista, which would be a silly thing to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Depending on your computer's hardware, it might be possible for you to install a newer version of Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Assuming that you were interested in Windows 7, your concerns are:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Can you find a legal version of Windows 7 for sale (retail sales ended on October 31, 2013)</li><li>Does your computer's hardware meet the minimum requirements for Windows 7 (1 GHz or faster processor, 1 GB RAM (32-bit) or 2 GB RAM (64-bit), 16 GB available hard disk space (32-bit) or 20 GB (64-bit), DirectX 9 graphics device with WDDM 1.0 or higher driver).&nbsp;
 Preferably, your computer should exceed those "minimums."</li><li>Are there Windows 7 drivers available for your computer's hardware</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Interestingly, Windows 10 has the same minimum hardware requirements, but it's less likely there will be Windows 10 drivers for your old hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To move from XP to a newer version of Windows you have to do a "clean install" (Microsoft calls this a "custom install").&nbsp; Because this involves booting from the installation medium and formatting your hard drive, you first have to back up all of your data
 to external media and gather everything necessary to install all of your application programs (product keys and installation CD/DVD or downloaded installer file).</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the end, you'll be better off if you purchase a new computer with Windows 10 pre-installed.&nbsp; You'll still have to transfer all of your data and install all of your applications (at least some of which will likely have to be upgraded because your old versions
 won't run on Windows 10).</p>

            <p>P-W,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your main concern is whether the investment in money, time, effort &amp; blood pressure is worth it.&nbsp; Any computer can fail and you might find that yours fails the day after you finish sorting it all out with a new OS - you&nbsp;might spend £100 and a week of your
 life but end up with nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you decide that your computer is&nbsp;going to last long&nbsp;enough for Windows 7 to be worthwhile then I suggest you also consider Windows 10.&nbsp; If you believe [and this really is no more than an act of faith / blind optimism] that your computer is going to last
 at least another year, say, then there is likely to be no logical reason why you would not believe that it could last another three or four&nbsp;years.&nbsp; A four year timescale extends beyond the Windows 7 end-of-support date so Windows 10 would then become your
 only option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 7 is currently being supported [security-related updates only] and will continue to be supported until 14 January 2020.&nbsp; Windows 10 will be supported indefinitely.&nbsp;However, future Windows 7 / 10 updates might rely on assumptions about hardware capabilities
 that yours fails to&nbsp;satisfy so you might end up with a partially updated system with ever widening vulnerabilities caused by your old hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Security is also of particular concern&nbsp;because older hardware &amp; software might not be as resistant to intrusion as modern versions even with all possible updates installed.&nbsp; Once your hardware &amp; software is out of support by its manufacturer then hackers
 might start to attack its vulnerabilities and even the best anti-malware protection might fail to protect you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You might also benefit from watching a new computer do some of your current tasks so you can see the improved performance you might get from buying a new computer instead of buying a new OS for your old one.&nbsp; Just for example,
</p>
<ul>
<li>Modern WiFi &amp; Ethernet cards operate at far higher speeds than were possible when XP was still current - you are likely to be astounded by the difference in speed.</li><li>Modern computers are also likely to astound you with their processing speed.&nbsp; I do not know what you use your computer for but I do some minor video editing and what takes my old computer a few minutes is done in a few seconds by a modern computer.&nbsp; This
 time comparison would also apply to other processor-intensive tasks.</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your best bet is to search your computer maker's support site &amp; user forums for reports by users who have installed Windows 7 / 10 on that computer model.&nbsp; In addition, search this forum for your computer model in case anyone has reported useful information
 about installing Windows 7 / 10 on it.&nbsp; You could also search the internet generally but that would take a long time and might get you nowhere.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If your software is also old then search the publisher's support site &amp; any user forums for reports from users who have used your version with Windows 7 / 10.&nbsp; Upgrading / replacing your software also adds to the money, time &amp;&nbsp;effort you need to invest.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Whilst some old computers can work with new OSs, you should not expect everything to be perfect.&nbsp; I have installed Windows 10 on an 11 year old Dell Inspiron 9300 and the only shortcomings are that the PowerCfg utility -BatteryReport command does not work
 and Task scheduler cannot wake the computer from sleep or from hibernation [even with the correct settings made].&nbsp; I can live with this but you might find shortcomings [after all your money, time &amp;&nbsp;effort] that render the computer useless for your purposes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Whatever other guidance you find, you will&nbsp;need to&nbsp;search for hardware drivers - see

Where to get hardware drivers</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;I succeeded in this endeavour but it took a&nbsp;fair amount&nbsp;of experimenting &amp; backtracking.</p>

<p>
</p><p>If you decide to go ahead then make sure you are able to get back to square one as a Windows XP computer might remain useful as a backup computer even though you cannot connect it to the internet or any other network / other computer.&nbsp;&nbsp;You can find software&nbsp;to
 create "system images" and they would be your best method of reversion.&nbsp; Do not proceed with anything until you have made a system image and learnt how to restore it.&nbsp; I did not know what system images were until I started using Windows 7 - they are a complete
 copy of your hard drive that can be restored to it to re-establish the computer in exactly the same state it was in at the moment the image was made.&nbsp; Modern OS include the ability to create system images but XP does not have this. &nbsp;Software for making system
 images does exist that can run on XP - I use a free** version of Acronis True Image on mine, Macrium Reflect [free] is another imaging utility, Paragon Backup &amp; Restore [free] is another and there are lots more.&nbsp; In general, you will need to make both a system
 image&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;the boot disk / rescue disk required by your imaging utility.&nbsp; [** <em>Free versions of Acronis TI are available for&nbsp;computers with Samsung-Seagate &amp; WD drives inside or just connected to them</em>].&nbsp;

    <title>After anniversary update, sleep acts like shutting down. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            After anniversary update, sleep acts like shutting down.</h2>
                    <p>My laptop is an ASUS N550JV.</p>
<p>Before the anniversary update, waking my laptop up from sleep was really fast. &nbsp;I opened the lid and within seconds the login screen was up, and typing in my password instantly brought me back to what I was working on. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now it's a different story. &nbsp;When my laptop wakes from sleep, it goes to the loading screen as if it's starting up, and after signing in it has to reload everything on the desktop including all background applications as if the computer had restarted. &nbsp;When
 it goes to sleep, all programs running are apparently force quit. &nbsp;When I re-open Chrome for example after putting it to sleep, it tells me Chrome didn't shut down properly and asks if I want to restore the pages. &nbsp;The total loading time after opening my laptop
 went from about 10 seconds before the update to about 3 minutes after.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I checked my power settings, and it is in fact set to sleep when my lid closes, and I got the same result when I tell the computer to sleep from the start menu. &nbsp;I also disabled hibernate, and I know it's not just shutting down because it turns off much
 quicker than a shut down and powers on when you press any key on the keyboard. &nbsp;I ran the power troubleshooter which did nothing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I googled around and haven't been able to find anything on this. &nbsp;Any ideas on how to fix it? &nbsp;I'm about ready to roll back the anniversary update at this point, as it's been nothing but trouble for me.</p>

            <p>Hey there, sorry if I'm too late.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After the Anniversary Update, my N550JV also behaved strangely. Windows Store crashed, random BSODs appeared after a few hours of usage, and a problem similar to yours: instead of sleeping, it kept shutting down completely.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It drove me nuts, so I had to reinstall a fresh version of Windows 10. It seemed all the above problems disappeared, except for that annoying shutdown instead of sleep issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Took me a few hours until I found this gem:&nbsp;http://www.windows10forums.com/threads/shutting-down-instead-of-sleeping.1254/page-2</p>
<p>
</p><p>It turned out the update process screwed up my laptop's BIOS, and if you reflashed it (with the latest version 208), everything will be back to normal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Good luck!</p>
