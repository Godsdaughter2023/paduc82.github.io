<h2>            Surface Laptop keeps disconnecting and reconnecting to surface dock</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have an issue where my surface laptop keeps disconnecting and reconnecting to my surface dock. I took the laptop to the Microsoft store 3 times already and have swapped out the dock 3 times. I thought the problem was finally fixed but after 2-3
 weeks of working correctly it is now doing the disconnection issue. I'm done going to the Microsoft store since they dont really know what to do. Maybe someone has a solution to this? I've updated the firmware on the dock, updated all my drivers, updated windows
 and ensured the power to the dock is constant and no weird shorts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is a link to a video of the problem happening:&nbsp;<a href="https://photos.app.goo.gl/c6EF7IiSUBaO73sB2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://photos.app.goo.gl/c6EF7IiSUBaO73sB2&nbsp;</a></p>

<h2>            Video editor not exporting</h2>
                    <p>Hiya,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've recently made a mini movie using video editor. The program was fine and easy to use, however now that I'm finished and trying to export the video I'm having issues. The total video is 05:40 and when I export, it only actually exports the first 02:24
 of the video.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If someone could please offer advice on how to fix this it would be great! I've sifted through hours of footage for this 5 minute video so I don't want to have to start again using another program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>

                    <span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Today I received the Windows 10 update notification on Windows Update, but every time I try to upgrade, after the installation process
 gets to 75%, the computer reboots like 10 times and then a message saying&nbsp;</span><em>Restoring your previous version of Windows</em><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">&nbsp;and then
 my computer reverts to Windows 8.1...</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">The most annoying thing of it all is that there is no error message to be found anywhere. When the computer boots to Windows 8.1, the Windows
 update history does not show any failed installations, it just asks to upgrade to Windows 10 again. There isn't anything in the Event Viewer either that could help me to troubleshoot the issue.</span><br />

    <title>Xbox Enforcement - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> frostthevii  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox Enforcement</h2>
                    <p>Alright. I'm going to be straight up here. I have been an Xbox Live member since WAY back in Halo 2 days. My emails and accounts have changed over time but I have been here and loyal since Halo:CE converted me from PlayStation One and I've never gone back.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>That might actually change today, even with how PS treated the Xbox head back in the day it never personally affected me to the extent that Xbox Enforcement has.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Over the years I have invested in Microsoft/Xbox products, accessories and an affiliated Developers and such. Back when I first got a job I invested in a Reach X360, Legendary Reach game and other things. When Nokia Lumia released the 1020 I got that straight
 up for the full $600 price with the camera-grip attachment, when Xbox One released I'd preordered the Day One Edition(I still have the controller), when the Elite Controller came out I got that(even though it broke about a month or so it due to the hairtrigger
 toggles jamming), when the Sunset Overdrive came out I got that because I really wanted the white console, when the Xbox One X Scorpio Edition went up I got that preordered and am currently on it, and I even have a Minecraft Xbox for my daughter to play with
 me on that she got for Christmas and her birthday. That in itself is over $2000. All the while paying $60/yr(sometimes monthly and quarterly purchases) for Xbox Live(when if you do the math is over $12,000 over time for the 17 years) and also getting every
 Legendary Halo I could since Reach. I have supported your business and enjoyed it for the most part. Up until Enforcement affected me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When Enforcement was brought up towards the beginning of X1 I knew this was going to be a problem. I just didn't expect it to be this big.<br />
<br />
Let me tell you, I've gamed with Xbox since I was 9. I hated PS due to what they did with the Xbox One reveal and supposed specs. It was uncalled for and I haven't purchased a Sony product since then due to that and have preferred Xbox(which up until a couple
 years ago when I first got enforced happened I was happy). I HAVE NEVER asked for a system like this to be implemented and in all honesty I have no choice in the matter because you HAVE TO accept terms and agreements to use an awesome product. A product I
 wouldn't want to stop using since I'm an avid gamer. I have no choice on what parts I agree with or not in the T&amp;Cs. It's metaphorically pushed down your throat without a choice or you can stop playing on the multiple-hundred $ devices I bought, playing with
 the online capabilities of the hundreds of games I've bought over time(I have 420+ Xbox live games on my console) and playing with the friends I have made over the almost 2 decades of gaming I have done. It is a very flawed Agreement that can me manipulated
 by trolls. Which happened to me yesterday. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, Trolls wouldn't be a problem if a huge notification didn't pop up telling me someone messaged me at the bottom of the screen(add a setting about non-friend notifications maybe? Add the ability to turn on and off?). I can't turn off my main notifications
 because I still want to see from friends that they're online and if they message me. I want to see that. But in turn I see randoms messaging me(especially after sweaty matches in Destiny 2 Competitive). Now my rule personally is don't go out seeking to message
 people. You can report in game if it's that bad or block so I don't get matched up with them again. But if they messaged first then you have free reign to put them in their place. It's been this way since the 360 Blades Homescreen for me and I've been ok with
 the smack given in return. You learn sarcasm, quick wit and many other things that can come on handy in adulthood life. I've never asked a business to impede my Freedom of Speech(especially when in defense of myself) or self-expression or honestly anyone else's
 FoS either. I don't mind the crap coming to me. Like I said I return it. This has happened for around ~10 years at least. I know, I know: "they're a business and they can do whatever they like. They're not the government so FoS isn't applied". Sorry but this
 business was made by consumers like me and others like me. I pay for services(Xbox Live) and also for the Hardware to run these services because I have been a huge fan of Microsoft products and a big gamer.<br />
<br />
Enforcement shouldn't affect your ability to talk and message with friends. If that solution right there were to be implemented I would stop right now and be ok with Enforcement. But yesterday a kid messaged me talking smack. I shouldn't have to block and mute
 someone not to get in trouble. Especially when the alternative is just typing a few words and sending to reply. Words are not sticks and stones. If people are soft enough on Xbox that don't want to risk harassment there's settings to not have online communications
 at all or if so you can tweak your kids settings. But I'm 26. I have grown up with messaging jerks. I'm the kind of person to get the last word or try and 1v1 to prove a point if need be in game. But that's it. This is my venting. This is my outside of work
 because my town has little to nothing to do that's worth it and let alone I game with my friends in Italy, across the state and country and so on. Let alone I run a little personal clan on Destiny 2. This hampers me. Let alone right now I'm going through a
 custody battle and I need my friends more than ever to talk to but can't with this Enforcement. An Enforcement that for some reason even implemented at a tech company somehow the team making those decisions can't be contacted directly, has to wait 24-hours
 JUST TO SUBMIT A CASE, not talk with anyone about context which would be 1000x better than sending words into the void in HOPES of it being reversed. AND LET ALONE I'M enforced for 14 days man. The Dreaming City Full Curse Cycle is this week. I NEED communication
 in Destiny 2(my primary game). But I can't fix this, and Microsoft can seem to give a crap less as to how loyal or long I've been with the company. It's not right. If I could have picked what bits in the T&amp;Cs for Xbox Live I wouldn't ever allow for the loss
 of my freedoms to say what I need. It's like saying even though I pay for texting and calls and data that they can take away my texts due to what I say. Like I said, I retaliate. I don't go out looking for trouble. But I shouldn't have to worry on getting
 Enforced for someone else initially messaging me. And if I do get reported there really needs to be a human component that gets ahold of you and asks some questions. It'd be much better than just enforcing and then telling me that you can't just flip the switch
 back as easily as you initiated it until 24hours later(and that's not even considering over 24 hours when they have to investigate it) even though I was reprimanded for replying and nothing more(plus it was a voice message because I didn't have enough time
 to message before the next match.) Like I said I shouldn't have to take the initiative in stopping trolls. I reply to jerks by talking smack right back. That's how most gamers are. With this system all you're doing is building pent up rage. And frustrating
 those older gamers who have been here longer than 2013 when this system was implemented(I've been since 2002).<br />
<br />
Can there be some form of Insider Preview questionnaire or just a mass email survey sent out asking what changes we want with this? Because I'm tired of losing the ability to talk with friends just out of the blue because some troll is salty or return mail
 to someone. I mean what happened to Online Interactions may vary, or ratings meaning anything? I'm 26, I shouldn't be treated like a 5 year old and having my Freedoms taken away by a business I support and have supported for near 2 decades. And it's honestly
 going to end soon if this Enforcement policy stays in place or at least stays the same with no human factor to it. I wouldn't mind being enforced if it were just but in this case it isn't and in no case where replying to a troll does this happen is that ever
 going to be just.</p>

            The code of conduct and enforcement team have been around since Live started, not just when the One came along. Playstation also has similar rules. The best thing to do if you encounter a troll is to block them and report them instead of responding. If
 you respond in a way that violates the code of conduct, you can be punished.&nbsp;

            This Enforcement hasn't existed until 2013. This is fact. I have been here since 2002. I can't pick and choose T&amp;C, I just HAVE to accept them to play a service I've invested well over a decade into and continually to invest in annually.

            I know where to go, but there needs to be a better HUMAN component to it that will actually contact and talk with you on it. Just like I had always had problems with texting my ex due to how bad trying to type conversations quickly is, I can explain things
 better when talking to a person. This is a fix I would like if possible. Especially in instances like this where I was playing Comp earlier, took a small break and was going to hop back on but I got enforced and you NEED voice chat to have a chance of winning.
 And that can't be sorted until 24-hours after and it STILL has to go through a process making it LONGER than 24 hours until if you get wrongly enforced to sort out and be able to talk with your friends again.

            I may not have been here since 2002, but the enforcement team definitely existed well before 2013. They used to use the forums instead of their current website for people to appeal their bans (there's actually an article about it from 2011&nbsp;<a href="https://venturebeat.com/community/2011/11/11/this-banning-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://venturebeat.com/community/2011/11/11/this-banning-season/</a>)

<p>I would recommend reviewing the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/Legal/codeofconduct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Code of Conduct, which I've linked.</a>&nbsp; It's not new; it's changed a bit as the industry, service, and internet has evolved. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Even though you're communicating with your friends in some instances, others might be able to hear you, and they come from a number of cultures and backgrounds, and might not have the same sensibilities as you do, thus we have the Code of Conduct that outline
 the interactions of what is allowed and not on the service that Microsoft provides.&nbsp; They provide the service, and they set the rules.&nbsp; They are not limiting your freedoms, but defining rules and consequences for actions on their service.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would ask that you also take a look at the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/developers/gaming-for-everyone/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Gaming For Everyone initiative that Microsoft has. </a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are so many ways to express yourself that don't violate the Code of Conduct and thus don't incur the consequences that come along with the Enforcement Team, and understand that there is a place for everyone to have fun in Xbox Live, but it will take
 work from everyone to continue to make it a better place, which I hope you will help us do in the future.</p>

            And the solution shouldn't be "don't reply" and go out of your way to block and mute. Who know maybe later we reconcile and become Xbox Live friends? I'll never have a second chance at knowing with that process. I'd prefer the ability to turn off message
 notifications from non-friends or something in settings. I think the notification is one of the biggest things bothering me along with the wrongful enforcing. T&amp;Cs have existed since the beginning of Xbox but the modified and implemented Enforcement when Xbox
 One came out.

<p>Very much so. I don't think there is a history of the Enforcement Team written, but I remember Stephen Toulouse (rest in peace), became the Director of Xbox Live Policy and Enforcement back in 2007, so it existed before that.</p>

<h2>            Why activate Windows&#63;</h2>
                    I had installed Windows 8 on my netbook a week ago. Now it gives me activation message on Desktop...(Right-down side). But my Windows is already activated...The message says "Go to PC settings to activate Windows" but in PC setting there is no option for
 Activation...(Meaning it is already activated).&nbsp; <br />

Somebody please diagnose the problem<br />

<h2>            How to share files&#47;folders across two WIndows 10 computers.</h2>
                    <p>Hi all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have what I believe should be a pretty simple problem that I've had no trouble with in the past, but now is frustrating.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a desktop and laptop, both running Windows 10. I'm not trying to set up any fancy domains or dual-boot servers.&nbsp; Two ordinary run of the mill computers, same OS version, with only Microsoft account login.&nbsp; Simple (or so I thought).I want to share
 folders across between the computers. I want to make sure only those logged on to the network can access it. What do I mean by network? In the past I've been able to do it very easily through the Wifi router, but now even though I believe I have the sharing
 set up (What exactly is "share with EVERYONE" anyway?) but I can't even ping the other computer, not even with the IP address.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So how can I get two Win10 computers on the same wi-fi network to talk to each other in the simplest way possible?&nbsp; Thanks!</p>

            Hello,<br />
<br />
If both computers are connected to the same network, you can create a HomeGroup so that you can easily share files and printers as well. Also in a HomeGroup, you can select which folders will be shared. For us to assist you, we suggest that you visit this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17145/windows-homegroup-from-start-to-finish" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
article</a>. From there, you'll see a guide on how to set up a HomeGroup from start to finish.<br />
<br />
Let us know how it goes and if you need further assistance, feel free to post back.

            already said I was notified via pop up stating the adobe photoshop elements 7 program was no longer being supported.&nbsp; Please uninstall and reinstall the program or contact _ _ _ (didn't get the name of contact before pop up was lost.)&nbsp; The another popup
 under that one stated to go to play memories website to download the program.&nbsp; The adobe photoshop program was installed via a cd that has been installed on this same laptop for several years now.&nbsp; Should be enough info to find an answer.

            <p>Keeping a program up to date is the responsibility of the developer of that software,
<em>not</em> MS.</p>
<p>This is nothing new to Win10 and applies to all software and hardware drivers.</p>
<p>- You would do better to&nbsp;&nbsp;as ThofikhAhamad has suggested and&nbsp; contact Adobe support.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- It is curious that you are directed to use Play Memories. I wonder, does Sony now own Adobe ?</p>
<p>Maybe they have some sort of arrangement for Sony to use their code ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Feel free to change to Apple Mac. MS doesn't care</p>
<p>This is a community forum. The people in power don't hear you, and wouldn't listen if they did,</p>
<p>and in a similar situation neither would Apple.</p>
<p>So don't expect eternal support for software on their system either. </p>
<p>
</p><p>- Option 2. If there is nothing in Win10 that you <em>need</em>, go back to Win7. You won't miss Win10,</p>
<p>and by the end of Win7 support in 2020 you may be ready for a change ? </p>
<p>

<p>Hey,</p>
<p>I fixed the problem I was having with this error msg. If anyone else is having the same problems, I would try creating a new user account and see if the download works on the new account because I had tried EVERYTHING and nothing worked until i created a
 new account and now my problem is fixed. I guess somehow my user account got corrupted, which i didn't expect considering my PC is only a month old but it was.</p>
<p>Hope this&nbsp;helps :)</p>

    <title>How do I undo plugging in a device and having a Windows-driver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> robtmathias  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I undo plugging in a device and having a Windows-driver installed before it&#39;s real driver was installed&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>My brother plugged in our Brother MFC-465CN printer before installing it's proper driver. My dad started printing with no problem. Then he calls me and tells me he needs to scan. Well in order to scan he needs to have the proper driver and suite installed.
 So I logged in from where I live using Remote Desktop Connection and installed the driver/suite for him. But when it got to the end of the installation it told me to plug in the printer through usb and turn it on. It was already plugged in and turned on. I
 know that it's not recognizing the printer because Vista has already installed a different driver for it. I've been through this before with a different kind of device and I ended up having to locate the actual driver file inside of the /Windows/System32/Driver/
 folder and manually delete it. (Q#1)Is this the correct course of action for the printer? And if it is..(Q#2)then how do I know quickly which file is the driver that windows installed for it when it was pre-emptively plugged in by mistake? I don't know how
 to do this expediently, so with the device I did this with before, I knew the day and time that it had been installed on and last used were the same day as a few hours before I went in to fix it, so I sorted the drivers by dates, and right clicked on properties
 and read the details looking for the company name, and by luck it was a samsung device so the driver's filename started with "s" and in the properties-&gt;details&nbsp;it&nbsp;even said&nbsp;"Samsung device driver".&nbsp;In the end I was able to locate and remove the&nbsp;bad driver
 that Windows had installed upon the device being plugged in before the drivers were installed from the device's disk,&nbsp;so that ActiveSync would recognize the phone after installing the real driver disk.&nbsp;(Q#3)But how would I go about such a task if&nbsp;the driver
 isn't locatable by sorting by date in the Windows explorer shell, and the driver's&nbsp;file name didn't start with the name of the company? Is there a log somewhere of the filenames and dates and times installed of all the drivers windows installs? Thanks in advance
 for you guys and engineers at MS who may be able to help, it is such a pain to have someone plug in a device before running the install cd, then windows installs the device with a wrong driver, so that when the device's Application/Suite is run, it doesn't
 even recognize that the device is plugged in, even after installing the driver disk, because Windows is associating the device with the driver that Windows installed when it was plugged in, and doesn't see it associated with/running on it's real driver. And
 as for my printer, the installation program&nbsp;still isn't recognizing that it's plugged in, even though it is.</p>

            Also, I found that usbccgp.sys and usbprint.sys are both printer drivers, both are in windows/system32/drivers and both are fixed so that I cannot delete them. Would deleting them give me a chance at fixing my problem ? With usbccgp.sys only TrustedInstaller
 and System have permission to delete it, with usbprint.sys it's the same story. I read that usbccgp.sys is a generic printer driver. Also, I havent looked up the rest of the drivers that start with usb, could one of the other ones, maybe one that I am able
 to delete be the culprit?

            <p>Hi Pat,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome to Microsoft community forums. I would appreciate if you could answer the following questions:
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the make and model of the computer?</li><li>Does printer work fine?</li><li>Do you get any error message?</li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the 4-In-1 printer is able to print I suspect it is an issue with the scanning software. This is because printing and scanning needs individual software to work properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fix this problem, use the following methods in the order in which they are listed. After each method, check if problem is fixed. If the problem is not fixed, try the next method.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong> I would suggest you to update your printer and scanner driver from manufacturer website. Refer this link.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Download and install drivers</strong></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers</a></strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong> If you have already tried installing the drivers from the above link and did not work, then follow these steps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>You may first try uninstalling the already installed printer drivers using the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>[How to uninstall the preinstalled printer driver]</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>(1)In Devices and Printers, right-click the icon of the applicable model, then select Remove device.<br />
(2)Open Print server properties, select the Drivers tab. <br />
(3) Select the applicable model, then click Remove.<br />
(4)In the Remove Driver and Package window, click Remove driver and driver package.</p>
<p>(5) Now, try installing the drivers and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this helps. If you need further assistance with Windows, let us know and will be glad to help.

<h2>            Windows 10 - Intel HD 4600 &#43; GTX 980m video freezing and TDR</h2>
                    <p>Hi All.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Fresh install on the laptop and upgraded both intel and NVidia drivers. Some videos on Facebook when full screen cause the PC to freeze, then blue screen. Also, when I full screen Xbox Video movies from the TV &amp; Movie app, I get the same error. It can rotate
 through a couple of blue screen errors. Sometimes it just freezes the screen and you cannot do anything (CTRL+alt+Del, mouse, alt+tab, etc...).&nbsp;I do *not* have this issue any of my desktops, though they are all running only ATI cards.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know these new laptops use the Intel HD for low power video and move over to NVidia 980 for the high powered stuff. This works flawlessly in all the games I have been playing but seems to have issues with videos being full screen (not all of them but just
 a few and it's consistently the same vids).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone else having this issue?</p>
<p>Intel HD 4600 driver: 10.18.15.4248</p>
<p>NVidia GTX 980m driver: 10.18.13.5582</p>
<p>Windows 10 Pro x64</p>

            Bit of background for me. I'm an 20 year experience IT guy with a MCSE certification. I've tried all the basics. I've also seen other users on the NVidia forums report similar problems. I've tried installing newer drivers, old drivers, Windows only drivers,
 factory drivers, etc... I can't seem to fix this with driver installs. Everything works flawless except occasionally full screening video... not idea why and I can't seem to figure it out. This does not occur with my AMD machine, so I am hoping a new intel
 or NVidia driver that comes out resolves this.

            I believe I found a work around. I went into the NVidia control panel, then Manage 3D settings, and under the Global Settings, I set the preferred graphics card to NVidia instead of "Auto-Select". So far today, I have not had any freezes, blue screens,
 or crashes. I'll keep testing to verify, but at least something for others to try if they run into this issue.

            <p>Auto-select changed seem to work, but I experienced my monitor randomly shutting off. I had to hard reset my PC... when it came back online, I checked event viewer, and no errors except an unexpected shutdown. I also noticed I could no longer change my brightness....
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, found that my monitor in device manager was disabled. I did another fresh driver install to see if it would fix the issue, and it did not. After the latest Intel drivers were installed, I just manual enabled the monitor. This resolved my issue with
 brightness. I haven't had my PC freeze up since, but still testing. I plugged in my external monitor, and it disabled the display... I had to re-enable the display which I found weird.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still some bugs here. Clearly something is up. </p>

<h2>            Epson Stylus Photo R340 does not work in Windows 7 64 bit edition.</h2>
                    
<p>When I try to print a document, there is no communication between the computer and the printer. When I look in the "See what's printing" it says that the printer is offline, and other times there is no document to print even after I try to send one to the
 printer. I installed the latest driver from the Epson site and that did not help.</p>
<p>Also, when I first got Windows 7 and plugged in the printer, I was able to print some documents, but after printing a page or two, it would stop responding without any error message, and when trying to print graphics with colors, it would only print part
 of the image, as if it was too much to handle. There were times when I had to restart the computer just to print another page.</p>
<p>Now it is worse and do not know how to get the printer back online. I just bought the computer, and the printer is only about three years old. I am extremely frustrated since I have three new technologies (the computer, the printer, and Windows 7 64 bit)
 and they are not getting along.</p>
<p>If you have a solution it would be very much appreciated. Thank you.</p>

<p><span>Okay, I deleted all printer drivers in the system, including the ones which were previously installed as a default in Windows 7 Home Premium 64 bit edition, just to make sure. To be able to do
 it, I had no choice but to remove all printers listed&nbsp;as devices, including&nbsp;one&nbsp;which was already installed in Windows. Without this action, I was not able to remove drivers currently occupied by them.</span></p>
<p><span>I installed the latest driver from the Epson website, plugged in the printer and turned it on when asked for during the installation process as instructed by you. The new&nbsp;printer device and its
 new drivers were successfully installed.</span></p>
<p><span>Please note that the very first time I tried to print a document, it did not print at all. I tried a second time and it printed the document successfully. Having said that, the printer setup is
 still on trial, but it is working for now. If I have any further problems with it I will let you know. Right now I want to thank you for your time and dedication to help me in this matter.</span></p>

<h3> zethp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Install updates on reboot...not on shutdown.</h2>
                    <p>Hi.<br />
I have a question that i thought Microsoft would have thought about and implemented years ago.<br />
When there is updates for windows that needs to be installed, why do Microsoft only have the option to install these on a shut down?<br />
If there is any updates you get 2 options.<br />
1. Shut down the computer and install updates.<br />
2. Install the updates and hope that the update doesnt require you to reboot.<br />
What i want is this.<br />
1. The option to install updates when i reboot my PC because then i can install the updates if i go away for a while and the computer are updated, rebooted and ready to be used again when i get back...even if the update doesn't require a reboot this feature
 would appreciated. Murphys law applyes here...if you don't have the time to reboot after installing updates a reboot is required....if you do have time a reboot isn't required. And even if a reboot isn't required there is no harm done if i choose to reboot
 and install updates.<br />
2. The option NOT to install updates when i want to shut down my PC. Sometimes i might just want to shut down the computer without having to install the update because i'm in a hurry...i don't want to have to wait for the updates to install before i can take
 my computer with me.<br />
I don't know if i make any sence...my english isn't the best.<br />
I hope that you can figure out what i mean =)<br />
And i REALLY hope that someone else than me have wished for&nbsp;the same option.<br />

<h2>            Clear &#39;Read-Only&#39; Property</h2>
                    <p>I have a number of directories on my C: drive (e.g.: C:\Bmate) that I use as scratch pads and for temporary data.&nbsp; I want to have FULL CONTROL for all files and subdirectories.&nbsp; Until a few days ago, I cleared the "Read only" check box&nbsp; in the File Explorer
 -&gt; Properties pop-up.&nbsp; I can still clear it but it is immediately reset to Read Only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What happened and how can I fix this??</p>

            Hey Bob.
<br />
<br />Go to C Drive.
<br />Right-click your user name in Users folder, then click Properties.
<br />Go to Security tab.
<br />Click Advanced, then click Continue.
<br />Click Enable Inheritance.
<br />
<br />Does this fix the issue? 
<br />
<br />
<br />If not, have a look at the answer here for another solution: It is for vista but should be applicable to win 10 as well:

</p><p>The gray square is <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><em><strong>NOT A STATUS INDICATOR</strong></em></span>. That checkbox only serves to toggle the read-only attribute on all the files in the folder. As others have noted, Permissions are what matter.
 You will see the gray square in every folder's Properties dialog regardless of permissions.</p>

<h2>            Account hacked moved to Russia. Need to get it back.</h2>
                    
<p>So, my account was hacked and moved to Russia. I got it back but it's still in Russia. Phone support says they cannot move the account back to US and now my xbox is still in Russian. This is completely unacceptable. If I cannot get my account back to where
 i can even read it, then *** MS I'm going to the PS3. been an Xbox Live member since the original Xbox. How can something like this happen? A One-click solution to steal the account, and n way to possibly get it back? The only option given to me was to create
 a new account, losing the years of achievements and save-games I've built up.</p>

<p>Has anyone found a way to get MS to get off their lazy asses and get their account back to their region?</p>

<p>Hey there! I'm sorry for the frustration. I'm not aware of any way to manually change the region of an account. I would recommend calling phone support for this info, but it sounds like you already talked to them. If there are any other options here, phone
 support will be the one to help you out. Sorry for the hassle here. </p>

<p>The same thing happened to me they told me i'm out of luck. &nbsp;I have been a Live subscriber since the first month it was available. &nbsp;It is absolutely ridiculous that they can not do anything about this. &nbsp;All we can do now is use the power of the internet
 and have our voice heard. &nbsp;I am posting these stories everywhere I can and contacting gaming websites to bring this practice to light. &nbsp;Here is my original post</p>

<p>Yeah, you aren't getting your account back. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Everything I've read from people that had a migration in addition to the hack and theft, aren't getting their accounts back. &nbsp;</p>
<p>What do they even do? &nbsp;Do they transfer the licenses to all your DLC, and arcade/retail downloads, to the new account? &nbsp;Or are you just out of luck there as well. &nbsp;</p>

<p>PS3 is a fine console with some great titles. Xbox is another fine console with some great titles. I play online on both and the 360 is far better in this arena. The migration of an account to another region can only be done every year. If someone got your
 WLID info and did this you will have to wait it out. In order for Microsoft to allow someone to migrate an account they have to make sure it follows american market place laws and Russian market place laws. These types of UA's are the most destructive to a
 persons account and i think its an option that should be removed from us and something that we have to request from phone support after passing all security short of a urine sample.</p>

<p>Happened to me today also. So I will have Visa take a pop-shot at Microsoft since we are paying for a service we cannot actually use. Keep in mind I said service. We do not own the virtual property but we do have the rights to the Xbox service.</p>
