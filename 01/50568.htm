            <p>I'm afraid not all usb to serial (or parrallel) adapters are equal. Some function others do not.</p>
<p>I have no recommendation (as I dont need to use such)</p>
<p>Its relatively straight forward with a desktop PC, you just buy the relevent pci card.</p>
<p>You would need to search using your favorite search engine for user recommendeations (or seek advice from a decent PC shop)&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try to create another administrator profile on your computer and log into Windows with this one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then&nbsp;start regedit.exe and expand this key: <strong>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\ProfileList</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>There, you'll find different keys related to User profiles on your computer (like "S-1-5-21-2176283522-2834935782-3221912834-1258").</p>
<p>Check if one key is not renamed as "S-1-5-21-2176283522-2834935782-3221912834-1258<strong>.bak</strong>"</p>
<p>
</p><p>If yes, remove the .bak from the key then try to log on again with the user that was creating the TEMP profile.</p>

<p><span>After the delegate is added, the delegator must sign out and then sign in back in to Skype for Business client. If the issue persists, I’d like to confirm the following information:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>A screenshot of the error message or symptom when trying to create a Skype for Business meeting on behalf of others.</span></li><li><span>Since you have switched to Office 365 Enterprise E5, I suggest you re-configure the account in Outlook client. Make sure the account is set as the default in Skype for Business.</span></li><li><span>Hold down the CTRL key while you right-click the Skype for Business icon on the task bar, and then select&nbsp;<strong>Configuration Information</strong>. Provide a screenshot of the Configuration Information.<br />

<p>Today I bought Halo Reach from the xbox live website because it wouldnt let me buy anything from the Marketplace. When I go to download it, it says the game isnt able to download. I have plenty of memory and I am connected to live. I spent alot of money
 on the game, &nbsp;but im not able to play it and I cant ge a refund. What do I do because that would be $60 wasted?</p>

<h2>            Skype Can&#39;t connect</h2>
                    In the beginning when Skype was working, it used to show me the loading icon instead of the sold green icon for Available or Red icon for Busy,it also showed me that the Skype home wasn't available,&nbsp;but still I could chat with friends and do all the stuff
 normally!<br />
But I got sick of the loading icon so I decided to uninstall Skype and re install, thats when the problem occurred, I did uninstall the program and reinstall it but whenever I enter my username and password it keeps loading for a while then shows an error &nbsp;saying
 &nbsp;" Skype can't connect"!<br />
I've tried ever solution mentioned in all different websites but it didn't work<br />
any help from the supporting team ?!

Unzip the file first.&nbsp; Adobe Reader is for PDFs, not ZIP files.<br />

Download and install 7-Zip.<br />

<h2>            Xbox live games app crashes in Windows 8.</h2>
                    Error Log: XboxLive GAmes crashes after opening every times. Any solution?
<div>
<div>I've witnessed that XboxLive Games App went crashing in at least 2 seconds after opening.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
</div>
Let you know that Problem found is "Display adapter might be out-of-date" is false negative because there is WDDM 1.1 on Intel Series 4 Family Express including GMA 4500MHD, which is updated to March 2012 on my laptop., In fact, It's still "up to date", not
 outdated. &nbsp; I prove that it works fine. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Unfortunately, I'm very frustrated to fix XboxLive App after repeatedly crashing few sec for no reasons.&nbsp;</div>

            <p><span>Hi ChrisNeufeld,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting your query in the Microsoft Community. Welcome to our Microsoft Family.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;You have an issue with the Xbox live apps crashing on Windows 8</span><span>. It can be
 difficult when something that is important to you does not work as expected. It is pretty simple and we are here to help you fix the issue. We will work as a team and get this sorted out.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please answer the questions-</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Is this issue limited to the Xbox live game app?</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Have you made any other changes on the computer prior to the issue?</span></p>
<p><span>I would like more information regarding the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Method -</span></p>
<p><span>Since you have tried almost all the troubleshooting steps, I would have you perform a “Refresh” of the Operating System.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, tap
<b>Settings</b>, and then tap <b>Change PC settings</b>.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>(If you're using a mouse, point to the
<b>upper-right corner of the screen</b>, move the mouse pointer down, click
<b>Settings</b>, and then click <b>Change PC </b>settings.)
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Under
<b>PC settings</b> tap or click <b>General</b>.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Under
<b>Refresh</b> <b>your PC</b> without affecting your files, tap or click get started.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Follow the instructions on the screen.</span></p>
<p><span>Note:
<span>Make sure you back up the data on the computer before proceeding further.</span></span></p>
<p><span>Refreshing the Operating System will reinstall all the apps downloaded from the Windows Store. But, the apps installed
 from other sites will be removed permanently. Proceed at your risk.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be happy to help. We, at Microsoft strive towards excellence.</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            Hi Nirmal S, thanks for reply. &nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>You know, I decided not to reset or refresh Windows 8 with 64 bit in second time but I installed Win8 with 32 bit on Virtual Machine for playing games only :) &nbsp; Virtual Machine is good option for playing app games and launching LiveXbox without app issues
 :)&nbsp;
<div><br />
<div>If I refresh Windows 8 so I would waste my times that I have to&nbsp;re-install&nbsp;Win32 applications :P&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>We are waiting that Microsoft Team should&nbsp;immediately&nbsp;develop App Repair Tool for fixing apps to prevent repeatedly crashing. &nbsp;Apps Troubleshooting Program Is not helpful due to false negatives such as out-of-dating updates of graphic drivers.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>MY suggestion for Microsoft Windows DEvelopment Team: App Repair Tool should fix issues and correct errors of loading apps to prevent crashing:</div>
<div><br />
<div>-Windows.UI.xaml&nbsp;</div>
<div>-ISsues sync of Store Licensing </div>
<div>-Virtual Studio scripts&nbsp;on hidden folder WindowsApps</div>
<div>-Avoid false negatives of out-of-dating graphic driver with at least 128mb </div>
<div>-Disable some Startup 3rd-party Programs avoid conflicts &nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>App Repair Tool brings ULTIMATE SOLUTION than many unnecessary methods such as refreshing, CFC Scan, etc. &nbsp; &nbsp; For Microsoft Windows DEvelopment Team, can you develop Repair Tool please? I'm one of many customers about concerning app crashing if we did
 try unnecessary methods.&nbsp;</div>
<div><br />
<div>Thanks&nbsp;</div>

            Hello friend! I'm experiencing the same problem since Windows 8 came out. I enjoy so much using Xbox Live service to play online games, and I use the Xbox Games App to get along with friends and see my gamerscore. Since I installed the application I only
 had frustration! I can't open it anymore because it crashes the system. I already tried to refresh the system, use "wsreset" command and then reinstall the application, virtualizations for testing purpose, "SFC" command and it's variations... Nothing seems
 to solve the issue! I agree with you about Microsoft creating something to repair it.
<div>All my Metro (New Interface) applications works fine, however I just use Xbox Games App: The buggy one.</div>
<div>Microsoft, please, solve this because I'm about to quit your services for good.</div>

<p>Microsoft is obviously NOT happy to help.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have the same issue.&nbsp;3 day old&nbsp;ASUS Zenbook. Almost nothing installed. Xbox Mahjong, Solitaire and Minesweeper all crash immediately after startup while logging into Xbox live. Whilst Xbox Tilestap logs into Xbox live with no problem.&nbsp; I can also log into
 my Xbox live account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The three games that crash normally crash as they start up. Mostly as they start to log into Xbox Live. Since the inlogging process seems to run in parallel to drawing the screen you do sometimes get some parts of the screen drawn.&nbsp; If there is no connection
 you might get into the game but after choosing a puzzle it crashes while loading it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I say Microsoft is NOT happy to help because I have been searching for the solution and there are&nbsp;a lot of People asking about this and NO attempt to actually fix it. The only advice people are given in Xbox forums and Windows forums is to RESET your device.&nbsp;
 This is NOT help, it is NOT trouble shooting and it is NOT fixing. It is a cop out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For every person who writes to&nbsp;Microsoft or Xbox&nbsp;with this problem there are large numbers who&nbsp;just delete the apps and move on. The behaviour of these apps along with the seemingly total disregard for the frustration and timewasting for Microsofts customer
 base is shocking.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I had the exact same problem with crashes during login. What I discovered was that there was an update to the Xbox terms of service and the app crashed immediately after login while trying to display that.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I fixed it by going to the Xbox site using a web browser, and accepting the TOS from there. After that, everything started working correctly again.</p>

<h2>            Is Windows 7 compatible with Intel Step Speed&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have noted that when I turn on my Intel Step Speed in my bios, windows 7 does not run. I presume windows 7 is not compatible w/ Intel Step Speed? How do I make it work with Windows 7?</p>
<p>Also my bios have options to turn on Virtual Machine. Is there any point of turning them on?</p>
<p>thankx.</p>

<p><strong>3 Q:</strong> What operating system supports SpeedStep™ technology?</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows ME, Windows NT4, Windows 2000 and Windows XP all support it. With the exception of Windows XP, you will need to load a driver in order to use SpeedStep.</p>
<p>To determine if the driver is loaded, first look in the notification area in Windows taskbar. You should see icon of a flag. If not, go into the power applet of the Control Panel and see if there is a tab for Intel SpeedStep technology. If the icons of the
 flag do not show in either place, the driver is not running and it is probably not loaded.<strong>Note:</strong> Since Windows XP has the Intel SpeedStep technology driver built into Windows, you will not see an icon on the taskbar and you will not see a tab
 for Intel SpeedStep technology using the power applet located in the Control Panel.</p>

<p><span>Hello,</span></p>
<p><span>You should be able to adjust the CPU speed by changing the Processor Power Management setting in the active Power Plan.</span></p>
<p><span>Go to Start, type<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Power Options</strong> in the search box and open the power options, then click Change
 Plan Settings, Change Advanced Power Settings, locate the Processor Power Management item and change the setting.</span></p>
<p><span>If the setting is not available you can try updating the system or power drivers from the manufacturer.</span></p>
<p><span>If that still doesn’t work then the feature is not available.</span></p>
<p><span>As for the Virtual Machine setting, you can use it to run programs such as Virtual PC to run XP Mode and other VM technologies.</span></p>

<h2>            USB 3.0 ports do not work on new Windows 10 PC - Does anyone know how to fix this&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have just purchased a brand new PC running Windows 10. It has several USB 2.0 ports (which work perfectly) and 2 x USB 3.0 ports which do not work at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have trawled the internet and cannot find a solution. I have spoken to ASUS (the PC manufacturer) who suggested reinstalling the chipset drivers, which I have done, but with no success. They have no further solutions at all to offer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ports are totally unresponsive to any device plugged in. Devices plugged in do not show up in File Manager/My Computer and cannot be accessed. Disconnecting &amp; reconnecting devices has no effect. All devices work perfectly when plugged into the USB 2.0
 ports, so I know the devices are fine. There are no issues detected on Device Manager and all drivers there are up to date.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd really appreciate any feedback offered on how to fix this. :-)</p>

<em>USB</em> devices you’ve connected with your system so far. To find the one from the list for which you have an issue, you have to follow the trial and error method. That is, plug and remove the device and note the changes among the list of devices for
<em>Universal Serial Bus controllers</em>. The entry which is appeared and then removed subsequently is the entry for issued device. Keep the device plugged in and right click over this entry, pick
<strong>Properties</strong>.</p>
<p>d. In the device properties window shown below, switch to <strong>Details</strong> tab. Now click the drop-down menu for
<em>Property</em> and select <strong>Device Instance Path</strong>. Note down the corresponding
<em>Value</em><span> because we will need this value in further steps. By the way, this value
<span>iscombination</span> of three IDs; namely
</span><em>Vendor ID</em> (VID), <em>Product ID</em> (PID),<em> Instance ID</em>.</p>
<p>e.&nbsp;Press <strong>Windows Key + R</strong><span> combination, type put

</em>f. Navigate here: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\USB\<em>&lt;Device Instance Path&gt;</em>\Device Parameters (Substitute the Device Instance Path part (after USB\) obtained from the step 3).</p>
<p>g. &nbsp;In the right pane of <strong>Device Parameters</strong> key look for the<em> DWORD</em> named

<h2>            Xbox One won&#38;&#35;39&#59;t connect to game servers</h2>
                    
<p>when I test network and multiplayer connections it says they are fine; but it won't connect to my game servers.&nbsp; Titanfall says "searching for data center" and never finds it. Elder Scrolls Online says "&nbsp; error 301 ( 3:1:654:10013) unable to connect to server"&nbsp;
 Neverwinter says " account server connection could not be started"&nbsp; I don't think the problem is with my internet connection because aside from the Xbox connection tests saying it is fine, I can run Destiny on my PS4 with no problem at all. Does any one have
 any ideas?</p>

<p>sign out of your profile , then back in....if that dosent work , try this below.....</p>
<p>go into settings and accounts and remove all the profiles , (make sure you have the email and password to get them back ) after you remove the profiles , shut the xbox down by holding the xbox logo on the console for 8 seconds till it powers down , while
 it is off , unplug your modem and router for 30 seconds to clear them also , plug the modem and router back up and when they are online , turn the xbox back on , when it is all the way up , re add your main profile ...it may sit there and sync a little while
 but all SHOULD be good afterwards ...</p>

<p>Thanks for the tip. &nbsp;However I seem to have stumbled onto a simpler fix. &nbsp;I shut down the machine by holding the Xbox logo on the front of the console for 8 seconds. &nbsp;When I re-started the Xbox and signed on with my profile everything worked again. &nbsp;I guess
 it just needed a reboot. &nbsp;Thanks again.</p>

<p>That doesn't really tell us anything&nbsp;much - only that the connection to the server failed. We have to see the entire error message to be able to diagnose the problem. Please remove any unsent messages from the outbox (below the account folders in the folder
 pane), then compose a new test message with a unique subject and send it to yourself (i.e. from the EarthLink account to the same account). Post&nbsp;any new error message in your reply. You can click on an error message to select it, then use right-click to copy
 it and paste it into the text entry box.</p>

<p><br />
If the OS is W7 use its Start menu's Search bar.&nbsp;&nbsp; E.g. type wireless and see what you get.&nbsp;&nbsp; For example, on my HP Tablet doing that finds its Wireless Assistant which shows the Wireless status and a button for toggling it on or off.</p>

<p>@zuhl,</p>
<p>the compatibility list isn't reliable. In most cases, when it says "The publisher stated that this game is not compatible", it simply means they're not willing to give any support if problems arise. If you go to the Valusoft site (from your link), they offer
 a "Windows 98/ME/XP/VISTA" compatible version - compatible with Vista but not with Win7? What a subtlety.</p>
<p>@mzuzile,</p>
<p>before you buy it and it doesn't work, there's an easy way: You can download all games of the series as free demos, each at ~100 MB or a bit more (<a href="http://www.valusoft.com/store/valusoft/DisplayCategoryProductListPage/categoryID.9361800&amp;productTitleAscending=sort" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.valusoft.com/store/valusoft/DisplayCategoryProductListPage/categoryID.9361800&amp;productTitleAscending=sort</a>).
 All games are at least compatible with XP (install and run them in XP compatibility mode), and the system requirements are so low that you should have no problems to run them.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If your laptop has a backlit keyboard, there's a dedicated key that you can use to turn the light on and off. Check the
<strong>F5 </strong>key to check if the backlit keyboard key is present. If so, press it to turn the keyboard light on or off. Refer to the screenshot below:</p>

    <title>&#91;Guide&#93; How to get all achievements in &#34;Family Guy&#58; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            &#91;Guide&#93; How to get all achievements in &#34;Family Guy&#58; Back to the Multiverse&#34;</h2>
                    <p><strong><em>Family Guy:&nbsp;Back to the Multiverse</em> Achievement Walkthrough</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>This walkthrough is for the retail game, Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse and is written as a suggested path for how to earn the achievements. This is by no means a definitive answer to every achievement, as many can be earned in different locations and different manners as those given here.</p>

<p>You should only need one playthrough of the main story if you follow this guide, although some achievements may require you to return to some of the levels if you were unable to complete them.</p>

<p>Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse can be played in local co-op mode, and with this in mind, I have tried to included co-op notes, where applicable, to assist in both players getting the achievements in the same playthrough. Please bear in mind however, that it does not seem that every achievement can be earned by both players in co-op mode. For instance: whenever player 2 collects cash, it gets credited to player 1; and when player 2 joins the game, there is no game save file associated with his profile, so he will likely need to play on his own for achievements like "Obsession".</p><p><br /></p><p>In general, if you are not very good at this game, you do not need to fear dying. There appears to be infinite lives; however, you do lose some cash every time you die.</p>

<p>The only real advice that I can give you is to remember that you can sprint by pressing down on the left stick when you run. You probably won't need this much, but getting at least one of the secondary objective requires you to use the sprint in order to make the jump to it. You can quickly cycle through the special items you possess by pressing left and right on the d-pad; I found this quicker and easier to use than pressing and holding Y for the weapon inventory, then pressing the RB or LB button.</p>

<p>Also, keep in mind that some people have reported a glitch in the final achievement, "There is no Cake", which requires you to have all of the other achievements. A suggested solution that seems to work for people, is to make sure that the last achievement you earn prior to this is "Mort Will Now Lend You Credit", which requires you to purchase every item from the store.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Story Mode</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse practically holds your hand through each of the primary objectives. There is virtually no way that you can miss them. Because of this, the story walkthrough will focus on secondary objectives and level specific achievements.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Level 1)&nbsp;It's All Greek to Me</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Before you do anything, press up on the D pad 10 times to switch back and forth between Stewie and Brian for: <em><strong>Bipolar</strong></em><br /></p><p /><p>Co-op note: As this requires you to switch between Brian and Stewie, t

<p>Then walk&nbsp;the yard around the nerd frat house you start at and break the piñatas to unlock: <strong><em>Day Labor</em></strong></p><p>Co-op Note: Both players must break at least one piñata for both players to get this, otherwise&nbsp;only the player breaking the piñatas will get this achievement.</p>

<p>Now go ahead and speak with Mort to begin the primary objectives for this level. Once you collect the photo for Lisa and speak with Mort, Mort will give you the secondary objective of finding all of the photographs. Keep in mind that when you have completed a secondary objective, you will receive an on screen notice that rewards have been unlocked. This is true, but you will not receive credit towards the "Obsessed" achievement until you finish the level and the game auto-saves.</p>

<p><em><strong>Collect All of the Raunchy Sorority Photos</strong></em>&nbsp;</p><p>Þ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On front porch of yellow house next door to Mort’s frat house (Apple)</p><p>
Þ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On front porch of the bluish house next door, where Mort gives you this objective (Lucy)&nbsp;</p><p>Þ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On front porch of the grey house next door to the previous one, the "NOT"&nbsp;frat house&nbsp;(Coco)&nbsp;</p><p>Þ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the table in front of the next house (Diana)</p><p>
Þ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the table in the back of the same house (Alana)</p><p>
Þ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the table in the “island” in the center of the cul-de-sac (Paris)&nbsp;</p><p>Þ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Shoot the propane tank along the fence between the sorority house and the house next door (the tank is on the side of the house next door); this opens up a small area where the photo is at (Kimmy K)&nbsp;</p><p>Þ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the ground behind this same house, near the skateboard/skating stuff (Mona)</p><p>
Þ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Continue around this house, the next one is on a table&nbsp;in the front of the house (Lauren)</p><p>
Þ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the front porch of the same house, right by where you got the last one (Christy)&nbsp;</p><p>Þ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once you steal the tap, you will jump the ditch. It’s on the table right there (Mary Kate)&nbsp;</p><p>Þ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Mort assigns you the task of stealing the jocks’ jackets, go to that house; the next photo is on the porch next to Meg (Chelsea)&nbsp;</p><p>Þ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the side of this house, by the passed out Greeks (Moon Unit)</p><p>
Þ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On a table in the back of this house (Stacie)</p><p>
Þ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Mort asks you to steal the speakers, it is on the porch just behind the speakers (Jessica S)</p><p><br /></p>

<p>When you complete the level you (and your co-op partner) will earn: <strong>It's All&nbsp;Greek&nbsp;To Me</strong></p>

<strong><br /></strong><p><strong>Level 2)&nbsp;Something's Amish!</strong></p>

<p><br /></p><p>This&nbsp;level adds the sniper rifle to your arsenal, which, if you don't&nbsp;have them already,&nbsp;makes it easy to get the following two achievements:</p><p><strong>One Shot Kills</strong></p><p><strong>Head Shot</strong></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>When you get to the pot field, remember to use Stewie's new flamethrower to earn:</p><p><strong>Scorched Earth</strong></p>

<p><br /></p>

<table><tbody><tr><td><p>Kill All the Chickens</p></td><td><p>Collect All the Wanted Posters</p></td></tr><tr><td><p><em>The chickens sometimes move around so locations will not be specific/detailed</em></p><p>Þ 4 can be found in the area before completing the first objective&nbsp;</p><p>Þ 1 can be found in a small, fenced-in yard to the left of Peter</p><p>
Þ 1 can be found in the area before you destroy the sniper tower&nbsp;</p><p>Þ 1 can be found in the stable area&nbsp;</p><p>Þ 2 can be found in the pumpkin patch off of the main playable area. You&nbsp;can get them from the stable area, or from where the buggies were after the pot field. These must be sniped.&nbsp;</p><p>Þ Last one is on a platform above the quarry, by where the large house sits. You may have to shoot this before flooding the quarry</p></td><td><p>Þ&nbsp;This is just to the left, outside of the barn you start in</p><p>
Þ&nbsp;By the Horse Fuel sign (You saw this one posted in the cut-scene)&nbsp;</p><p>Þ&nbsp;Behind the store-portal in the alley across from the Milk Saloon&nbsp;</p><p>Þ&nbsp;On the shed by the 3 hay stacks just past Herbert
Þ&nbsp;On the back of the building next to the sniper tower&nbsp;</p><p>Þ&nbsp;At the end of the short road to the left in the cornfield</p><p>
Þ&nbsp;On the stable, past the hay stack at the end of the building</p><p>
Þ&nbsp;On the big barn just after the stable</p><p>
Þ&nbsp;On a large rock to the left of the&nbsp;second tree you need to burn
(Note, you must get these next three&nbsp;<em>before</em>&nbsp;flooding the quarry)</p><p>
Þ In the Quarry, at the bottom on the side of the ramp leading up&nbsp;</p><p>Þ&nbsp;In the Quarry, on the second level</p><p>
Þ&nbsp;In the Quarry, top level, follow the path to the right</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

<p>During the "boss fight", you will be up against a&nbsp;giant robot Bertram. Aim for the eyes to weaken it and then shoot the Amish guy when he pops out. Once you've done this a few times, you complete the level and earn:</p><p><strong>Something's Amish</strong></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Level 3)&nbsp;Handicapable</strong></p>

<strong><br /></strong>

<p>There are no mission specific achievements here.</p>

<p>When fighting Crippletron, stay away from the howitzers while he is throwing buses, otherwise you will have to keep repairing the damage. Run around until he puts his hands up, then shoot the howitzer closest to him. He will throw more buses after each shot that hits him. Once Crippletron has been defeated:</p><p><strong>Handicapable</strong></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Level 4)&nbsp;****</strong></p><ul><li>Collect Evil Mayor West’s Kitty Figurines
<br />Þ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At start of level, on the stairs to the right<br />
Þ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After cut-scene with tank objective, on right behind the sandbags under the crashed plane
<br />Þ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind enemy spawn truck between first and second tank
<br />Þ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind enemy spawn truck next to Burger restaurant
<br />Þ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Behind last tank</li></ul>

<p>Shoot Bertram when he pops his head out of the tank (I used the sniper rifle to help avoid his fire) until he is defeated, then defeat Evil Mayor West to unlock:</p><p><strong>****</strong></p><p><br /></p>

<p><strong>Level 5)&nbsp;No Cheese, Please</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>When you get to the room with Quagmire tied to a bed, make sure to hide in that room until you get:<br /></p>

<br />Þ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The game gives you no direction for this secondary objective. When you are on deck firing the cannons at the other pirate ships, look for buoys (they seem to alternate sides) in the water with a shark near each. You have to shoot these with the cannon (It has been said that you can snipe the guys on the buoys as well).&nbsp;You only need&nbsp;three, so do your best.</li></ul>

<p><strong>Long John Peter</strong></p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Level 7)&nbsp;Santa's Sweatshop</strong></p><p><br /></p>

<p>Once you begin to walk into the factory, you will see a portrait of Vernon, Santa's Employee of the Month. As you get to the portrait, he comes around the corner. Kill him to unlock:</p>

<p><strong>Employee of the Month</strong></p><p>Co-op Note: Both players will earn this achievement when Vernon dies.<br /></p>

<p><br /></p><p>Defeat&nbsp;Santa to&nbsp;complete the level and unlock:</p><p><strong>Santa's Sweatshop</strong></p>

<p><br /></p><p><strong>Level 8)&nbsp;Chickens in Space</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>This level is an amusing parody of the Alien series, all the way up to the boss fight with the chicken "queen" laying eggs.</p>

<ul><li>Rescue All the Captured Quahogians
<br />Þ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bruce is next to switch for second crane (“oh, noo….”)
<br />Þ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Consuela&nbsp;is next to switch for third crane (“Mr. Superman is no here…”)
<br />Þ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Herbert is next to the switch for the third crane (“Where’s the paperboy?”)
<br />Þ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mort is along the route from the bridge-like/control room area
<br />Þ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Joe and Carter are in the room with the cryosleep chambers
<br />Þ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tom Tucker is to the right just after you come back inside the second airlock
<br />Þ&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cleveland and Quagmire are in a room along the path just after destroying the gas tubes</li></ul>

<p>The boss fight here can be frustrating due to the large number of enemies that chase you. You need to shoot the chicken "queen" until she faints, then pull the lever right underneath her to hit her with steam. If you aren't fast enough, she will wake up and heal herself. Do this a few times to unlock:</p><p><strong>Chickens in Space</strong></p>

<p><br /></p><p><strong>Level 9)&nbsp;Chicken Fight</strong></p><p>There are no secondary objectives in this level</p>

<p><br /></p><p>During the fight however, position yourself so that when you punch and kick the chicken, he gets knocked into some of the level's many objects. While this does not have to be done in one playthrough, you really should be able to get 20 in one go and unlock:</p><p><strong>Wrecking Ball</strong></p>

<p>Co-op Note: Player 2 will play as the Giant Chicken. Both players can earn this as they fight each other.<br /></p>

<p><br /></p><p>Once you complete the fight, you will unlock:</p><p><strong>Chicken Fight</strong></p>

<p><br /></p><p><strong>Level 10)&nbsp;No Place Like Home</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>This is the final level of the game, and is essentially one big boss fight, in three distinct phases.&nbsp;</p><p>Phase 1: Destroy the lasers on the T-Rex's head. HIDE! You must hide from the T-Rex on rooftops and in buildings and try to shoot the lasers mounted on his head - all while dealing with a small army of Bertrams - because if he sees you, he will activate those lasers.&nbsp;If he catches you on the ground, you may quickly be trampled. BEWARE - if you die here, the T-Rex's damage meter refills. This phase can be frustrating.<br /></p>

<p>Phase 2: Destroy the rocket launchers on the T-Rex. This phase seems much easier than the first, especially when using the Rail Gun from a distance. The rockets should be fairly easy to avoid.</p>

<p>Phase 3: Destroy the cars that the T-Rex picks up in his mouth&nbsp;before he throws them at you. This seems to be the easiest phase. &nbsp;Make sure to die once in Phase 3 to unlock:</p><p><strong>Ugly Tastes Terrible</strong></p>

<p><br /></p><p>Once you complete the level, you will earn:</p><p><strong>No Place Like Home</strong></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>If you completed all of the secondary objectives, (remember that you must finish a level with all of its secondary objectives completed for them to count towards the achievement) you will also unlock:</p>

<p><strong>Obsessed</strong></p><p><br /></p><p><strong><em><u>Multiplayer</u></em></strong></p><p><br /></p><p>This is merely a suggestion on how to set up the multiplayer matches for the various achievements. You can use any character you want to in any mode and if boosting these alone, you can just kill yourself to switch characters - except in Multiverse Madness - and get more achievements in a single game mode. Of course, if you have others to play with, just screw around and you're bound to get most of these along the way. With that said I will write this out assuming it will be just you and an extra controller and setting the match options to the minimum for time.</p><p><br /></p><p><strong><em>Deathmatch</em></strong></p><p>This is for 2-4 players in teams or a free-for-all.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Choose Meg for both players. When the match starts you get:<br /></p><p><strong>Mr. Unpopular</strong></p>

<p><br /></p><p>Melee kill Player 2 and unlock:<br /></p>

<p><strong>Shut up Meg</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Melee kill player 2 two more times for:<br /></p>

<p><strong>Roadhouse</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Continue to kill player 2 and you will eventually get:</p><p><strong>The Cleaner</strong></p><p><strong>Kings of&nbsp;Quahog</strong></p>

<p><strong><br /></strong></p><p><em><strong>Capture the Greased-Up Deaf Guy</strong></em></p><p />

<p>This mode is basically capture the flag, with a twist. The flag is, obviously, the greased-up deaf guy. You have to defeat him to pick up a flag, and then return the flag to your vortex base. If you play this as Quagmire, you can go kill player 2, then taunt him to unlock:</p>

<p><span><strong>Teabag a D-Bag</strong></span></p>

<p>Once you capture the rest of the flags to finish the match you will unlock:</p>

<p><span><strong>Grease Can't Save You Now</strong></span></p><p><strong>Lockdown</strong></p><p><br /></p><p><em><strong>Multiverse Madness</strong></em></p>

<p>This mode plays like Firefight in Halo or Horde in Gears of War. You must defeat waves of enemies from across the multiverse. The only catch? You just get one life. If you die, it's game over and you must start from wave one again. This can be done in co-op, but only 2&nbsp;can play this mode. You must survive all waves required to unlock the associated achievement if playing in co-op mode; even if your partner survives, if you die, you won't get the achievement.</p>

<p>Multiverse Madness mode is similar to Firefight mode in Halo or Horde mode in Gears of War. What worked for me was to play on the Space Station map and stick to the starting area (in the room near the Joe special item with the health pack special item in it). this way I could force the enemy waves to funnel themselves to me through the room's only entrance.

I played as Quagmire and once I had enough cash I purchased the Acid Sprayer and watched my enemies melt away. I also purchased Land Mines and placed them between waves. If you have not purchased Quagmire, or prefer not to use him, you can play as Stewie and use his Magma Gun for a similar effect. It has been suggested that by quickly entering and exiting the store portal (Press X then B), you can reload much faster.

After 15 waves, if you don't already have it, you will get:</p><p><strong>Bunch of Chumps</strong></p>

<p>And once you have completed all 30 waves:</p><p><strong>Cartoon Apocalypse</strong></p><p><br /></p><p><em><strong>Infiltrator</strong></em></p>

<p><br /></p><p>This mode involves accomplishing various goals better than, or faster than, your opponent(s) to win the match, and includes enemies that will attack you.
If you play as Peter, you can taunt&nbsp;5 times to get:<br /></p><p><strong>Bird is the Word</strong></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Continue taunting for a total of 25 times to get:</p><p><strong>Teabaggin'</strong></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>Once you complete the infiltrator match you get:</p><p><strong>Bestest Infiltrator</strong></p>

<p><br /></p><p><strong><em><u>Challenge Mode</u></em></strong></p><p><br /></p><p>Challenge Mode features seven different challenge objectives, each based on one of the game's levels. Each challenge allows you to earn up to three stars. How you earn these stars will vary from challenge to challenge, some require you to choose a difficulty, while others simply require you to survive a certain period of time. There are also some bonus challenges that were pre-order bonus DLC content. I do not know if they will eventually become available to all, but have included what I know just for information sake as they do not count towards achievements as of this writing.</p>

<p>The first three challenges are immediately available for play.</p>

<p><strong><br /></strong></p><p><strong>Money Shots</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em>Gather</em>&nbsp;</p><p>Remember collecting the raunchy sorority photos in "It's All Greek To Me"? Now it's your turn to take them. You can choose between Meg and Quagmire to do this. It may take you a couple of tries, but the best tip I can give you is to try and just work around either clockwise or counterclockwise. Don't skip houses or jump back and forth across the street. You must get to your car to complete the challenge.&nbsp;</p><p>* Take 6 photos of girls before time is up&nbsp;</p><p>
** Take 8 photos of girls before time is up&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>*** Take 10 photos of girls before time is up&nbsp;</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p>

<strong>Amish Amuck</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em>Elimination</em>&nbsp;</p><p>This is the easiest challenge, hands down. There is no time limit; you just have to kill the Amish without killing more than the specified amount of civilians. You can choose between Brian and Lois. I found that by using Brian and the shotgun, it made short work of the Amish, and reduced the amount of civilians you would shoot.&nbsp;</p><p>* Kill 30 Amish with less than 6 tourists killed&nbsp;</p><p>** Kill 40 Amish with less than 5 tourists killed&nbsp;</p><p>*** Kill 50 Amish with less than 4 tourists killed&nbsp;</p><p><strong><br /></strong></p><p>
<strong>The Crips and Ables</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em>Rescue</em></p><p>
Remember the pods you activated to rescue the Quahogians from in "Chickens in Space"? Well, the "Crips" have trapped several "Able" people in them in the hospital area from "Handicapable" and it's your job to rescue them within a set time limit. You can choose between Quagmire and Cleavland. All of the objectives are marked here, so do your best to get them all by working your way to each one. There is a fairly linear pattern you can follow from your first to your last, starting on the top floor from where you start and working your way down and across to the other side of the hospital. I found that doing this made things easier.&nbsp;</p><p>* Rescue 4 people before time runs out&nbsp;</p><p>** Rescue 5 people before time runs out&nbsp;</p><p>*** Rescue 6 people before time runs out</p>

<p><br /></p><p>Once you have earned at least 7 stars (you'll have up to 9 once you've done the above challenges), you will be able to try these next two:</p>

<p><strong><br /></strong></p><p><strong>Town Hall Beating</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em>Wave Defense</em>&nbsp;</p><p>Based in the small "****" level, you must survives waves of enemies, much like in Multiverse Madness. You can play as Adam West, or Evil Adam West. Most people advise that you stay at the top of a flight of stairs and/or inside the ruined building where the ammo crate and portal store are located. In fact, the game seems to advise this as well. If you are good, you can run about outside, but you cannot find ammo or power up out in the field. Just stay in the three story building, where you have access to ammo and bonus items, and use the rifle to pick off enemies in the distance and the six shooters (or whatever weapon you're best with) for those that come close; the rifle seems to be very effective against the mechs.&nbsp;</p><p>* Survive many enemies per wave&nbsp;</p><p>** Survive many more enemies per wave&nbsp;</p><p>*** Survive a (bleep) ton of enemies per wave&nbsp;</p><p><strong><br /></st
<strong>Sea Men Attack</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em>Wave Defense</em>&nbsp;</p><p>If you hated the cannon sequence in "Legend of Long John Peter", I'm sorry. This challenge, in which you play as either Peter or Death, requires you to survive for an unspecified amount of time in order to earn up to 3 stars. The longer you live, the more stars you earn. Death has a great melee attack, but you can use whomever you're best with.</p>

<p><br /></p><p>Once you have earned at least 13 stars (you'll have up to 15 once you've done all of the challenges above), you will have access to the final two challenges.</p>

<p><strong><br /></strong></p><p><strong>Last Minute Shopper</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em>Escape</em>&nbsp;</p><p>After picking up the first bomb, go back to your spawn and jump off the railing, just like when you had to collect the Rupert in "Santa's Sweatshop". This makes the going easier. Then just keep going down and run out the front when you have the last bomb. Don't worry about the enemies too much, especially the ones that explode, and try to focus on running and picking up the bombs as quickly as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>* Collect all of the bombs with a 30 second time bonus per bomb&nbsp;</p><p>** Collect all of the bombs with a 20 second time bonus per bomb&nbsp;</p><p>*** Collect all of the bombs with a 15 second time bonus per bomb

7.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p><strong>Someone to Overwatch Me</strong> - <em>Overwatch</em></p><p>
This challenge is co-op required. You can do it by yourself with two controllers if you don't have someone to play with. It should not be too difficult to plant the bombs and defend yourself with Lois's needle gun. Watch out for the snipers but, you can take them out pretty easily. The tricky part is making the jump from the crane to the second building, this is what makes this challenge a pain in the ass. The jump is very far and hard to pin down (just like the above mentioned Rupert). It has been suggested that&nbsp;to make the jump, you must stand at the left corner of the crane and jump, making sure to time it carefully, and you should make it. Plant the last four bombs and jump into the helicopter. You may not have to touch the second controller at all ("To the Peter-Copter!") except, perhaps, to take out some snipers.&nbsp;</p><p>* Set 4 charges without either character dying</p><p>
** Set 6 charges without either character dying&nbsp;</p><p>*** Set 8 charges without either character dying</p>

<p><br /></p><p>After getting your first 7 stars, you will unlock</p><p><strong>Little Dipper</strong></p><p><br /></p><p>When you complete all 7 challenges and earn all 21 stars, you will unlock:<br /></p><p><strong>Big Dipper</strong></p>



<p><br /></p><p><strong><em><u>Bonus Challenge</u></em></strong></p><p><br /></p>

<p>Remember that the bonus challenge does not seem to increase your star total, and thus does not count towards the above achievements. I am including the bonus challenge merely for fun.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p>

<p><strong>The Great Eggscape</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;<em>Escape&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>(Pre-Order bonus available in the US via GameStop and UK/Ireland via GAME and Xtravision)</em></p><p>
In this challenge, set in the "Chickens in Space" level, you must go from room to room in a linear fashion, clearing each room by killing all chickens and robot chickens in the room before moving on to the next. You finish by getting to Quagmire after clearing the final room. You have a time limit and must avoid killing too many of the civilians, who foolishly run into your line of fire at times, especially on the 3 star difficulty. You can destroy eggs from a distance to prevent them from hatching and can perform "mercy killings" by shooting the people strung up, which prevents chickens from bursting from their chests. You choose between Stewie and Chris. Personally, I like Chris and his primary weapon, the pulse rifle. Don't rush and try to get headshots on the robot chickens and you should do fine.</p><p>
* Clear all 6 rooms in 6:00 and kill less than 8 civilians&nbsp;</p><p>** Clear all 6 rooms in 5:35 and kill less than 6 civilians</p><p>
*** Clear all 6 rooms in 5:05 and kill less than 4 civilians</p>

            More information would be helpful. What printer? What architecture of windows is installed, is the driver package for the proper architecture? Have you tried running the installer with elevated privledges (right click, run as administrator).
