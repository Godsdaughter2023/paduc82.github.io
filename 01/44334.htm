<p>========================================</p>
<p>
</p><p>I also got a call from a guy claiming to be from Microsoft Corp., who also may have been from "Team Viewer", but I could hardly understand his dialect -- after a half hour into the conversation, I asked him where he was from, said he was from Indonesia.
 &nbsp;(Red Flag went to my brain already!)&nbsp;</p>
<p>He told me that this was a courtesy call on behalf of Microsoft to users of "Windows" (didn't specify which, but later on he indicated most widely used and popular system is Windows 7, which I have, and prefer after hearing the volatile use of Windows 10.
 &nbsp;But he continued to suggest to me that I delete certain "files" that could be harming my computer (I am using a laptop with Windows 7, powered by HP Pavilion g6, with AMD Vision A4), which he instructed me to get into my "Event Viewer" log files. I was to
 inform him of the choices in the menu, and he told me to click on Administrative Events. &nbsp;When I did that, a long list of "events" came up in the event viewer log file column, of which many were "errors" and "warnings" of all the events leading up from the
 last 2 years of use with this laptop, which I noticed but not all that concerned about them. &nbsp;Sometimes I would get a popup window reporting an 'error' on a program, and then I would click off of it, and continue on, never occurred to me that it was being
 reported as an "error" event log, but everything else was running ok. &nbsp;He then instructed me to use the "Run" command line in the "Start" button, and type in "msconfig", which I know what that is as I've used it many times before and it was already typed in
 there. He said to open it up, and go into "Services" and see how many of those services are "stopped"...and to count how many there are. &nbsp;I have 82 services stopped in that listing. &nbsp;He then said he would send me a "CODE" (RED FLAG goes up again) that would
 link me up with another one of his "tech support" people to show me how to get rid of those Event logs and how to start those services up again in the MSConfig window. &nbsp;I was leary of this guy with that</p>
<p>Indonesian accent who claim he was calling from Los Angeles (he pronounces it "Los Angeleees") and I asked all sorts of questions as to why would Microsoft call me up on a Saturday night, on Halloween of all things, after hours, on a "supposed" help service
 to delete certain files and then&nbsp;</p>
<p>get me on a "code" with them to "take a look" at those files? &nbsp;Well, he went into his long speech</p>
<p>(probably pre-written) that they would have no use in going after my personal files, blah blah blah,</p>
<p>and nothing would go wrong........RED FLAGS!! &nbsp; Well, I said I'll call my REAL tech support guy where I live in town who previously fixed my computer before and ask him these questions. &nbsp;I hung up after that. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I believe this is a scam also, am I right?&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            How to move storage folders from Windows Live Mail 2012 to the Mail app in Windows 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Mail app - storage</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am trying to move storage folders from Windows Live Mail 2012 to the Mail app in Windows 10, as&nbsp;explained in "Windows Live Mail 2012 will not connect to Outlook.com", under "Move data to Mail app for Windows" -&nbsp;"For locally stored emails".</p>
<p>Problem: drag and drop or copy/paste functions (under #4) do not work. </p>
<p>Question: how can I activate either one of those two functions?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Does it mean that I have to move FIRST my Windows Live Mail Storage folders to newly created folders in Outlook.com? by following the instructions of # 4, correct?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes, but you do it <em>within</em> Windows Live Mail like this (showing the <em>
Copy to folder </em>technique):</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3dbcdba7-4a67-44e4-abe4-94d7b88f7675" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/3dbcdba7-4a67-44e4-abe4-94d7b88f7675" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Putting messages into a folder under the Outlook.com account means that they will be uploaded to Outlook.com at the next sync. Then, when the same account is synchronized with the Mail app, the same messages will be downloaded when you select the folder:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/26e6c714-2661-40d5-8408-a8aba46b359a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/26e6c714-2661-40d5-8408-a8aba46b359a" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>While this will enable you to see in Mail the messages that were in your Windows Live Mail storage folders, I'm not sure how effective it is as an archive.

            Ok, I guess I am back to my original question. How do I file a complaint and get a refund? What we pay to be an overnight process is now into the second week. Although I was PM'ed by a Nikki from Microsoft, no information is forthcoming. When I call 1-800-642-7676
 nobody can help or steer me in the right direction. This is what happens when you outsource to a horrible company like
<span>Concentrix Corporation. Not only are we looking at replacing our 150 Surface Pro 3s but our 1500 Surface Pro 4s. This is completely unacceptable!</span>

    <title>How can I recover my windows 8.1 Pro N product key - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> horohoro55  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I recover my windows 8.1 Pro N product key</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently (possibly because of the Intel hotfix or the windows internal cleaning tool (the 2 last things that I ran before it crashed), but let's not jump to conclusion), my boot was completely destroyed. I tried to repair it with the boot tools but it only
 seems to make it worse so I boot on a live USB and copied the entire content of the drive on my second computed and proceeded with a clean install (also because, the indefinitely growing Installer folder was making me mad).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I reinstalled windows from scratch and I thought that by browsing my old drive, I could find the product key somewhere. However I could not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By checking the register I only could find the ProductId which is 00260-10012-12158-AA675. However, if I enter this to activate my windows it does not work ... so I came to the conclusion that ProductID != ProductKey.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What should I do to get my ProductKey back ? Can you directly give me my ProductKey from this ProductID or do you need more information from me ?</p>
<p>The version was Windows 8.1 Pro N.</p>
<p>
</p><p>(I cannot find the receipt with my product key because I bought it only (so no stamp on the PC) and unfortunately, the mail address was on a mail server that shut down recently and the local backup were somehow lost before I backupped my disk content (Murphy's
 law))</p>

            WMP doesn't have built-in support for an iPod. However, you could purchase one of the iPod WMP plug-ins that SpiritX linked to in his post above.

<br />
Set the MP3 to MTP Mode for Sync to WMP - MSC mode to treat the MP3 as a drive.<br />
(Its set at MSC now)<br />
<br />
Your MP3 should have 2 settings - MSC which should allow the player to be used as an external drive<br />
and MTP which is the setting to use to Sync to WMP. Remove the MP3 and reboot the computer.<br />
Change the MP3 to MTP mode - power it off and hook it up.<br />
<br />
======================================</p>
<p>There are plugin's to let WMP sync music to an iPod:<br />

            thanks for the reply....been pulling my hair out....tried the link you suggested already....all settings in wmp and the motherboard audio driver has been deleted and reinstalled....usb driver updated as I'm trying to play from a usb external hard drive music collection.....same same problem viewing downloaded movies in wmp or vlc....video fine....no audio but the volume icon in the tray shows VU.....load the content onto a usb memory stick and audio is fine on xbox but not on pc from stick....have googled the **** out of this issue.....lol....leaning towards a wmp versus win 7 koogle but can't find any real solutions out there

            <p>Hello Pierre,</p>
<p>Given that its the Realtek that may be at issue, what video driver / connection&nbsp;are you using? I know its an audio issue, but video and audio are often linked. And given the work you've done, I presume you've already checked in Device Manager, Video, sound
 and game controllers tab, and there are no yellow triangles with exclamation point on them, correct?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other point to keep in mind is that instead of uninstalling your audio drivers, you are better off "disabling" the driver / device in question (if you uninstall the driver, it'll reload itself on next boot-up).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know about the video driver(s) and if there are any yellow triangles (also check your USB drives for them). If you find any, right-click on them and select properties, report any information here. One last question:&nbsp; you say You Tube comes through
 fine...can you trace which driver is playing that audio stream, and if so, can you redirect your USB audio through the You Tube stream?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you could answer these questions, I may&nbsp;yet&nbsp;be able to assist you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>

            ....yes....have wandered fruitlessly thru all the tabs you mentioned and no apparent issues....i'll trace the utube stream....that makes so much sense.....as it stands now....internet-&gt;direct to realtek-&gt;speakers...all good&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; downloaded or usb input-&gt;realtek-&gt;.speakers?....no
 go, but VU shows active audio....will check to see if I can trace the audio from internet source and report....nice approach that one....lol

<p>I'd do it in stages. Driver trace; audio out you tube; audio input speakers. Its probably too big a question to ask in one phrase. Just a thought.</p>

            <p>Hello Pierre,</p>
<p>Well I don't blame you for feeling lost, its certainly above my level - its designed for use by Field Engineers, and I'm not one of those!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it does trip a memory. Go to Control Panel, Administrative Tools, and when you open that look for the Event Viewer. That will have a list of all warning and error messages generated by the system. What I would do is 'create' an event as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) "clear" your system out by doing a few tasks that you know work flawlessly. Print a couple of pages of graphics, and let your system sit idle for a minute. Print more graphics, sit idle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Then watch a video in You Tube, something short is fine, but something you know plays through OK. Then let the system sit idle, repeat the video, let the system sit idle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) Then find and watch a video that you know doesn't play audio, but the video plays fine. Then let the system sit idle, repeat the video, let the system sit idle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) Then go into Event Viewer and see what you have for warning and error events covered in the Viewer log.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>See what you learn and post back here with the results.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

    <title>laptop cursor having &#34;spasms&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sophiadv  say:</h3>
<h2>            laptop cursor having &#34;spasms&#34;</h2>
                    <p>Hi I would like to address my issue that has been happening over a week now to me, and it's my laptop cursor glitching out and having "spasms" at certain points when I use my laptop. My laptop is a HP Notebook, Windows 10, and I've had it for about 9 months
 now. I tried looking in several forums what the cause may be, and most of them say it's because when I type the trackpad gets sensitive but for me that's not the case because I am typing right now and it's fine. Again, there are just random times when it just
 starts getting out of control and clicks everywhere or gets stuck and clicks in an upward/downward motion. I also updated&nbsp;<em>all</em> my drivers so I don't think that would be the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope you guys can help me!</p>

            Hello I am a fellow community member here to help. I know this must be frustrating<br />I would recommend to perform a "Repair Upgrade". Your current installation may have some  corrupt system files. Thisl reinstall windows over top of your existing installation and will preserve personal files and settings.

            Hi angelok1, usually a Bad Image error will refer to a particular dll file on your system . . .
<br />
<br />Does the error dialog refer to a dll and if so, is it the same dll when you get that error on different apps?

<h2>            How can I make custom tiles&#63;&#63;&#63;</h2>
                    After getting Win Hate off my new computer and installing Win 7 Pro!! I am going to see if it's possible for to use Win Hate(dual boot). I have figured out I just need a few custom tile to make Win Hate usable!<br />
1st: This tile I want to call "Programs" when I click it it will bring up a list of the folder "Programs" on normal installs C&gt;Programs!<br />
2nd: a tile called "Search" All this tile does is search my whole computer, not just sections. The whole computer!(Google Search for desktop?)<br />
3rd: a tile called "Power"&nbsp; when I click it all needs to do is give me choice on shutting down my computer. ie: Shut Down, Restart, Hib..... you get it.<br />
4th a tile to enable/disable touchscreen/tablet gestures and the Charm Bar!! that way some those strange uncalled for thingie's that keep popping won't!! We could call it TouchScreen/Tablet or Desktop!!! Simple??<br />
And just maybe I could use something simple like "Notepad" without windows/tiles impeding/blocking me and having to bring up task manager to kill the dang thing!!(How about a little "X" I could actually see).
<br />
Any help I will be Thankful for!!!<br />

            Srimadwa B,<br />
Thank You for your reply!!! Unfortunately, the this only tells me what I already know. One of my main problem's is having a disability and limited range of motion all that clicking to get to basic functions just plain hurts, I need to do as few as possible
 and using the keyboard isn't really good also!! I need tiles that make it easy to basic things. I really could use the tiles above!<br />
1st something that allows me to shut down in a couple of clicks not window key + C, then all the others clicks. Just click and do which shut down you like.<br />
2nd a program tile. I don't remember so well(disability) so again trying to search doesn't work so well if you can't remember the name, keyboard doesn't work well for me there but will recognize it when I see!!!<br />
3rd again I don't and can't use that search very well. I use auto-complete!! When I looked for Activation it wasn't found!! It wasn't found till I put in Windows Activation, I am not going to be able to remember all that! When I use Google I type in act and
 already have what I am looking for. By the way that is how I found it in Win 8 by using Google search because the search in Win 8 couldn't find it!!<br />
4th the disable tile/desktop!! because there is no no "X"&nbsp; on tiles, again I have to try to do some kind of swipe thing!! I am disable and this doesn't work!!! Please a little help for a disable person!!! My computer is very important to me trying live some
 kind of normal life!!!<br />
I am doing this because I am thinking about trying Win 8 again!! I bought a new computer with Win 8 and almost returned it!! I was able to get Win 7 Pro installed on it, without the right's thing. Heck it's my computer right??<br />
Without being able to get tiles like this from Microsoft just means no Win 8 this computer till Win 8 is more disable/handicapped friendly for those with limited range of motion.<br />
One last thing as I like to play under the hood! I can see Win 8 has what I think is a GOOD!!! Kernel it's just the shell I am have difficulty with.<br />
I again really want to Thank You for your time to answer me!!! <br />

    <title>Q re modded lobbies in WaW - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> gnatsuk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Q re modded lobbies  in WaW</h2>
                    
<p>I know MS can't go into specific detail but I was just wondering whether Microsoft and WaW developers are takling the people that set up these modded lobbies. I have warned my son away from them, but for some of his friends the lure of them is very tempting
 and I am sure it's only a matter of time before one of them falls foul of the people in them or gets caught by the XBL enforcement team.</p>
<p>My son is lucky in that because I have been i user since it began and one of the lucky ones to get on the beta, I am aware of the risk that he and his friends were taking, most of his friends wont be so lucky as their parents dont use the service and are
 not savy enough to know what is going on.</p>
<p>It would be nice to see the enforcement team be a bit more pro active in trying to educate the users of the risk they take, I fully support the actions they take and have told my son that if his account does get banned that I will not pay for another one.</p>
<p>What bought this on was seeing one of the people in his friends list with 10&nbsp; as the age of his XBL account, I understood that E's account is the oldest and if&nbsp;I am correct his will be 9 in August?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>
<p>Gnats</p>

<p>According to the Enforcement Team you can't get infected by accident. There are several steps to take that make it clear what is going on. You sound as if you know what you are talking about so just tell your lad to be careful and if people start asking
 him to join a private game and start doing odd things, then he should power off his console. Then block all communications with those people.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I agree that it'd be nice to see more education about the danger of modding but the Enforcement Team would just say that you have your warnings in the Term of Use and Code of Conduct, which to be fair everyone should read as it is all covered.</p>

<p>I understand that, and its not my son I am that concerend about, there are young lads under the M age range that play this that don't know what will happen to them, I will do my bit to make sure he knows and that where possible his friends know what the
 consequences are.</p>
<p>I am just hoping that MS and the developers are taking steps to clean this game up and make it fun again.</p>

<p>i doubt that they are going to clean up the game, i was on it earlier and there were only about 2000 people on it, and every game i joined there were at least 3 to 4 people in god mode flying around.

<h3> kelvinwise  say:</h3>
<h2>            toshiba c55-a won&#39;t boot up after windows 8.1 update and the fan just surges rhythmically</h2>
                    I upgraded to Windows 8.1 from download about a month ago and just within the last 2 weeks, my Toshiba C55-A laptop won't boot up normally. The cooling fan would surge rhythmically for a while (sometimes up to 8 hours or more) and then the welcome screen
 would come up. Today, nothing comes up. The screen stays black and the fan surges. Any ideas as to my next appropriate action?

<h2>            Mirror a Surface 4 to laptop.</h2>
                    <p>I bought a wireless display adapter and have had no problem displaying the Surface directly through a projector.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then I tried to use an older projector that only had VGA input and no USB. I can project my laptop through this projector and would like to use the wireless display adapter to mirror the surface to my laptop. When I plug the wireless display adapter into
 the laptop the Surface does not find it. Is there any way for this to be done?</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately, I installed a programme name "FileSafer.exe" from that link " https://filesafer.com/FileSafer.exe ". When I run it, without any confirmation it installed my hard drive. Then I saw the error in the taskbar some process including Cortana and
 windows defender and Microsoft store with a small green sign. When running these programs they worked correctly. I scan my PC with defender also with Malwarebytes but did see any threats. So is this a virus? Please help what to do. I am giving the screenshots
 from the taskbar. Please reply as soon as possible.</p>

            Try going back to a restore point to see if you can get rid of it.
<br />Go to search and type restore point.
<br />Click Reset this PC.
<br />Click Get Started.
<br />Your machine will reboot.
<br />Select Troubleshoot - Advanced Options and System Restore.
<br />Go back to before you installed it.
<br />
<br />See if that works for you.

            That is a new feature with Windows 10 1803 where the unnecessary processes are suspended so that they can be quickly resumed.
<br />To make sure there is no malware:
<br /> I recommend the following 2 things:
<br />
<br />Scan using Malwarebytes:
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/</a>
<br />Perform a Windows Defender Offline Scan:

<h2>            According to DDPE log, encryption in not starting due to the fact that the TPM Base Services&#40;TBS&#41; did not start</h2>
                    <p>Original Title:TMP Base Services (TBS)</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;I am running Windows 7x64 SP1 Enterprise.&nbsp; We are using DDPE to manage BitLocker.&nbsp; Laptops are not encrypting.&nbsp; According to DDPE log, encryption in not starting due to the fact that the&nbsp;TPM Base Services(TBS) did not start.&nbsp; Opened services.msc and realized
 that TBS was not even listed as a service.&nbsp; Did research on TBS and found that is relies on the, "tbssvc.dll" file.&nbsp; That file is not anywhere on my PC,,, (should be in Windows\System32).&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully someone can help me with the following&nbsp;questions.&nbsp; I am ASSUMING
 that TBS is a Windows service???&nbsp; Should it be included in a standard install? Windows update?&nbsp;&nbsp;If it is standard,,, and it doesn't install, is there a way to reinstall service?&nbsp; I found a link on Dell's site that has me copy tbssvc.dll from a working computer,
 paste it to a non-working computer, create new registry keys, and register the dll,,,,, from the registry.&nbsp; This works, but would rather not go down that rabbit hole if there is an easier solution.&nbsp; Thanks for your help.</p>

            <p>You have three options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press F8 to boot the machine into Repair Mode, then perform a repair.</li><li>Reload Windows from an image that you created while the system was intact.</li><li>Perform a destructive Factory Restore.</li></ul>
<p>Option 2 is an excellent method to avoid the arduous task of a re-installation. Note also that regular data backups to an external medium is not an option but a "must". Lots of people ignore this until they suffer a major disaster.</p>

<h2>            Files in Download subdirectory disappeared un-recoverably &#40;Lost directory after 8.1 update&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>All the files in a Download subdirectory disappeared while I was moving one of it's files to another directory. The empty subdirectory remained.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ctrl-z would not recover them. </p>
<p>I found some names in the Recent Files directory and searched for them everywhere on the machine.&nbsp; They were not there.
</p>
<p>They were not in the Recycle directory.&nbsp; </p>
<p>I used Recuva to look for deleted files.&nbsp; There was nothing "in" that Downloads subdirectory.&nbsp; I looked for deleted documents all over the disk using the deep search.&nbsp; No luck.&nbsp;(I also tried for all documents, deleted or not.)&nbsp; I tried WinHex document recovery
 as well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This was all about 2 days after the Apr 8 Windows 8.1 update.&nbsp; A couple of days later the computer blue screened for the first time, but it hasn't happened&nbsp; since.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any one else with bizarre directory behavior after the update, particularly the 'funny' directories, like Downloads?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've haven't seen a disappearance like this in Windows .. though&nbsp;I could have done something I didn't notice but ... I've never encountered files that could not be found, somewhere on the disk, alive or erased or even unrecoverable, but there.&nbsp;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>So ...&nbsp; any idea where they went or, never mind that, how do I get them back?&nbsp; It was a few weeks work.
</p>
<p>Thanks!&nbsp;&nbsp; -- John</p>

            <p><span>Hi John,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s unhide the folders and check if you files show up. Refer to the below steps:
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a) Press
<strong>Windows and X</strong> simultaneously and select <strong>Windows Explorer</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Click on
<strong>View </strong>and check the box <strong>hidden items</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Now go back to the
<strong>download folder</strong> and check if the folders are listed there.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:
</span></strong><span>After checking, you may hide the files that you have unhide, by following the above method.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If you are still unable to find the folders, you might need to contact the data recovery experts.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the information provided is helpful.</p>
        </p>

            <p>Babu --</p>
<p>
</p><p>My folders were already set up to view hidden items. (By the way it is File Explorer in 8.1 and View has a submenu Show/Hide where the Hidden items checkbox is located.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you are a Microsoft engineer:&nbsp; If I can only recover the directory listing of the lost files I think I might be able to piece the files themselves together.&nbsp; Recall that Recuva and WinHex both failed to recover the directory listing for the Download subdirectory&nbsp;
 in question (which remains intact and showing in explorer, just empty.)&nbsp; Is there a program I can download or a way I can use one of these, say WinHex, to recover the list of files that were in the directory (the original directory state as of the loss)?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Given the bizarre nature of the disappearance (see original question) &nbsp;I can only speculate that it is because of the special nature of the Download folder or a post-8.1 Update glitch.&nbsp; Any explanation for it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help. </p>

            I just had the exact same thing happen on my Win 10 (X99 MoBo) but it was an entire sub-directory with about 50 JPGs in it. I tried the same measures you took, also unsuccessfully. There were shortcuts to the files under C:***Users/Me. Clicking on the
 shortcut(s) reported the link invalid. Since it happened, last night, I've been head banging ever since. The JPGs were created by Epson Scan that Win 10 completely wiped out after an "update" with no explanation, about 2 weeks ago. I found several users on
 forums complaining about the same Epson Scan obliteration and no clue as to why. I found the install disk and put the SW back on my PC. I have made several other scans with no problem with the software or the resulting files up until last night. I don't think
 ti's related to the Epson thing but, who knows. What MS calls an operating system I call malware when it trashes programs and files without my permission. My OS started out as Win 8.1 on this PC.
