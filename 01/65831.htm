            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
<strong>Results verified by WinDBG. DumpCHK, and BlueScreenView. <br />
</strong><br />
The Bug_Check were 8E CAUSE&nbsp; memory_corruption and ntkrpamp.exe which is a Windows
<br />
component which means something else drove it into Fault.<br />
<br />
BugCheck 1000008E, {c0000005, 82ac0089, 94ea7aa0, 0}<br />
Probably caused by : ntkrpamp.exe ( nt!IopCloseFile+20b )<br />

Followup: memory_corruption<br />
<br />
<strong>1.</strong> Check&nbsp;with STRIDE&nbsp;support and their forums (if any).&nbsp;Thouroughly check the
<br />
memory. Keep in mind that memory tests do&nbsp;not detect all errors such as the <br />
tiny&nbsp;speed differences&nbsp;between the memory modules that appear to be identical. <br />
So it&nbsp;may be necessary to swap the modules in and out in different combinations <br />
and patterns (see&nbsp;memory test methods in the next message).&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>2.</strong> Check with ASUStek Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask
<br />
in their forums about any known issues. Update the BIOS, low level chipset drivers,<br />
and the major on-board and separate device drivers. Run DriverView - set VIEW<br />
to Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names (see driver <br />
update methods in the next message).<br />
<br />
BiosVersion = 0502&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
BiosReleaseDate = 03/03/2010 &lt;- check for updates to the BIOS, low level chipset <br />
drivers, and the major on-board and separate device drivers.<br />

<strong>3.</strong> Remove ALL power then reseat the cards, memory, and cables (on both ends
<br />
when possible) - actually remove and replace - do not just snug. Clean out the <br />
dust bunnies and ensure the vents are clean and that the fans are working. Try<br />
adding a small fan blowing into the intake to reduce the effects of heat.<br />
<br />
<strong>4.</strong> Use the other method in the troubleshooters below.<br />

<strong><br />
BCCode: 8E&nbsp; 0x0000008E is same as 0x1000008E</strong><br />
<br />
Two primary causes of these blue screen are&nbsp;video drivers and BIOS - Check with System Maker's<br />
Site for Display Adapter (Video) and BIOS and then Device Maker's site for latest Video. It can be<br />
other drivers so check while there. Turn OFF auto-driver installation as those are older and if<br />
Windows Updates suggests a driver just HIDE it. Antivirus is another possibility.<br />
<br />
<strong>See Generic Driver Update Methods and&nbsp;check running Driver Verifier in the next<br />
message.</strong><br />
<br />
<strong>BCCode: 8E&nbsp; 0x0000008E is same as 0x1000008E<br />
<br />
Cause</strong></p>
<p>The KERNEL_MODE_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED bug check is a very common bug check. To interpret it, you must identify which exception was generated.</p>
<p>Common exception codes include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>0x80000002: STATUS_DATATYPE_MISALIGNMENT indicates that an unaligned data reference was encountered.</p>
</li><li>
<p>0x80000003: STATUS_BREAKPOINT indicates that a breakpoint or ASSERT was encountered when no kernel debugger was attached to the system.</p>
</li><li>
<p>0xC0000005: STATUS_ACCESS_VIOLATION indicates that a memory access violation occurred.</p>
</li></ul>
<p><strong>Resolving the Problem</strong></p>
<p>If you are not equipped to debug this problem, you should use some basic troubleshooting techniques:</p>
<p>Make sure you have enough disk space.</p>
<ul>
<li>If a driver is identified in the bug check message, disable the driver or check with the manufacturer for driver updates.
</li><li>Try changing video adapters. </li><li>Check with your hardware vendor for any BIOS updates. </li><li>Disable BIOS memory options such as caching or shadowing. </li></ul>
<p>If you plan to debug this problem, you might find it difficult to obtain a stack trace. Parameter&nbsp;2 (the exception address) should identify the driver or function that caused this problem.</p>
<p>If you do not know the specific cause of the exception, consider the following items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hardware incompatibility<em>. </em>Make sure that any new hardware installed is listed in the Microsoft Windows Marketplace Tested Products List.
</li><li>Faulty device driver or system service<em>. </em>A faulty device driver or system service might be responsible for this error. Hardware issues, such as BIOS incompatibilities, memory conflicts, and IRQ conflicts can also generate this error.</li></ul>
<p>If the bug check message lists a driver by name , disable or remove that driver. Also, disable or remove any drivers or services that were recently added. If the error occurs during the startup sequence and the system partition is formatted with NTFS file
 system, you might be able to use Safe Mode to rename or delete the faulty driver. If the driver is used as part of the system startup process in Safe Mode, you have to start the computer by using the Recovery Console to access the file.</p>
<p>If the problem is associated with <em>Win32k.sys</em>, the source of the error might be a third-party remote control program. If such software is installed, you can remove the service by starting the system by using the Recovery Console and then deleting
 the offending system service file.</p>
<p>Check the System Log in <strong>Event Viewer</strong> for additional error messages that might help identify the device or driver that is causing bug check 0x1E. You can disable memory caching of the BIOS to try to resolve the error. You should also run
 hardware diagnostics, especially the memory scanner, that the system manufacturer supplies. For more information about these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</p>
<p>The error that generates this message can occur after the first restart during Windows Setup, or after Setup is finished. A possible cause of the error is lack of disk space for installation and system BIOS incompatibilities. For problems during Windows
 installation that are associated with lack of disk space, reduce the number of files on the target hard disk drive. Check for and delete any temporary files that you do not have to have, Internet cache files, application backup files, and<em>.chk</em>files
 that contain saved file fragments from disk scans. You can also use another hard disk drive with more free space for the installation.</p>
<p>You can resolve BIOS problems by upgrading the system BIOS version</p>

<br />
Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen<br />
info that would help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other<br />
error information such as STOP codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />
tcpip.sys - Address 0x00000000 base at 0x000000000 DateStamp 0x000000000<br />

<br />
Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however<br />
there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or <br />
Recovery Options if your system has that installed by the maker.<br />

The log might give you the answer if there was a corrupted driver. (Does not tell all the possible<br />
driver issues).<br />
<br />
Also run CheckDisk so we can rule out corruption as much as possible.<br />

Often updating drivers will help, usually Video, Sound, Network Card&nbsp; (NIC), WiFi, 3rd party<br />
keyboard and mouse, as well as other major device drivers.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<h2>            Why won&#39;t my scroll bar work on my laptop since downloading Windows 10 yesterday&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I downloaded Windows 10 yesterday. I REGRET IT!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My scroll bar on my laptop will not work and it is beyond frustrating. I cannot even find Control Panel!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had to give so much personal information to Microsoft since getting this, I am confused as to why they need my phone number and country and email.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I regret doing this, my computer takes about 15 minutes to boot up now and the internet is now very frustrating to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am by no means a computer genius, I will never figure out how to switch all the compatibility modes, I have tried they just don't work. I can't find some of the basics of My Computer, Control Panel. I have to seriously question why you have made this interface
 completely foreign to the average user. I am not familiar with any of these new titles for very common things.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since this is clearly not ready, I feel like this was only introduced to gather personal information on people because there is no way this is meant to better your Windows experience. I will never experience the internet as carefree as I once did. The scroll
 bar alone is enough to make me want to whip this thing across the room.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It says I can change my settings so my name isn't showing but how the hell do I do that? I'll just assume that my full name is being disclosed to the world. Someone should go to prison for this, you have screwed my computer and left me with no choice but
 to put my full name in a public forum. My computer runs so slow now that it will take me several hours to go through my VERY UNWANTED MICROSOFT ACCOUNT to go through all the privacy settings so I can post here without threat of identity theft.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How you have got away with this is beyond me. When *someone* responds do they get to keep my name, email and country of origin? I cannot believe I will spend so many hours trying to rectify this. I AM NOT COMPUTER GENIUS, I AM FRUSTRATED AND I FEEL LIKE
 I'VE BEEN HAD! Is this community public, does anyone from the internet respond? How will this person use my personal information? Will I now be receiving UNWANTED emails from Microsoft? I DON"T WANT A BARRAGE OF EMAILS FROM ANY CORPORATION!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Christmas is coming, I want a new computer- IT WILL BE A MAC!</p>

            <p>Hi Barbara,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>We would be glad to help you with the problem on the computer</span><span>,
</span><span>I understand it is very frustrating.</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Do you get any&nbsp;error message?</li><li>What is the make &amp; model of the laptop?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: </strong><span>I&nbsp;suggest you to set the computer in a clean boot state and check if you can upgrade. Setting the system in a clean boot state will help to identify if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue</span><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">.</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Please </span></strong><strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">follow the link to perform a clean boot:</span></strong></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span style="color: rgba(0, 102, 204, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> After you have finished clean boot, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: </span></strong><span>I would suggest you </span><span>install the latest available drivers on manufacturer's website in “<strong>Compatibility mode”</strong> and check.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Follow the steps below on how to install driver in compatibility mode:
</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><span>Download the driver from the manufacturer’s website and save it on your local disk.</span></li><li><span>Right click on the setup file of the driver and select “Properties”.</span></li><li><span>Select “Compatibility” Tab.</span></li><li><span>Place a check mark next to “Run this program in Compatibility mode” and select operating system from the drop down list.</span></li><li><span>Let the driver install and then check the functionality.</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p><span>Hope it helps. Please do let us know if you need further assistance.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Thank you.</span></span></p>

            <p>Dear Microsoft Support,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your reply. I have had so many new problems in the past few weeks those problems are old news now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The driver for my laptop scroll bar is not ready yet so I am stuck using these toggle buttons for the near future. I am frustrated by this and at times want to throw this thing against a wall. This should have never been released if things like this were
 going happen. Something so basic as scrolling is now annoying.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>My most recent problem is my computer WILL NOT recognize my wifi. THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH MY WIFI, before you begin to blame that. My husband is surfing away on his Chromebook and my son is surfing on his Mac at the same time I am struggling to connect.
 I never had this problem until Windows 10. It will recognize it only after I restart my laptop, a full RESTART. It takes forever and I hate Microsoft a little more every time I have to spend 15-20 minutes restarting this thing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I usually shut the laptop down using Shutdown but the next time I go to use the web it will not just connect to the internet I MUST restart it every time. It sees my wifi but it won't connect it tells me it cannot connect to this network, but it runs fine
 after I restart. Is this so I am forced to get your updates? I would like you to think about the time it takes to restart Windows 10, if there are updates you can add another 20 minutes or so to that time. I have no words for my frustration.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are other times where I restart the computer and it just freezes and I have to hold my power button down and that usually involves several restarts to get it to recognize my wifi. Surfing the web is just a hassle now, I pay a lot of money for wifi
 and it is money that is now totally wasted since most of my time trying to surf the web is just trying to get Windows to work. This should not be this difficult.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried to disable apps but miraculously when I do Windows freezes, I have not been able to disable ONE **** APP it refuses to let me, when I hit the disable/uninstall it does NOTHING! I suspect this will be like this until I get a new computer.
 I'm not sure how you got away with putting this out with so many problems. I'm furious Microsoft software takes up so much of my time and the most basic of tasks are now near impossible.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm a mechanic, I'd like to rip your cars apart and put them back together half **** and then tell you to spend every day figuring out how to put them back together so they run smoothly. Those power windows and power steering you've enjoyed for so long
 will now be manual until the near future, oh well. It will sport a new paint job though and have over 60+ buttons that do **** you never wanted or needed and no, you can't get rid of them. I wonder how you would feel sitting in your driveway having to restart
 your engine repeatedly until the ECM recognizes your gas line to actually drive the thing, it's on, it's running but it won't go anywhere. Some days you will have to get out and unbolt the battery and refasten it because that is just what your car does now.
 Are you very familiar with the intricacies of the automobile? Would you be able to figure this out? Put yourself in my shoes.</p>

<h2>            Resetting PIN on HP Pavilion 11k102U</h2>
                    <p>Soooo my laptop's decided my sign-in PIN is incorrect. I've tried to reset my Microsoft password as suggested but that needs to be alpha numeric whereas the PIN needs to be numeric only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried to set up a password reset disk, but the Windows key doesn't respond, as I haven't signed in with my PIN.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please tell me I don't really need to do an HP System Recovery???</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>To reset pin to can follow the below steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click on the Windows icon in the left-hand corner of your screen, you’ll open up the Start menu. Next click on
<strong>Settings</strong>. </li><li>When the Settings app opens, click on <strong>Accounts</strong>. </li><li>Click on <strong>Sign-in options</strong> on the left pane. Under the PIN section, click on the “<strong>I forgot my PIN</strong>” link.
</li><li>The password reset procedures differ between Microsoft account and local account.
</li></ol>
<p><strong>For Local Account:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>If you’re using a local account, Windows will prompt you to verify your local account password. Enter your password and click OK.
</li></ol>
<p>You’re now prompted to set up PIN again. Enter 4 digit number for your new PIN login and click
<strong>OK</strong>. If you want to remove and disable the PIN, click <strong>Cancel</strong>.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>For Microsoft Account:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>If you PIN is for a Microsoft account, you’ll see this confirmation dialog. Click
<strong>Continue</strong> to confirm that you really forgot your PIN. </li><li>Microsoft will send you a security code to validate that you are the owner of the Microsoft account. Enter the recovery email address for verification and click on
<strong>Next</strong>. </li><li>Check your email account and look for a message from Microsoft account team. Copy the security code from the mail and paste it in the Code text box. Click on
<strong>Next</strong>. </li><li>Now you can either set up a new PIN or click Cancel to disable/remove the PIN login completely.
</li></ol>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Thanks for response. Tried all tips above and no improvement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm using Norton security suite.<br />
</p>
<p>Found strange result on my setup;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Internet---------AP1---------AP2.</p>
<p>
</p><p>AP1 is cable modem+WAP</p>
<p>AP2 connected to AP1 via ethernet cable (gigabit link) - both APs support 802.11ac</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I connect wirelessly to AP1 I can only get 12M, when I connect to AP2 i get 150M!</p>
<p>When i connect via wired connection to either AP, I get 150M.</p>
<p>Any other device will get ~150M from both APs too.<br />
</p>
<p>When I connect to APs in other locations, I only get 12-15M.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows Store Error Code 0x80070426</h2>
                    <p>I am unable to buy any apps of the Windows Store. When I clicked buy and confirm, it would get stuck&nbsp;loading a pop out dialog asking me to enter my Microsoft account password. However, there is nothing for me to type. It would throw up the error code below&nbsp;after
 a while.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>"Your purchase couldn't be completed. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Something happened and your purchase can't be completed. error code : 0x80070426"</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can someone help me and tell me what's going on and how to fix it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have tried many solutions found online, all did not work.</p>
<p>Tried recovering from recovery disc and even that did not work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I did successfully buy an app (Halo: Spartan Assault)&nbsp;from a windows 8 desktop that doesn't belong to me,</p>
<p>although I used the wrong card and the purchase was revoked later.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did not try the above work around as it is not a sustainable solution and I do not have access to that desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After rumours of a near&nbsp;2015 release date for Xbox One in Singapore and many problems in Windows 8,</p>
<p>Microsoft isn't exactly a company I would put my money and time on.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will someone please provide a permanent solution that doesn't require me to recover my laptop again?</p>
<p>(I'm a student.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm already considering jumping ship to OS X/Playstation 4.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I connect tablet to any display through hdmi and windows can't detect it.</p>
<p>Reboot it, starting logo with loading circle appears on both screen,</p>
<p>but since os loads up, it starts to show only on tablet.</p>
<p>Tried to detect on desktop, update hardware changes, force duplicate or extend on second screen - no luck.</p>
<p>Hope for a help. Thank you in advance.</p>

<h2>            Pri Master Hard disk S.M.A.R.T Status Bad</h2>
                    I have a Hp mini 110 net book with a windows xp OS and I can't boot to the login window. It shows a blue screen for 1 second and it reboots. Now, it says disk error occurred and it won't pass that point. I tried to do a primary hard disk self test&nbsp; but
 it failed and it says failed element unknown. I was wondering if this hp mini has a safe mode because I can't find it. Do I need to send it back to hp to install a new hard drive and also to reinstall windows xp OS. Help-Thanks.

Hi nhim,</p>
<p>1. What is the exact error message?<br />
2. Did you make any changes prior to the issue?</p>
<p>It looks like there is a problem with the hard drive. We first recommend you to get in touch with HP to diagnose and check if the hard drive&nbsp;is working correctly.</p>
<p>Try the following steps to disable automatic restart on system failure&nbsp; and check the result.<br />
a. Start your computer and tap F8 key to see advanced boot options menu.<br />
b. Select Disable automatic restart on system failure and hit enter.<br />
c. Check if Windows starts.</p>
<p>Also try to start your computer in safe mode and check if the issue persists.</p>

            Thanks, I did review the reinstallation. Fortunately I was able to fix the problem by finding and disabling a shell extension that was causing the problem.<br />

<h2>            PowerDVD 12 Won&#39;t Launch</h2>
                    <p>After the last major windows update, my copy of PowerDVD 12 will not longer running insisting my trial version is up (I own a DVD copy of it and activated it 2 years ago), when I try to explain it to Cyberlink they keep saying PowerDVD is about to enter
 legacy support - essentially telling me off saying I need to buy a new one for support. I bought this with a externalbluray for over 100 dollars, and now I can't use it, and Leawo doesnt' have the best set up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>JUST DONT BUY CYBERLINK, PowerDirector 16 also crashes for no reason, the comapny is practically a scam at this point

<p>This will be the best thing you ever did for All audio and video playback in WMP</p>
<p>Don't waste your time with useless media players. </p>
<p>
</p><p>For all audio and video playback<br />
Install shark007 advanced codecs<br />
Close the 64bit settings app<br />
Select shark007 suggested settings in the 32bit settings app<br />
Close it out<br />
<br />
Go to:</p>
<p>Settings&gt;&gt;Apps&gt;&gt;Default Apps<br />
Select Windows Media Player for default player for audio and video.<br />
<br />
Start Menu&gt;&gt;All Apps <br />
Locate Windows Media Player, Right Click&gt;&gt;More&gt;&gt;Pin to Taskbar<br />
Restart PC<br />
<br />
Now you can play every audio and video file in WMP. Shark007 is the best in the world. Never a problem again playing files. Even DVD, BlueRay and 4K videos. It is free and no malware. Been using it on mine and customers PC's for almost 20 years since XP.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It even provides nice Thumbnail previews in Explorer, as Shark007 installs Icaros. You can access Icaros by opening up the Shark007 64bit settings app and opening up Icaros.
</p>
<p>But the default settings for it is fine as it is. </p>
<p>
</p><p>You must always open Shark007 Settings &gt;&gt; RUN AS ADMIN to make any changes.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Shark007 is located in Start Menu&gt;&gt;All Apps&gt;&gt;Shark007 Codec’s. </p>
<p>Right Click&gt;&gt;More and Run as Admin or Open File Location and send shortcut to desktop. Then right click on them and Run as Admin.</p>

<h2>            Using Windows XP sounds on YouTube.</h2>
                    Hi.<br />
<br />
I would like to use the Windows XP Startup Sound and Shutdown Sound on my YouTube videos. Can I use them? Will that infringe any copyright policies or content licenses?

<h2>            avast blocks external drive, freezes windows</h2>
                    <p>After spending hours tearing apart my Dell laptop/dock/peripherals, I pinpointed my Seagate 1T expansion drive as the culprit freezing Windows 7 Pro. I sent to Seagate for an RMA as the expansion drive had worked before, on this and another PC.</p>
<p>This weekend I tried using the drive in Safe Mode. No problem. Once I rebooted however, Windows froze again. I can be monitoring Device Manager as I plug the drive in and unplug it. Freezing happens in seconds, unfreezing as soon as I unplug the drive.</p>
<p>Fianlly, a light bulb went off. I disabled Avast antivirus. Voila. No more freezing. Windows does still ask me every time if I want to scan the drive. Problem is: How can I make Windows quit asking me to scan it, and how can I make Windows and Avast treat
 this drive like they do my other Seagate drive, by ignoring it?</p>

<br />
</font></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Thank you for posting the query in Microsoft community forums!<br />
From the problem description I understand that, the Avast blocks the external drive.<br />
</span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><br />
<font>1. Is the drive working on a different computer with Avast/third party security software?<br />
2. Do you receive any error message when the computer hangs/freezes?<br />
<br />
Try the suggestions and check if it helps:<br />
</font><b><br />
</b><font>Since the Windows is asking for scanning, you may try to scan the drive and check.<br />
Note: </font></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Any data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which means there is a potential for data loss.
</span><span style="color: rgba(103, 103, 103, 1)">For safety you can back up your data.<br />
<br />
As you have mentioned Avast is blocking the external drive so, you may need to give exception for the drive in Avast settings.<br />
<br />
You may need to get in touch with Avast support for further assistance.<br />

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Noting the details that you have provided.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that this is caused by some corrupted program file or software incompatibility. We'd like to know more about your query so we can come up with a more established workaround.
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Did you make any changes to your settings prior to this?</li><li>Did you recently install any software or updates?</li><li>Were you prompted for any error messages? If so, can you please specify?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial advice, can you try updating Windows 10. This ensures that you get the latest fix for any bugs and errors you might have.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>To check for updates now, select the <strong>Start</strong> button,&nbsp;and then go to
<strong>Settings</strong> &gt; <strong>Update &amp; security</strong> &gt; <strong>Windows Update</strong>, and select
<strong>Check for updates</strong>. If Windows Update says your device is up to date, you have all the updates that are currently available.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the problem is still there even after the Windows 10 update or if you couldn’t update the Windows, the second method you can try is Running a Disk Check on your computer. This could fix minor problems in the system files or the hard drive. To do this:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Open </span><strong>Run command</strong><span> by pressing </span><strong>Win</strong><span>+</span><strong>R</strong><span>.</span></li><li><span>Type </span><strong>cmd </strong><span>and press </span><strong>Enter</strong><span>.</span></li><li><span>The </span><strong>Command Prompt</strong><span> window will open up.</span></li><li><span>Type </span><strong>chkdsk /f</strong><span> on the command line and press
</span><strong>Enter</strong><span>.</span></li><li><span>The disk check will start now, and it will automatically fix minor problems (if any).</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Update us with the result so we can further assist you.</p>

<h2>            Windows media center won&#39;t record all shows of a series</h2>
                    
<p>I scheduled a TV series to be recorded in windows media center. I tried it first by selecting the progran from guide and then selected "Record Series". The series settings were set to "Show type": "New &amp; Rerun", "Channels": "Any Channel", "Airtime": "Anytime".</p>
<p>The result was that the first episode was set to be recorded and all other episodes were marked with an exclamation mark in the guide with "Another airing will be recorded..." information - even though they were not the same episode as the first one. I assume
 that the program information provided for the guide is incorrect, claiming that all episodes are the same even when they are not. Even so, I think the media center should record everything when I have selected "Show type - New &amp; Rerun" in the series settings
 - but it does not. I have to manually set each show to be recorded.</p>
<p>I also tried the same thing by using keywords (from TV/Recorded TV/Add recording...) with the same results. Media center will record only the first episode. Is there any way around this issue? Or better yet - when will this behavior be fixed?</p>

<p>This does not happen with all shows. Some shows are recorded correctly and some shows have this problem where only the first episode is recorded. This has happened a couple of times in the past. Currently this occurs with "Tanssii tähtien kanssa" series.
 This is being broadcast in Finland via freeview digital terrestrial (DVB-T) system. The behavior with this show is a bit different from others - this has live shows on sundays and&nbsp;reruns on mondays. Only the first sunday live show was recorded but all monday&nbsp;reruns
 have been recorded. On all other shows so far, only the first episode has been recorded but nothing after that.</p>
<p>In all cases when I have had this problem, it has existed from the beginning of the series. Only the first episode has been recorded regardless of the recording settings. If I delete the existing scheduled recording and create a new one for the show, the
 next episode will be recorded but none of the episodes after that one are recorded.</p>

<div>I can't comment on whether this is a problem with the EPG or the data provided</div>
<div>by the broadcaster as I can't check this myself. This sounds like a problem</div>

            <p>Hi!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have three series with the exact same problem. And I had it already on Vista. All other series work fine, even on the same channels as&nbsp;the series that aren't recorded. There isn't even a warning triangle in the guide for them. Yet they are in Series, and
 if I click on them there is no Record Series option, only Cancel Series and Record. So it&nbsp;obviously knows I want it recorded, but ignores it without any explanation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have also posted on The Green Button. There are complaints there since two years - but no answers. But this site is called ANSWERS.microsoft.com. It is bad manners to fob it off - and now&nbsp;TGB is run by MS anyway so that recommendation certainly does not
 hold water.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yes, the metadata is probably bad. But that is not the question. Don't fob it off. The question is this:&nbsp;The setting is called "New &amp; rerun". The Microsoft home page says that this setting will record "all shows, new shows and reruns." But it doesn't. So
 - - - why exactly is it not recording shows that it even should consider reruns? What is the third type other than new and rerun (leaving Live out of it for the moment)? Certainly you must agree that "New &amp; rerun" sounds like ALL shows? That's at least what
 I'm expecting but not finding. </p>

            This problem was reported 2½ years ago and I am sad to see that it still exists. I recently changed to Media Center and am experiencing the exact same issue.
<div><br />
<div>I want to record the Daily Show series and as far as I can see the only show Media Center is going to record is a re-run in 5 days totally skipping the new shows and re-runs prior to that show.</div>
<div><br />
<div>I have tried to re-download the EPG and cancel all recordings and it still refuses to record the series.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Please fix.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Cheers</div>
<div>Michael</div>

            Anything that is scheduled by keyword that is not currently in the guide when setup does not record&nbsp;when a program becomes available in the guide. Its almost like the scheduled programs never check the listings when the guide is updated because no program
 that was previously setup ever gets recorded.&nbsp; Once the item is in the guide the keyword search and setup&nbsp;will work but that totally defeats the&nbsp;purpose of&nbsp;being able to schedule recordings in advance.&nbsp; Microsoft please look into this issue.&nbsp; It is making
 media center useless to me.

<div>&nbsp; There isn't anyone working on Media Center enhancements any more. Microsoft</div>
<div>considers Windows Media Center a legacy app. I doubt there will be any changes</div>
<div>to the current behavior. </div>

                    I'm getting as far as "Connecting" to server, but test message is not sent &amp; no mail is downloaded/received- it times out after default 60 seconds. I've changed Port Settings to those used to access email on another PC (that machine uses Mozilla the browser
 to access email)&nbsp;Any help/support is appreciated.

<br />
I sent you a reply and I cannot find it posted. So I am resending .....<br />
A. )&nbsp;&nbsp;Error Message from #1 to #4 .....<br />
Go back to the instruction given to you, step #5<br />
What did you enter ?<br />
PO3 or POP3 ? I think you were a little careless typing.<br />
Your username ( account name ) is the first half of your e-mail address. <br />
If your address is&nbsp;&nbsp; *** Email address is removed for privacy ***, then your account name is abcdef<br />
Your password is the one GIVEN to you by your ISP, Comcast. Make sure you use that one.<br />
<br />
B. ) Error message #5 and the subsequent reply you posted .....<br />
Go back to step #11 " My server requires authentication " MUST be checked. <br />
Apparently, you did not. Hence the #5 error message.<br />
<br />
Please make the corrections. Hope you'll be ok after that.<br />
