<p>First, I downloaded songs on Guitar Hero Warriors of Rock last year and have been playing those songs fine offline, then i recently downloaded one more song recently on the game and now i can't play it or any of my downloaded songs offline. Second, i downloaded
 a game on RockBand the Beatles and i can't play it offline either.</p>

<p>Have you recently replaced your console? If you have, you would need to do a license transfer in order to have access to your DLC items offline.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>The best thing is for you to do a DRM transfer with the account that purchased the items.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live/marketplace-and-purchasing/download-content" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">support.xbox.com/.../download-content</a></p>
<p>Follow those steps provided in the link and you will be able to play your games on and offline and the other accounts will be able to play them once again.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>Once the DRM transfer has been complete, all you have to do is re-download each item again.<br />
<br />
</p>
<p>So make a list of the things that are important and you want access to and then download it. Since It's already on your hard drive, each download will just need to download the key so it will jump from 1% to 99% and then complete it's download.<br />
<br />
<br />
What was the item you recently downloaded for Rockband? (was it just tracks?) Do you know if it requires online access? (if it's a game mode)</p>

<p>no i haven't replaced my console, but i &nbsp;have my profile on multiple consoles, and i have recently done i license transfer to one of the consoles, not the one i usually play rockband and other music games on, but i did the transfer before i downloaded the
 songs, so that might be why i can't play the newly downloaded songs, and it was just one song</p>
<p>thank you for the help</p>

<h2>            Skype for Business Can&#39;t Sign in - Appears to missing its Skype for Business License</h2>
                    <p>Good Afternoon,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 6 users that can no longer log into Skype for Business.&nbsp; All for different reasons.&nbsp; All users have Windows 7 Professional and all were using Skype for Business for over a year.&nbsp; It started almost 3 months ago with the first user.&nbsp; Then it got to
 losing one user every week or two, and all were under difference circumstances.&nbsp; All other Office 365 applications work fine and can log in with no errors.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1st user changed her password and then started receiving the Error</p>
<p>2nd user received a new PC and fresh install of Office 365, could not log into skype</p>
<p>3rd user Logged off her PC for the weekend and on the Monday, logged back in and Skype would not log in</p>
<p>4th user changed her password, could no longer log into Skype</p>
<p>5th user received new PC with fresh install of Office 365, could not log into Skype</p>
<p>6th user Changed her password, could no longer log into Skype</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error that they all receive is "Your account appears to be missing its Skype for Business License"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had a ticket in with Microsoft since the first user 3 months ago and it is still not resolved.&nbsp; It has been escalated to higher levels of support (so I'm being told) and the latest was that it is being investigated by the Skype for Business engineers.&nbsp;
 I have sent all the Skype logs multiple times and we are getting no where.&nbsp; Has anyone else experienced this??</p>
<p>

</span><span>Your account appears to be missing its Skype for Business License”, have you tried to run Office 365 PowerShell: (Get-MsolUser -UserPrincipalName user@domain.com).Licenses.ServiceStatus to check if provisioningstatus of MCOSTANDARD is

<p>I had not tried that PowerShell command.&nbsp; One of the Techs that had my ticket at one point had tried something with the Provisioning and it was good.&nbsp; These users can use Skype when online they go online using OWA and clicking the little skype button.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did just try the command just for this reply and it did come back as "success" for MCOSTANDARD.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Hi Alna,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft has finally found an answer as to why this is happening to my users.&nbsp; They don't have a fix, but they know why it is happening.&nbsp; I work for an organization that works with the local city government.&nbsp; We are on the city's network.&nbsp; Since we are
 not a city entity, we purchase our own software, hardware, etc.&nbsp; Since we are on the city's network, when we log on to our PC's, our network credentials&nbsp; are "username"@domain.gov.&nbsp; When we fire up Skype for business, even though we use our organization account
 info which looks like "*** Email address is removed for privacy ***, Skype recognizes the domain.gov credentials in our profile and tries to use that too.&nbsp; [<strong>Domain name was removed by moderator for protecting your privacy</strong>]</p>
<p>
</p><p>It makes no sense to me why it would try to do this, since we have our own account info in the skype login box....&nbsp; When we provide the login credentials, why does it still try to use something different.....&nbsp;

<p>Hi Gerald,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for providing me the feedback on your issue.&nbsp; Sounds like you still have&nbsp;the&nbsp; Skype login issue&nbsp;or did Microsoft provided you a workaround?&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agreed, make no sense for Skype to be using the computer credential where you specifically&nbsp;provided the application credential to log in. Unless you have single sign-on configured to override the login process.</p>

<p>To set up single sign on is at best a workaround. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Skype for Business should work with your office 365 credentials and regardless of location.
</p>
<p>Isn't that the point of cloud computing?</p>
<p>

<h2>            G&#58; drive &#40;local disk&#41; is displayed but is not recognized</h2>
                    I am using a 64-bit windows 7 pc that has the following drives being used for a variety of storage: C, G, and M. &nbsp;All of these are considered local disks and each has a capacity of roughly 700GB and the used space within each varies. &nbsp;However, after booting
 up this morning I noticed that the G drive, formerly named 'GridData', was renamed 'local disk' and now has 0 GB capacity and it is as if the drive never existed in the first place. &nbsp;What could have caused this to occur and how do I restore this disk? &nbsp;I have
 tried a system restore using a restore point from a week ago and was unsuccessful. &nbsp;I have found very little info pertaining to this drive on the web and am in need of some other options. &nbsp;Please help!!

<h2>            Windows 10 download taking a very long time</h2>
                    My screen has been showing that Windows 10 has been downloading in the background for more than 24 hours.&nbsp; I think that the download has failed and I need to know how to get out of it and start over.

            Could this be related to a Windows update? I uninstalled the last update which was around the time this all started but it didn't seem to help. The problem persists.&nbsp;

    <title>Headphones do not override default sound - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ericf10  say:</h3>
<h2>            Headphones do not override default sound</h2>
                    I updated my sound card drivers to Window 10 on my laptop.&nbsp; I must select a default playback device - either (the onboard) speakers or headphones.&nbsp; If I select the speakers and plug in my headphones, I cannot get sounds to play back unless I go back and
 change the default device and restart Windows Media Player.&nbsp; I never had this issue in previous Windows versions.&nbsp; Is there a way for the headset jack to automatically detect when plugged in for playback in Win 10?

            <p><span><span>Hi Eric,</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting the query.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>The issue might be occurring because the headphones might be disabled on the computer.
</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 1:</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you have not checked for the disabled device, let’s check if the Headphones is disabled. Follow the steps and make it enable:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a) Press <strong>Windows</strong> and <strong>X key </strong>and select
<strong>Control Panel</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b) Click on <strong>Sound</strong> icon.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c) Navigate to <strong>Recording tab</strong>. <strong>Right click
</strong>on an empty area and click on <strong>Show Disabled Devices</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d) You will now see the disabled audio devices with the<strong> arrow pointing
</strong>down on them.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>NOTE</strong>: These audio devices will vary depending on the installed audio card or chip you have.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>e)<strong> Right click </strong>on each listed disabled audio device that you want to enable and click on
<strong>Enable</strong>.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>f) You will now see the&nbsp;headphones device icon getting enabled. You can now
<strong>change the properties </strong>settings on these audio devices to how you want them.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><strong>Method 2:</strong></span><span><strong>Uninstall and Reinstall the Sound Drivers.</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 1</strong><strong>:</strong> Uninstall the Sound Drivers.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>a. Press <strong>“Windows Logo”</strong> + <strong>“X”</strong> keys on the keyboard.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>b. Click on “<strong>Device Manager</strong>” from that list.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>c. Search for the Sound Drivers from the device list,<strong> right click
</strong>on it and then select “<strong>Uninstall</strong>”. On the un-installation window, if you have an option: “<strong>Delete the driver software for this device</strong>” you may select that and then remove the corrupted drivers from the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>d. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete it and then <strong>
restart</strong> the computer if prompted.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>After the restart, please go ahead with the next steps to install the latest drivers and check if that resolves the issue.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Update Driver Software from the Manufacturer’s website:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span>Step 2: </span></strong><span>Go to the manufacturer’s website and search for the latest Windows 10 drivers available for the&nbsp;Sound Drivers and then install it by following the instructions given in the website.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope this information was helpful and do let us know if you need further assistance. We will be glad to assist.</span></span></p>

</p><p><span><span>Tell us more about your concern.</span></span><span> Does it affect all exe files? Has it always been like this before? Since it's an executable file, it could be conflicting with Windows Firewall. Temporarily disable it and observe if it will
 make a difference.<br />

<p>Hi Rob2e,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Tell us more about your concern.</span></span><span> Does it affect all exe files? Has it always been like this before? Since it's an executable file, it could be conflicting with Windows Firewall. Temporarily disable it and observe if it will
 make a difference.<br />
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Let us know how it goes.</span></span><span> </span></p>
</blockquote>
It only seems to be some particular .exe files and turning off Windows Firewall does not improve the speed.

<p><span>Refer the link to check the compatibility status of the device:

    <title>Is there still reason to use standard user account&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> art unknown  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there still reason to use standard user account&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Suppose I'm the only user of the computer. Suppose I have User Account Control activated. Is there or are there still reasons to create and use standard user account for everyday work? As far as I understand, with User Account Control active I have the permissions
 of a standard user even if I'm logged on as an administrator. If I use administrator account for everyday work does User Account Control give me EXACTLY the same level of protection from viruses and malware and from making accidental system-wide changes as
 standard user account with active UAC? [I don't imply that UAC protects me from viruses and malware. I use proper antivirus software for that.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I'm asking is that some legitimate modern programs still require administrator password (when you have one for administrator account) to run them in standard user. I suspect that some legitimate modern programs are unable to install updates in
 standard user even if I enter administrator password. And some programs have limited functionality in standard user account. Last but not least, it's an extra work to set up and administer two accounts for one user of the computer. This is all quite annoying.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I'm wondering what's the point in using standard user account for everyday work or am I missing something?</p>

<p>
</p><p>FWIW, I read the summary of a study recently (I'm sorry, cannot find the link) that found that removing administrator rights reduced malware, adware and virus infections by 65%. I wish I had the link to that but it was on the internet so it must be true

<p>Thank you for your reply. I'm well aware of all the everyday hazard associated with using the computer in this day and age. I know how to use and properly configure antivirus software, firewall, user accounts and how to run programs with administrative permissions.
 And I still use standard user account for everyday work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still, the question that I don't seem to find an answer to [in you reply too] is... "If I use administrator account for everyday work does User Account Control give me EXACTLY the same level of protection from viruses and malware and from making accidental
 system-wide changes as standard user account with active UAC?" In other words, do I get the same level of protection when I use administrator account with UAC enabled and when I use standard account with UAC enabled? Is it true that UAC turns an administrator
 account into what is know as a protected administrator account, basically, an administrator account that runs with standard user account privileges? Or does standard user account with UAC enabled gives me yet higher level of protection over administrator account
 with UAC enabled?</p>

 eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot. You must log on to the computer as
 an administrator to be able to perform a clean boot. Your computer may temporarily lose some functionality when you perform a clean boot. When you start the computer normally, the functionality returns. However, you may receive the original error message,
 or experience the original behavior if the problem still exists. If the computer is connected to a network, network policy settings may prevent you from following these steps.

            Method one refuses to work, method two wont give me the option of changing from manual to automatic in the startup type, and method three doesn't give me a manage option after I search for "Computer" after I have done a clean boot. Win 10 upgraded without
 issue on my Lenovo laptop witch was slower and had less memory then my Asus, so what's going on, you have a problem with Intel processors now?

            Hi RF# has your system recently crashed or Blue Screened?
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

<h2>            Deathrow Sequel</h2>
                    
<p>I would love to see a sequel to this game. It was one of, if not the only game to blend sports gamers with war/action gamers. I think with the trends of the past few years of team-based war games and sports games, that a well made, well advertised sequel
 could do exceedingly well. Is there anyone else out there that agrees with me, or am I by myself on this one?</p>

<h2>            windows 10.1 new window &#34;transparent&#34;</h2>
                    <p>I updated to Windows 10.1 back when it first came out and have had a recurring graphical glitch when I open new windows. (see below. and no, it's not the sideways screen, that just happens when i upload these pics)&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7222d2f9-75bc-4f8e-ad69-f433898a6d40" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/7222d2f9-75bc-4f8e-ad69-f433898a6d40" /></a></p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4d219066-2aac-45ba-a059-b8067cf3f366" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/4d219066-2aac-45ba-a059-b8067cf3f366" /></a>Apologies
 for the large pics, but it is what it is<br />
Anyway, as you can see, when the window (the replace/skip window in this case) opens, it remains transparent. When I click and drag it, it's like it leaves an afterimage of sorts inside the window. This doesn't happen every time I open a window, and though
 I had this problem shortly after updating, it seemed to go away on its own for a little while, but, lo and behold, it's back. It's accompanied by a ridiculous amount of lag as far as loading things on my computer. &nbsp;Sometimes it happens after using a program
 (GIMP) that can use a fair amount of memory while in use and sometimes lags. I know it doesn't have to do with the display adapter because I have flip-flopped from Microsoft Basic Display Driver to an Intel driver, both having been fully updated.<br />
<br />
Here are my computer specs:<br />
<br />
Processor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-3337U CPU @ 1.80GHz 1.80 GHz<br />
Installed memory (RAM): 4.00 GB (3.88 GB usable)<br />
System type: 64-bit Operating System, x64-based processor<br />
<br />
<br />
It's a Dell XPS 14, if that makes any difference.How do I stop this problem? To be frank, it's a nuisance</p>

    <title>Reinstalling WSUS on SBS2011 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ryan.irish  say:</h3>
<h2>            Reinstalling WSUS on SBS2011</h2>
                    <p>I recently discovered that our WSUS was not functioning, nor could I access it in any fashion, mmc, admin tools, server manager, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was suggested that I uninstall the role and reinstall...that has not gone well.&nbsp; I tried to remove the role via the server manager and received an error:</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/27a2c8fd-2502-41fe-b94a-acbfbe2dffc8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/27a2c8fd-2502-41fe-b94a-acbfbe2dffc8" height="453" width="612" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>I then tried to uninstall via programs/features.&nbsp; WSUS was listed, but the uninstall failed with the 'may already be uninstalled' error.&nbsp; I then tried again to remove the role...no deal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then found the following steps to remove manually:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><em>First, determine the application’s product code GUID.&nbsp; You can do this by looking in the registry at

\\HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall.&nbsp; You will need to cycle through the subkeys until you find the one with the correct name in the DisplayName value.&nbsp; Make note of the subkey; that is the GUID.&nbsp; To save you the trouble (in case
 you’re working with the same version as me), the GUID for WSUS 3.0 SP2 is {2C0D7E35-EE6E-4DC7-BA13-2C68AEDEB59D}</em></li><li><em>Now, at an administrator command prompt, using <span>
MSIZAP.exe</span> (which is included in the Windows SDK), clear the install entry:</em><br />
<em>MSIZAP T {&lt;GUID&gt;}</em></li><li><em>Stop the WSUS services:</em><br />
<em>net stop wsusservice</em><br />
<em>net stop wsuscertserver</em><br />
<em>NOTE: If your WSUS install is truly broke, you may just get message saying the services are not online.&nbsp; In that case, just proceed to the next step.</em></li><li><em>Delete the WSUS services:</em><br />
<em>sc delete wsusservice</em><br />
<em>sc delete wsuscertserver</em></li><li><em>Detele the Windows Internal Database:</em><br />
<em>msiexec /x {CEB5780F-1A70-44A9-850F-DE6C4F6AA8FB} callerid=<span>ocsetup.exe</span></em></li><li><em>Delete the WSUS program folder: C:\Program Files\Update Service (this may vary if you’re using an x64 OS)</em></li><li><em>Open IIS manager and delete the WSUS virtual directory</em></li><li><em>The role will still show in server manager, but can be reinstalled using the WSUS installer package.</em></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>I made it to step 5, but I'm leery to proceed as I don't know where that GUID came from.&nbsp; The value listed in step 1 did not match my environment, so I have no reason to assume the GUID listed in step 5 matches.&nbsp; As there is no explanation on how to find/verify
 that ID, and I'm not even sure I want to delete any internal databases, does anyone have advice on how to proceed?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Or, assuming that this SBS is now FUBAR'd, and a reinstall is NOT happening, is there a decent alternative to WSUS outside of M$ that anyone can recommend?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>
<p />

<h2>            DirectX V9.29.1974 and AMD GPU drivers won&#39;t install</h2>
                    <p>Hi, I just upgraded to Windows 10 from Windows 8.1. I love Windows 10 so far, but there's one MAJOR problem I'm experiencing. I can't install DirectX or my AMD Radeon HD 6xxx Series PCIe.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>When I try to install DirectX, I get this error:</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"A cabinet file necessary for installation cannot be trusted. Please verify the Cryptographic Services are enabled and the cabinet file certificate is valid."</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to look up a solution to THAT error but when I opened up Command Prompt in Administrator mode, I got a lot of errors and some pop-ups saying that it succeeded. The Cryptographic service is on as well. I checked task manger and the services program
 from the administrator tools.</p>
<p>The link to the DirectX I'm trying to install is here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Now onto the AMD Drivers. When I try to install the GPU drivers for the AMD card, AMD Catalyst AutoDetect only says there were error messages and that I need to view the log to see them. When I opened the log, this is what came up.</p>
<p>
</p><p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ae823ee8-9f84-4465-94b2-a664116ecb73" /></p>
<p>
</p><p><br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help on this would be very helpful as this is my gaming computer and both DirectX AND the GPU drivers are SUPER important to gaming.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>My computer specs are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>8GB RAM</li><li>500GB HDD</li><li>AMD Radeon HD 6950</li><li>Intel i5 3.5GHz</li></ul>

</p><p>Hello Sarah, thanks for the help. Sadly, none of these worked and I already tried checking the Cryptographic settings to make sure it was on automatic and it was. I think I may have found the problem, however. I did some research and these problems are common
 with people who had a corrupt Cryptographic Service. I ran a CBS scan and it said it found corrupt files it was unable to fix. I looked at the log and There was so much stuff in it that I was unable to find out the problem. I'm hoping maybe you or some other
 people could help look through it. It's around a 15MB log file which is pretty huge considering it doesn't contain any code in it just words of a scan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hello again, I was able to fix this but not in the way you said. I refreshed Windows 10 so it can reinstall the Cryptographic Service. I guessed the service was corrupt so I just decided to refresh it and now I have all my drivers and DirectX all installed
 without a single problem!</p>

You should switch to a third party solution such as Macrium Reflect (Free).
Learn more: https://www.groovypost.com/howto/create-windows-10-system-image-best-free-alternatives/
Details:
Let’s start off with Macrium Reflect (Free) (https://www.macrium.com/reflectfree). Macrium provides a small click to run the installer, but I chose the offline installer, which required finding the download agent (http://updates.macrium.com/reflect/v5.0/reflectdl.exe); this downloads the full installer at around 800 MBs. Included are a collection of preinstallation environment tools based on Microsoft’s Windows Image deployment solutions.
Setup was quick and easy but needed a restart to complete changes made to the system.
The Macrium Reflect interface is a bit more jam-packed than what you would normally find in Windows 10. But this a powerful alternative offering a range of options for creating and managing backups. Macrium integrates heavily with Windows—examples include support for attaching and browsing backups; boot image backups in Hyper-V; generating PowerShell scripts to automate backups; creating batch files and of course, scheduling backups. You can also find handy options such as cloning and standard file and folder backup.
For these instructions, we are going to focus on image backups. Similar to the System Image backup (https://www.groovypost.com/howto/create-windows-10-system-image-backup/) feature in Windows 10 and previous versions, this lets you create a replica of your current installation state. You can be granular with your backups by choosing only the partitions you want to save as part of your image.
To create your first image, click the menu Create an image of the partition(s) required to backup and restore Windows.
Under Destination, click the Browse button, then point to your external drive where you want to store the backup, create a new folder, select it then click OK. Click Next to Continue.
 
This phase of the wizard lets you create a Backup plan if you want. It’s optional, but lets you choose different methods of backups which include full, incremental and differential. For now, I am going to choose a schedule just to make things simple. I recommend you review the retention rules to save on disk space. Users can retain a number of backups using any method; this can quickly eat up disk space over time, so I will reduce the amount for each to about two. Click Next to Continue.
What are Incremental and Differential Backups and which should you choose?
A full backup gives you one backup file that restores your entire system up to that point. Full backups are a comprehensive way to go, but they take a long time to create and if you have multiple backup images, you end up duplicating a lot of the same data. Incremental and differential backups are two ways to address this inefficiency.
Incremental Backup – This maintains a regular backup in addition to changes that have been made since the last full or incremental backup. Incremental backups are often preferred because they use less disk space; not to mention, they are faster, too. So, if you created new Word documents since your last backup, those are added to the backup.
So, let’s say Backup A is a full backup you made on Monday. On Wednesday, you can make an incremental Backup B which only includes the new data since Backup A. On Friday, you can make Backup C, which only includes the new data since Backup B. In this way, you are storing no duplicate data. The downside is that if you want to restore your image, you have to use all three backup files: Backup A, Backup B, and Backup C.
Differential Backup – This creates a backup of the differences made since the last full backup. So, if you made changes to a few Microsoft Word documents, those changes are applied to the backup. A disadvantage is that differential backups use more space, since you need to maintain a full backup in addition to changes since you created your last backup.
How is that different than an incremental backup? Let’s say you make a full Backup A on Monday. On Wednesday, Backup B contains the differences since Backup A was made. On Friday, Backup C contains the differences since Backup A.  In this way, if you want to do a restoration, you just need two files: the last full backup and the last differential backup. This means you only ever need two files, compared to the incremental backup method. The downside is that, as you can imagine, your differential backup image file gets bigger and bigger as the time since your last full backup increases. And after awhile, you end up with a quite a bit of duplicated data across your various differential backups.
So, which should you use? Either one is fine. It all depends on how much storage space and time you have. Incremental backups are faster and take less space during the backup phase. Differential backups take more time and space during the backup phase but are easier during the restoration phase.
Review the image summary to ensure you chose the right options. If you maintain a dual boot configuration, make sure each partition is checked as part of your backup. Click Finish to begin the backup.
Click OK to start the backup immediately.
As with all image backups, it will take some time, so, sit back and relax as your image is saved. Click Close after your image is created.
Restoring Your Macrium Image
There are multiple ways to restore a backup. You can start the restore process from within a running installation of Windows 10 with Macrium already installed. But in most cases, restoring an image would take place after booting into a recovery environment similar to System Image in Windows 10.
Create Rescue Media
One important task you should complete after creating your image is to create rescue media, which will facilitate restoration of the image. This is perfect for scenarios where your computer won’t boot or you installed a new empty hard disk. Click the Other Tasks menu then click Create Rescue Media.
This will start the create bootable rescue media wizard. Remember, as we mentioned earlier, Macrium downloads a full installer at around 800 MBs. This is where the preinstallation environment tools based on Microsoft’s Windows Image deployment solutions are used. Macrium adds its own recovery tools to facilitate restoration of the image when you boot from it. Click Next.
You can add drivers in advance for hardware that might not be supported by the restored image. Click the Update Driver button to do so then point to the source. This can minimize the chances of Windows 10 not booting on new hardware; especially if you are changing motherboards.
Depending on the architecture of your Windows 10 image, you can choose either a 32 or 64-bit (https://www.groovypost.com/howto/windows-10-edition-architecture-build-your-install/) recovery image. For this particular case, I am restoring a 64 bit Windows 10 installation, so I will choose that. Click Next to begin the creation.
Bootable media can be prepared using a blank DVD or USB drive or you can create a bootable ISO image instead. Choose your desired method, then click Finish.
Restore Image – Macrium Reflect
Configure your computer to boot from the installation media (https://www.groovypost.com/howto/bios-uefi-setup-guide-boot-from-cd-dvd-usb-drive-sd-card/) on the target computer. Attach your external drive where the image is stored, then power it on.
Under the Restore tab in Macrium, click the menu, Browse for an image or backup file to restore.
Browse to the image file, select it then click Open.
Click Select a disk to restore to… then click the selected image that appears. Click Next to begin the restoration.
After the image is successfully restored, click File &gt; Exit to reboot.
That’s pretty much all that’s involved in preparing a system image of your Windows 10 installation using Macrium Reflect. Macrium feels a little complex and overwhelming at first, but once you familiarize yourself with it, you should feel comfortable using it in no time. If you still want something a bit more user-friendly, then check out EaseUS Todo Backup Free.
