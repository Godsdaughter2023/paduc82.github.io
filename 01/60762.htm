            I am curious to know if there has been a solution to this yet. I have a Fresh install of Windows 8 64 bit on my Toshiba Satellite C655 with 4GB of RAM (laptop is a little over a year old bran new). After the most recent update from windows my windows 8
 apps cannot connect to the internet and I haven't found a solution worth trying since it seems it was a Microsoft update that caused the problem, not on my end. I have not installed third party firewall or anything like it. Please help if you have a solution.

            also check that if you have not set the pc to log without the email password of your pc that you registered your email and if so you can select that choice log with your email or you can manually set each app to log and i think like when i did the xbox
 it asked for email log <br />

            Well my apps are working now after a restart. I made no other changes. I'm not sure why they work now. I'm not expecting this fix to be permanent, but I am happy for the time being.

            Ya, it seems to be a problem with "proxy server" stuff. I have X3 Watch&nbsp;installed&nbsp;which&nbsp;utilizes&nbsp;a proxy server and it created the same problem, but as soon as I turned it off, my apps started working again. MICROSOFT, FIX YOUR SOFTWARE! :P

            I had the same exact problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is now solved!&nbsp; I went to Windows Update and found there were 12 updates and I did see .net was there.&nbsp; I downloaded and installed the updates right then and once I restarted it was solved!&nbsp; Hope that helps someone.

<h2>            Windows Defender Real Time Protection Blocks Loading Websites in Vivaldi Browser</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So I have this problem - i visit some local news sites i visit always, and windows defender real time protection doesn't let them load in Vivaldi browser. They open normally in all three of the major browsers. When i turn off real time protection, the sites
 load normally in Vivaldi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What can be done about it? It doesn't want to load, let's say, one in ten sites.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

    <title>Unable to retrieve info about disk &#38; virtual disk service - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nugen  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to retrieve info about disk &#38; virtual disk service</h2>
                    I've been researching the entire day for the solution to this irritating problem!<br />
I am upgrading my Eee PC (it has the system requirements) from Windows XP Home Edition - Service Pack 3 to Windows 7 Starter.<br />
Everytime I attempt to install the OS, this message always pops up:<br />
<span>
<span>
<p>Windows could not retrieve information about the disks on this computer.<br />
<br />
I've found that a lot of people have solved this by enabling the Virtual Disk Service and setting it&nbsp;to Automatic. My problem is, is that I don't such a service on my computer. The VDS is NOT LISTED.
<br />
I've tried googling on how to install the service but I simply can't find the answer.<br />
<br />
If anyone has any solution to my problem, that would be greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>Some of the songs are on video format and i can't sync them to my mp3 player like the regular mp3's.</p>

<p>
<span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Which operating system is installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>Windows Media Audio (WMA) songs that are downloaded from the iMesh may be protected by DRM (Digital Rights Management), which
 prevents you from converting the file into an MP3 that can be played on any computer or portable media player. In order to convert protected WMA files to an MP3 you may burn them to a CD in Windows Media Player and then rip the CD back into Windows Media Player
 as MP3 files.</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the following links to on how to burn the CD using Windows Media player.</span></p>

<p><span>You may also use any third party music converter software in order to convert the WMA to MP3 format. You may use your favorite

            Hi Aida
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type in at the prompt then hit Enter
<br />
<br />rundll32.exe pnpclean.dll,RunDLL_PnpClean /DRIVERS /MAXCLEAN
<br />
<br />Hit Enter on your keyboard
<br />
<br />Exit command prompt
<br />
<br />Restart
<br />
<br />Another option is to download the latest Surface Pro recovery image and use it to reinstall Windows 10:
<br />
<br />Here are steps to do so:
<br /><a href="https://www.cocosenor.com/articles/surface/create-a-usb-recovery-drive-for-surface.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.cocosenor.com/articles/surface/crea...</a>
<br />
<br />This of course means backing up your data and preparing to reinstall Windows.

<h2>            An error keeps on popping up in my computer and it&#39;s getting annoying</h2>
                    <p>There's this one error called ''Common Language Runtime Debugging Services'' which has the following content: ''Application has generated an exception that cannot be handled.'' Now, i didn't bother to put in any process id and thread id because it changes
 every time it pops up. It's just getting annoying at this point and i can't watch videos or browse through the internet properly. Also, this error hadn't popped up until just today as if it just picked a random day to annoy me with the constant pop ups.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does any one of you know how to solve this problem? Please do tell me because i'm desperate to get this error out of my screen so i can finally watch videos in peace.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that there's a certain program or browser extension causing this error to occur. For us to better assist you, we'd like to know the following details:
</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>When browsing, does the error occur on a specific web page or specific browser?</li><li>What browser are you using?</li><li>Does the error also occur if you are launching a program?</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>As an initial troubleshooting step, we suggest that you perform the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Check if you have installed a browser add-on that can cause the issue and remove it.</li><li>Delete temporary Internet files by following the steps <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/260897/how-to-delete-the-contents-of-the-temporary-internet-files-folder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still persists, we suggest that you boot up to <strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/17419/windows-7-advanced-startup-options-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Safe Mode with Networking</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Performing a Google search on the error, then clicking the Images link there are lots of results and in all of them the error message box seems to contain the name of some program in the title bar of the error message - like WPALauncher.exe in this example:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f5b803e-8d82-4646-b17d-00c9255af8ff?upload=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0f5b803e-8d82-4646-b17d-00c9255af8ff?upload=true" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Since you did not include the name of the program in your topic does that mean there is no program name in the title bar of the error message?</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you want to include a screenshot of your error message thins link tells you how to do that:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_other-windows_programs/how-to-include-a-screenshot-in-your-post/2594b08e-32a3-476a-85a6-b021181be7e4">How to include a screenshot in your post</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>You can also provide more information about your system by doing this:</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is your system make and model or is it something assembled from separately purchased components?<br />
<br />
If the system is a Dell what is the Service Tag Number?<br />
<br />
If the system is an HP what is the serial number?<br />
<br />
If the system is an Toshiba what is the serial number?<br />
<br />
Click Start, Run and in the box enter:<br />
<br />
msinfo32<br />
<br />
Click OK, and when the System Summary info appears, click Edit, Select All (Ctrl-A), Copy (Ctrl-C) and then paste (Ctrl-V) the information back here in your next reply.<br />
<br />
For video device and driver information, expand the Components, click Display, click Edit, Select All, Copy and then paste the information back here.<br />
<br />
There will be some personal information (like System Name and User Name), and whatever appears to be private information to you, just delete it from the pasted information.<br />

    <title>Large black rectangle on middle of Display Surface 2 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> brycetowle  say:</h3>
<h2>            Large black rectangle on middle of Display Surface 2</h2>
                    <p>I recently had a battery issue with a Microsoft Surface 2, so I traded it in and received a brand new surface 2. I've used this new surface for about twenty minutes, and while I was browsing the App Store, a large black rectangle appeared on the screen.
 The rectangle is vertically oriented, stretching from top (surface with lock button) to bottom (surface on which a keyboard is connected. It stretches about two inches across, with the right-most border on the exact middle of the screen. The mouse moves behind
 the rectangle and the touch screen still works well.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What could have caused this? Should I take it back or can I fix this??</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This note from that page may be of interest (I bolded the important sentence).:</p>
&nbsp;
<p>"All versions of Money Plus sold at retail and online, required users to perform an “Online Activation” step in order to keep using the product, even if online services had already expired. Online Activation was also required for every machine onto which
 Money Plus was installed. Now <strong>that Money Plus is no longer available for purchase, the online activation step will eventually become unnecessary and unsupported.</strong> This Money Plus Sunset package is targeted at removing the activation dependency.
 There are two versions of Money Plus Sunset. The Money Plus Sunset Deluxe version is meant to replace Premium, Deluxe, and Essentials versions of Money Plus. The Money Plus Sunset Home and Business version is meant to replace Money Plus Home and Business.
 Please note that Money Plus Sunset versions come preconfigured with: · No online services (no online quotes, no bill payment, no statement downloads initiated by Money, no data sync with MSN Money online services, etc…) · No support services (support services
 are limited to online self-help only, see Money Plus Sunset EULA and Microsoft’s Support Lifecycle pages for more details) · No need to activate the product"</p>

<p>Hey robstudent,</p>
<p>This problem is caused due to left over broken start-up entry or a virus in registry which means there are some entries in windows run which are pointing to incorrect values. Follow these steps to manually correct those values in the registry.</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> This section, method, or task contains steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For
 added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then, you can restore the registry if a problem occurs. For more information about how to back up and restore the registry, click the windows help article below.</p>
<p><strong>Back up the registry<br />
</strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Back-up-the-registry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Back-up-the-registry</strong></a><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;Open Start Menu &gt;&gt; Run and type regedit and press Enter. <br />
<br />
2.&nbsp;Navigate to the following registry path<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run<br />
and <br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run</p>
<p>Note: Verify that all the values in these keys do not contain any incorrect, incomplete, or null entries (such as "").</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;An incorrect entry in the following registry value has been confirmed to cause the behavior described above:
<br />
<br />
Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run<br />
Value: ActiveMovie File Extensions<br />
Value Type: REG_SZ<br />
Value Data: ActMovie.exe /Check</p>
<p>If the value data for this entry is null or appears in Registry Editor as quotation marks, you may experience the problem described above. To correct the problem, change the value data to match the entry above or delete the ActiveMovie File Extensions value.</p>
<p>You can resolve this behavior by deleting the Remainder value that has "" next to it is in the following registry key:
<br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\Current Version\Run<br />
<br />
4.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are uncertain whether an entry is incorrect or incomplete, you may want to delete all entries other than the default Windows entry. The following entry to run the System Tray is the only required Windows default entry:
<br />
<br />
Key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run<br />
Value: SystemTray<br />
Value Type: REG_SZ<br />
Value Data: SysTray.exe</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;Restart you computer once you’re through with the steps. Check if the error disappears during startup.<br />
<br />
If you still face the same problem, boot to safe mode and let us know if the problem recurs in safe mode.<br />

<h2>            Microsoft Fix It encountered an unexpected problem and cannot continue.</h2>
                    <p>I was having trouble with updates. So much so that I was tired of the crashes, hangs, restarts, etc. I re-formatted my drive and reinstalled Windows 7 Professional SP1 64 from my disk. Re-installed all the drivers, programmes, registered with Microsoft and
 got authenticated. Whoopee! Still wont update. So I decided to run the Fix It but no. Apparently it encounters a user induced break point. During the installation I did not amend or adjust any settings and therefore am innocent I tell you! Ahem, I have searched
 Microsoft and the internet for a solution but nothing appears to work. Anyone know of a Fix It to Fix a Fix it?&nbsp; When I run updates (which is why I sought help in the first place) I get error 800B0100 which does not help very much at all. Can't say I am that
 impressed with Microsoft at the moment but maybe someone there will be able to put that right. I pasted a screen shot of the error below but I bet its not here once I submit.</p>

            <p>Hi Anil</p>
<p>
</p><p>Firstly thank you for suggesting a solution to my problem, I appreciate you taking the time to try to assist me. Regrettably it did not work. I followed your instructions and the Fixit did allegedly manage to check for updates on line. Pressing next took
 me to updates where I got the 800B0100 error. </p>
<p>I then followed all the command line instructions , one by one, remembering to press enter after each command entry.
</p>
<p>To check I had the most up-to-date updater I followed the link and let the automatic Fixit have a go. It retuned :</p>
<p>Script Diagnostics Native&nbsp;Host has encountered a user defined break point.</p>
<p>this then flipped to:</p>
<p>Script Diagnostics Native Host stopped working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed all the instructions again (all those command line entries) but this time did not check the update version but completed a restart with a clean boot. Guess what! Yep Good old 800B0100.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So after&nbsp;90 minutes of tinkering I still cannot get updates. I still cannot run the automated fixits on offer and I have no idea how I have defined a break point. Although I do feel that I am coming closer to a breakdown point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, what next, I have recently formatted my c drive and re;installed a clean version of Windows 7 Professional 64 because I had a crashing and updating problem before.
</p>
<p>Although I have registered my product key and the response from Microsoft was as expected do you think there could be a corruption here and Microsoft is treating me as an unauthorised user? I did purchase a Dell pc with OS but have completely rebuilt it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway I await your next set of instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Nigel</p>

            <p>Hi Again Anil</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for coming back to me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) I have already mentioned that I cannot run the automated Fix It. I get a message stating "Scripted Diagnostics Native Host has encountered a user-defined break point" It then tells me that Scripted Diagnostics Host has stopped working"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have a solution to this problem? This was an error I received previously before I re-installed windows and it has recurred. I had little involvement with the loading of the OS certainly I was not asked to add any break points. Refer to my original
 post for more information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2) I previously ran the readiness tool prior to re-installing and it did nothing to solve the problem. I ran it yesterday before posting this request for help. It did complete and told me what would and would not run under Windows 8. Sadly it did not cure
 the updating problem. </p>
<p>
</p><p>3) I used the SFC command as an administrator (and also signed on as the hidden administrator) before re-installing W Pro 64 and it did say some files were corrupt. It appears it often says this.&nbsp; As soon as the installation was complete I ran SFC /scannow
 out of curiosity.&nbsp;this time it again stated some files were corrupt so figured that this was a standard response.&nbsp; I have just run it again and it reports corrupt files, some of which it cannot repair. If I can get access to the CBS log I will post it below.
 No I will have to try and access as the hidden administrator as I am denied access.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No doing very well are we? What do you suggest now?</p>

            <p>Hi Again, again Anil</p>
<p>
</p><p>You may recall that I reformatted my drive and reinstalled Windows to cure the updating issue, but regrettably the problem and that of User defined Break points continued. Well I did an In Place Upgrade as suggested. It failed telling me some files needed
 were missing or corrupt.&nbsp; I didn't notice an error code. I figured there was a problem with my installation disc and as&nbsp;I already had a download of Windows 7 I could use (win7-64-iso-x17-59186) so I burnt an ISO and ran setup from within. It failed for exactly
 the same reason, "cannot copy files as some files are missing or corrupt". I noted the code 0x80070241. so if we review:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) a full re-install of Windows 7 (after a format) did not solve the problem</p>
<p>2) an upgrade fails due to missing or corrupt files twice with two completely separate discs</p>
<p>3) error ode 0x80070241</p>
<p>

 excel or just the internet. The computer just stops, I cannot move the mouse, no task manager or control / alt / delete..... etc. I then need to do a hard reboot, ..... start windows normally, and about 6 minutes later, done / frozen again. Although I bought
 the computer in February, I can count on two hands how many times I've used it; it's been like this since almost day one. This computer is a big disappointment. I have antivirus software, I believe it's windows defender, I do run scans and I do update the
 computer every chance I get. Now last weekend was brutal and I lost allot of work repeatedly that I had to do over. I'm at my wits end that's why I haven't used it. BTW... my desktop also died, blue screen of death issue, so I'm back to using my 9 year old
 Chromebook and my ancient Dell laptop with the solid state drive... remember those? At least they work. I'm 54 years old and this is not acceptable, I needed this computer for work at home on the weekends and for school believe it or not. Now, next week I'm
 going to try these fixes unless there's anything you can suggest based on the additional info I provided. I do not have time tomorrow to work on this as I have a very busy week ahead and I need a computer that actually works. One more thing, I am very loyal
 to the Microsoft suite of products, I purchased the computer through Microsoft; BTW... I'm also a share holder. I expected alot more from Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,&nbsp;</p>

<p>Why doesn't microsoft find the source of the programs? Because I had did a search and found&nbsp; a lot and what programs you use, man if I was working for microsoft a lot of people who thinks it's funny to hack would be ban forever..</p>

<p>I know people get caught, I have seen a lot (why was I ban) but I never had seen (why was I ban) then a xboxpet mentions "you were ban for hacking the rank for a leaderboard"</p>
<p>I haven't seen anyone got ban from leaderboard, a couple years back I reported a guy from resident evil 5 the leaderboard shows 1 sec on every act and campaign.. 3 years and his still there just like other guys an still playing games, I had already message
 game developer's of removing people from those ranks they hacked never a reply from them.</p>

<p>Well if you had done a search of sources of how these people do it, a lot of people who aren't hackers they just mimic something from a person did. Can't go in too much detail.&nbsp; I would use resident evil 5 as a example, you would know how I feel if you became
 rank 1 on a leaderboard had the fastest time that people did the same time but couldn't get rank 1 at all then someone gets 1 sec rank 1.</p>
<p>What I'm trying to say is, people buy games for&nbsp; (leaderboards, achievements, story ect) there isn't a point in downloading a trial arcade game that shows a message (buy the full version you get the leaderboards and many more) It's more like if you buy this
 game forget the leaderboards people can hack to get rank 1.</p>

<p>Well it was a little hard to reread what I typed as well, when I use the format it showed how I wanted it to be but while I clicked sent then everything all together..</p>
<p>When it comes to the internet people are gonna do really stupid stuff, so it's hard for microsoft to find those sites.. Manly ya I was mention about that. I also probably couldn't even image if someone did had a paying job to go to every game that has a
 leaderboard then to know if this is possible and the other one isn't possible unless you hacked.</p>

<p>Thank you!!! That really gave me a smile, so they're looking at the leaderboards now of crash course?</p>
<p>What I want to ask a question to anyone, is microsoft able to remove someone from a rank board because he hacked or the developer have to do that because they are running the server or microsoft is.</p>

<h2>            Where are the results for MS Ultimate Word Games stored on a Windows 10 desktop machine</h2>
                    <p>I am constantly getting messages stating that my desktop and cloud results are out of sync. The screen displays the date related to data stored in the cloud and on my device. I am able to select the newest version and continue playing the games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is that twice in the past the sync'ing process has deleted my entire results for&nbsp;MS Ultimate Word Games. The end result being that I have no results in the cloud or on my device for&nbsp;MS Ultimate Word Games.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to be able to take my own copy of the results so that I do not have to start over in the event of my data being erased.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone please give the folder address of where&nbsp;MS Ultimate Word Games stores the results?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I asked the same question in Nov 2018 and was advised the my question would be forwarded to a service that would give me a suitable an answer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately that service did not respond. I was not given their address so I am unable to follow up with them.</p>

<p>Hello AdrianHu_AZ!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did some research on the FAQ for Ultimate Word Games and found this for the possible issue with your syncing.&nbsp;</p>

I'll take your advice and visit the Microsoft Casual Games community page. I dropped my Facebook account so that limits the number of avenues that I can explore.

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hello there. I have a problem with my Movie Maker. When I try to edit, a big majority of my video is greyed out and I cannot trim nor split the video. When I do edit some parts successfully, some parts just end up at a green screen.
 I don't know what's wrong, I have a Windows 8.1 laptop, AMD Radeon HD 7660G + 7600M Dual Graphics card and 8 GB of RAM. Please help, as I have no clue what is going on. Thank you.

            <p>Do you have the issue with all file types (all videos, all photos)?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are able to view photos and/or some other videos, that tells me the issue is not your driver. Instead the issue is probably the video file format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What is the format of your video file? &nbsp;It sounds like it isn't 100% compatible with Movie Maker and in that case, the workaround is to convert that video to a supported format like WMV. &nbsp;There are numerous video converter utilities that you can find. &nbsp;I've
 used Freemake Video Converter and it has always done a good job. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>One caveat though: &nbsp;Most freeware (including Freemake) will try to install add-ons. &nbsp;Always choose a "Custom install" whenever you install freeware. &nbsp;Then pay attention to all the dialogs. &nbsp;Always uncheck anything (and everything) so that you don't install
 add-ons or change your browser settings. &nbsp;If you do that, you should have a clean install of the program and nothing else.</em></p>

            <p>Hi TheGort,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apologies for the delayed response. It's possible that the previous MP4 file you were editing is corrupted; as what considerate_guy mentioned, you can try converting it into WMV then check if you can edit that without any error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know how things turn out.</p>
<p>
