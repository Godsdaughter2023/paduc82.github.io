<h2>            Downgrade from Windows 7 Pro to Home Edition</h2>
                    I have Win 7 Pro installed on my desktop. Win 7 Home Edition came installed on my laptop. I need XP Mode on my laptop. I would like to remove Pro from desktop and install on laptop. Shouldn't be a problem since it's an upgrade. Since Home Edition is bundled
 on my laptop, I can't install it on my desktop. I guess I will need to purchase another Home Edition for that. Is there a way I can downgrade from Pro to Home Edition on my desktop without a clean install?

<p>If both your Windows 7 came preinstalled on each computer, they are OEM versions and can't be moved.</p>
<p>Then I see you say the desktop is an Upgrade. Is it a Windows Anytime Upgrade or a Retail upgrade that upgraded you from Vista? There are different upgrades and you are not clear at all.</p>
<p>If it is a Windows Anytime Upgrade from Home Premium to Pro, the Upgrade key can be moved to the laptop, after it is removed from the desktop by rolling back your desktop to before the WAU was done.</p>
<p>If your desktop was upgraded with a retail upgrade from Vista, it will do you no good for your laptop.</p>
<p>Your options are limited. Your best bet is to leave the desktop as is and buy a Windows Anytime upgrade for the laptop. Simple, cheap, very fast and no software involved, just a key.</p>

I am a firm believer that if something is working don't try to fix it. &nbsp;Windows 10 has a host of problems as you can see on this site. &nbsp;I would wait until Microsoft has all the bugs worked out before you upgrade to Windows 10. &nbsp;I just bought my wife a new computer
 that has Windows 10 and it has more problems than Windows XP Pro operating system ever had. Sorry I bought the new computer, she now went back to her old computer that has XP Pro, and is working fine......

            <p>The problems you read about are the result of people who don't know how to install an operating system correctly. The same problems show up every time a new version of Windows is released.</p>
<p>
</p><p>People don't understand that installing a new operating system is one of the most technically difficult things you can do to a computer. It takes a great deal of technical expertise and experience that most people don't have. After all, spending your free
 hours studying technology is not everybody's idea of a good time, believe it or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>For most people, the right thing to do is to buy a computer with the new operating system already installed. And not now, for goodness' sake, when Windows 10 is not even a year old. If you're thinking of buying a new computer, wait until the fall. It takes
 at least a year for a new operating system to become truly stable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A computer should be useful, even enjoyable. Why would you even think about doing something to your computer that makes you scared? And why would think of doing something highly technical when you know inside that you're not a technical person?</p>
<p>
</p><p>The big difference between Windows 10 and all the earlier versions of Windows is that Microsoft is desperate to get Windows 10 on peoples' computers. And desperate is not too harsh a word. So they're using every slimy trick in the book to put Windows 10
 on your computer. But - and unlike with Apple or Google - it's also possible to avoid the tricks and never get Windows 10. All it takes is a trip to the internet with your friend Google - err, Bing - with this search term:

            <p>The problems posted on this site represent a miniscule part of those that have upgraded to Windows 10 and a significant majority have done so successfully, people only post when they have&nbsp;an issue&nbsp;not when the upgrade works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is impossible to say that you will definitely have a good experience only that it is more likely than not. You cannot base the decision just on what you read here on the Windows 10 forum, switch to the Windows 7 one and you will see almost as many on
 a settled and mature operating system which you yourself run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The question you have to ask is why do you want to upgrade? True Windows 7 is now on extended support but it will still get updates until 2020, it works and you are familiar with it. Between now and then are you likely to get a new computer because if you
 do it will most likely come with 10, be 100% compatible with and include support</p>
<p>
</p><p>Generally I advise Windows 8 computers should upgrade without doubt, newer Windows 7 systems most likely but only older ones are suspect due to compatibility worries.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can do a few things to make the upgrade more successful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 Find out if the manufacturer supports the upgrade with drivers, download them beforehand if you can. Microsoft have been somewhat cavalier about what systems can be upgraded, the compatibility check is somewhat rudimentary.</p>
<p>2 Remove any software you do not use. The less on there the less the potential issues.</p>
<p>3 If you haven't already make the system recovery disks, most computers that came without disks had a utility to burn your own.</p>
<p>4 Inventory the software you do use, make sure you have the disks to repair or reinstall it if required and the log in to the supplier if downloaded.</p>
<p>5 Back up your files. Although the upgrade leaves your personal files intact that assumes it works as intended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft have tried to make the upgrade easy enough for somebody like yourself to do and most have.</p>

            <p>Is there something in Win10 that you <em>need</em> ? The Store, Cortana, one of the other 'features' ?</p>
<p>Or are you just being seduced by 'free' ?</p>
<p>Should you decide to take the leap, don't rush into it. Read tutorials and prepare.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- What brand and model desktop or laptop do you have ?</p>
<p>Or if not an OEM brand ( HP, DELL, etc. ) what brand and model motherboard and
</p>
<p>graphics processor does it use ? </p>
- MS has been approving machine that are borderline capable (capable vs compatible).
<p>Particularly regarding graphics processors that don't have Win10 specific drivers.
</p>
<p>While the generic Win10 drivers may work, you have no guarantee of full performance with them.</p>
<p>As time goes by borderline hardware will become more problematic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Not wishing to sound alarmist, but personally...</p>
<p>There is no way I would upgrade without first making a clone of my current OS.</p>
<p>Sure many millions of people have '<em>upgraded',</em> but many have failed. My first attempt resulted in the</p>
<p>common issues with crashing Start Menu and Task Bar, as well as 'update' loops.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I am still using an upgrade (2nd go)&nbsp; because I have a ton of games and software I didn't want to reinstall,
</p>
<p>and it runs very well (but no better than Win7, and there are things about Win10 I really don't like),
</p>
<p>but if you are certain you want Win10 a clean install would be no risk - assuming your&nbsp; hardware is capable.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>- If you are not aware of Murphy's Law doing an upgrade without a solid back up of your OS</p>
<p>has a very real chance of&nbsp; familiarizing you with it.</p>
<p>Should you decide you don't like Win10, rolling back has more chance of a borked OS than the upgrade.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 unable to search for updates - error code 80080005</h2>
                    <p>Automatic updates do not run, and I have tried to search for updates mannually.&nbsp; I've tried several times, obviously, and the timescale varies from trying to search for over a hour, to a few minutes.&nbsp; Everytime I get the same error code - unable to search
 for updates, 80080005.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far I have tried the following to try and resolve this:</p>
<p>- Disabled the anti-virus and firewall and then tried to mannualy search for uppdates</p>
<p>- Search for malware etc, no problems or issues</p>
<p>- Rurned automatic updates on and off, rebooted etc.</p>
<p>- Ran Microsoft Fix-It twice, no help at all</p>
<p>- System restore to a date before that last succcessful update</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The system and computer is running fine, but now I'm just finding it frustrating that I can't update the system.&nbsp; I'm not into donloading loads of stuff (music, filsm etc), and as far as I can remember I haven't downloaded ot installed anyting new since
 the last update.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Hi Nadia,<br />
<br />
Which antivirus application are you using?<br />
<br />
<p>
<p>
<p>
</p>
Method 1: Check if the time settings are correctly configured. 
Change the display of dates, times, currency, and measurements
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/change-the-display-of-dates-times-currency-and-measurements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-in/windows7/change-the-display-of-dates-times-currency-and-measurements</a></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:</span> Let’s clean start the operating system and install the updates.</b></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>We recommend you clean start the operating system to determine if other programs are interfering with this application.
<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>To do this, see this article on how to clean start your computer:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></a></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b></p>
<p><b><span>Note:
</span></b><span>After checking the functionality in clean boot, follow the suggestions under
</span><span>“How to reset the computer to start as usual after troubleshooting with clean boot”.
</span></p>
<p>
<b><br />
</b></p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>Method 3:</b> From the following link refer to “Let me fix it myself” section.</p>

            Many thanks for your reply, I appreciate it.

<div>I've now tried al, of your suggestions, but the problem still isn't resolved. I don't know if it helps, but I also tried to update iTunes but hat would work either.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Also, after I tried method 2, when I try to manually update, it says that there have never been any updates ever.</div>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">I understand that performing clean boot says you do not have any updates pending. I would suggest you to perform Method 3, which deals with resetting all the Windows update components and reply us with the results.</span></p>

    <title>Mass effect 2 - Arrival DLC - overcharged - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Mass effect 2 - Arrival DLC - overcharged</h2>
                    
<p>&nbsp;I saw that the Mass Effect 2 DLC was priced at 280MS points today - went to buy it, and confirmed - as I hit the button I realised that on the confirmation screen it said 560 points - I pressed cancel but too late. Can I have my 280MS points you overcharged
 me by back please MS?</p>

<p>You'd have to try calling support. Although it's showing as 560 points in the marketplace and I don't think it's been on any sales recently so I don't know if they can do anything.</p>

<p>There are deals that sometimes last only a day or a matter of hours. Please make sure to check the price on the console before you hit buy on the confirmation screen. You can try calling phone support for a refund.

<p>
</p><p>The attached DMP file is of the <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>DRIVER_IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL (d1)</strong></span> bug check.<br />
<br />
<em>This indicates that a kernel-mode driver attempted to access pageable memory at a process IRQL that was too high.</em><br />
<br />
A driver tried to access an address that is pageable (or that is completely invalid) while the IRQL was too high. This bug check is usually caused by drivers that have used improper addresses.

                    <p>Hi All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having a problem with a handful of users signing in to Skype for Business.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error they receive is "There was a problem verifying the certification from the server".</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are on a Office 365 Online plan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried re-installing the client and resetting the user's 365 password - no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to sign in with the problem users credentials on my PC (Skype works on mine) and received the same error.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Grateful if anyone could assist.</p>

            <p>Hi Dan,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>To identify if it’s an account issue or not, you may sign in your account on an affected user’s PC. If you can reproduce this issue with your account, it means that this issue happened to a specific client.</p>
<ol>
<li>Please try <strong>deleting my sign-in info </strong>and cleaning your credential on PC (<strong>Control Panel</strong> &gt;<strong>User Account</strong> &gt;<strong>Credential Manager</strong>)</li></ol>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0e08f2e8-ac4e-4d39-989d-eaf9b43a084d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/0e08f2e8-ac4e-4d39-989d-eaf9b43a084d" /></a></p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Changing to another network environment or disabling the antivirus software to see if this issue can be improved.
<p>More information, please refer to this KB: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2604176" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/2604176</a> <span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If all of above is not working, I’d like to confirm more information:</p>
<ol>
<li>What’s the detailed version of the Skype for Business client and OS (Operation System)?</li><li>Is the affected user able to sign in <a href="https://sched.lync.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Skype for Business Web</a>?
<span>&nbsp;</span></li></ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi Rick,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks for assisting with my issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was able to resolve the issue by adding:</p>
<p>
</p><p>sipdir.online.lync.com:443&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>As both the internal and external server address names.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Doing this then prompted me for a password which allowed me to sign in.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 10 does not see iPhone 5s</h2>
                    <p>Windows 10 does not see my iPhone 5s in its File Explorer. Sometimes it does - sometimes it doesn't. I am talking about those occasions, when the iPhone 5s is connected to the PC via a cable. iTunes does see the iPhone 5s. iTunes does see the iPhone 5s via
 Wi-Fi as well. I have several photographs on the iPhone 5s and I have to move them to DropBox or post them to Facebook instead of getting to them directly on File Explorer.</p>

<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Used subst for local folder, but now Win10 thinks its a CD Drive</h2>
                    <p>Hello all,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I use Visual Studio at work and many projects are configured to run specifically from build servers, which requires that I run the project from a specific file structure from the D drive.<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The long standing way of handling this has been to simply have the project run from your D: hard drive. However in the past few years we have been upgrading to laptops that often have a single drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Rather than mess with the partitions on my Dell to get a D: (and assume my size need for it) I created a D: with subst (since there is no CD hardware).&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It worked for over a year until recently. Now the drive is inaccessible and demands I insert a disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm pretty sure a recent update affected this setup though. Now Windows recognizes D: as a (seemingly authentic) CD Drive, complete with icon and all expected messages (i.e. "Insert a disk into Drive D:")</p>
<p>
</p><p>Using subst to display a list of current virtual drives (as documented in /? ) shows no virtual drives.</p>
<p>Using subst d: /d results in "Invalid parameter - D:"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've gone into diskpart. At the time I presume I had found the partition since it had no volume (and all the other partitions were legitimate and had their expected unmounted volumes)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I deleted successfully the partition, and it doesn't show up in diskpart any longer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The erroneous D: still lingers. It is haunting my ability to develop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am assuming it would take some specific registry manipulation if not more than that. I am not well versed enough to go into it and there doesn't seem to be any specific instances of this problem that I've been able to find.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please help, and thank you for reading.</p>

 don't know how this problem could be solved.</p>

<p>I deleted him about 3-4 months ago, he is not following me on one (this is kinda irrebefolevant because this works the other way around) I am not following him. i have blocked/unblocked him and the problem still occured.</p>
<p>__________________________________________________________________________</p>
<p>I think a cause for this problem could of been because i accidentally added him after trying to rapidly delete friend request that i let pile up then quickly deleted.</p>

<h2>            Administrator account disabled after upgrade from 7 to 10, no login possible.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I removed my Notebook from a domain, logged in with user 'Administrator' and did the upgrade, which worked fine. Now when trying to login it prompt for the 'Administrator' password and then says: account was disabled, refer to sysadmin. No other option is
 available, I cannot chose to login with another account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I open a command prompt via shift+restart I can login with another user that exists on that PC who has admin rights. I can do 'net user administrator' and it shows that the Administrator account is active.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Still no login possible with Administrator and no option to login as another user.</p>

            <p>I have the same issue with an upgrade of my Surface Pro.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are 3 accounts on the device (2 non-admin cloud accounts) and the local administrator account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I was logged in with the local admin account to perform the Update to Window10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now after the first reboot, the local administrator account is unavailable on the names in the bottom left of the screen, I'm therefore left with no admin accounts on the device?</p>
<p>
</p><p>How is it possible to login with the Administrator Account again on the device?&nbsp; Does this account get disabled during the update to Windows 10?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>

            &nbsp;Hi Bassed,
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Welcome to Microsoft Community.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I appreciate your interest on windows 10.<br />
I understand the inconvenience you faced. We certainly help you with this issue.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would suggest you to try to login in safe mode and check.</div>
<div>Follow the link:</div>

Administrator account by using the Local Users and Groups Microsoft Management <br />
Console (MMC).<br />
1. Open the MMC console and select Local Users and <br />
Groups.</div>
<div>2. Right-click the Administrator account and select Properties. <br />
&nbsp;The <br />
Administrator Properties window appears.</div>
<div>3. On the General tab, clear the Account is Disabled check box.</div>
<div>4. Close the MMC console.</div>
<div>Administrator access is now enabled.</div>

            <p>Many thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried your proposed solution,&nbsp;but unfortunately I'm unable to change the properties of an elevated account from a non-admin elevated account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have booted windows 10 into safe mode, launched the mmc for local users and groups but of course I'm not able to change properties of an account that's more privileged than the account I'm logged in with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only account that I can now log into the device with is a cloud account which is not an admin.&nbsp; I performed the upgrade to windows 10 as the local administrator account (the only admin account on the machine) which it seems has&nbsp;now seems&nbsp;been disabled
 as part of the upgrade process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are only two other local accounts on the machine after the upgrade:&nbsp; "Guest" (also disabled) and "local-account" which is an account I've not seen before (prior to the upgrade).&nbsp; This new "local-account" is an administrator but I would not know what
 the password is as it's not an account that I've created. (I assume it was created during the upgrade process.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As I'm a 3rd line IT tech professional I have tools at my disposal that I can boot from and use to "break" the local admin password but unfortunately not even this is possible as the machine is running bitlocker (which I can not disable due to UAC and not
 having an administrative account).</p>
<p>
</p><p>So it seems that the&nbsp;disabling the local administrator account during upgrade has left me in a bad chicken/egg situation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any other ideas ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kind regards,</p>
<p>Mark</p>

            <p>I reverted the machine with an image backup to the previous Win 7, logged in with the other account that has admin rights and did the upgrade again. Now I can log in with that user name - only!
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no choice to log that user off and log in with another user. I have another non-admin account that I see and that can manage in user management, I also activated Administrator and Guest.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I cannot find an option to log in with any of these accounts. When I log off, I go back to the login screen with the only input field being for my password. No other-user-button, nothing.</p>

            <p>Best for you is to have a HirenBoot CD nearby. If you face problems, then</p>
<p>you can boot from it in the Windows PE environment. It has the tools</p>
<p>necessary for you to either:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) reset Administrator password</p>
<p>2) create new account</p>
<p>3) unblock accounts.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thanks for the suggestion, do you know if HirenBoot can support bit locker'd drives ?&nbsp; I have all the recovery key info that I can enter.&nbsp; My usual tool of choice for password recovery doesn't support bit Locker'd drives as it boots a Linux kernel rather
 than WinPE.</p>

<h2>            Getting a refund</h2>
                    I was planning that I would buy some 24 Halloween loot boxes yesterday but instead I accidentally bought 24 normal ones also to back me up the official Twitter for Overwatch @playoverwatch tweeted out they had a problem with the loot boxes and they weren't
 appearing on the Xbox store so if you could take this into consideration I would be very happy

</p><p>This is something that may take a while and is tricky to fix considering the developer is the sole owner of items purchased for the game and Xbox is just an interface. I would contact Xbox support to see if they'll, at the very least, refund your money.</p>

    <title>Microsoft Store NOT Working&#33; Dissapointed - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> a. user  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microsoft Store NOT Working&#33; Dissapointed</h2>
                    <p>I am appalled at the way Microsoft has not given me any solution. I had to contact technical support who could not come with a solution for my problem. I went out of my way to the Technical Support as they have no convenient time in my country as I would
 have gone for work at the hours they are available. Later I waited for 1 hour on the waiting list to watch a Microsoft Official using remote Desktop and wasting my Internet for Over 1 and a half hours. Then due to Microsoft's 'technical trouble' I got disconnected
 from the support team. Pissed Off by the series of events that has occurred I decided to come here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem I have been facing for my last few weeks is that I am unable to use many Default Preinstalled apps. I am now unable to open them. There is an exclamation mark right next on the icon of the apps. &nbsp;I have a screenshot of the Start menu with my
 Username and Photo blacked out. Many important apps such as Store now cannot be used causing inconvenience for my work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;<a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f68c55b8-47a1-4998-9e1a-a40011e2303b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/f68c55b8-47a1-4998-9e1a-a40011e2303b" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Most apps just close while trying to open but some show a message like this -</p>
<p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e7b6b3e8-35f5-42e7-9cb9-3ce6d7020e6f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/e7b6b3e8-35f5-42e7-9cb9-3ce6d7020e6f" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had read the solutions from another users complaint/question and I tried them all and none of them worked. I am pretty sure that this is not a problem in just the computers of two people or three people only. My question is why hasn't Microsoft updated
 Windows 10 to solve these issues. I would like an experienced Personnel from Microsoft who has the answer and not someone jabbering out some canned responses and pretend to feel sorry for us. &nbsp;If Microsoft does not come up with a genuine solution then you
 will have a far worse situation than one unhappy customer as I am willing to go to any extent to get a solution from your company. &nbsp;I would like a reply as soon as possible and if I don't receive one in a months time I will take this up to Higher Authorities.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Signed,</p>
<p>A very pissed off customer<br />

            <p>Hi Sue,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>In order to diagnose the issue, I would suggest you to try these following steps and check is the issue persists.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 1: </strong>Using Windows Sound Recorder to test the microphone.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>You can use this section to find out if the computer can record a signal from the</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Microphone and play it back. Use Windows sound recorder to create an audio file using the following steps:</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Plug the microphone into the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Click Start, All Programs, Accessories, and select Sound Recorder.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Click Start recording and speak into the microphone.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>When finished recording, click Stop Recording.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>A save screen automatically opens.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Type a filename and click Save. A file of type WAV or WMA is created in the Documents folder.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>If you can record the Audio using Microphone using the above method then the
</span></span><span><span>Microphone is working fine.<br />
Now it should work any application that </span></span><span><span>Supports Microphone. If the computer does not record audio using the above method then it could be an issue with the settings of the Microphone. Now verify the following settings.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Step 2: </strong>Enabling the Microphone.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>1. Plug the microphone into the computer.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>2. Click Start, All Programs, Accessories, and select Sound Recorder.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>3. Click Start Recording and speak into the microphone.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>4. Recording tab showing a detected signal for the Microphone device</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note: Microphone Icon should have Green check mark on it. If</span></span><span>
</span><span><span>there is no Green check mark, it means it is disabled. If there is No green mark on Microphone it never works. To enable the Microphone Right click on Microphone and click on Enable. If you do not see the Microphone in the list, Right click
 on the White space and select Show disabled devices. Then you would see the Microphone. However, if you do not see the green check mark on it, Right click on it and click on Enable. And also Select Microphone and click on Set Default (If Set as default button
 is active).</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>If you see the Green check mark on Microphone the Microphone definitely works.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><br />
<strong>Step 3: </strong>Increasing Microphone Sensitivity and Un-muting the Microphone.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>1. Select Microphone and click on Properties button.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>2. Adjust the slider until to 100 % of its range.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span><span>&nbsp;</span>3. If Mute is on, click the mute button to un-mute the device.
</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span><span>4. If Microphone Boost is available, boost the volume.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>5. Click OK to make the changes.</span></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>Now, the Microphone should work. </span></span></p>
