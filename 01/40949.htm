                    For the life of me, I cannot set up a working VPN on Windows 7 Home Premium.&nbsp; I followed the official Microsoft instructions to the "t" but got Error 800.&nbsp; So I found a solution online and made adjustments...but then got Error 629.&nbsp; After finding another
 solution, I fixed that but am now getting Error 919.&nbsp; Next, I contacted Microsoft Support and was told that I had to contact Acer because I'm running an OEM.&nbsp; Then Acer told me they can only help me with hardware issues.&nbsp; So you can understand why I am throwing
 up my hands in frustration.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is there anyone out there who can help me or point me in the right direction?<br />

            <p>Note that in order to access your PPTP VPN server from a remote location you need
<strong>TCP Port 1723</strong> forwarded/open on any router or firewall the PPTP VPN server is behind. You also need the router or firewall to pass
<strong>GRE Protocol 47</strong> traffic. This is sometimes called <strong>PPTP Pass Through</strong> or
<strong>VPN Pass Through</strong> or is allowed automatically when TCP Port 1723 is forwarded/opened. This includes software firewalls like the native Windows Firewall. You can test this using the PPTP Ping and VPN Traffic sections on this page.</p>

I have posted my issue at TechNet as per your suggestion and received no response.&nbsp; It appears either that there is no answer...VPN is simply not available on my system...or there's no one who has an answer.&nbsp; Could I be the only owner of a Windows 7 Home Premium
 on a less than 1 year old laptop who can't have this feature.&nbsp; If so, it must be the OS since I got VPN on Windows XP Pro on my older laptop without a hitch.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
By the way, I have Googled all the errors and can find plenty of definitions but precious few fixes other than what you've already suggested...and I carried out.<br />

            Welcome to the wonderful world of Windows, where you have to deal with error message after error message and finding support is virtually impossible. Just buy a Mac if you can. Setting these things up with a Mac couldn't be easier, and OS X Server is only
 around $30.

<h2>            Windows Live Mail Error ID&#58; 0x800C013E</h2>
                    
<p><strong>Windows Live Mail - sending and receiving messages; getting an error message.</strong></p>
<p>I keep on getting these error messages very often. They say: unable to send or receive messages for the<em>Live (blondie-25)</em> account. To send and receive messages in your Hotmail account, go to<a href="http://hotmail.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://hotmail.live.com</a>
 on the Web, or try again later. To get help from Windows Live Customer Support, go to<a href="http://support.live.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.live.com</a> and click Windows Live Mail in the list of services. Getting the Windows Live Mail Error ID: 0x800C013E. It seems
 like I'm able to receive messages, but not send (sometimes it seemed like I was able to send, but then other times not). I did all the other things as above; such as checking customer support, but got nothing on this. I did the other part, the&nbsp;hotmail account
 and that worked. But it still seems that I should be able to go through my Windows Live Mail vs. Windows&nbsp;Hotmail. Aren't they both two separate mail systems? I have Windows 7 Home Premium, and an HP 1360US.</p>
<p>Please help!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            If anybody still has this problem. Maybe it reapeared with Win 10 Upgrade. The easy solution is:<br />
1. Go to C:\Users\%userprofile%\AppData\Local\Microsoft&nbsp;<br />
2. rename Windows live mail in Windows live mail backup<br />
3. Start Windows live mail again and setup your account.<br />
4. import the missing mail from the backup folder.<br />
5. profit

<h3> dimitarspasovski  say:</h3>
<h2>            Creating installation media for windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>Hello. I just downloaded the windows 8.1, and I found this guide online&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media</a></p>
<p>for creating installation media. I downloaded the Windows 8.1 setup, started it and I guess I missclicked something and download started. Now I can't get it back (I can't go back to select "Install by creating media" ) and so I am stuck at step four. Is
 their any way I can fix this ? Because I don't feel like downloading the whole thing again. I tried to delete and redownload the Windows 8,1 Setup but it makes no difference, whenever I start it it starts downloading right away.<br />

<h2>            How do I populate the fields on the fax cover page&#63;</h2>
                    I can open the fax cover page and see the fields I want to populate (sender, receiver, etc) but it will not let me type in those fields.&nbsp; How do I get it to accept text?&nbsp; Is there also a way to automatically populate my sender fields?&nbsp; I've filled in the
 account info on another window but they do not flow over to the cover page.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Do you get this error when installing this particular program or all the programs?</p>
<p>Check if you have issue in installing this particular program by installing it to a different computer.</p>
<p>It appears to me that the antivirus program could be blocking the script to install the program. I suggest that you try the below methods to install the program.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 1:</b></p>
<p>I suggest that you disable the Anti-virus program and the firewalls temporarily and check if you have the same issue.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> Please make sure that you enable the antivirus software and firewalls after performing the test to keep your computer protected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2:</b></p>
<p>I would suggest you to perform clean boot and check.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to configure Windows XP to start in a "clean boot" state</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Note: Make sure to start the computer normally by following the steps under “Steps to configure Windows to use a Normal startup state” in the above article.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3:</b></p>
<p>Create a new user account and try to install the program. You can refer the below article that will give you information ‘How to create a new user account’:</p>

<h2>            flash for surface RT</h2>
                    <p>I realize that the flash player is automatically installed on the Surface RT. I have installed the upgrade to 8.1 RT and since then I am having trouble accessing sites that utilize Flash. And even when I go to Flash to verify what version I am using, I have
 nothing that pops up, not even an error message. I have searched on editing the whitelist, and when I look at the file, under the area where flash would be it shows

            Thanks, but I did&nbsp; that and I still have no flash player that is able to run. I&nbsp;have gone to the flash website to verify what version I am using. I&nbsp;have gone to websites&nbsp;as well that use flash, and no go.&nbsp;What do you make of the fact that the white list
 says "&lt;no flash&gt;". Does it matter I am using 8.1 RT?

            The whitelist isn't used anymore really, it only stops flash from working on a very small number of&nbsp;sites, which aren't compatible with the Surface. Only thing I can suggest would be to try a Refresh or Reset, see if that fixes your problem.

            <p>Even with all your updates, you will still see a &lt;noflash&gt; section that blocks 9 (I believe is the last count) of sites.&nbsp; However most of these sites offer HTML5 alternatives anyway, and this flash block actually makes the sites work far

<p>Make sure you have all the updates, reboot, and if it still won't work, can you tell me what site you have a problem with?</p>

<h3> lakeflake209  say:</h3>
<h2>            Special keys not working with HP Enhanced special keys keyboard in Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>Running WIN 8 preview on separate partition until I decide if it's worth it to upgrade.&nbsp; Keyboard is an HP enhanced with special function keys that control drive open/close, play/stop/search/mail shortcut/etc.&nbsp; Some of those keys work as intended, others
 do no.&nbsp; Specifically the DVD drive control keys do NOT work when in WIN 8 but function fine in Win 7.&nbsp; Also, in Win8 the open/close button on the COMPUTER itself do not open/close the drive doors for loading DVD/CD, etc.&nbsp; I've run all the suggested fixes I
 can find -- check for new/updated drivers, reinstall drivers, etc.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can anyone&nbsp;advise if this problem will go away if I update Win 7 to Win 8 rather than run Win 8 on a separate partition or come up with a solution to get it working on the separate Win 8 partition so I can continue evaluation of Win 8?&nbsp; Appreciate any advice
 possible. </p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for showing interest in the Microsoft Windows 8!!!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>From the description about the issue that you have given, I guess you are using a desktop PC and it seems that this is a compatibility issue. You have mentioned
 that you have tried reinstalling and updating the keyboard drivers and still you face the same issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me ask you some questions to understand the root cause of the issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>1)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Are you using a wired or a wireless keyboard?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>2)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What is the model of the keyboard?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>3)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What is the status of the keyboard device in Device Manager in the computer?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>4)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>How did you try updating the keyboard drivers? Was it from the Device Manager or did you try downloading it from the HP website?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>5)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>What actually happened when you tried it? Was it showing any updated or new drivers?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Install the Keyboard drivers in Windows 7 Compatibility Mode.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you have mentioned that the keyboard was working fine with the Windows 7, let us install the latest drivers for the keyboard in the Windows 7 compatibility
 mode and check if that helps. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow the steps given below:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>A.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Download the latest drivers for the keyboard model that you are using from the HP website and save it in your computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>B.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Right click on the setup file, scroll down to Properties and click Properties.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>C.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>On the window that pops up, click Compatibility tab.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>D.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Under Compatibility mode, check the box “Run this program in compatibility mode for”.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>E.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>In the scroll down select “Windows 7”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>F.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Under Privilege Level, check the box “Run this program as an administrator”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>G.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click Apply and Ok.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reply to let us know the result.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

Answers to ur ??:</p>
<p>Wired Keyboard; Model HP KB-0630; Status: working properly; updating: tried both Device Mgr and HP;&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Device Mgr indicating it is most current driver; HP site doesn't even list that keyboard.</p>
<p>Tried the suggestion on Compatibility mode but no change in status; (same keys work and same special keys have on effect).</p>
<p>What I have detected is that on the WIN 7 partition the driver is shown as an HP driver 1.0.7.1 dated 9/7/2006 and on the WIN 8 partition it's a Microsoft driver. I suspect that the MS driver is more of a generic driver and doesn't have support for the special
 keys that HP built in to it's driver for the Media Center PC that it's supporting.</p>
<p>I've tried to copy the HP driver from the WIN7 partition to the WIN8 partition driver folder but it won't let me do so even with an Administrator function. I can't change the permissions in WIN8 for some reason, or I'm missing some step.</p>
<p>I have found out that I can get the drive doors to open if I go to Computer&nbsp;and Click on the specific drive.</p>
<p>Any thoughts as to IF I do the full install of WIN8&nbsp;(I already have&nbsp;purchased the upgrade version win WIN8 Pro) on the main partition of my computer will that overwrite the driver or will it&nbsp;keep the original HP version of the&nbsp;keyboard driver?</p>
<p>Appreciate the suggestions thus far.&nbsp; Thanks&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>As per as the information given by you, did you install the latest Visual C++ redistribute&nbsp; program? In the meantime, do try to reset the Windows store cache and then try to install the game again and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>a. Press the “<strong>Windows Logo</strong>” + “<strong>R</strong>” keys on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Type “<strong>wsreset.exe</strong>” and press “<strong>Enter</strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span>c.<strong> Reboot </strong>
the computer and then check if you are able to open the <strong>Windows Store </strong>
and all the other apps on the computer.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please get back to us with the necessary details so that we can resolve your issue at the earliest.</p>

            <p>Hiya,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've followed your instructions above but they didn't seem to do the trick. I have however made some sort of progress.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By uninstalling and re-installing the Windows Store via the Power Shell, I am able to download the game. I now however get the following message instead:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/61f85067-92dd-4c39-899c-cabe18c9c18c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/61f85067-92dd-4c39-899c-cabe18c9c18c" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p>The message then reverts to the original - "To use this app, you'll need a device with more features...etc". I can only do this the first time I open the store. Afterwards it just reverts to how it was before.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help would be ideal.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            <p>In my case, I think it is due to the following: I have a laptop with an integrated video card and a GeForce. If I run dxdiag, the detected video card is the integrated one. I believe the store relies on this information and prevents me to download the game.</p>

            <p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am also having the same problem. I have a laptop with "Optimus" technology by Nvidia. DXdiag also only recognizes Intel Graphics instead of Nvidia GPU. Please Microsoft. You need to fix this. Is there a solution yet? Setting Windows Store and DXdiag tool
 to use the Nvidia GPU in the Nvidia System Settings (Manage 3D Settings). No good. I want to install this game and I also want to install Forza Horizon 3 when it comes out. Are you telling me that I won't be able to, because of the store's and DXdiag's inability
 to recognize my GPU?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reply Microsoft.</p>

<p>Personally I would go with Turtle Beach's over any generic headset. I've always found TB's to be better in sound quality and comfort. I do suggest you look at reviews before buying an product. And if I may make a suggestion. If you can afford to pay about
 $71 more, I would suggest going with the Turtle Beach XO Seven's (I have them). You don't have to worry about wires running across your floor all the time.</p>
<p>All you have to do with the OX Sevens' is just connect them to your controller. Very, very easy to set it up.</p>
<p>If you can't afford to go with the XO Sevens, then for sure go with the XO Four's.</p>
<p>Once more always read reviews.</p>
<p>If you do go with the Turtle Beach XO 7's and need to know how to set them up, feel free to send me a message.. I will gladly help you out.</p>

<p>The PS4 Gold headphones work with the XB1 as well.</p>
<p>You just need the XB1 headset adapter and the cable going from the headset to the adapter. Works pretty well.</p>

<p>I prefer my Turtle beach X42's. It's wireless, has Dolby game sound, and dual band 2.4/5Ghz wi-fi so there's no interference whatssoever since everyone uses 2.4Ghz tech like home networks. But need a chat adaptor for the Xbox 1 console. I so far won't get
 the chat adaptor because I want to use the Kinect for voice chat. In my experience Xbox headsets are cheap. When I got my Xbox 360 slim console which came with a headset, it broke. When I got the Bluetooth wireless headset for 360, I had to shout into it for
 it to pick up my voice even tho I got a laugh from the two pfficial Xbox ads of this South African [I wont say the B word] chubby man switching from playing games and his mum. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Iv got the MS headset, they are cheap but have good sound, they have a simple look and can be worn for long gaming sessions without a problem, iv had tb's for my 360 and they are also good. The great thing is the adaptor, i use my tb in ears during the day
 so when people walk by they dont point and laff so much. Like others have said you cant go wrong with tb's but the XO4 vs MS headset i dont think theres much diff in quality, if you carefull with your cash like me the 45 quid i spent was well worth it, hope
 that helps gl.</p>

<h2>            &#34;The backup application could not start due to an internal error&#58;  The specified service does not exist as an installed service. &#40;0x80070427&#41; </h2>
                    When trying to do a back up wuch as "Create a System image" in Windows 7 Professional I get an error. The Windows Backup Service is on the list and it is even started.<br />
I have seached this forum and the internet and have not found a conclusive resolution to this issue. This is a freshly installed Windows 7, and I tried a clean boot and still get the same issue. I did a sfc /scannow and the integrity is just fine. I have Norton
 Internet Securities 2010, and have not&nbsp;&nbsp;found any malware or virus on my system. I really do not want to activate my support for Windows 7 for a back up issue that should be working installed right out of the box. I have not even reinstalled any of my games
 or anything that could modify windows in any way.

            Have same Prob as Mezroc&nbsp;with Win7 Pro (64bit). It may be coincidence but problem started after failed attempt at boot defrag using system mechanic 9!<br />
<br />
Looked at Volume shadow copy service, started it, set it to auto, made no difference!<br />
<br />
Its now 2 days later and decided to rollback System Mechanic registry changes and now find Back up and Restore working again!!!

            <p>If you want to dual-boot, the earlier operating system (in this case Windows 7) must be installed first.&nbsp; This means that you will need a copy of Windows 7 and you will need to be able to reinstall Windows 10.&nbsp;
<br />
</p>
<p>Please don't confuse downloading with installing.&nbsp; They're two different things.</p>

            What do you think about setting up a virtual machine? The dual boot method would require uninstalling W10, installing W7 and then reinstalling W10. Virtual machine setup is pretty straightforward if my research is correct?

            <p>I have to apologize, because I should have suggested a VM.&nbsp; Just a brain fart I guess.&nbsp; If you have Windows 10 Pro you can run Hyper-V, or you can choose from one of the other free VMs, such as Virtual Box or VMWare.</p>

            Windows 7 works well in a VirtualBox installation and isn't too demanding in terms of memory if your primary purpose is to run 'business' software.

<p>Hmm. Good luck. I was on this morning when it first came on. There was 2000 players and a game later it jumped to 10,000. Your best shot would be to syncronize with Bungie's live stream, start matchmaking when they do.
</p>
<p>It's funny, in the first handful of Bungie's games they already got steaked. Their players weren't exactly the best either.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Having too many CD/DVD programs can cause strange issues, especially if they load parts of
<br />
themselves at StartUp as they will compete for resources. This does not mean this issue was
<br />
caused by those however it is a possibility depending on which and how many you have installed.<br />
<br />
You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD burn and<br />
CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others&nbsp;do so<br />
properly.<br />
<br />
Burning at slower speeds or using the Master Format might help.&nbsp;A CD/DVD cleaner might help.<br />
<br />
Brand of CD or DVD disk can also be the issue. Low quality (cheap brands) are always problematic.<br />
<br />
CD/DVD's have a +- tolerance and yours might read/write on the edge outside of those discs&nbsp;<br />
tolerances. They can be realigned however it is usually more economical to replace the drive.<br />

<br />
References to Vista also apply to Windows 7.</p>
<p>Stage 1 : Please do all the below even&nbsp;if you have done some before as it is often the total<br />
process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -<br />
REBOOT&nbsp;this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue<br />
below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose<br />
cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />
<br />
Your CD drive or DVD drive is missing or is not recognized by Windows or other programs<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for you drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others<br />
do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some<br />
registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause.<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and the<br />
correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course<br />
as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as<br />
the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your
<br />
CD/DVD drive from someone with the same model.<br />

<p>Use DevManView to locate CD/DVD in registry (be careful and make a Restore Point before<br />
changing anything) - find the device in&nbsp;DevManView&nbsp;and then Right Click on it Open in RegEdit.</p>
<p>DevManView - Free - an alternative to the standard Device Manager of Windows, which displays
<br />
all devices and their properties in flat table, instead of tree viewer<br />

<h2>            Edge&#47;IE11 auto refresh after network connection restored</h2>
                    <p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Im building a ReactJS application, and have built a component which listens to window events for online/offline (network disconnection/reconnection) and provides a little message letting the user know that they are not on the internet, or when they reconnect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently working all as expected in all browsers, however, in IE11 (using polyfils) and Edge, the browsers auto refresh the page once the network connection is restored.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Luckily, as my app has some large forms in it - Im preventing any refresh/redirects with a confirm dialog - however, Id like it not to have to do that at all as all other browsers just continue on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is ther anything we can do dom or javascript wise to prevent the browsers from auto refreshing after restoring their connection?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any advice appreciated!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>
<p>

<p>There are signs of a possible hacker's Activation Exploit to get around licensing requirements.</p>
<p>This model usuall ships with Starter Edition, rather than Home Premium - it's likely that someone installed a non-genuine 'upgrade'. If this is the case, you should back up your data to external media, and then use the manufacturer's Recovery media to revert
 back to the original OS.</p>

<h2>            Cannot play songs error This computer is not authorized to play this song</h2>
                    <p>Original title : Just this past week (11/8/12) my media player issued a warning on a few of my songs (e.g. Carole King).&nbsp; The warning is "This computer is not authorized to play this song!" ANY HELP?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a Microsoft Window that popped up since it was labled - "Media Usage Rights Acquisition" &amp; "Services.entertainment.msn.com"</p>
<p>Why is Microsoft trying to prevent me from playing songs that I purchased?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>MS ANSWER DESK referred me to a ResetDRM solution, but when I tried to download it, it said that it only applies to Windows XP</p>
<p>and Windows Vista. So, does that mean that, since I have Windows 7, that I am out of luck?!</p>

            <p>Hi StanleyCammieDaisy,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in the Microsoft Community. I’m sorry to know that you have issues with Windows Media Player.</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Have you made any recent changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span>Reply with above information to help you better.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>However, I’m glad to provide you with these steps which will help you to resolve issue with Windows Media Player.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1</span></b><span>:</span></p>
<p>Open Windows media player setting troubleshooter. Follow the steps in the link:</p>
<p>“Open the Windows Media Player Settings troubleshooter”</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Media-Player-Settings-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Media-Player-Settings-troubleshooter</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><b><span>Method 2</span></b></span><span><span>:</span></span></p>
<p>If the above step <span>disable and enable Windows Media Player from Windows feature on or off follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Click the <b>Start</b> button, click
<b>Control Panel</b>, click <b>Programs</b>, and then click <b>Turn Windows features on or off</b>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>To turn off <b>Windows Media Player</b>, click on
<b>Media feature</b>. And <b>uncheck Windows Media Player</b> and click on <b>OK</b>.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 3</b>:</p>
<p>If the issue still occurs, You may try resetting the DRM licenses and check if the issue persists.</p>

 After the following process is complete, you have to reacquire DRM licenses for your Windows 7-based computer.</p>
<p>Download the ResetDRM tool and save it to your desktop. To download this file, visit the following Web site:</p>
<p><a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=105000" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=105000</a></p>

    <title>Rant Against Windows 8 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> thinking&#33;  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rant Against Windows 8</h2>
                    Where should I start about this operating system. Describing all of its flaws is no different than trying to describe each tree in a Siberian forest. I will start with a few.
<br />
<br />
1) Automatic updates is terrible. Yes it can be turned off, but out of curiosity I decided to let it run. What ended up happening was my machine being frozen for no less that 30 minutes as the auto updates tried and failed to install.
<br />
<br />
2) Automatic updates tells you nothing about what is being updated, which is also highly frustrating. I suppose that this is inherited behavior - but the user should not under any circumstances have his or her machine hijacked by autoupdates at any time.
<br />
<br />
3) This is the first time that I have ever been advertised to on my own machine. Yes, windows 8 is advertising to its users to try Norton anti virus software. This gives the impression that the computer you buy belongs to microsoft, and that you are simply
 leasing it.<br />
<br />
4) The tiles. A lot has been said about this. But I would like to chip in here. This design might work well for a phone, but is definitely not suitable for a desktop or laptop environment. I understand here that Microsoft is trying to be friendly to the trendies
 here, but this really is not cool. It gives a very poor feel to the overall functioning of the operating system.
<br />
<br />
5) You have no control over the machine .... at all ... on a system level. At this point the operating system seems really to be more or less read only. Installing software seems painstaking. The internals of the machine are not available to the users.
<br />
<br />
6) The quickboot/secure boot is difficult to disable. If you want to boot some other OS, then you are more than likely going to spend some time trying to even get into the BIOS of your machine. This is clearly done to obfuscate the option of booting linux on
 any commercial laptop. This shows that Microsoft is clearly worried about losing market share, and is trying to lock its users into using windows. Many laptops I have tried boot relentlessly into windows.<br />
<br />
7) The use of the word "we" in the dialogues which are coded in the OS ... this is a personal matter. Look Microsoft, this is my computer, and to be honest I dont want anything to do with YOU. The only reason I am dealing with YOU is that I have not had time
 to delete YOUR operating system from MY computer. If YOU would have stuck with XP (which was a much better OS) I would be much more interested in giving you my business.
<br />
<br />
8) The integration with the microsoft accounts. If you want to use a program you have to verify and verify and verify with your microsoft account.&nbsp; You are forced to register everything with microsoft before you use any of the software on the machine.
<br />

9) Appification. Since when have programs become apps ... especially on a laptop !!!! All I want is a desktop from which I can open a command line and run the programs I want to run (or in the case of XP or 7 click my way to the programs I want to run). I do
 not like this appification - everything is an app ... if you want more apps you have use another app to buy them and register with your microsoft account. In just using this OS for 3 days, I feel like I have been coerced into a marriage with microsoft ....
 I want a divorce. <br />
<br />
10) Crashing ... programs will suddenly and unexpectedly crash in windows 8 ... and the OS will not boot reliably. In these few days of using windows 8 I have seen these rotating balls on a string no less than 10 times. I am not really sure why this is happening,
 because the OS does not have a readily available dmesg or log which allows you to see what it is doing. Again this problem of hiding the actual mechanics of the OS from the user.
<br />
<br />
11) Look Microsoft, if you want to maintain your status with regards to being the premier software company in the world, you need to produce good software that give people a freedom and flexibility with their machines. If you produce good software, then people
 will pay for it and speak positively about the company. I know you have good software engineers over there ... but build in a personal touch and a sense of user friendliness and control. Give the users options of which versions of windows they would like to
 have, and design operating systems which appeal to users in different categories. What is good for the common user will simply not work for the software engineer.
<br />
<br />
12) Please change the design philosophy of Windows, as well as the overall architecture of the OS. If you do, then I may come back to windows in the future. If things continue as they are then I will either delete the operating system as soon as I boot the
 machine on the first run, or I will order a laptop from some company in Taiwan with a blank hard disk. I will only give my business to a company who is producing a product supports the creativity of its users.

            Did you do an upgrade or did your system come with Win8 installed. Some of the problems could be due to stuff your manufacturer put on. I've never had any ads show up on my systems (except in the Windows Store) and I've used Win8.x for over a year now<br />
<br />
1 - I haven't had any problems with updates hijacking my system, but I tend to check for them and install manually when possible. Sounds like a problem with the configuration.<br />
<br />
2 - That's why I do it manually - so I can see what's going to be installed. You can check the update history after the fact, but checking what's going to be updated is smart.<br />
<br />
3 - People keep complaining about ads. I've never seen one, except in Windows Store, and the occasional free app, which is how the developer pays for it. If you don't want ads, but the program. But ads in the main interface? That's either a virus or something
 the pc maker added.<br />
<br />
4 - I love the tiles. It's a dramatic improvement over the wall of text that passed for the Start Menu. How is it a poor feel? I love the flexibility - for the first time since Progman was retired, I can organize my programs easily and quickly. And I can skim
 icons, rather than squint at a long text list (multi-column in XP - whose brilliant idea was that nightmare?)<br />
<br />
5 - Control Panel is still around - Charms - PC settings and then you have a choice between the Modern side controls and the more comprehensive Control Panel, where you have a lot of control over your machine.
<br />
<br />
8 - Actually, you're not forced to use a Microsoft account. You can easily tell it to use a local account. I chose to use a MS account because I felt the benefits - integrated Skydrive, syncing info between my 3 machines - were worth it. Besides, I already
 used my MS account for my phone and XBox.<br />
<br />
9 - You don't have to use the apps, unless you want to work in Modern. Traditional applications work just fine on the desktop.<br />
<br />
10 - Are you getting any error messages? Any info in your logs you could post? Crashing, especially constant crashing, isn't the norm. Something is going wrong in your setup. I or someone else here might be able to help.<br />
<br />
11/12 - I think the design and architecture of Windows 8 is the best yet. Certainly more integration between the Modern and legacy portions would be appreciated, but I like the direction they're going. You have more options about how to work than ever - the
 traditional powerhouse supperapps of the desktop or small specialized programs in Modern. And you use either or both depending on your needs at the moment or even just on a whim.
<br />
<br />
Windows 8 gives you more flexibility than any version of Windows prior. IMO it's the best Windows yet (though not without its flaws)<br />

            <p>For #3, this is the fault of the manufacturer of the laptop. My guess says you went with one of the big names like HP or Dell. Take your complaint to them. They are the ones who do the install of Windows 8 and add all the little extra programs like Norton
 Antivirus, links to EBay/Amazon/Netflix, etc. These do not appear if you put the Windows 8 retail disc and did the install yourself (which by the way is extremely easy - I went from a blank hard drive to logged into Windows 8 in about&nbsp;15 minutes).</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I would recommend you seek technical support for your issues (that is if you are not technical yourself). There are various logs explaining why the Windows Updates failed but you need to be an advanced user to find them and make sense of them. I can help
 you find them if you wish to pursue your own technical support.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>But in regards to the tiles/apps, they are extremely easy to use and are like a bonus to the operating system's original desktop environment. You just need to know how they work and there are free tutorials available online to explain everything.</p>

<li>Updates freezing your PC.<br />
Never had that happen to me on my machines.<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li>Auto Updates doesn't say what's been installed.<br />
Auto Updates have worked that way since Windows 98. But in Windows Vista/7/8, you can always click "Update History" and see what's been installed. Sounds like that's what you want, have you tried it?<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li>PC advertises Norton to you.<br />
That's not Microsoft's fault, your manufacturer put it there.&nbsp; Just like my car dealer put their "Joe's Dodge City" sticker on my bumper.&nbsp; That's not Dodge's fault, the retailer did it.<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li>Tiles are not useful for non-tablets.<br />
That's why you have the desktop - you can use it just like Windows 7 and never see the tiles.<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li>"The internals of the machine are not available to the users."<br />
Yes they are, you are the admin. You can do literally anything. There's nothing blocking you.<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li>"The quickboot/secure boot is difficult to disable."<br />
No it's not. It takes roughly 30 seconds and a simple click on my Dell computer. You reboot, go to Bios, and click the button to turn it off.<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li>"we" is used in dialogs.<br />
No comment.<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li>"You are forced to register everything with microsoft before you use any of the software on the machine."<br />
False. You can use the same software you used in Windows 7, and it will never request an account.<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li>"Everything is an app and requires registration"<br />
False. You can use any software you want (like the command line you mentioned).&nbsp; App is just a short word for application.&nbsp; And application and programs are the same thing.&nbsp; It's just an abbreviation.&nbsp; Just like truck and pickup are commonly used to refer to
 the same thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li>Crashing.<br />
Again I've never had this issue. Your machine has problems. Maybe you exercised too much of that control in item number 5 and messed stuff up.<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li>"give people a freedom and flexibility with their machines"<br />
you have it.&nbsp; There is nothing stopping you from doing anything with your machine. Anything you did on Windows XP or 7 is still there. Nothing was taken away from you.&nbsp; If you think something was taken away from you, please name it.<br />
<br />
<br />
</li><li>"Supports creativity."<br />
Again, you have all the creativity.&nbsp; Can you name something that you lost?</li></ol>

<h3> compdude123  say:</h3>
<h2>            Explorer.exe has requested the runtime to terminate it in an unusual way.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>Recently, I had to replace my hard drive. After installing Vista, and running the WD System Align Utility, I attempted to copy my files out of the folder I had restored them to. My files were stored in many different folders. When I attempted to copy one
 of the folders out, I right-clicked on it, clicked copy, went to the folder I was going to paste in it, clicked paste, and I recieved this message:</p>
<p>Runtime error!</p>
<p>Program: C:\Windows\explorer.exe</p>
<p>This application has requested the runtime to terminate it in an unusual way.</p>
<p>Please contact the application's support team for more information.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that, the Windows GUI restarts. No folder on the computer will copy, but the files inside them will copy fine. Folders will cut fine. I have tried a Startup Repair, a Clean Boot, "sfc /scannow", running Internet Explorer without add-ons, and chkdsk.
 Does anyone have any suggestions?</p>

            Do you have&nbsp;&nbsp;FTP Explorer from FTPx Corp installed? Its shell extension appears to be tossing an exception that is not handled, and this causes explorer to crash. &nbsp;Check for updates to the FTP Explorer program, disabled the shell extension either from
 the program's options, if it has any, or using e.g. Autoruns or ShellExView, or uninstall FTP Explorer and possibly find an alternative program that offers comparable functionality.&nbsp;

<h2>            Ugee 1910B Graphics tablet off sync</h2>
                    <p>I've been using an Ugee pen tablet for a little over a year now and had no problems, until one of the Windows 10 updates. After making sure there was nothing wrong with the calibration, testing and resetting and resyncing, I'm slowly beginning to believe
 that it was due to the recent windows update, (the windows fall developer update I believe). I have no issue using a mouse when using it as a secondary screen and I do use it as a secondary screen when not used as a tablet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm confident its not my graphics card either having played around with the drivers and it's been no different.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I say it is off sync, I mean as in the point of the pen on the surface of the tablet is approximately 2 - 3 inches off from where the cursor says the pen should.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be grateful of any suggestions or fixes you could suggest.</p>

<p>Hi Noonkin,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since the issue occured after installing a Windows update, there is a possibility that this is due to an outdated device driver or a software glitch. To isolate the issue, kindly perform the following steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Uninstall the current Ugee 1910B driver.</li><li>Disconnect your device from your computer.</li><li>Restart your computer.</li><li>Download and install the latest&nbsp;Ugee 1910B driver directly from the manufacturer's website.</li><li>Connect it to your device.&nbsp;</li><li>Perform PEN calibration. Please refer to your device manual for instructions or call Ugee tech support for further assistance.</li><li>Check if the issue persists.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>If you've already tried these steps, our next would be uninstalling the update that caused the issue. Go to Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; View installed update history &gt; Uninstall updates. Click the most recent update that caused the issued
 then click Uninstall. Don't forget to restart your PC after this process.</p>
<p>
