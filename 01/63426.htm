<h3> tomg2049  say:</h3>
<h2>            Skype Number</h2>
                    <p>I just tried to obtain a Skype number (re: telephone #). The signup/request process suggested a number and location; however, I would like to have a number/location (area code) in Nebraska. When I tried to select "Nebraska" from the drop-down list box, it
 appears that every state is listed EXCEPT Nebraska. What!? Am I missing something, or is a Skype number with a Nebraska location/area code not possible? Please advise. Thanks.</p>

<p>
</p><p>Meanwhile, if you haven't tried to uninstall the microphone driver and let Windows install the default driver, kindly check this

            Hi, my windows version is 1709, build 16299.125. I didn't make any changes that I can recall. I have done a lot of stuff to troubleshoot, however, I am very limited of ways that I can troubleshoot because the microphone doesn't show up in device manager
 or anywhere else on my PC. The microphone shouldn't need drivers as it is "plug and play." I have heard that windows might be installing the wrong drivers to the microphone, but, I don't know how to check that.

    <title>Unable to connect to both LAN and Wireless Internet connection at same - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Unable to connect to both LAN and Wireless Internet connection at same time</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Hoping someone can help. I have 2 laptops and a wireless internet router.<br />
<br />
Laptop 1 is a Win 7 machine, from which I am sharing files to Laptop 2 (XP). Originally I created a homegroup and shared wirelessly, but the connection was too slow, so now I have connected the two Laptops via cross-over cable and the speed is much better.
 Here is my problem...<br />
<br />
LAN and wireless internet seem to work in a mutually exclusive way on the XP machine. To connect the XP machine to my Win7 machine via LAN crossover I have to disconnect the wireless connection on the XP machine, otherwise the LAN connection does not work (e.g.
 the software on the XP machine - Quickbooks - cannot&nbsp;see the shared file on the Win7 machine). Likewise to use the wireless internet on the XP machine, I have to disable the LAN on the XP machine.<br />
If I turn on both wireless and LAN connection on the XP machine neither one (Wireless or Lan) will connect succesfully on the XP machine.</p>
<p>I am not trying to share internet access from the Win 7 machine via LAN, just the shared files on the WIn 7 machine. I want the XP machine to have it's own wireless internet connection, and to see the shared files on the Win7 machine at the same time.<br />
The Win 7 machine however is able to connect to both seamlessly.<br />
<br />
Any ideas?<br />
<br />
Thanks<br />
<br />
Lee</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p><strong>It cannot work this way.</strong></p>
<p>Two Network cards (does not matter Wire or Wireless) in the same computer cannot work on the same Network at the same time when using Windows client OS, as oppose to real server like Windows 2008).</p>
<p>You can configure the second Wire card on each computer as a different Network with a Static IP.</p>
<p>Then unbind the sharing from the Wireless and bind only the wire card to the File Sharing (check/uncheck in the TCP/IP properties.</p>
<p>Second network means different subnet.</p>
<p><strong>On Subnet</strong> <br />
<br />
Classical IP looks like this (example), 192.168.<strong>1</strong> .x&nbsp; The first three groups are also called Subnet , and they identify the specific Network, x can be a number from 0 to 255 and it identifies each unique device on the Network.<br />
<br />
An IP of 192.168.<strong>2</strong> .x&nbsp; would be a Subnet of another Network.<br />
<br />
Subnet and Firewall.<br />
<br />
Most Software Firewall can set a Trusted Zone (&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ezlan.net/faq#trusted" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> http://www.ezlan.net/faq#trusted</a> &nbsp; ).&nbsp; I.e., if your subnet at home is 192.168.1 .x any device that has different subnet will not be allowed to pass. Two Network
 cards (does not matter Wire or Wireless) in the same computer cannot work on the same Network at the same time when using Windows client OS, as oppose to real server like Windows 2008).<br />
<br />
You can configure the second Wire card on each computer as a different Network with a Static IP.<br />
<br />
Then unbind the sharing from the Wireless and bind only the wire card to the File Sharing (check/uncheck in the TCP/IP properties.<br />
<br />

            <p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>1.What is the make and model of the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>2.What is the security software installed on the computer?</span></p>
<p><span>3.Did you make any changes to the computer recently?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 1.</span></b></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to follow the steps from this article.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Troubleshoot problems when you cannot install Internet Explorer 9:

<p><b><span>Note:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Antivirus software can help protect your computer against viruses and other security threats. In most cases, you
 shouldn't disable the antivirus software. If you have to temporarily disable it to install other software, you should enable it as soon as you're done. If you're connected to the Internet or a network while your antivirus software is disabled, your computer
 is vulnerable to attacks.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Method 2.</b></p>

    <title>Sound keeps skipping. Does not matter where the sound comes from. - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Sound keeps skipping. Does not matter where the sound comes from.</h2>
                    
<p>Hello. Sorry if this isn't the right place to put this but it seemed fit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what I have here is an issue with the audio on my computer. I have an Acer Aspire 5741-5763</p>
<p>The specs:</p>
<p>Intel Core i3-350M processor</p>
<p>(2.26Ghz, 3mB L3 cache)</p>
<p>Intel HD graphics (Up to 1755 DVMT)</p>
<p>4GB memory</p>
<p>320 GB HDD</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The issue is that the sound skips out on anything I do.</p>
<p>I've cleaned up my computer, defragged, got rid of almost everything on my computer and &nbsp;have backed up everything to an external harddrive. I am thinking I might just wipe it clean and return it to factory standards. However I don't want to because of the
 sole fact of reinstalling all of my programs and I can't find my antivirus serial code...so I was hoping to get it fixed because it doesn't expire until August.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I read that it had to do something with probably a spike in the processes going on in the background and the only weird thing I found was that I have 11 svchost.exe running in the background. The top one is at 144,672k and that just seems wrong. I read that
 you can get viruses from that but I've ran multiple virus checks with different programs and my computer hits the clear every time.</p>
<p>Another odd thing I noticed was that under my performances tab on the task manager is that it spikes pretty frequently. I have stopped all excess background programs so I don't quite know what to say... another thing that I noticed is that in my "Physical
 memory (Mb) my total is 3766, my cached is 1992, my available is 1969, but my free amount never gets higher than 50 which is really weird....or at least I think so maybe that is normal?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>II've tried everything I've read on the web....well almost I've tried at least 2 sites if not more a night for the last week and a half. One good thing came out of it though... my files got organized haha.</p>
<p>I appreciate all of your help. Thanks!</p>
<p>Kineric</p>

    <title>Should I be concerned about javaws.exe running 1000&#39;s of Image - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sharpshorts  say:</h3>
<h2>            Should I be concerned about javaws.exe running 1000&#39;s of Image Names&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Do you think this issue may be causing some hidden problems or longer term system degradation that I'm not aware of?</p>
<p>It's odd that this issue has actually benefited my machine's operation :</p>
<p>
</p><p>About 5 minutes after every Start, Restart or Log-off/log-on, jsched.exe*32 will start javaws.exe, up to 15,000 Image Names build in Task Manager's Process tab...Physical Memory will approach 100% before an error message window pops up or a warning sound
 is heard. Then the extra Image Names and high Physical Memory percentages start to decline..this takes a total of 4 to 5 minutes to complete...</p>
<p>Afterwards, Task Manager shows &nbsp;my "normal" number of Processes and "normal" CPU Usage
<em><strong>BUT</strong></em>&nbsp;it shows a <strong>30% LOWER Physical Memory</strong> percentage than before...AND CPU core temperatures run about 10% lower.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have been running my machine this way for the past two weeks, 10 to 12 hours a day...I have noticed no ill effects - I can still run multiple programs, browsers etc with a the added benefit of not having to deal with closing and reopening one of my 64-bit
 programs that used to "slow down" after a few hours...</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can prevent the above from happening by right clicking jsched.exe and selecting End Process or by unchecking the box for Java Platform SE Auto Updater on the Startup tab in System Configuration...<br />
</p>
<p>I'm also reluctant to take the Java Update that's available as it might "fix" the multiple javaws.exe issue...the few minutes it takes to do it's thing does not bother me as long as my machine continues to perform great...</p>
<p>
</p><p>This link goes to a page on one of my blogs where I document the issue further...<a href="http://sharpshortsdaytrades.blogspot.com/p/weird-windows-stuff.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Weird Windows Stuff</a>&nbsp;.</p>
<p>The picture shows the Task Manager before, during and after javaws.exe has done it's thing:</p>

            I have seen this on several of my clients' computers.&nbsp; The solution I found that works is to uninstall java.&nbsp; You have to be prepared to do it quickly as Windows starts.&nbsp; The problem takes 30 seconds or so to get going.&nbsp; It may take several attempts to
 do it quickly enough.

<h2>            Dell AIO Photo 944 not printing in Windows 10</h2>
                    After installing Windows 10, I have found that my Dell Printer 944 will not print.&nbsp; It works for all functions, scanning for photos and in Adobe, and independently.&nbsp; The device manager tells me it's working.&nbsp; I installed the latest drivers.&nbsp; But when I
 go to print a document, nothing happens.&nbsp; In Word, the printer is selected and all systems seem to say go.&nbsp; Yet there is nothing in the queue when I click on print.&nbsp; I checked the spooler and that says it's running.&nbsp; Any ideas on how to get this to print would
 be appreciated.&nbsp; I did all of the trouble shooting programs and they say everything is OK.&nbsp; Thanks in advance, Mark.<br />

            This solution did not solve my problem.&nbsp; I followed all of the instructions and tried to put my printer in compatibility mode, which I did with Windows XP.&nbsp; However, while doing all functions, recognizing the printer, etc., it still does not send what
 I want printed to the printing queue.&nbsp; Nothing prints.&nbsp; I click on print and the printer icon shows up in my taskbar, but it shows there is nothing to print.&nbsp; I was able to do the compatibility thing in Windows 8.1, but it's not working in Windows 10.

 nothing happened and not a single light of problem is on.

<h2>            Program Can&#39;t Run because MSVCR110.dll Missing</h2>
                    <p>Hi,&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to install the WampServer on my computer and keep getting an error saying:</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Program cannot start because MSVCR110.dll file is missing from your computer".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Every website I looked on told me to download the Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2012 Update 4 from this link:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30679 </p>
<p>
</p><p>Every time I download it and run the application nothing happens. The application will run and do the setup and the last screen will just say "setup complete" and the only option is to the hit the close button. But when I look at the programs list in the
 control panel, the file I had downloaded is NOT the same type as the&nbsp;Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio from previous years. Also, when I search for the msvcr110.dll file from the start button, two files do show up as being on my computer (regardless
 of whether I install the the 2012 update or not).<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone can me help figure out what is wrong, that would be great!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            <p>Hi Paulbnz,<br />
<br />
<span>Thank you for writing to Microsoft Communities.
<br />
<br />
I understand how frustrating it could be when things do not work as expected. Please do not worry I will try my best to resolve it.<br />
<br />
Before we start troubleshooting on the issue please provide us with the additional information by answering few questions mentioned below, this will help us to troubleshoot better.<br />
<br />
<span>&nbsp;</span>Where are you checking for the disk space?<br />
<br />
<b>Method 1</b><br />
I would suggest you to run disk clean up and see if you get back the disk space.<br />
<br />
Delete files using Disk Cleanup<br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/delete-files-disk-cleanup" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-8/delete-files-disk-cleanup</a><br />
<br />
<b>Note: </b>When you run the disk clean up you may lose some files which are unused for long time and old restore points.<br />
<br />
<b>Method 2<br />
</b>I would suggest you to go to the disk management and check for the disk space.<br />
<br />
a. Press Windows key + C<br />

You can solve some computer problems by checking a drive or drives for errors. For example, you can check your computer's primary hard disk to fix some performance issues, or you can check an external hard drive if it's not working properly.</span></p>
<p><span>a. Open Computer by Pressing Windows key + C , type computer.<br />
b. Right-click the drive that you want to check, and then click Properties.<br />
c. Click the Tools tab, and then, under Error-checking, click Check now.<span>&nbsp;
</span>If you're prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span>To automatically repair problems with files and folders that the scan detects, select Automatically fix file system
 errors. Otherwise, the disk check will report problems but not fix them.</span></p>
<p><span>To perform a thorough check, select Scan for and attempt recovery of bad sectors. This scan attempts to find and repair
 physical errors on the drive itself, and it can take much longer to complete. 
</span></p>
<p><span>To check for both file errors and physical errors, select both Automatically fix file system errors and Scan for and
 attempt recovery of bad sectors.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Click Start.</span></p>
<p><span>Depending on the size of your drive, this might take several minutes. For best results, don't use your computer for
 any other tasks while it is checking for errors.<br />
<br />

            <p>Hi </p>
<p>Thanks.&nbsp; I have done all this - had done it already.&nbsp; I am not a computer novice.</p>
<p>When I recently purchased a new SSD I installed my Windows 7 at the time and set it up carefully for peak performance.&nbsp; I was very happy with the disc space used, boot time and overall performance.</p>
<p>Then I upgraded to Windows 8 (clean install as I had backed up all files to an external drive)&nbsp;and immediately lost considerable disc space, even after deleting Windows.old and all other unnecessary files).&nbsp; I was also disappointed as boot time was no faster,
 in fact it was slower.</p>
<p>Then I had to 'Refresh' and have lost even more disc space.&nbsp; I've done all the cleaning up I can but am overall very disappointed that so much of my SSD disc space has been taken up.</p>
<p>I'd like to reduce disc space if possible so any other suggestions welcome.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

            I think the reason for lost drive space is simple. Win 8 makes a partition with no drive letter! Appox. 128 mb! You can't see it in disk management or most disk tools. I have read that you need to go into dsk. mgt. and assign a drive letter. Haven't done
 it yet. You can find the info on Microsoft website for dev's look under BCD stores and Windows Boot Manager.<br />
Hope this helps!<br />

            <p>This is likely the reason right here. Win 8 uses GPT and not MBR to organize the disk.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There are additional partitions you do not see and those partitions use up some disk space.</p>
<p>
</p><p>GPT has both goo and bad qualities. On the good side, you can have more than 4 primary partitions on the drive. On the bad side, it is much more difficult to create a true ghost or clone of your partition or drive.&nbsp; The standard tools such as Partition Commander
 do not yet work with GPT partitioning.&nbsp; Also, even when installing Win 8 or 8.1 from a DVD a "Recovery" partition will be created on the drive in addition to the boot partition and OS partition resulting in less disk space available for other apps and data.</p>

            <p>Hello Paul,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I wanted to tell&nbsp;you that I was having the same problem but some another reason. So, as Vijay said&nbsp;I went to the Disk Management and&nbsp;I saw that there are 2 extra drives other than Local Disk C: and their status was they were a&nbsp;Restore Partition, which comes
 when you restore, refresh or reset your PC. There is no thing to worry about. But now don't&nbsp;restore your&nbsp;PC anymore cause&nbsp;as much&nbsp;you restore or&nbsp;refresh, the partition will increase and you wouldn't have space on your&nbsp;PC.&nbsp;In my problem, the reason to&nbsp;refresh
 was as I&nbsp;tried to restart my&nbsp;PC it&nbsp;said that&nbsp;Windows couldn't load properly.&nbsp;So, I used automatic repair and refreshed my&nbsp;PC. Yeah, it deleted some&nbsp;apps and games but now my PC is working like a new PC.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks&nbsp;for reading and I hope that this information may be helpful to you.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate the effort made towards trying to fix it&nbsp;yourself. Let's try the following:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Place the computer in clean boot state</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Placing your system in Clean Boot state helps in identifying if any third party applications or startup items are causing the issue. You need to follow the steps from the article mentioned below to perform a Clean Boot.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135/en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)"><span>How to perform a clean boot in Windows</span></span></strong></a><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Note</span></strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">:
<em>Refer "<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>" to reset the computer to start as normal after troubleshooting.</em></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> To Turn&nbsp;Off Toggle Keys Tone in Settings:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Open the Settings app, and click/tap on the <strong>Ease of Access
</strong>icon.<br />
<span><strong>2.</strong></span> Click/tap on Keyboard on the left side, and turn ON or OFF (default) to
<strong>Hear a tone when you press Caps Lock, Num Lock, and Scroll Lock</strong> under
<strong>Toggle Keys</strong>. </p>
<p><span><strong>3.</strong></span> When finished, you can close Settings if you like.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 3: </strong>Turn Off Toggle Keys Tone in Control Panel </p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>1.</strong> Open the Control Panel (icons view), and click/tap on the <strong>
Ease of Access Center</strong> icon.<br />
<span><strong>2.</strong></span> Click/tap on either the <strong>Make the keyboard easier to use</strong> or
<strong>Make it easier to focus on tasks</strong> settings link. </p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Check (on) or uncheck (off - default) <strong>Turn on Toggle Keys</strong> for what you want set, and click/tap on
<strong>OK</strong>. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this information is helpful. Please feel free to reply in case you face any other issues with Windows in future.</p>

    <title>Can I reuse Windows 7 Professional key&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> yusufpandor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Can I reuse Windows 7 Professional key&#63;</h2>
                    Hey,
<div>Been using Windows 7 for a couple of months now and I must say, im absolutely loving it.</div>
<div>The other day whilst visiting some dodgy site offering a video converter, I picked up a virus.</div>
<div>Now I have tried AVG and an anti-spyware program, and both can detect the virus but not effectively deal with it.</div>
<div>I am left with a frustrating user experience which includes Windows crashes, many notifications and general slow performance, on what is a fast laptop. I am fed up of trying to patch things up and think that the best method would be to format the HDD and
 reinstall Windows.</div>
<div>Now, my question is, when I reinstall Windows, will my product key be reusable?</div>
<div>I picked up my copy of Windows 7 on the £30 student offer and am worried about the license use.</div>
<div>Like what do I do, can I deactivate Windows somehow, then upon reinstall just use the same key?</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Anyone have any advice on the system would work?</div>
<div>Thanks.</div>

                </div>

<p>Hi<br />
<br />
The Windows 7 Product Key (License) is perpetual, it never expires. You can reuse the key as many times as you wish, as long as the operating system is only installed on one computer at a time.
<br />
<br />
The Student version of Windows 7 is the Retail, Upgrade version. You will need to perform the installation the same way you did when you originally installed it.
<br />
<br />
The product key that you used to activate the first installation is kept on the Activation Servers at Microsoft. After you reinstall, you may need to perform a manual activation, which means that you may need to use the telephone option when you activate. Here
 are the instructions for a manual activation.</p>
<p><span><span>1. From the desktop, press the
<strong><span style="font-weight: bold">Windows Logo Key+R</span></strong>. This will bring up the
<strong><span style="font-weight: bold">Run</span></strong> dialog box.<br />
<br />
2. In the <strong><span style="font-weight: bold">Open:</span></strong> box, type&nbsp;&nbsp;
<strong><span style="font-weight: bold">slui 4</span></strong>&nbsp; and press OK. This will start the manual activation wizard.
<br />
<br />
3. Select your <strong><span style="font-weight: bold">Country</span></strong> in the drop down menu and click
<strong><span style="font-weight: bold">Next</span></strong>.<br />
<br />
4. The wizard will display a <strong><span style="font-weight: bold">Toll Free phone number</span></strong>.
<strong><span style="font-weight: bold">Leave the wizard open</span></strong> on the computer and
<strong><span style="font-weight: bold">call that phone number</span></strong>.<br />
<br />
You will be given some recorded options. Select the option to talk to a live representative.
<br />
<br />
The representative will manually activate that system for you.<br />
<br />
Let us know if you have any more problems</span></span></p>

    <title>Creating child account for xbox live - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> optimummink8671  say:</h3>
<h2>            Creating child account for xbox live</h2>
                    
<p>I am trying to create an xbox live account for my son. &nbsp;I have created a microsoft account for him, and it is linked to our family account. &nbsp;I logged into his microsoft account and requested an online account, but when it asks for parental permission I have
 a problem. &nbsp;I put in the email address for our microsoft account, but when it opens the window to login, the system will not let me log into my account. &nbsp;I thought maybe it was because I already had a microsoft account open in another browser window, so closed
 the first window. &nbsp;This sort of helped, as it allowed me to log in, but then it navigated to an error message telling me that the page I was looking for is no longer there. &nbsp;So, I have no idea how I am supposed to approve the request if I cannot find it. &nbsp;I
 don't understand why microsoft cannot just email the request to me, so I can approve it from my phone or tablet. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Any advice on how to find this request and approve it? &nbsp; &nbsp;Thanks. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Complaints department</h2>
                    Does anyone know how to get hold of the complaints service as a Microsoft employee(a legit employee) had broken my new computer. I just needed help activating windows but they deleted all my files etc. It is not a scam either I had the reference checked
 over the phone and live chat. I am furious £1300 gone because of a Microsoft employee!

<p>There are no "legit" Microsoft employees providing Technical Support. They are all contract employees primarily in Asia.</p>
<p>You can leave Feedback via the Feedback app in Windows 10 as to the issue. However, be forewarned no one will contact you back.</p>
<p>You can also write (postal, not email) Microsoft HQ and they should route your letter to the correct department.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We don't work for Microsoft.</p>
<p>We are mainly volunteers here, who give other users free advice in our own free time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you wish to make a complaint:</p>
<p>
</p><p>The only way to do this is to contact your Local Microsoft Office by phone or letter with all the details, including Case Number&nbsp;if you have it.</p>
<p>

            Well I'm in from Canada to the United States not send Middle Eastern country 2 years ago and after 6 months I was locked out of my account for 3 months I could not contact them but they sure found a way to contact me now when I was busy talking to the
 manager of Microsoft getting this all set up and all these new add-ons and subscriptions you got to have everything is extra there's an extra that so this agent today who can barely speak English it's telling me that no and belittling me because for his country
 women don't have rights while we're in the United States and we have rights here and I don't need your verbal abuse so I will hang up but he says if you don't have the extra protection of the warranty on your Microsoft account and your computer isn't active
 when there's a major update then it will just boot you out of the system and you need to pay Microsoft to get back in well that sounds like blackmail to me

            I purchased outlook and the same night it was installed my computer crashed. I can only imagine this is no coincidence. I will be taking legal actions once the technicians find out the answer as to why. This is in respect to service request is 1412143650
 and Order #2350310520 . I am furious this has cost me thousands of dollars because I had no computer to do Business. and now will have to pay the tech support hundreds of dollars to hopefully have the issue resolved.&nbsp;&nbsp; I will never trust help again.

<p>If not having a computer can cost you thousands of dollars, wouldn't it be prudent to have a backup computer?&nbsp; Things happen, you know.<br />

            I recently purchased Microsoft visio Professional 2016 from the official website of Microsoft by making a full payment of 42,750 INR. But, the software contains many bugs. The issues are not in installation. The issues are in development of the software.
 It is not developed properly. The support is not helping me. They are mostly not picking up the phone call or (when connected) are unwilling to listen to the problem. I have also given mail to Microsoft. They are also not helping me<br />
<br />
I am myself a software engineer and I am an expert in using Microsoft visio Professional series. I have worked on Microsoft visio Professional 2013 for a couple of years. It was perfect in its functionalities. But, (the latest version) Microsoft visio Professional
 2016 is filled with bugs / issues<br />
<br />
I tried to reach the customer care to Microsoft global team and to Microsoft India. But nobody is willing to help. In last 6 - 7 days, I have made more than 120 - 130 phone calls. Many numbers are not even picked up.<br />
<br />
For example<br />
The number (800) 642 7676 is the contact number of the visio Support as given in the official website of Microsoft. The website itself displayed that the support timings for Indian region is from 7:30 AM to 11:30 AM. Next working day (Monday), I started calling
 the same number at 8 :15 AM and I kept calling on the same number till 11 AM. But, No one picked it up. It was not busy, but ringing.<br />
Out of about 35 calls, only 1 call was picked up and disconnected by a lady within 2 seconds of the call connection.<br />
<br />
Not just that, I tried calling on the number (0124 415 8000) given on the Official facebook page of Microsoft. I kept calling multiple times till I stopped counting the number of calls. But, No one from Microsoft picked up my call.<br />
<br />
Microsoft is unable to accept the fact that they can code something incorrectly.<br />
In fact, my complaint for their defective product was also registered as 'Request for Support from Microsoft'. They asked me that I (Anshul Jain) who has already purchased Microsoft visio Professional 2016 from them for 42,750 INR will have to buy Technical
 support which is worth 4,100 INR for them to even consider a technical discussion / register the complaint, because the the Software provided to me by Microsoft is defective / malfunctioning / filled with bugs.<br />
<br />
1. I am not asking Microsoft to give me any compensation for the loss of my time<br />
<br />
2. Nor I am asking them to apologize<br />
<br />
What I am asking is simply<br />
Either 'Debug the software Microsoft visio Professional 2016 and provide me bug - free software'<br />
<br />
or 'Provide me the key for Microsoft visio Professional 2013'<br />
<br />
There is a chat box given at the bottom of the page for purchase of software. That chat box is for contacting Microsoft before we buy something from Microsoft. I must appreciate that chat box is always active. Even during midnight, from any time - zone, from
 any region, from any country and interestingly It does not even have any delays. (for obvious reasons)<br />
I tried to explain my problem to them also by chat. I have explained the situation to them in detail. They listened to me and agreed with me. Even the sales chat representatives said that what you are saying is genuine and fair. But, they said "We can not do
 anything for you. We are from sales department. We do not have anything to offer you. Our hands are tied". They always give me a service Request Number and say 'Give this number to the Technical support team and they will give you the key of Microsoft visio
 Professional 2013'. But, the number (800) 642 7676 is never picked up at all.<br />
<br />
I even called on 1800 11 11 00, the Customer Hotline number. I spoke the entire issue and tried to explain the issue to the Customer Care executive. He said "We are from the consumer team. The Software you are using comes under Commercial software. For resolving
 its problem you (Anshul Jain) have to make an extra payment of 4,100 INR as paid support. or go to the store / vendor from where you have purchased the product and get your Support ID or Partner ID". I explained I purchased it from the official website of
 Microsoft and was not given any Support ID / Partner ID. I said that I can present the receipt of payment made to Microsoft. But the representative refused to help me.<br />
<br />
Reason :<br />
1. Because I bought the software legally and honestly directly from the official website of Microsoft.<br />
<br />
2. The software given to me by Microsoft is not functioning well.<br />
<br />
So, the Consumer (Anshul Jain) has to make an extra payment of 4,100 INR for raising the complaint against the non - compliance and poor quality of deliverable by Microsoft.<br />
<br />
I called on the contact number given on the Microsoft India website.<br />
The contact number of Delhi Branch (Saket)<br />
+91-11-40514051<br />
could not even be connected. I tried calling on this number about 7 - 8 times<br />
<br />
<br />
I have given 3 emails in last 4 days to Microsoft mail id<br />
*** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />
Even they have not resolved my issue.<br />
<br />
Through Customer chat, I asked if I could get the email address of any senior executive for making complaint if the customer care or Technical support does not resolve my issue. They clearly said that 'We do not provide email address of our senior executives
 as it is confidential'. No customer executive agrees to provide me any email of any senior executive.<br />
<br />
Microsoft is so confident about itself that it does not even provide&nbsp; an option / possibility for any customer allowing them to approach it and just tell if there are any bugs in the software. It assumes that what they make can never have bugs / errors / issues.
 That is highly arrogant from an enterpreneur<br />
Talking about its Customer support, a small table - lamp maker has a better service than Microsoft (considering my last week's experience)<br />
I never expected this kind of an experience from a brand name like Microsoft.<br />
<br />
I Summarize:<br />
I have purchased Microsoft visio Professional 2016 by making payment of 42,750 INR and found it filled with bugs. It is a poor product<br />
Just provide me the key for Microsoft visio Professional 2013.<br />
<br />
regards<br />
Anshul Jain<br />

Although this is a Microsoft hosted site - it is a community site predominantly populated with members of the technical community.&nbsp; Microsoft very much work in partnership with their partner network and the wider tech community.
