<h2>            Windows 7 no longer updates</h2>
                    Please can anybody tell me if MS are still supporting Windows 7.&nbsp; I have not received updates for ages now and when I go into control panel/windows updates and click on check for updates, then I get a box saying 'Windows Update can not currently check
 for updates, because the service is not running'.&nbsp; Any help and advice would be most appreciated.

    <title>How do I copy windows xp installation files to the hard disc&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> the4lanes  say:</h3>
<h2>            How do I copy windows xp installation files to the hard disc&#63;</h2>
                    I hired someone to repair my computer about a year ago.&nbsp; They were out of work, were very skilled and nice enough to come to my house to do the work.&nbsp; I've since lost their cel number and I am unable to contact them.&nbsp; Until I started having some problems
 recently, I didn't realize they installed Windows XP Pro.&nbsp; I own the Home Edition and thought they used my discs when they repaired and cleaned my computer.&nbsp; So... to fix my problems I had to remove Pro and install my Home Edition again.&nbsp; It all seemed to
 be going well, Pro is gone and I was able to pick a partition and the installation seemed to be starting, but then it stops.&nbsp; After several different attempts, I am stuck at the following:<br />
<br />
Setup cannot access the CD containing the Windows XP Installation files.&nbsp; To retry, press ENTER.&nbsp; (Retried, doesn't work.)&nbsp; If you are not successful after several tries (wasn't), quit Setup.&nbsp; Then to restart Setup, copy the Windows XP installation files to
 your hard disk.&nbsp; To quit, press F3.<br />
<br />
It has been decades since I took any classes that used DOS, but even so I don't know where to find the installation files or how or where to copy them.&nbsp; I'm guessing I leave the disc in my D drive and type something like XCOPY D:*.* C:*.*&nbsp; but I'm clueless
 and afraid of messing things up even more.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help me?

            I used the cd and followed the directions.&nbsp; Something was going on with the PC, which was why I decided to "start over" and wipe it clean.&nbsp; I don't have anything important on there so data loss isn't an issue, but I'd like to have a computer.&nbsp; So, you
 don't think I should try to copy the files to my hard disk?&nbsp; (Which I don't know how to do anyway.)&nbsp; I don't know that I have any other options because I don't have the funds to hire anyone anymore.

            I am having problems with that same error.&nbsp; I am trying to install windows xp pro on my acer one laptop;&nbsp; it doesn't have a cd-rom, so I had to use WinSetupFromUSB to convert the xp cd to my usb flash drive.&nbsp; I am in step 1 out of 3 of installing it, and
 after it formats and wipes out the C: it goes to that error.&nbsp; If I exit setup, and the computer attempts to boot, it gives me the error message "NTLDR is missing, Press Ctrl+Alt+Del to restart".&nbsp; I am totally lost now because I don't have any idea if it's
 my flash drive, my computer, or what is wrong with it.&nbsp; Maybe I need to get the NTLDR?&nbsp; Any help would be GREAT.&nbsp; Also,&nbsp; my internet access will not allow me to go to that website where I'm at right now; When I get home I'll give it a try.&nbsp; THANKS<br />

    <title>Xbox One Power Supply Failure - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jackiejackatar  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Power Supply Failure</h2>
                    
<p>Okay let me just start by saying that I followed all proper warranty channels to have my failed power supply replaced, and it was. Only several months after the fact, Xbox decided to send me back my original power supply, thinking they may have fixed it,
 I plugged it in, nothing, okay...why would they send me back my broken supply? So being that it was useless anyway, and I already had a replacement months before, I decided to take it upon myself to investigate why my original decided to explode. (Yes it literally
 made a loud BANG, with a bright flash of blue light when it failed, it still smells like burning)</p>
<p>**Small disclaimer, please don't ever take it upon yourself to open any power supply, as most contain high power capacitors that could seriously injure or kill you if you don't know what you are doing.**</p>

<p>So I will let the pictures do most of the talking here as it shows the complete story as to why this unit failed, but in brief heres what i believe happened.</p>
<p>1: First and foremost, take note of the screw hole that punched through the fan housing and into the inductive portion of the fan shroud, there was no evidence anywhere to be found of a loose screw, nor was there any evidence of the screw holes through any
 other exterior parts of the housing surrounding the fan assembly. its a mystery as to how it was done, but its quite clearly a screw hole.</p>
<p>2: Secondly, (and obviously) this fan likely had never worked, from day 1. The console at time of failure was only about 2 months old, my theory is it took that long for the power supply to significantly be affected by repeated overheating conditions. This
 may have been prolonged since it was used in my basement which is usually cold (15C-ish), and was only used for short periods of time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>3: In all the other pictures I tried to accurately show where i think this thing ultimately failed, because the fan was not doing a *** thing, stuff obviously got hot, but the most pronounced area is next to two high power transistors/amplifiers and a large
 capacitor. This capacitor has all kinds of carbon tracing all over the side of it, even some can be seen on the neighboring transformer, the transistors/amplifiers also look very full of carbon and it appears both have a crack running through them.</p>
<p>In conclusion I believe because of this terrible terrible quality control on the fan, it led to this thing literally melting itself down until failure. I have yet to show Xbox support these pictures but hope it can gain some traction here. Also I would really
 like to know how/who/what they investigated into this power supply the 4 months they had it...it took me 3 minutes to find the cause of failure.</p>
<p>hopefully this link works for the pictures, the forum wont let me upload.. :(</p>

<p>I'm no expert but that's clearly the problem, also the mod didn't do his cover up real well. That's obviously a screw shape as well as not supposed to be written all over it.

<h2>            USB Modem Not Working</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I am trying to use a Conexant USB CX93010 ACF Modem on Windows 10 and it says that I have the latest Driver for the device but I am getting this message in the Properties and the device won't work.&nbsp; It did prior to Windows 10 on Win7.</p>
"Device USB\VID_0572&amp;PID_1324\24680246 requires further installation."&nbsp; I'm using it (attempting) on a Dell Precision M3800.&nbsp; Can someone please help me with this?</div>

            <p>Just a quick update from me on this issue...</p>
<p>
</p><p>As as much as I tried I was never successful at getting the modem to work on my Dell 3800 laptop running Win 10. I decided to try a different modem, one that was described as Win 10 compatible. I purchased a HiRO H50113, downloaded the Win 10 driver from
 the manufacturers website and installed it all. &nbsp;Everything worked as I hoped it would so at this point the issue has been resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks again for any help/suggestions received!</p>

<h2>            System thread exception not handled - cyclic restarting</h2>
                    <p>Hi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My laptop is getting on a bit and can overheat. This morning it did just that and shut itself down.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I go to restart it some time later, and Windows 10 is trying to do something called 'preparing automatic repair '. After a moment of trying this, I get 'your pc ran in to a problem and needs to restart. We'll restart for you.'. &nbsp;This screen also gives the
 above error code.</p>
<p>
</p><p>At this point it restarts and does the same thing again. Thus it's going round in circles, and I can't seem to break through it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Help!?!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sam&nbsp;</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your concern in Microsoft Community and welcome to the Windows 10 Family.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We regret for the inconvenience. Let me assist you to resolve the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In most cases, you will experience&nbsp;<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff559239(v=vs.85).aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Bug Check 0x7E: SYSTEM_THREAD_EXCEPTION_NOT_HANDLED</a> blue screen errors after you’ve installed
 new hardware or software. So this error can be a result of&nbsp;incorrectly configured, old, or corrupted device drivers. As well it can be due to corruption in Windows registry from a recent software change.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><span><span>Now, if you are unable to login to desktop to perform troubleshooting, I suggest you to deploy Startup Repair&nbsp;which automates common diagnostic and repair tasks of even unbootable Windows installations.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the computer fails over into Windows RE because of a detected boot failure, Startup Repair launches automatically. If however, Automatic repair fails over Windows RE too, Startup Repair can also be launched as a manual recovery tool from a

            <p>Thanks for your reply. I wasn't aware of anything being installed, although perhaps it was something going on in the back ground. Where do you get the windows RD CD from? I thankfully managed to get the laptop working again by removing the battery and putting
 it back on again (something I know used to work with mobiles as well so though I'd give it a go). The laptop is now working fine again, although still has potential to overheat! I'll bare this in mind if I have any further problems.</p>
<p>

            <p>It's unlikely to be Windows XP SP3 that is the CAUSE of the problem.&nbsp; It may have uncovered the issue - but it is probably not the root of the issue.</p>
<p>I would dare say that&nbsp;if your system *just* got Windows XP SP3 (3+ years after its release) it needs some other maintenance.</p>
<p><strong><u>Check for malware:</u></strong></p>
<p>Download, install, run, update and perform full system scans with the following two applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://malwarebytes.org/mbam-download.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">MalwareBytes (FREE)</a>

<p><br />
Removing everything they find.&nbsp; Rebooting when needed.&nbsp; (You can uninstall one or both when done.)</p>
<p>Then perform an online scan with the <a href="http://www.eset.com/us/online-scanner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
eSet Online Scanner</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>The less you have running all the time, the better the things you want to run will perform:</u></strong></p>

<a href="http://www.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Google</a> (and/or ask here.)&nbsp; You can hopefully figure out if there are things starting when you computer does (or you logon) that you do not need and then configure them (via their own built-in mechanisms is
 the preferred method) so they do not start up - using your resources without reason.</p>
<p>You can download and utilize <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896653" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p><strong><u>Do some house cleaning and dust off that hard drive:</u></strong></p>
<p>You may wish to free up some disk space (will also aid in getting rid of things you do not utilize) by going through these steps:</p>
<p>Windows XP should take between 4.5 and 9GB *with* an Office suite, Photo Editing software, alternative Internet browser(s), various Internet plugins and a host of other things installed.</p>
<p>If you are comfortable with the stability of your system, you can delete the uninstall files for the patches that Windows XP has installed...<br />

<p>You can turn off hibernation if it is on and you don't use it..</p>
<p>When you hibernate your computer, Windows saves the contents of the system's memory to the hiberfil.sys file. As a result, the size of the hiberfil.sys file will always equal the amount of physical memory in your system. If you don't use the hibernate feature
 and want to recapture the space that Windows uses for the hiberfil.sys file, perform the following steps:</p>
<p>- Start the Control Panel Power Options applet (go to Start, Settings, Control Panel, and click Power Options).<br />
- Select the Hibernate tab, clear the "Enable hibernation" check box, then click OK; although you might think otherwise, selecting Never under the "System hibernates" option on the Power Schemes tab doesn't delete the hiberfil.sys file.<br />
- Windows will remove the "System hibernates" option from the Power Schemes tab and delete the hiberfil.sys file.</p>
<p>You can control how much space your System Restore can use...</p>
<p>1. Click Start, right-click My Computer, and then click Properties.<br />
2. Click the System Restore tab.<br />
3. Highlight one of your drives (or C: if you only have one) and click on the "Settings" button.<br />
4. Change the percentage of disk space you wish to allow.. I suggest moving the slider until you have just about 1GB (1024MB or close to that...)<br />
5. Click OK.. Then Click OK again.</p>
<p>You can control how much space your Temporary Internet Files can utilize...</p>
<p>Empty your Temporary Internet Files and shrink the size it stores to a size between 64MB and 128MB..</p>
<p>- Open ONE copy of Internet Explorer.<br />
- Select TOOLS - Internet Options.<br />
- Under the General tab in the "Temporary Internet Files" section, do the following:<br />
- Click on "Delete Cookies" (click OK)<br />
- Click on "Settings" and change the "Amount of disk space to use:" to something between 64MB and 128MB. (It may be MUCH larger right now.)<br />
- Click OK.<br />
- Click on "Delete Files" and select to "Delete all offline contents" (the checkbox) and click OK. (If you had a LOT, this could take 2-10 minutes or more.)<br />
- Once it is done, click OK, close Internet Explorer, re-open Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>You can use an application that scans your system for log files and temporary files and use that to get rid of those:</p>
<p>Ccleaner (Free!)<br />
<a href="http://www.ccleaner.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.ccleaner.com/</a><br />
( just the disk cleanup - don't play with the registry part for now )</p>
<p>Other ways to free up space..</p>
<p>SequoiaView<br />
<a href="http://www.win.tue.nl/sequoiaview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.win.tue.nl/sequoiaview/</a></p>

<a href="http://www.jgoodies.com/freeware/jdiskreport/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.jgoodies.com/freeware/jdiskreport/index.html</a></p>
<p>Those can help you visually discover where all the space is being used.&nbsp; Then you can determine what to do.</p>
<p>After that - you will want to check for any physical errors and&nbsp;arrange&nbsp;everything for efficient access"</p>

<p><strong><u>Cleanup the Update Components on your Windows XP machine</u></strong></p>
<p>While likely not 100% necessary - it is probably a good idea at this time to make sure you continue getting the updates you need.&nbsp; This will help you make sure your update system is ready to do this for you.</p>
<p>Download and run the MSRT manually:<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/malwareremove/default.mspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/malwareremove/default.mspx</a><br />
(Skip the details and download the tool, download and save to your desktop, run it.)</p>
<p>Reboot.</p>
<p>Download/Install the latest Windows Installer (for your OS):<br />
( Windows XP 32-bit : <span><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloadS/details.aspx?familyid=5A58B56F-60B6-4412-95B9-54D056D6F9F4&amp;displaylang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">WindowsXP-KB942288-v3-x86.exe</a></span> )<br />
(Download and save it to your desktop, run it.)</p>
<p>Reboot.</p>
<p>and...</p>
<p>Download the latest version of the Windows Update agent from here (x86):<br />
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=91237" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=91237</a><br />
.... and save it to the<strong> root of your C:\ drive</strong>. After saving it to the
<em>root of the C:\ drive</em>, do the following:</p>
<p>Close all Internet Explorer windows and other applications.</p>
<p>Start button --&gt; RUN and type in:<br />
%SystemDrive%\windowsupdateagent30-x86.exe /WUFORCE<br />
--&gt; Click OK.</p>
<p>(If asked, select "Run".) --&gt; Click on NEXT --&gt; Select "I agree" and click on NEXT --&gt; When it finishes installing, click on "Finish"...</p>
<p>Reboot.</p>
<p>Now reset your Windows Update Components with this FixIt (you will <strong><em>*NOT*</em></strong>&nbsp;use the aggressive version):<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How do I reset Windows Update components?</a></p>
<p>Reboot.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now that your system is generally free of malware (assuming you have an AntiVirus application), &nbsp;you have cleaned up the 'extra applications' that might be running and taking up your valuable memory and processor, you have cleared out some valuable drive
 space and made sure there are no issues with the drive itself and your Windows Update components are updated and should be working in top shape - there is only one other thing you
<em>may</em> wish to do:</p>
<p>Obtain and install&nbsp;the latest hardware device drivers for your system from the system/hardware manufacturers' support and/or download web site.</p>
<p>If you wish, come back and let us know a little more information about your system - in particular the Make/Model of the system you have - and perhaps someone here can point you to the right place(s) to go to accomplish this.&nbsp; This is not 100% necessary
 - but I would bet that you would gain some performance and features by doing this part.</p>

<p>The hard drive has failed.<br />
<br />
If the Acer is still under warrenty, return it for repair.<br />
<br />
If it is not under warrenty, if you fee comfortable dealing with hardware, purchase a suitable HD and replace the failed drive. Use whatever means Acer provides to restore the laptop. Restore your user files fro your backups. Alternately, if you have a complete
 system backup, use that to set up the laptop again.<br />

<h2>            Installing Bloomberg on Windows 8 - failed permission registry but only one user</h2>
                    <p>Bloomberg did not even have an answer to troubleshoot this one - at least remotely.&nbsp; When clicking on software under c:\ and checking "Properties", see no option for administrator as told by "Bloomberg IT.&nbsp; This caused concern that I'm not logged in as administrator.&nbsp;
 But this is a new PC and I am only user.&nbsp; Checked under control panel, user settings -&nbsp; my username does list me as "local account, administrator..."&nbsp; So just failing to change permission registry rights.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cannot see how it could be related but when I initially opened new laptop and logged in, I used hotmail account.&nbsp; Then went to Change PC settings and changed login fashion to be under "local account."&nbsp;&nbsp; Is this interfering in some way?&nbsp;&nbsp; No other logic.</p>

            Hello Latrel.  I'm Greg, a Microsoft MVP here to help you.

Go to the manufacturer's Support Downloads webpage for your exact model  PC to download and install the Webcam software.  Report back the make and model if you need help.  

Check again in Device Manager under Imaging Devices.  Then on the View tab show Hidden Devices.  If the webcam doesn't show up somewhere in Dev Mgr then it may be faulty.

            Hi latrel1340,

Thanks for the update.

On my HP notebook, it is listed on Imaging devices, so it seems the driver is missing or not installed properly. 

What you can do is scan for changes in the Device Manager to see if it shows up as a device thats not installed.  

What is the make and model of your computer?

Best,
Andre

            Hi latrel1340 ,

Thanks for the update. 

I would suggest you to contact Asus Support for further assistance on this issue. They might be able to provide insight into whether the make and model of your computer is fully supported by Windows 10.

<h2>            Administrator user account not visible in the first Windows 10 start</h2>
                    <p>I have just updated one laptop to Windows 10, Professional, 64 bits, and I do not find the option to log in as 'administrator' user, only as the normal user, and he gives to me the laptop to do the update and I can't now continue my job until he returns,
 wasting his time.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem is now I can't enter in windows because I only know the administrator user and it's not visible. How can I to do visible again the Administrator user account?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried with shift+restart in the power button with the advanced options, and I continue only seeing the normal user account.</p>

</p><p><span>To enable the Windows 10 administrator account do the following:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Tap on the Windows-key.

            <p>Thanks for the response, but it do not solves the problem. I can't tap on windows-key because I can't enter in windows system due in the login screen, only the secondary user account appears, not the one for 'Administrator'. Then if I update to Windows 10
 or if I reinstall Windows 10, although I had 'Administrator' account active before, I only can work later the first restart with the user account of the owner of the computer, if he is present or if he gives to you his credentials because the user 'Administrator'
 is not visible.</p>
<p>You have to do one first login and activate the account, then you need to know the user password or wait until he is available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In may case, I have to wait until our CEO is in the office to can continue. Now I'm stopped waiting and wasting important time.</p>

            <p>Finally I had to reinstall windows formatting the drive, not using the old installation, then I could generate a new user account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think it's a problem to hide the 'Administrator' user when the system is updated to Windows 10.</p>

<h2>            How to disable Windows 10 fax &#38; Scan</h2>
                    A few days ago, Windows 10 updated itself. Since then I keep getting an app screen "Windows Fax &amp; Scan" popping up often. The only way I found to close it is to go to Task Manager and close it from there. This is driving me crazy. I cannot find it on the
 apps list for deletion. How can I permanently get rid of or disable this app?

    <title>Hotkey Mute Issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> woodshop20  say:</h3>
<h2>            Hotkey Mute Issue</h2>
                    <p>I have a Dell Inspiron 7447, as well as the strangest mute issue I've ever encountered on this laptop. The mute hotkey will fail to work properly the first time I press the fn-f2 combination upon a cold system boot - the Windows 8.1 volume 'overlay' will
 display unmute but it will quickly flash back to mute a second later. This means that the mute hotkey is effectively registered twice. Strangely enough, if I press the hotkey combination again, it will work properly then, and for the rest of the time I leave
 the computer on.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, the problem occurs again when I do a full shutdown and cold boot. Again, the first time I press the hotkey combo, the mute-unmute bug will happen again. A normal system restart does not cause the problem (the mute will work properly), and sleep
 seems to be no problem either.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've searched all over but cannot find anyone with a similar problem. This problem has existed ever since I bought the computer, and even multiple driver reinstalls and complete system format has failed to solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

            Hi, thanks for the help. I've got the most updated version of Quickset available for my laptop, and I've tried disabling startup services like you said &nbsp;through Clean Boot (except for the Realtek sound management, because the volume hotkeys won't function
 without it). I'm still getting the same problem. I believe there is a conflict of startup services which is causing the mute command to cancel itself out.&nbsp;

    <title>Unable to Join a Windows 7 Homegroup with a Network that spans over a - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> epeterik  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unable to Join a Windows 7 Homegroup with a Network that spans over a Wireless Bridge</h2>
                    I have two Windows 7 machines that are on oposite ends of a wired LAN network that connects via a wireless bridge and I am unable to get Windows 7 machines on either side of the brdige to connect to a Homegroup created on the other side of the bridge.&nbsp;
 Perhaps to better illustrate what I mean, here is my network configuration:<br />
<br />
<strong>Wireless Router:</strong><br />
Windows 7 machine 1 (wired LAN to Router)<br />
Windows XP machine (wired LAN to Router)<br />
<br />
<strong>Wireless Bridge</strong> (connects wirelessly to Wireless Router):<br />
Windows 7 machine 2 (wired LAN to Bridge)<br />
PS3 (wired LAN to Bridge)<br />
TV (wired LAN to Bridge)<br />
<br />
I use the wireless bridge set up so that I can connect wired LAN devices to the wireless bridge so that they appear to be on the same LAN as all of the other devices on the Wireless Router (saves from having to wire the house, and the wireless bridge allows
 me to extend the range of any wireless devices I may have).&nbsp; While all of the machines can see each other without a problem and I can even set Windows Media Player to stream video to the PS3 and TV via its DLNA server capabilities, the Windows 7 Network map
 does not show systems&nbsp;connected to the other end of the wireless bridge as being on the same network (though it does show them); thus Windows 7 Homegroup does not see the other machines as being on the same network.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
The only thing I can think of is do to limitations in TCP/IP with regards to a wireless bridge, from the wireless router perspective all devices connected to the wireless bridge appear to be one device (they all appear as the same physical MAC address as the
 only "wireless" device that is connecting to the network is the wireless bridge - which just happens to have three other devices connected to it) even though they are assigned different IP numbers (that are within the same subnet, etc).&nbsp; So I guess what&nbsp;I
 am wondering does Windows 7 have a limiation of recognizing devices connected via a wireless bridge?&nbsp; Has anyone else encountered this problem and discovered a workaround?<br />
<br />
Thanks.

            <p>Hassan.E, I don't believe that's the issue. There are many people who can't connect to their homegroup from a machine connected to the network via a bridge.</p>
<p>I can't take credit for this solution, but I don't remember the thread where I saw this suggestion. So, credit to the original poster...</p>
<div><br />
I solved my "can't join homegroup from behind a bridge" issue by disconnecting each bridge and using my 75-foot Ethernet cable to&nbsp;<strong>hardwire each previously-bridged machine to my router</strong> . Then, I could successfully join the homegroup and, after
 I removed the Ethernet cable and re-connected the bridge, everything was fine. Annoying, but at least it justified my owning 75 feet of Cat 5e.
<div><br />
<div><b>Solution summary:</b></div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Disconnect computer from bridge.</li><li>Use Ethernet cable to connect computer to router.</li><li>Join the Homegroup.</li><li>Disconnect Ethernet cable from router.</li><li>Connect computer to bridge. You're (still) in the Homegroup.</li></ol>
I've found nothing else that works reliably, and this is relatively simple.</div>

<p>Hello EPeterik,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>not sure if my problem was the same but here was my network setup:</p>
<p>Home PC (Win 7 Pro) &gt;&gt; wire &gt;&gt; switch &gt;&gt; Internet router&gt;&gt;&gt; Internet</p>
<p>Laptop PC (Win 7 Pro) &gt;&gt; wireless&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;^^^</p>
<p>Not sure if my diagram shows it well but both computers were connected to the same internet router, except The home PC had to go through a&nbsp;switch&nbsp;first (because it was wired).</p>
<p>In essence, both computers were also within the same network. I could see both computers on the network map and they could communicate through the map (?similar to your winodws media player, &nbsp;PS3 and TV), but they were not connected on the map, and I could
 not access them via homegroup.</p>
<p>It turned out to be a dumb oversight from myself.</p>
<p>For every connection device (switch and internet router), Windows 7 creates a different homegroup name. So I ended up with TWO different homegroups.&nbsp;Solution: I deleted one homegroup (laptop), and upon requesting to join a homegroup the laptop automatically
 detected the other homegroup (home pc) and prompted me for the password. Everything else went smoothly.</p>
<p>hope that helps.</p>
<p>In summary, simple but can be overlooked, make sure you are running within the same homegroup name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

                    <p>I am running a custom built rig with the following specs:2</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Pro</p>
<p>MSI Gaming Series 5 motherboard</p>

<p>8 GB RAM</p>
<p>Intel I5-4690K CPU @ 3.5 G</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I initially boot up my machine I am unable to use my start menu or access my system settings. I will sign out and sign back in again so that it will work, but I always see the message "Task Host is stopping background tasks. (\Microsoft\Windows\Plug
 and Play\Device Install Reboot Required)" and tell it to reboot anyways. I have seen that many other people on the net are having this problem, but there have not been any solutions to this issue that I have seen aside from what I just mentioned that I do.
 Has anyone seen any permanent fixes to this problem or heard if Microsoft plans to push a patch that will fix this issue? My wife's laptop is doing the same thing as well.</p>

<p>Same thing here! Many, Many, people are encountering this error/bug! My computer was working fine then after this update its been 5 days of frustration and just hell where my computer is completely inoperable. First I could not click on the start menu to
 open the start menu and then I noticed Cortana and my taskbar were inoperable (where I couldn't click on or open anything in my taskbar) then I discovered I couldn't even use the Windows key on my keyboard to open the start menu. Finally I was able to find
 out I could not open ANY settings or even get to my Settings by using any method!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I did a clean install, deleted Everything and formatted my Samsung 950 Pro NVMe</p>
<p>M.2 SSD over 4 times; and same issues! And the formatting and deleting has seriously decreased the lifespan of this very expensive hard drive... Yet Nothing has been fixed or repaired and the Fresh Start or "Repair" Install advice is utterly useless..! Now
 I just can't continue wasting any more time or mental health trying to get windows to work right. Microsoft OWES its customer a fix or an actual Patch or hotfix... not these useless DIY ne'er-do-wells posting "tips"or things to try when they can barely read
 English! In other threads Microsoft "representatives" are telling people with this same problem to open their settings using the Start Menu that people are complaining is broken and they can't get to, to&nbsp;<span><em><strong>begin with</strong></em></span>..!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I paid over a Hundred dollars for Microsoft Windows 10 Home Edition from Walmart when I built this computer last year. And the least I could expect was for it to work and to be able to use my computer! Some people are recommending Linux as a better OS and
 I can see why now! This Windows 10 OS is the worst ever and Microsoft doesn't give a dam% about their customers or actually fixing the problems and havoc THEIR updates have caused!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Luckily from my signature/info on a PC Builders forum I had listed my system information and was able to find my Windows Build information from January 1, 2017 right before the trouble started... (Windows 10 64-Bit)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 Home Version 1709 OS Build 16299.1922</p>
<p>
</p><p>Somebody should open a class action lawsuit against Microsoft for all the problems they have created in peoples lives; with no concern whatsoever on how their "Automatic"/mandatory, forced, horrible/hurried/hair brained, rushed out, untested, updates have
 affected peoples lives and livelihoods. If Microsoft is going to force everyone to receive their "Automatic" updates they should at least TEST them THOROUGHLY and MAKE SURE they won't harm people's computers or hurt their businesses or interrupt our lives
 and livelihoods. Even Forbes business magazine is reporting this latest update as a Microsoft disaster!</p>

            Phone numbers are easily spoofed. The scammer doesn't have to be using Skype to have their calls appear to come from a Skype number. There's nothing at this time that can be done about spoofed numbers.

<p><strong>How do I do this?</strong></p>
<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

Some keystrokes for three languages. This is the best way to get them.. </p>

Foreign characters, to type foreign characters hold ALT and numeric key</p>

    <title>Mass Effect 3 Citadel DLC still not working - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Mass Effect 3 Citadel DLC still not working</h2>
                    
<p>When is Microsoft going to fix this. If they can't fix it then they need to refund all of us who can't play it. I downloaded 1 of 2 and did not pay attention to how long it took ( walked away) a little while later I came back and downloaded 2 of 2. When
 I played and went into the galaxy map it told me I had only installed 2 of 2. I went back and checked my downloads and 1 of 2 was not listed. I downloaded it again. It went from 1% to complete in about 10 seconds. Tried playing again. Same thing. I deleted
 2 of 2 since it was the only one listed and started all over. Same thing. No 1 of 2 on the downloaded list. Cleared the cache. Tried again. No go. Logged onto xbox online and sent the download for 1 of 2 to my xbox and checked the queue, says it's assigned
 to another console. Come on people. It's not our machines, it's yours. Fix it or refund my money.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You're probably barking up the wrong tree for M$ will just pass the blame over to EA/BioWare, just as they've done with enforcement of the Missile Glitch problem plaguing the Platinum lobbies.</p>

<p>Pretty much anything that's downloaded from XBOXLive sports a "No Refunds" tag before you 'Confirm Purchase', EA aren't known for a sparkling 'Customer Service' record, but have you tried contacting them?&nbsp; It appears to be a common problem that you're having
 with a lot of others&nbsp;so perhaps there is some fix for it by now, many are quick to post about problems that they're having with games but&nbsp;often don't follow it up when a solution is found, they&nbsp;understandably just get right to the game that they've been unable
 to play so give it a shot, good luck&nbsp;for the DLC is worth the effort...:-)&nbsp;</p>
