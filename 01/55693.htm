<p>Winipcfg was part of Win9x/ME and isn't in XP. To see IP information, do:</p>
<p>Start&gt;Run&gt;cmd [enter] - A command prompt box will open. At the prompt, type:</p>
<p>ipconfig /all [enter] - to get IP address information</p>
<p>If you need more help, please provide details about what you are trying to install, set up, etc.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>For better assistance, are you running a Windows 10 Insider Preview on your computer?</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can re-download Minecraft for free as long as you will use the same Microsoft account you used on first purchase.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><em>"I have Windows 10 so is it the same program to download as Windows 8?</em>" - Just search Minecraft from the Windows Store and it will automatically show the download for your PC.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Feel free to post back should you need further assistance. </p>

<h2>            Explorer Not Responding on File Rename</h2>
                    <p>When I create a new folder in the Explorer Window say on my D: drive (data disk) and then try to rename the New Folder Explorer stops responding and says Not Responding.&nbsp; I then have to close the Window open under Explorer. This leaves the New Folder as
 New Folder.&nbsp; I am Running Windows 10 with Anniverary Update plus all the latest patches.&nbsp; Dell with i7 CPU, 8Gb RAM 2 x 1Tb Disks.&nbsp; In the Event Viewer I think this is the event:&nbsp;

<h2>            Error 0x800f081f at downloading update KB4100403. Installation of update fails repeatedly</h2>
                    <p>Good day to the community</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a PC built around a Gigabyte GA-Z87-D3HP motherboard and an Intel Devil's Canyon i5-4690k CPU with 24GB DDR3 RAM.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The PC works fine, but today when downloading the cumulative update KB4100403, this could not be installed, although I tried more than three times. At the end I downloaded the update manually and I asked my Pc to install it. It seemed to install it successfully,
 but after restarting, although at the beginning appeared to install it, at the end and after two more restarts, I received a message saying that the update could not be installed and the PC reverted to the previous stage.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error for the installation failure is reported as 0x800f081f.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can someone help for this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

            Download and install May 23, 2018—KB4100403 (OS Build 17134.81) manually:
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:

<br />
<br /> 	2018-05 Cumulative Update for Windows 10 Version 1803 for x64-based Systems (KB4100403) 
<br />
<br />Follow instructions to install manually:

<br />
<br />If you still continue to experience problems...
<br />
<br />I recommend you block it until the next cumulative update is released. Many are reporting the same problem too and it looks like this update is buggy.
<br />
<br />Is there an option or work around to block updates or hardware drivers that might cause problems?
<br />Yes, Microsoft has released a KB update (KB3073930) that will let users block or hide Windows or driver updates.
<br />
<br />You can download it at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3073930</a>

<br />
<br />After downloading, launch it, click Next, wait while it detects pending Windows Updates.
<br />
<br />Click the Hide Updates menu.
<br />
<br />Scroll through the list then select then select the update. Check the box next to the update then click Next to confirm changes.
<br />
<br />If you still want to troubleshoot the problem:
<br />
<br />Before carrying out this procedure, disconnect from the Internet. That means turning off Wi-Fi and disconnecting from a wired connection. If you don't, Windows 10 will indicate some files are in use and cannot be modified or the command will be non-responsive. Also, you should restart your computer after disconnecting from the Internet. The easiest way to do it is to enable Airplane mode from the Action Center - Windows key + A.
<br />
<br />Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />taskkill /f /fi "SERVICES eq wuauserv" (Do this multiple times)
<br />net stop cryptSvc
<br />net stop bits
<br />net stop msiserver
<br />ren C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.old 
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\DataStore
<br />rmdir C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download
<br />
<br />When complete, hit Enter, then restart, then try updating again.
<br />
<br />If that does not work..
<br />
<br />1. Open Start, type: CMD
<br />Right click CMD
<br />Click Run as administrator
<br />
<br />Type each of the following then hit Enter
<br />
<br />Run these codes:
<br />Net Stop bits
<br />Net Stop wuauserv
<br />Net Stop appidsvc
<br />Net Stop cryptsvc
<br />Ren %systemroot%\SoftwareDistribution SoftwareDistribution.bak
<br />Ren %systemroot%\system32\catroot2 catroot2.bak
<br />Net Start bits
<br />Net Start wuauserv
<br />Net Start appidsvc
<br />Net Start cryptsvc
<br />After running these commands, check if your issue is fixed.

<h2>            GAME pre orders not dispatching&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>So me and my mate have pre ordered dead island from GAME. I pre ordered mine over a month ago. With 2 days to go I have had no email saying that it has been dispatched and no payment has been taken? Im slightly worried about it. Do you think it has something
 to do with the site being updated?</p>

<p>As above, give their customer service a call to get an update, sometimes the account page on their website is very slow at updating, I have recieved pre-orders in the past from them and even after delivery of it the page still didnt show it had even left
 yet. Game may use the evening to do all their mailing so it may take their system some time to send confirmation of dispatch, best way to check would be to check your bank account, if payment has been taken then the game is on its way as they only take payment
 on point of despatch..they take payment then send out game</p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player Playback Is Choppy And Skipping, Anyway to fix the problem &#63;</h2>
                    I enjoy the way Windows Media Player is on Windows 7 but at times some songs are Choppy and sound as if they are skipping, its only some songs, I don't understand why that is so, but is there anyway to fix it, because I want to place my music collection
 back in my PC, but I'm not sure if Windows Media Player would play my files properly, also when its a playlist there is no skipping, only when I select files, but CD audio doesn't skip it plays flawless. Anyway to fix the MP3 problem ?<br />

            The problem was easily solved by me turning off my enhancements, that is what caused the choppy playback, now all the files I play on WMP plays flawless.. so if anyone has this problem the proper thing is to check and see if you have any enhancements on,
 while playing files, that will most likely solve the problem.

            Hi <span>mvmoses,<br />
<br />
The steps we will provide below will remove the sound on the movie or a portion of the movie&nbsp;you are editing. Please take note the audio of the movie will be removed including the background music embedded on the video. Here are the steps:<br />
<br />
1. Open WL Movie Maker.<br />
2. Open the video you want to edit by dragging the video to Movie Maker or by browsing.<br />
3. Go to Edit tab.<br />
4.&nbsp;Click the video you want to mute (in case you have multiple videos added for editing). If you only want to remove the sound&nbsp;of a portion of a movie, it will be best if you trim or split the movie first, otherwise the whole part of&nbsp;video will be muted.<br />
For more information on trimming/splitting a movie, follow this article <a href="http://explore.live.com/windows-live-essentials-movie-maker-get-started?T1=t3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Edit your movies</a>. <br />
5. Click <strong>Video volume</strong> (the speaker Icon on the upper left corner of Movie Maker) then slide the bar going to the left.<br />
<br />
If you need further help, feel free to reply on this post.<br />
<br />
<span>Best regards,<br />
Eugene R.<br />

            <p><span>Hi <span>mvmoses,</span><br />
</span></p>
<p><span>I suggest that you open the video, mute the&nbsp;conversation and then save it as a movie file in Windows Live Movie Maker. Below are&nbsp;the steps on how to do so.<br />
</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Launch Windows Live Movie Maker. </span></li><li><span>Click the <strong>Add videos and photos</strong> on the <strong>
Home</strong> tab and add the video file that has the narration. </span></li><li><span>Click <strong>Edit</strong> tab on the menu bar. </span><span>Select
<strong>Video Volume</strong> and drag the slider going to the <strong>left</strong>.
</span></li><li><span>C</span><span>lick on the <strong>blue button</strong> located on the top left corner of Windows Live Movie Maker.</span>
</li><li><span>Click <strong>Save movie</strong> and choose <strong>For computer</strong>.
</span><span>Choose your preferred location of the file and click the <strong>Save</strong> button.</span>
</li></ol>
<p><span>This will give you a new video file (.wmv), try playing this file using Windows Media player and see if there will still be a conversation on the video.<br />
<br />
<span>Thanks!<br />
<br />
</span></span></p>

Hell I want to even erase the app but am unable to please fix and respond this is ridiculous.

<p>hey y'all&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>im having trouble trying to boot my gateway FX laptop...it has been working for a good 2 years but now its not booting....it all started when i was playing Rfactor and it froze up on me. and ctrl alt del didnt even respond so i turned off the laptop with
 the power button...now it keeps trying to boot...it makes it all the way to the black screen load bar right before the vista logo comes up but then it goes into the transition black screen and stays then it restarts going to the windows repair thing. it runs
 though it and sometimes it attemps to repair it and then restarts and then the same thing happens...i dont think its a hard drive problem because i was able to get into the cmd prompt and i can see the files...i also totaly restored windows to factory default
 using the repair tool and still it does it...im starting to think it might be my video card because right when i turn it on and the gateway logo is on there is a couple really thin purple lines through it....if anyone can help me try to solve this prob it
 would be very helpfull...is it possible that the videocards heat paste is bad and could be affecting it in this way?</p>

 with burning software like: </span><a href="http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.snapfiles.com/get/active-isoburner.html</span></a><span>&nbsp;and,
 of course, a blank CD.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't work, try to boot into safe mode (repeatedly click the F8 key while booting and go to safe mode with networking – or do so from the command prompt on the disk).&nbsp;If you can boot into safe mode with networking that's a good sign.&nbsp;Then let's check
 some of your system files:<br />
<br />
Go to Start / All Programs / Accessories / Command prompt and right click on command prompt and click run as Administrator (you can skip this step if using the disk).<br />
<br />
If using the disk, cd to C;\Windows\System32. Type sfc /scannow and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will scan and try to fix some of your system files.&nbsp; Hopefully it will complete with no corruption it could not repair (if there is such corruption post back here
 or try to analyze it to find the problem file(s) using </span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://support.microsoft.com/kb/928228</span></a><span>.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Try to post any corrupted files here so we can see if they can be repaired with good copies from the installation disk (unless there are too many).<br />
<br />
While in Command Prompt, type chkdsk /f /r and enter and let it run.&nbsp; It will probably want to schedule itself to start at the next startup.<span>&nbsp;
</span>Answer yes and then reboot so it will run. It will scan and try to fix any corruption or bad sectors on your hard drive and mostly remove that as a potential cause.</span></p>
<div><span>If that doesn't work, then please post any repeating error messages from the Event Viewer concerning startup (Start / Control Panel / Administrative Tools
 / Event Viewer – or typing eventvwr from the command prompt on the disk stilll in cL\Windows\System32).&nbsp; Here's how to use Event Viewer:
</span><span><a href="http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.petri.co.il/vista-event-viewer.htm</span></span></a></span><span>.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></div>
<p><span>It may be your device drivers, especially your video card or monitor.&nbsp;
<span>
Go to Device Manager by going to start / search box and type device manager and enter and then double-click on the program icon that appears.&nbsp; Check each device for a red x, yellow ! or white ?.&nbsp; These identify devices with problems (probably drivers, but also
 conflicts or something else).&nbsp; Click on each for further details and troubleshooting tips.&nbsp; If you need to get drivers (and you should for at least the video card and the monitor and anything else you can find and have time for), do so from the computer vendor
 or device manufacturer (NOT from Microsoft Updates).&nbsp; In fact, you should turn off automatic driver updates from Windows Update as follows:
</span><span><a href="http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.addictivetips.com/windows-tips/how-to-disable-automatic-driver-installation-in-windows-vista/</span></span></a></span><span>.
 Proceed as follows to get the drivers: </span><span><a href="http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://pcsupport.about.com/od/driverssupport/ht/driverdlmfgr.htm</span></span></a></span><span>.&nbsp;
 Once you have the drivers, you can install them through Device Manager as follows:
</span><span><a href="http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/193584-device-manager-install-driver.html</span></span></a></span></span></p>
<p><span>If this doesn't help, then please pose back with the results of the above efforts and any additional information you can provide and we'll try to come up with
 some other options to try (but there aren't very many remaining).</span></p>
<p><span>I hope this helps</span></p>
<p><span>Good luck!</span></p>

<p>hey y'all&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>im having trouble trying to boot my gateway FX laptop...it has been working for a good 2 years but now its not booting....it all started when i was playing Rfactor and it froze up on me. and ctrl alt del didnt even respond so i turned off the laptop with
 the power button...now it keeps trying to boot...it makes it all the way to the black screen load bar right before the vista logo comes up but then it goes into the transition black screen and stays then it restarts going to the windows repair thing. it runs
 though it and sometimes it attemps to repair it and then restarts and then the same thing happens...i dont think its a hard drive problem because i was able to get into the cmd prompt and i can see the files...i also totaly restored windows to factory default
 using the repair tool and still it does it...im starting to think it might be my video card because right when i turn it on and the gateway logo is on there is a couple really thin purple lines through it....if anyone can help me try to solve this prob it
 would be very helpfull...is it possible that the videocards heat paste is bad and could be affecting it in this way?</p>

<p>Would you have a known good Graphics Card to swap it with to rule out Graphics as being the problem?</p>

<p>It could also be a problem with the monitor but there's no real way to check that yourself on a laptop.&nbsp; It appears that if none of the above procedures help to resolve the problem, then it is hardware-related and you need to take it into a competent computer
 repair shop (NOT Geek squad or any of those big store centers - but a true professional) who can diagnose and repair the problem.&nbsp; Check out a number of vendors before deciding (including sending it back to Gateway for repair even if it no longer under warranty
 - if still under warranty make an immediate claim).&nbsp; Consider cost, quality, and warranty as well as the ability to make sure the replacement parts are appropriate for your system and version of Vista.&nbsp; With a laptop replacing a video card often means replacing
 the motherboard so you want to be SURE it is either exactly the same or fully compatible.&nbsp; Also, even though this doesn't really involve the hard drive, be sure to backup your important data before sending or bringing it in because they frequently wipe the
 drive clean even if it doesn't seem like that should be necessary.</p>
<p>I hope this helps.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Hello,</p>
<p>1. What is the operating system installed in the computer?</p>
<p>2.
<span>Did you make any software changes to the computer prior to the issue</span><span>?<span>&nbsp;
</span></span></p>
<p><b>Method 1</b>: Perform clean boot.</p>
<p><span>To help troubleshoot error messages and other issues, you can start Windows Vista or Windows 7 by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs.
 This kind of startup is known as a "clean boot." A clean boot helps eliminate software conflicts.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note</span></b><span>: Perform
<b>step 7</b> to reset the computer to start as usual after the clean boot process.
</span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</a>

<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310353" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to configure Windows XP to start in a "clean boot" state</a>
</p>
<p><b>Method 2</b> : Run Microsoft Safety scanner in Full/complete scan and remove all the threats detected by it and check whether the issue is resolved or not.

<p>
<span><span><strong>Method 3</strong> : If it is a Windows Vista /Windows 7 then turn off the sticky keys and check whether the issue is resolved or not.
</span></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> Type Ease of access centre in the start serach box and hit enter.

                    <p>While attempting to update a computer from 1709 to 1803 Windows 10 Pro, I downloaded the mediacreationtool1803.exe from https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10 and attempted to use it install the 1803 update as Windows update and the

<br />Would like to look at Rollback logs.

<br />Share Setuperr.log and Setupact.log named from 
<br />C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Rollback\ 
<br />
<br />and 
<br />
<br />C:\$Windows.~BT\Sources\Panther
<br />You can open the folder by typing the path in Run or showing hidden files and viewing through explorer.
<br />
<br />Use Onedrive/Google Drive/Mediafire to share the files and drop the links in the next reply.

            Hi Bret.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />See these steps for Overcoming Version Upgrade problems:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />But if it's failed with a BSOD then what I'd do now is do the Clean Install which should get you past all difficulties as it has hundreds of thousands of others who have followed the steps in this link and never come back to report another problem:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot following exactly the steps I give below then you may need to create it again, trying another USB drive or DVD.  
<br />
<br />To create new Windows 10 Installation Media on another PC install Media Creation Tool and follow the directions here:  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  Uncheck the box for Recommended Settings to choose the exact version and bit rate for the target PC only. 
<br />
<br /> Insert media, boot it by powering up PC while pressing the BIOS Boot Menu Key: <a href="https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutorials/23010-bios-boot-menu-f-keys-hotkeys-system-manufacturer-oem.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.sysnative.com/forums/hardware-tutor...</a>
<br />
<br />If the media won't boot you may need to enter BIOS/UEFI Setup (pressing key given in chart in link above) to turn off Fast Boot or Fast Startup first. 
<br />
<br />Choose the boot device as a UEFI device if offered,  on second screen choose  Install Now, then Custom Install, then at the drive selection screen delete all partitions down to Unallocated Space to get it cleanest, click Next to let it create needed partitions and start install - this makes it foolproof. 
<br />
<br /> .
<br />You will get and keep the best possible install to the exact extent you stick with the steps, tools and methods in the linked tutorial.  It's a better install than any amount of money could buy and a great learning experience that will make you the master of your PC because you will learn everything that works best and how to apply it with your own hands.
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

<p>The following solution finally worked (which I believe I had to use on another computer for an earlier Windows 10 update):</p>
<ol>
<li>Download the media creation tool</li><li>Create an .ISO image on the desktop</li><li>Run the update program directly from the .ISO image (skip attempting to create media).</li></ol>

<p><strong>Me :</strong></p>
<p>Hello,<br />
I've got issue with the connexion to Bethesda.net account on Xbox one.<br />
When I type user + password, the synchronization just crash with a loud synth sound. I don't even download a mod or anything.<br />
PS: EN or FR.</p>
<p><strong>Bethesda support :</strong></p>

            <p>Hey&nbsp;TGL S kro78 -&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about the troubles. When you hear the loud screeching and then the crash, is this causing just the account sync page to crash or is crashing your entire Fallout 4 game?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's try to isolate what is causing the issue by changing one account at a time. So first, please log into your Bethesda.net account.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Click your username in the top right</li>
<li>Click 'Linked Accounts' on the left menu</li>
<li>Answer your Security Question</li>
<li>Unlink your Xbox Live account from your Bethesda.net profile</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, please <a href="https://support.xbox.com/browse/my-account/manage-account/Create%20account" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Create A New Xbox Live account</a> (this is free). Note that provided your Xbox One console is set as your <a href="https://support.xbox.com/games/game-setup/my-home-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Home Console</a> it will automatically be grated Xbox Live Gold privileges).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please sign into your Xbox One using the new account you just created and load up Fallout 4. Then under the 'Mods' menu in Fallout 4, go ahead and link your Bethesda.net account and see what happens. This does not permanently tie your Bethesda account to this Gamertag. You will be able to unlink the new Gamertag the same way I outlined above.</p>
<p>Additionally, are you able to try using a friend's Xbox One console to see if the issue still occurs?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know it looks like a lot of steps but this will really help us narrow down where the issue lies.</p>
<p>Keep us posted!</p>

<h2>            Updates Hanging on Windows 7 Home Premium, 64-bit</h2>
                    I&nbsp;have Windows 7 Home Premium on a 64-bit computer.&nbsp; I changed the Windows Update settings to automatically download upgrades but let me choose if and when to install them.&nbsp; This doesn't work.&nbsp; I've tried it numerous times on different days and it still
 tries to install updates on shutdown.&nbsp; (I say try because 8-10 hours later, it's still "installing" though the com light isn't flashing.)&nbsp; Finally I read the "check for updates screen" and all of the updates were checked to install despite my changing the
 setting to download automatically but let me choose what to install.&nbsp; Additionally, I was not notified that the downloads occurred.&nbsp; I manually installed updates one at a time and it appears the installation hangs when it installs a 32-bit update to my 64-bit
 computer.&nbsp; Additionally, updates for Office 2007 are failing on my machine that has Office 2010.&nbsp; I have three questions.&nbsp; 1)Why are updates being installed on shutdown when I

A1. If you change your Automatic Updates setting (e.g., from <strong>Automatic</strong> to

I changed the auto updates on 12/24 and installed all available updates according to the list in the control panel.&nbsp; More updates appeared yesterday that were not on the 12/24 list; they were downloaded and checked for installation.&nbsp; These are the ones that
 hung up during installation last night during shutdown.</p>
<p>You are correct about the&nbsp;Office 2010--it is 32-bit version.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is the only Office program installed.&nbsp; I read the page you referred to, above.&nbsp; Thanks, it was quite informational.&nbsp; My interpretation is that I do not&nbsp;need the Compatibility Pack for 2007
 Office if I have 2010.&nbsp; Is that correct?</p>

    <title>How can I block an unknown user from accessing my home network on - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bgbdwlf408  say:</h3>
<h2>            How can I block an unknown user from accessing my home network on windows 7&#63;</h2>
                    <p>I discovered a device accessing my network that does not belong there. I can not access it, so I can't really do anything as far as seeing who it is. I thought that it was just someone leeching off my wifi hotspot, but when I turned off the wifi, they didn't
 disconnect. When I try to access this unknown, my computer tells me that, basically, the device isn't there. How can I put a stop to unwanted guests from accessing my network? I would think that this would not be possible, since the network requires a password
 in order to access. I have not given the password to anyone except those authorized, and yet, here I have a device belonging to someone named "Griff" attached to my network.</p>
<p>I have already been burned by unauthorized leechers hiding behind my IP and downloading illegal or pirated content. I do not want that headache again. How can I stop this?</p>

            Here's my take on what was posted. Turning off the SSID broadcasting will only stop casual leechers. #2 won't accomplish anything as it's someone connecting to your network.#3 is a given....you need to change your password and #4 is probably your best
 bet, but I would change it so that only mac addresses you specify can connect to the network.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

            <p><span>Hi,
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You want to block an unknown user from accessing home network. I will help you with this issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Please refer to this article and check if that helps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><span>Prevent Your Router From Broadcasting</span></b><span>:
 When you connect your wireless (Wi-Fi) router, it broadcasts the router name--or SSID--every few seconds to computers within the wireless range. This allows "foreign" computers and other devices (such as mobile phones) to connect to it. This, in turn, reduces
 the amount of bandwidth available to you. You may disable broadcasting by accessing your router's wireless settings and selecting the "Disabled" function. You may also change your SSID.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><b><span>Connect To 'Preferred' Networks</span></b><span>:
 When your wireless connection is enabled on your computer, it may automatically attempt to connect to any network in range. You can block your computer from connecting by selecting preferred Wi-Fi connections. To complete the process, you merely need to access
 your computer's "Control Panel," browse to your "Wireless Network Properties" and remove networks that you do not wish to connect to.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><b><span>Encrypt Your Connection</span></b><span>:
 If you host a Wi-Fi network, you may block others from connecting to your network by creating an encrypted password. To encrypt the connection, access the router's wireless security settings and enables the connection titled "WPA-2," "WPA2 Personal" or "WPA2
 Enterprise." You will need to have the encrypted password handy to access your network on each computer that you wish to connect to the network.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><b><span>Block a Specific Computer</span></b><span>:
 If you know the MAC (media access control) address of a user, you may enter it into your computer and block them from accessing your Wi-Fi connection. You can choose whether to allow only certain MAC addresses, or you can block specific MAC addresses. Access
 your router's wireless MAC settings to enable or disable the filter and choose between "Permit Only" or "Prevent" options.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<span>Hope this helps.</span>

            It's not a NAT problem, it's an ISP problem. You could connect your xbox directly to the modem and still get the same error code. It has to do with being so close to each other and ISP not dealing with it properly. About all you can do is just call your
 ISP and complain. The error code eventually went away but occasionally comes back despite our xboxs having open nat. Because the issue is only with that one friend in particular and only when we connect to each other. I can connect to anyone else just fine,
 but if I connect to him or connect to a party he is in, everything messes up.

<h2>            Playing an SRT. file &#40;subtitles&#41; with a video using WMP</h2>
                    When playing a movie with a foreign language without embedded subtitles, it is impossible to add the SRT. file on WMP so that the movie with the subtitles can be seen. In order to rectify this problem, I searched Google and found there was an app call
 WmpSub (Local Subtitles for WMP Installer) which I downloaded and installed. I also found a YouTube video that tells one to get it working, which said to open the WMP, click Organize:Options:Plug-ins:Background. At that point, a box appears in which the WmpSup
 app is supposed to appear but it doesn't. Dragging the SRT. file to the play area doesn't work so the result is the movie still can't be seen with subtitles. My question is: how do I get the WMP to play an external subtitles file?

            Hi Warren
<br />
<br />If you are on Windows 10, your best option is to play that video in the Films and TV app
<br />
<br />Then at the bottom left, click the close captions button and choose the srt file . . .<br /><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/d824048b-3e5e-44d9-9ab9-c7f4480d48e8?upload=true" />
