            Hi Daniel
<br />
<br />In version 1809 Microsoft released the Dark Mode in Explorer and honestly it was released too early and full of bugs
<br />
<br />Microsoft have been working on the Dark Mode a lot and have resolved the bugs in that and added it to other Windows applications - this is all coming in version 19h1 (1903) dues to be released in a couple of weeks
<br />
<br />So, for the moment there is nothing you can do, but rest assured all these bugs have been fixed in this new release . .

    <title>Want To Join A Clan In Halo Reach&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> spartan i043  say:</h3>
<h2>            Want To Join A Clan In Halo Reach&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>Then come and join Team Forerunner!</p>
<p>Hey! Spartan I043 here.<br />
<br />
I am currently a&nbsp;Field Marshall&nbsp;and I am currently in the process of recruiting for my clan Team Forerunner in Halo Reach.
<br />
<br />
ABOUT TEAM FORERUNNER:<br />
Team Forerunner is a clan where winning and losing don't count, where skill doesn't matter, where cussing hardly exists, and where fun is always in the game. If you cuss up storms, only care about winning, and are unsporting don't bother reading on or sending
 us friend requests. We DON'T want players that cuss up storms and we DON'T want players that are unsporting and only want to win. We want players that want to have fun, we want players that are good sports and we'd prefer players that don't cuss (we don't
 mind if a you can't help throw a cuss word in every now and then). We currently have about 60 awesome, official players in Team Forerunner! Team Forerunner only cares about having fun and if we win great. . . if we lose, oh well we have our chins held high
 ready to move on either way. We are very strict on players who only want to win, who are unsporting, and who cuss up storms (We banned two members because they were both cussing up a storm and one of them only wanted to win and was unsporting). Most of Team
 Forerunner's members rarely ever cuss (which is really nice) and we try to help each other rank up, complete challenges and become better players. Both guys and gals are welcome to join our clan. Reydaitso and KillJoyseries89 made two websites where you can
 view more of Team Forerunner's information.<br />
<br />
WEBSITE INFO:<br />
KillJoyseries89 made this website:<br />
http://team-forerunner.spruz.com/ (No registration is required except in posting)<br />
<br />
We also have the "group" feature on Bungie.net. You can join our group there if you wish.&nbsp;We also have&nbsp;our own Youtube channel. Check that out&nbsp;if possible.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
TEAM FORERUNNER RULES:<br />
1. Player must respect the leaders/co-leaders: Spartan I043, Iron Hawk II, Jakeylakes, Reydaitso, and fishiesDONTswim (So far only two members have disrespected us and I don't want it to happen again)<br />
<br />
2. Player must be a good sport whether it's win or loss. (In other words, have fun whether you win or lose)<br />
<br />
3. Player must have a mic and must communicate to the team. <br />
<br />
4. Player must be willing to participate in ALL Halo Reach game modes. (Slayer, Capture the Flag, Headhunter, Invasion etc.)<br />
<br />
5. Player must change their emblems to Team Forerunner's official emblem (No armor or gamertag changes are required, however if you join our clan, I ask that you put "Team Forerunner" into either your motto or bio so that way when our new members look at my
 friend's list, they will know who is in our clan and who isn't)<br />
<br />
I allow ALL ranks to join so I will allow you to join whether you are a Recruit, Inheritor or anything in between. Currently our highest ranked officer is a Field Marshall and our current lowest ranked officer is a Warrant Officer (again these are official
 Team Forerunner members). And we have many ranks in between, so you should be able to fit right in!
<br />
<br />
TEAM FORERUNNER INFO:<br />
Players can also list a specific preference in which class they will be assigned. (All-Around, Heavy, Long Range, Close-Quarter, Vehicle Operator, etc.)<br />
<br />
An Octagon backround with the Champion Star in the middle is the Team Forerunner emblem. The Colors are Steel (Backround Color), Silver (Primary Emblem Color), and White (Secondary Emblem Color). I no longer require the service tag to be changed, because it
 is hard to recognize teammates with the same service tags.<br />
<br />
As said above I am trying to make Team Forerunner as fun as I possible can, and if there are any recommendations let me know. We also try to have clan battles every weekend, so if your clan wants to battle ours, feel free to contact our Clan Battle Organizer
 Jakeylakes.<br />
<br />
TEAM FORERUNNER CONTACTS:<br />
You are more than welcome to contact any of the leaders/co-leaders listed above, but for the most part you will want to send me messages. You can contact me multiple ways:<br />
1. Xbox Live Gamertag: Spartan I043 <br />
2. Right here in the forum<br />
3. Send me a private message<br />
<br />
TEAM FORERUNNER RECRUITMENT:<br />
NOTICE: You may have been aware that I kept using "official Team Forerunner Members." That is because some of the players who want to join us take so long to recruit.
<br />
<br />
If you recruit by:<br />
Week 1: You will receive ALL Team Forerunner Updates and will be invited to games.<br />
Week 2: You will NOT receive Team Forerunner Updates for 3 days and will not be invited to games for 3 days.
<br />
Week 3: You will no longer be eligible to join.<br />
<br />
What I mean by recruiting by week one, two, and three is how much time you have to join before you are penalized. For instance, if you wanted to join by week 1, but were offline for 1 week, you would be penalized, unless you had a good excuse for not recruiting
 by week 1.<br />
<br />
If you make me wait I will penalize you. I am only doing this because so many players don't recruit before week 1 and they make me wait and wait and wait. . . Sometimes it takes at least 2 or more weeks for most of them to join. We are VERY SERIOUS when it
 comes to recruiting. If you plan to join please be serious about it. To be an "Official Team Forerunner Member" your emblem must be changed, you must obey the rules, and you must play at least one match with me and/or my co-leaders. We will then decide if
 we want you in our clan. We also decided that we don't want our members in other clans besides ours. If you join our clan, it will either be this one, or another one. It gets to complicated if our members are in more than 1 clan in Halo Reach. If you for some
 reason can't join before week 1, please send me a message ASAP and I may excuse you from being penalized depending on the excuse.
<br />
<br />
TEAM FORERUNNER MEMBER NEWS:<br />
When you join Team Forerunner, don't only send me a friend request, but also send Iron Hawk II (Team Forerunner Leader), Jakeylakes (Team Forerunner Co-Leader and Clan Battle Organizer), Reydaitso (Team Forerunner Co-Leader and Secretary of Treasure) and fishiesDONTswim
 (Team Forerunner Co-Leader) one. This way they will know you are wanting to join or have already joined. You can try to contact one of them if I'm not online.<br />
<br />
Iron Hawk II writes:<br />
"Hey guys, I am proud to be a Team Forerunner leader. I hope you have the best experience possible playing Reach in our clan.
<br />
This clan was built by Spartain I043 and myself and we want other Reach players to play to win, but also be good sports about losing because we will most likely not win every match. This has been a great experience for me. I hope to see you on the battlefield
 soldier. Iron Hawk II, signing out.<br />
PS: I appreciate my fellow clan members to be my friends and also if it isn't too much to ask, I would like a good rep. Oh! And one more thing I would appreciate as little language (cussing) as possible."<br />
<br />
Jakeylakes also writes:<br />
"Hey guys i'm Jakeylakes one of the members of Team Forerunner. I would just like to give you a heads up display of how great this clan is and I highly recomend that you join. Team Forerunner plays for fun, Team Forerunner accepts anyone who's willing to join.
 These past few weeks have been awsome, I have played so much now and my ranks are soaring through the roof because I can actually play Reach and enjoy. Team Forerunner has lots of members and there all fun to talk to. If you consider becomeing an honarable
 member of Team Forerunner all you need is a mic, contact Spartan I043( our team leader- also give Iron Hawk II respect aswell) or alteranativly you can contact me and i'll talk with Spartan I043. Many Thanks Jakeylakes Team Forerunner"
<br />
<br />
ArmorLock4Noobs also writes:<br />
"I'm a new member myself, this is a great clan to join. Team Forerunner may put fun first, but don't let that fool you into believing we are not a serious clan. I have been in 4 clans spanning the past 7 years on XBOX Live and I am impressed with the level
 of professionalism on Team Forerunner. "<br />
<br />
Other quotes by my members:<br />
1. "Team Forerunner is the BEST clan in Reach!" -EC30<br />
2. "Team Forerunner puts the Team in Teamwork!" -Crazed So<br />
3. "I never plan to leave Team Forerunner!" -Untaimed Spirit<br />
4. "Finally a clan where winning doesn't matter!" -burningclod<br />
5. "Team Forerunner's guys are GOOD!" -SILENTxkiller<br />
<br />
CONCLUSION:<br />
Believe it or not this is our (Iron Hawk II and me) first time running a clan as well as being in a clan. We must be doing a good job or our clan members wouldn't be saying these things. Personally we love to have fun, but we can get very serious (especially
 when it comes to recruiting and cussing players with unsporting attitudes). If you want proof that these guys have fun in Team Forerunner just send them a message and ask. They will tell you how much fun they have. We guarentee you'd have fun as well. If you
 want to join, but may be nervous if you were to want to quit and not disappoint me, don't worry about it. We don't force anyone to stay, nor do I force anyone to leave. It is completely up to you. We ask that you really think about joining. We have so much
 fun as a group and we want to share our fun with YOU.<br />
<br />
If Team Forerunner is a clan where you want to find friends, play with mature yet fun guys that rarely cuss, have VERY GOOD sportsmanship, and have the teamwork spirit, then Team Forerunner is the clan for you, because Team Forerunner wants you to have a Halo
 Reach experience that you will NEVER forget.<br />
<br />
Questions and comments needed answered quickly about Team Forerunner should be sent to Spartan I043, Jakeylakes, Reydaitso and/or fishiesDONTswim. Iron Hawk II is online when possible (not frequently) so only send him messages if necessary.
<br />
<br />
On behalf of Team Forerunner we hope that you join (quickly).</p>

<p>On the contrary, we DO work as a team. Our attitude is not negative either. And since when were we annoying? Our youngest player is 13 years old! We like to joke around alot, but is that something to complain about? You were way to serious all the time.
 Even our most serious players have to joke around sometimes. &nbsp;You never even took the time to get to know us better. When we tried to invite you, you just left. You are full of lies.</p>

<h2>            Windows Media Player cannot convert the file to the format required by the device.</h2>
                    After applying all settings to convert WAV files, from ripped cd's, to MP3, I am still unable to sync/convert for IPOD usage. I have MGTEK installed and it is recognizing IPOD, but not able to sync.

<h2>            My WIFI is Working, Windows 10 HotSpot Functionality Stopped Working after Recent Update</h2>
                    <p>Hi Community, I am asking this question, because there is an issue with the Windows 10 HotSpot function, there are lots of threads where users are asking this question, but not getting an answer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>So put plainly my WIFI is working perfectly, but I cannot turn on the Windows 10 HotSpot.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Running the Network troubleshooter, reinstall drivers . . . etc. does nothing to resolve this issue</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>The issue is with the HotSpot functionality in Windows 10, everything worked perfectly up until an update caused it not to work!</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone found a workable solution to this issue with the Windows 10 HotSpot?</p>

<h2>            I cannot remove my profile picture&#40;s&#41; from the Outlook mail app in Windows8.</h2>
                    I cannot remove my profile picture(s) from the Outlook mail app in Windows8. I was able to remove them from the desktop version but there is a profile picture for both of my aliases in the Mail app. One of them is from at least&nbsp;five years ago, I don't
 even remember adding the other. How can I get rid of these? it is annoying to say the least since there is absolutely no logical explanation for them being there or a simple way to remove them. I have searched&nbsp;the&nbsp;MS Community. I am not connected to any other
 accounts (Twitter, FB) except for Google. I have already chosen the option to disable third party linking. &nbsp;

            <p>Hi Paul Zanoni2013,<br />
<br />
Thank you for reporting to us that you're&nbsp;unable to remove the&nbsp;profile picture(s) showing up in the Mail app of Windows 8.&nbsp;I understand that&nbsp;it can be annoying to not get this problem sorted out after trying out the suggestions you've researched. Let's investigate
 and try to get this resolved.<br />
<br />
Please check if the same profile pictures as showing up in your account at <a href="https://profile.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://profile.live.com</a>? If yes, then please delete it by hitting <strong>Remove.</strong> If a different profile picture is shown, then there's a possibility that you're signed in with a different account on the Mail app. Can you please double check it?<br />
<br />
Please also send us a screenshot of the pictures shown in the Mail app and provide your impacted email address for further investigation. I have provided a secured private message where you can upload them. Just en<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">sure that you are

We look forward to your reply.</span></p>

                    This question has been asked for over 4 years and there is still no permanent solution from Microsoft.&nbsp; Re-launching google chrome can solve the issue, but it comes back soon.&nbsp; Uninstall/re-install google chrome also works, but the issue comes back.&nbsp; Turning
 off hardware acceleration works, but the issue returns.&nbsp; These solutions are all from replies in this forum.&nbsp; Why can't Microsoft put out a fix for this?&nbsp; Are google and microsoft such adversaries that they won't work together to fix an issue that frustrates
 and wastes time of thousands of users?

                    <span>
                    <span>
<p>At the log in screen, I log in and it goes straight to a black screen and just the cursor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also at the log in screen, when I try to restart, it just hangs up and I have to do a hard shut down. I have made a vista recovery disk and tried to do a boot up repair and a system restore, but nothing has changed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was working perfectly fine all day, it didn't have this problem until I restarted to try to get an internet connection working and instead I get a black screen when I try to log in. The most recent thing I have downloaded is a Java update earlier today.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have files I would like to save, but if worse comes to worse, is my only option to do a full wipe and reinstall vista?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What can I do other than try to use the vista repair disk? My computer has no apparent problems when I use it to troubleshoot.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
The files can be saved by putting the drive into another computer or an external USB drive case.<br />
Then the files can be copied to other media and if desired the drive can be put back into the computer<br />
and you can re-install Windows fresh and clean.<br />
<br />
Can you access Safe Mode? Repeatedly tap F8 as you boot? If so you can try Control Panel - Device
<br />
Manager - Display Adapter - Double Click on - Driver tab - click UPDATE driver - then Right Click<br />
on Device and UNINSTALL - REBOOT.<br />
<br />
Another method to try to access the desktop (try in both regular&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;and Safe Mode) is to
<br />
CTRL + ALT + DEL and on Process Tab find EXPLORER.exe and END PROCESS on it - then<br />
on Applications Tab - lower right - New Task - type in EXPLORER.exe .<br />
<br />
First check this thread in case its a simple one and if not come back to this thread.<br />

<br />
Black screen issues are extremely tough to repair and any fix is usually on a hit or miss basis.<br />
That there is no information on a black screen like there is on a blue screen just adds to the<br />
difficulty. Often using a restore point nor startup repair will have any effect. You can try a
<br />
google to see suggested repairs some of which have worked however these cover a wide<br />
field of efforts.<br />
<br />
Here is a video of one fix.<br />

Here is another fix<br />
<span>http://blogs.pcmag.com/securitywatch/2008/12/the_mysterious_black_screen_of.php</span><br />
<br />
<br />
Do you have a Vista Disk? You can try System Restore from it. If you do not have the disks your system<br />
maker will sell them cheap. <br />
<br />
How to Do a System Restore in Vista<br />
<span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/76905-system-restore-how.html</span><br />
<br />
You can create a Recovery Disk or use someone else same version (to do the System Restore it only has to
<br />
be bootable).<br />
<br />
How to Create a Vista Recovery Disc<br />
<span>http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/141820-create-recovery-disc.html</span><br />
<br />
------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
These require the correct Vista Disks since you can't boot to Safe Mode.<br />
<br />
Try Startup Repair -<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or with a Vista Disk<br />

Here&nbsp;are&nbsp;Google searches where several have found different solutions :<br />

<br />
If needed and you can access regular Windows at all.<br />
<br />
You can try an In-Place Upgrade (hopefully saves programs and data)&nbsp;or a repair installation (hopefully<br />
saves data and will have to reinstall programs). Be sure to do a good backup or three.<br />
<br />
You can use another's DVD as they are not copy protected however you will need you own Product Key.<br />
<br />
In-Place Upgrade<br />
<span>http://vistasupport.mvps.org/repair_a_vista_installation_using_the_upgrade_option_of_the_vista_dvd.htm</span><br />
<br />
<br />
If nothing works you can do a repair installation which should save data however you will have to
<br />
reinstall programs. This also requires the correct Vista disks especially for OEM versions. You will<br />
need to know your Product Code.<br />
<br />
This tells you how to access the System Recovery Options and/or from a&nbsp;Vista DVD<br />
<span>http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/326b756b-1601-435e-99d0-1585439470351033.mspx</span><br />

<br />
---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Another method that sometimes works : In the Command Prompt of a Vista boot disk type :<br />
(type one line or copy and paste one line at a time and then hit enter - <strong>
do not type parenthesis<br />
or BOLD</strong>)<br />
<br />
c:<br />
<br />
cd\<br />
<br />
cd c:\Windows\System32\winevt&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>(there is a space between cd and C: )<br />
</strong><br />
ren Logs&nbsp;LogsOLD&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>(there are spaces between&nbsp;ren&nbsp;and Logs and&nbsp;Logsold)</strong>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
REBOOT to Windows<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.<br />

<p>I am still having trouble unlocking the associated achievements... according to Bioware, uninstalling &amp; redownloading the DLC may fix it. &nbsp;I deleted all the DLC for DA2 and redownloaded all of it, then used Sebastian in the final mission and nothing ever

<p>[/quote]</p>
<p>Not really true. That character's story expands the entire game from Act 1 to Act 3, with plenty of quests along the way. Like some other people in the thread I got it with my Bioware Signature Edition, but I think it's worth the 560 MS. I've seen worse
 DLC for 560 ms and no achievements (Fable 3's Understone Quest pack for example).</p>

<p>It's actually cheaper to just buy the entire pack for 400MSP. After playing with all the items from start to finish, I would say in my opinion that the Rogue and Mage sets are the best. They contain weapons and other items that you can use the entire game
 because they scale with level. Take the Rogue knives for example, they are now the best weapons in the game for rogue that you can use the entire game. Sometimes you would come upon some daggers with higher attack but considering the bonus stats on the knives
 they are still better. Same with the Mage staff in the pack, the Warrior doesn't have a two hand sword that levels up with you, so I was disappointed in that, however it does have some pretty sweet swords in the pack.</p>

<p>My gripe with the DLC items is if you have them from the start of a new playthrough you don't need to buy any other weapons throughout the game. All items in the three packs seem way overpowered in comparison&nbsp;to the in-game items for the comparable equipping
 requirements.</p>
<p>Plus, you get them delivered to your home with no cost or effort involved. Bioware should have made you work for them, either in finding them as washed up cargo on the Wounded Coast, or stealing them from the Templar's armoury, or some other believable means
 of acquisition.</p>
<p>I find it extremely unlikely&nbsp;that penniless Gamlen has been hoarding such treasures or you dragged it all from Lothering.<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fforums.xbox.com%2femoticons%2femotion-7.gif" /></p>

<p>I understand this isn't an official accessory issue but there seems to be no other forum for this problem. Feel free to move this thread wherever necessary!</p>
<p>I have a 4tb Seagate external hard drive. My console is set to instant-on. I have the option "when Xbox is off, turn off storage" checked.</p>
<p>Whenever I turn the console off, the external drive will spin up for about 20 seconds and then go silent for about 20 more seconds, before repeating this cycle at least 30 times over the next half an hour or so. Then it finally settles down and I don't hear
 it again unless the Xbox gets an update.</p>
<p>This happens with every external drive I've tried on mine and my friends console - I'm in the preview but he isn't.
</p>
<p>I don't want to disable instant-on mode in favour of energy saving mode. I see no reason why the hard drive needs to do this so much immediately after turning off... what can I do? Is this an Xbox issue overall? Does anyone else experience this? It's extremely
 annoying and sometimes I just turn the hard drive off completely to avoid hearing it.</p>

<p>tis is not a problem at all this is just the hard drive either cooling its self down or trying to organize data that it just recived. no reason to worry the actual xbox does this as well

<p>It deifnitely is a problem, it's not the hard drive cooling itself down (it's not hot) and it's not trying to organise data it just received (it's turned off and didn't receive anything recently, and happens every time I turn it off), and the built-in Xbox
 hard drive does not do this at all.</p>

<p>I have a question and it could be a simple one. I'm trying to file share but the other person can't see any of my games. All my games are saved to an external hard drive. Could my games being stored in the EH prevent the other person from downloading my
 games? Or do they just have it messed up on their end. (Sorry if the isn't the right place for this question.)</p>

<p>The location of your games doesn't matter, as they're not shared from your Xbox.</p>
<p>When you buy a game digitally from Xbox Live, it's added to a list on your account. When you share with another console, it simply checks that list and lets the other person download the same games.</p>
<p>If you don't own any digital games, you can't share anything - it's not possible to share games that you own on a disc (other than giving your friend the disc)</p>

            <p>Hey Mr XBob! Using Instant On mode will allow the Xbox read and write to your external HDD even after powering off your console. Check out <a href="http://support.xbox.com/xbox-one/console/change-power-settings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Change Power Settings on Your Xbox One</a> for more information on changing this.

<p>Hi! I do understand this, and that's fine but that's not what I'm describing unfortunately.</p>
<p>When I get an update, I do hear it come on and it downloads and then it shuts off when it's done. But my issue is that even if there are no updates available, the very second I turn my Xbox off, the hard drive comes back on for 20 seconds. Then off for 20
 seconds. Then on for 20 seconds. Then off for 20 seconds, and it does this for a very long time.</p>
<p>Like I said, it does it with every hard drive I've tried so I know the drive isn't the issue - and it does it with my friends console, so I know my console isn't the issue. Also I'm in the preview, but he isn't, so I know it's not a preview update issue
 either.</p>

<p>It does, because the Xbox is no longer able to send signals to the hard drive, so it stays off for good. But I want to use Instant On mode</p>

    <title>A problem about maintenance of Surface Pro4 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> augoct  say:</h3>
<h2>            A problem about maintenance of Surface Pro4</h2>
                    <p>I bought a SP4 in China one and a half years ago. It worked well until it updated automatically on July 29th. The touch screen cannot work normally. In fact, you can refef to this page https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/forum/surfpro4-surfupdate/surface-pro-4-broken-after-26th-july-update/db8dcfd0-e033-443c-a01f-1a62a075f71f</p>
<p>What happend to his device also happend to me. That's why I sent my device to Microsoft China in Suzhou, Jiangsu ON Aug 13th. However, they told me that my order is in abnormal contidion. There is no information about my device. They just told me to wait
 with patience.&nbsp; FOURTEEN days passed, and my patience has gone completely. I will go to university in 4 days, and I need my Surface Pro to study urgently. If they couldn't fix my device, they should just send me a new device. Does not they? My device is still
 in guarantee.</p>
<p>Anyway, I need a responsible reply, not only continue telling me to wait with patience again.</p>

<p>Dear Marby Rey,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As you are aware the thread quoted by <em>AugOct</em> was started by me on July 28th. I am yet to have a decent response either from my ticket:&nbsp;<span>SRX*******
</span>or from any other form of communication.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have now had broken firmware (no screen, pen, shut down) on my Surface for over 5 weeks due to diligently updating my Surface as Microsoft instructed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE can you do something to reinstall some confidence in Microsoft customer care?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>            Windows Creators Update&#58; Renders my PC Unable to Boot</h2>
                    <p>Hi there everybody,</p>
<p>
</p><p>So yesterday I finally decided to update my computer to the creator's update after putting it off for a while. I downloaded everything and hit install, no worries there.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, during the installation process, something went very wrong. At around 22% completion, my PC rebooted and suddenly displayed my normal boot screen with a white text saying "BlInitialization failed 0xc00000bb", and I have absolutely no idea what this
 is. I tried resetting my SSD (Kingston 128GB) but this issue is so bad that it won't even let me do that. At first my SSD was locked, then I unlocked it using commands in CMD but it all of the sudden disappeared and windows has no idea that it even exists.
 I tried resetting everything and all Windows tells me is "We ran into an error." or something like that and that's it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have any idea what's wrong? My PC was scanned for viruses that same day and I know there are no viruses or any strange activity before this. This stupid update ruined my computer and I am unable to even boot because my SSD is seemingly corrupt
 and no troubleshooting can yield me any results.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If anyone has any other helpful information, I'd absolutely love to hear it. Thank you!</p>
<p>
</p><p>My SSD is a 128GB Kingston and my motherboard is a Gigabyte motherboard.</p>
<p />

<p>Hi Aaron,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>One of the possible reasons why your PC fails to boot into normal mode are broken components on the boot configuration data of your system. To isolate your concern, we suggest that you perform the following steps to trigger
<strong>Safe</strong> <strong>Mode </strong>through the <strong>Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE)</strong> option</span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">. To do this, follow the steps below:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong><span>Improper shutdown process</span></strong>
<ul>
<li><span>Turn on your computer. When the Windows logo is visible, unplug the power source of your computer. Perform this step three times.</span></li><li><span>On the fourth time that you turn on your computer, just simply wait for the
<strong>Windows Recovery Environment (WinRE)</strong> window to appear.</span></li></ul>
</li><li><span>On the <strong>Choose an option</strong> screen, select
<strong>Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced options &gt; Startup Settings</strong> and click <strong>
Restart</strong>.</span></li><li><span>Once your computer restarts, you will see a list of options. Press the
<strong>F4</strong> key to start your computer in <strong>Safe Mode</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span>We also recommend that you perform a system restore after booting in safe mode.
</span><span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">This option takes your PC back to an earlier point in time. Restoring won’t affect your personal files, but it will remove apps, drivers, and updates installed after the restore point was made. To do
 this, follow the steps below:</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Right-click on the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><span>Start</span></strong>&nbsp;<strong>Menu</strong> and select&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel</strong>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">On the upper-right window, under <strong><span>View</span></strong>
<strong><span>by</span></strong>, click <strong>
<span>Category</span></strong> and select
<strong><span>Large</span></strong> <strong>
<span>icons</span></strong>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Search&nbsp;<strong>Control Panel</strong>&nbsp;for&nbsp;<strong>Recovery</strong>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Select&nbsp;<strong>Recovery</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Open System Restore</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>.</span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">Choose the restore point related to the problematic app, driver, or update, and then select&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Finish</strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Let us know if the solution above works for you.</span></p>

<p>Hey! So I attempted to boot my computer into WinRE but unfortunately I cannot do this because my PC is unable to even start windows. When I boot my PC, it just shows my motherboard brand with no loading dots or anything. A few seconds later it says "BIInitialization
 failed 0xc00000bb". </p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I can get to WinRE using my USB I got Windows 10 from. (It's the light blue background stuff after I click Repair My PC, right?)&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's my next issue: I cannot actually reset or reformat or rollback. I don't have any rollback points that my computer can find (although I have rolled back before, not sure why I can't now) and when I try to reset my whole SSD and delete absolutely everything,
 Windows simply doesn't let me. None of the recovery options work. Everytime I try to reset my SSD (without completely deleting everything for recycle use, I don't want to do that) it just tells me "Windows ran into a problem." and that's it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Am I gonna need to buy a whole new SSD to install windows on? Why can I not do anything to fix this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the confusing issue, I am not sure how Microsoft's update managed to ruin my computer like this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you so much for your support :)</p>

<p><span>In this case, to regain access in Windows, we recommend that you perform an in-place upgrade using an ISO file to repair any broken system file while keeping your personal files, settings and installed applications. To do this, follow the steps provided

<p>Hello Aaron. I know how you must be feeling -&nbsp;after&nbsp;Creators Fall WU was installed the first screen I got was that my PC had run into a problem BSOD - error 0xc0000225 Win 10. I couldn't get to my desktop to run an repair etc. programs. So I created this:

<p>
</p><p>Monkey57's patience and advice to do a Clean Install has resolved my problem and I'm overjoyed&nbsp;- I now have my main laptop back, although I have some more work to do now.</p>
<p>I strongly suggest that you follow his advice mainly on the pages at the end and go for it. Do let me know how you get on - please!!</p>
