            It might be a compatibility issue with the latest version of Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Unfortunately, you will have to perform a new install. This appears to be a serious bug many are encountering with the new version of Windows 10.
<br />
<br />I am going to recommend you downgrade to Windows 10 1703.
<br />
<br />Yes, not the best news you want to hear. These feature updates are not thoroughly engineered and are rushed mostly to meet deadlines. They have become highly unnecessary in some instances. My opinion, focus on the apps and less on having the latest version of Windows. If your apps are working fine and you are getting your work done, minimize your need to jump on the latest release. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Now, get ready to go back to your previous version. I recommend Windows 10 1703 because its the most stable and efficient release to date. 
<br />
<br />
<br />Step 1: Go to another working computer with Internet access, download Windows 10 1703 from the following link:
<br /><a href="https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf51-12ed-19f5-2885-3b48ad9ee67b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://tb.rg-adguard.net/index.php?sid=74a7cf5...</a>
<br />
<br />Choose the following:
<br />
<br />- Windows Final
<br />- Windows 10, version 1703
<br />- Windows 10 Pro + Home
<br />- English
<br />- x64 (64 bit) x32 (32 bit)
<br />
<br />Step 2: create a bootable copy
<br /><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/how-to-prepare-bootable-install-media-for-windows/442447c3-0826-4473-a5b7-36568d20ef9d">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wik...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 3: perform a custom install
<br /><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-do-a-custom-installation-of-windows/38adfa8c-32f8-4354-8c53-13b5f2cf7e44">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Step 4: how to recover your files from Windows.old:

<br />Windows Update might attempt to upgrade to Windows 10 1803 again. See instructions how to block it:

            Hi himax, do you get the Windows spinning dots on the Lenovo screen?
<br />
<br />If so, 
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset       
        </p>

<p>This is possible but often tends to be a disaster if some of the computers are laptops that use an overlay for the keypad. I'm guessing this is why there is no GPO.</p>
<p>
</p><p>e.g. The keypad overlay on Sony laptops is</p>
<p>789</p>
<p>UIO</p>
<p>JKL</p>
<p>&nbsp;M</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you wan't to script it or add a registry template, the key and value is as follows...</p>
<p>HKEY_USERS\.Default\Control Panel\Keyboard</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; InitialKeyboardIndicators=0 - NumLock Off</p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; InitialKeyboardIndicators=2 - NumLock On

    <title>windows restore stuck - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> toadster89  say:</h3>
<h2>            windows restore stuck</h2>
                    I went to do a system restore on my Windows 10 laptop, but it got stuck at 3% for about 6 hours. The percentage went away and now I have a black screen that has the spinning loading sign, which it has been doing for 2 days now. I had another problem which
 the forums said a system restore would fix, and since I am not the best with computers I followed a step by step guide to do it. I am unable to do anything with the computer. I have read posts of others that have similar problems but all the answers say to
 download drivers and stuff like that. I am unable to do any of that because the screen is completely blank except for the spinning wheel. Please help I can't afford another computer.

    <title>Cannot access Windows 8 App Store or any app associated with it. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nikups  say:</h3>
<h2>            Cannot access Windows 8 App Store or any app associated with it.</h2>
                    I downloaded <i><u><b>Windows 8 Pro on Nov 1 , 2012</b></u></i> . Everything was working fine until today. Now I cannot access the Windows App Store or any app associated with it. I am receiving
<u><b>NO ERROR MESSAGE </b></u>. The little circle thing just keps turning and turning. Without having an error message I have no idea where to start in finding what is causing me to be unable to connect. I have looked online for a solution but they all say
 they are receiving an error message saying "<u><i><b>App Store cannot connect to internet."&nbsp;
</b></i></u>I cannot find a post anywhere with someone having the exact problem as me.&nbsp;
<b>CAN ANYONE HELP ME WITH THIS PROBLEM</b> ? <b>Is anyone else having this problem ? Any help will be greatly appreciated.</b><br />
<b><br />
NOTE</b>------ <u><b>I have tried all solutions i have found online short of System Refresh because I am still waiting for my Windows 8 Pro backup DVD from Microsoft.</b></u>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 3:</span></b><span> <b>Check in Safe mode with Networking</b></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Boot the computer in Safe mode with Networking and check if the issue persists. Follow these steps to start the computer in safe mode.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>a)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Press the ‘<b>Windows + C</b>’ key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span><span>b)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on <b>settings</b>,
<b>more pc settings</b> and then <b>general</b>.</span></p>

<b>restart now</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click on <b>troubleshoot</b>,
<b>advanced options</b>, <b>Windows Startup Settings</b>.</span></p>
<p><span><span>e)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span>Click <b>restart</b>, select
<b>safe mode with networking</b> and then press <b>enter</b>.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> Restart the computer to start in normal mode.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Method 4:</span></b><span> If the issue does not persists in safe mode then perform a clean boot to check if any third party application is causing the issue, as clean boot helps in eliminating software conflicts. Follow these steps to start the
 computer in clean boot.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 1:</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a) Press the <b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the <b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click the <b>‘Boot’</b> tab and uncheck <b>‘Safe Boot’</b> option.</span></p>
<p><span>d) On the <b>‘General’</b> tab, click to select the option <b>‘Selective startup’</b>, and then click to clear the option
<b>Load startup items</b> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>e) On the <b>‘Services’</b> tab, click to select the <b>‘Hide all Microsoft services’</b> check box, and then click
<b>‘Disable all’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>f) On the <b>‘StartUp’</b> tab, click ‘<b>Open Task Manager’. </b>In the<b> Task Manager window
</b>under<b> startup tab, </b>right click on each startup item which are enabled and select ‘<b>Disable’.</b></span></p>
<p><span>g) Click <b>‘OK’</b>, and then click Restart.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 2: Enable half of the services</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a) Follow steps 1a and 1b to start the System Configuration utility.</span></p>
<p><span>b) Click the <b>Services</b> tab, and then click to select the <b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box.</span></p>
<p><span>c) Click to select half of the check boxes in the <b>Service</b> list.</span></p>
<p><span>d) Click <b>OK</b>, and then click <b>Restart</b>.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 3: Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
<b>Service</b> list.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 2. In step 2, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Service</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If only one service is selected in the <b>Service</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the selected service causes the problem. Go to step 6. If no service causes this problem, go to step 4.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 4: Enable half of the Startup items </span></b></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 5: Determine whether the problem returns</span></b></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>If the problem still occurs, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, click to clear half of the check boxes that you originally selected in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If the problem does not occur, repeat step 1 and step 4. In step 4, select only half of the remaining check boxes that are cleared in the
<b>Startup Item</b> list. Repeat these steps until you have selected all the check boxes.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If only one startup item is selected in the <b>Startup Item</b> list, and you still experience the problem, the startup item that is selected in the list is the service that is causing the problem. Go to step 6.</span></p>
<p><span><br />
If no startup item causes this problem, a Microsoft service most likely causes the problem. To determine which Microsoft service may be causing the problem, repeat step 1 and step 2 without selecting the
<b>Hide all Microsoft services</b> check box in either step.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 6: Resolve the problem</span></b></p>
<p><b><span><br />
</span></b><span>After you determine the startup item or the service that causes the problem, contact the program manufacturer to determine whether the problem can be resolved. Or, run the System Configuration utility, and then click to clear the check box
 for the problem item.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Step 7:</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span>Note:</span></b><span> After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to boot to normal startup.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>a) Press the <b>‘Windows + R’</b> key on the keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b) In the <b>‘Run’</b> windows type <b>’MSCONFIG’</b> and click <b>‘Ok’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>c) On the <b>‘General’</b> tab, click the <b>‘Normal Startup’</b> option, and then click
<b>‘OK’</b>.</span></p>
<p><span>d) When you are prompted to restart the computer, click <b>‘Restart’</b>.</span></p>

I am in safe mode with networking right now, and I'm having the same problem as you MPC Spragge. With so many windows 8 pro users experiencing the same issue for so long is ridiculous. When is Microsoft going to fix this issue??? I'm jonesing for my Mahjong

            Thanks Sharief K! I have tried everything. Everything you listed above, along with all other methods listed on any forum regarding Windows 8 and not being able to login to the store or my MS Solitaire and MS Mahjong games on my laptop. This has been going
 on for weeks and I am really needing my MS games fix, bad :-) Anyhow, right now I am in clean boot and still have same problem. I clean booted to local account (here now) and still cannot login to my games or the app store. The trouble shooter acts like it
 is working, keeps saying something about my display driver (I have the most recent nVidia driver from nVidia). After I reboot, nothing has changed. I am so frustrated right now after weeks of taking all of these steps and being unsuccessful with all of them.
 I would think that Microsoft would have a permanent fix that works the first time. Especially with so many paying customers having the same issue. Is there anything not listed in any of the forums and fixes that show up when I do a Google search&nbsp; for not being
 able to login to windows 8 store or apps? I even reset windows 8 not to long ago and that didn't even work???<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance Sharief!<br />
<br />
Marty<br />

<h2>            Email messages in MIME format</h2>
                    <p>I am running Windows 8 with Windows Live Mail.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lately, why am I getting some of my email (about 25% of them) in: MIME format -- they are all text in the message body with the words jumbled up. There are no images, just all text. I cannot read any of the text.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other 75% of my emails are OK. Within the message body the images show also.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is only on my desktop Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The start screen mail which also has Windows Live mail, every email is perfect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you,</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks for posting. I understand that you are having issues on your emails. I would like to ask some questions for isolation:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you use the Mail app to compare the messages you received, does the emails in MIME format have an embedded content? Is it specific to those messages only?</li><li>If you check on web, do you still encounter the issue?</li></ul>
<p>Also, I would like to ask for a sample email where you are encountering the issue so we can check on our end. You can upload it in the private message area. Access it by signing in to Microsoft Community and hit Private Messages link.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Richard</p>

</p><p>Hello superniceguy,</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>We're sorry to hear about your frustrations with the program. We'll take your sentiment and feedback and provide it to the appropriate team. Clicking on the "Activate this offer" button in the email would have opted in to this offer, and taken you to the mission page which outlined the spend requirement. If you had completed the offer, any eligible MyVIP spending past that point would have gone towards MyVIP. This offer was special in that it required users to manually opt in. All other offers are automatically started. Since you chose to opt in, your purchases went towards progressing that offer. Unfortunately, there is no way to opt out of the current retro rewards offer.</p>

<h2>            Installing Dutch Language Pack - Windows 8.1 - &#40;KB2839636&#41; stuck</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Language Install does nothing </p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm trying to install Dutch (Nederlands) language pack. When the "Download and Install Updates" window appears, the following status appears:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Initializing installation...done!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Installing Dutch Language Pack - Windows 8.1 - (KB2839636) [nl-NL-LP] (update 1 of 1 )...</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>After that, nothing happens. I've waited 2 hours, and nothing happens. It doesn't freeze, just does nothing. If I examine the task manager, the CPU usage on the "Language Pack Installer" is 0%. The CPU never does anything with it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's the solution here?</p>

<h2>            Are the xbox live servers for the 360 going to get shut down&#63;</h2>
                    Are the xbox 360 servers going to be shut down with the release of the Xbox One? If they do, all xbox 360's will be useless and I don't want to buy a new console. If they're getting shut down, I'm just going to switch to a playstation.

            <p>It's highly unlikely. Look how long the original Xbox servers stayed on after the release of the 360. I think the 360 has a lot more life in it.</p>

<p>Not much I'll bet...when I saw the reveal that was the first thing I thought of. &nbsp;If you remember, the old Xbox servers were shut off in April, 2010, 4.5 years after the 360 came out. &nbsp;I would bet real money that the 360 servers will be gone by 2020. &nbsp;The
 only reason I think they will last that long&nbsp;is because that at the moment, no one believes there will be any backwards compaitibility with the One so there will probably still be a huge following for the COD games online along with Halo and GOW. &nbsp;If those
 players start slacking off however when the One is released you will see the 360 servers shut down. &nbsp;And it is possible that individual game severs could be shut off...I am surprised Halo 3's are still up. &nbsp;There was at least one 360 game that has its' servers
 shut down a few years ago...anyone remember what it was?</p>

<p>I hope not. The 360 still offers great multiplayer. And because of the full-on, drown-in-your-soup idiotic move to not give the One backwards compatibility, I will be holding on to my 360. And 360 owners shouldn't have to lament the loss of these great games
 because of the One. </p>
<p>Honestly, can we get some OFFICIAL yes or no on this subject?</p>

<p>Unless there's something specific that comes up that they'll have to drop from the 360 (I doubt so, since they ditched the original LIVE servers due to that issue so it should be fairly future proof now,) 360 LIVE should remain up as it'll keep drawing in
 money for some time.</p>

<p>I hope so. Besides, I can't think of a reason why both the X1 and 360 couldn't both use XBL at the same time.Again, though, official confirmation would be nice.</p>

<p>They can...as I mentioned both the original Xbox and the 360 were both on live for several years. &nbsp;But the issue is how much of the community will stay playing the 360 games when the One comes out: &nbsp;when the 460 community starts to die the servers will get
 shut down.</p>

            Hi Richard. this is a known bug caused by an incompatibility between the new update and your video device driver . . .
<br />
<br />Try rolling that device driver back to a previous version and then restart to see if this resolves the issue.
<br />
<br />Microsoft are aware of the compatibility issue and will hopefully release a patch for this as soon as possible . . .

            Please try these options one by one and check after each option. 
<br />
<br />1. Use the Hardware &amp; Devices Troubleshooter
<br />Type Troubleshoot in Windows Start Search box &gt; Click Troubleshoot &gt; Scroll down &amp; Click Hardware &amp; Devices &gt; Click Run the Troubleshooter &amp; follow on-screen directions &gt; Restart the computer after troubleshooting is completed
<br />
<br />2. This will not correct the problem but will provide relief - Right click on battery icon in Task bar &gt; Power options &gt; Change plan settings &gt; Change advanced power settings &gt; Expand Display &gt; Check the values under Display brightness, Dimmed display brightness and Enable adaptive brightness
<br />
<br />3. Take actions related to Display Driver
<br />Windows Key+X &gt; Click Device Manager &gt; Expand Display Adapter &gt; Right click on Display Driver below &gt;
<br />
<br />A. Rollback the Driver 
<br />Click Properties &gt; Go to Driver tab &gt; If there is rollback option, click it
<br />
<br />B. Uninstall the Driver 
<br />Uninstall &gt; Reboot the computer &gt; The driver will be installed automatically when you restart
<br />
<br />C. Update driver from manufacturer's website
<br />Go to the website of the display adapter's manufacturer or computer's manufacturer &gt; See if some driver is released for your model and OS &gt; If yes, download that &gt; In previous option, you click Update Driver Software, in place of this, click Uninstall &gt; Install the downloaded driver &gt; Restart your computer
<br />
<br />3. I would recommend that you should consider rolling back 1803 to 1709 and defer it from happening as there seem to be issues. Try to install this after a month or two when more cum packs are released stabilizing 1803 further. (Roll back can be done only if you were upgraded during last 10 days i.e. you are within 10 days roll back window)
<br />
<br />Roll Back - Windows Key+I &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Recovery &gt; Under Go back to previous version of Windows 10, Get Started &gt; Follow onscreen directions
<br />

<p><span>Hi Arlene Moss,</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span>I understand that you are facing issues with Skype.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Quick questions:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Is the issue confined to Skype?</span></p>
<p><span>Do you get the error when trying to install Skype or when you try to run the program?</span></p>
<p><span>Let's try these steps and check the results.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>You may rename Skype folder to Skype. Old in C:\Users\”username”\AppData\Roaming. Follow the steps mentioned below to rename the folder and then restart Skype:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Click Start, Type run, Type %appdata% and hit enter.<br />
b. Right click on Skype Folder, click on Rename and type Skype. Old.<br />
c. Restart Skype and check if you are able to open Skype.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Perform System Restore.</span></strong></p>
<p><span>System Restore helps you restore your computer's system files to an earlier point in time. Typically, you want to restore your computer to a restore point that was created just before the date and time when you started noticing problems. The descriptions
 of the restore points that are created automatically correspond with the name of an event, such as Windows Update installing an update. System Restore returns your computer to the state that it was in before the restore point that you choose.
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>System Restore</span></strong></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span>Method 3:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Try to uninstall and re-install Skype and check whether the issue is resolved or not.<br />
<br />
<strong><span>Uninstall or change a program </span></strong></span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><strong><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Uninstall-or-change-a-program</span></strong></a></span></p>

<p>I might say the same! I asked you to do&nbsp;four things:</p>

</p><ol>
<li>If possible, post the instructions you received from Cox so we can see whether there's anything wrong with them*. You're not the only Cox customer who's run in to trouble after following them.</li><li>Post the error message so we can see what's wrong;</li><li>Post your version of the program, and</li><li>Post your version of Windows.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>We can't possibly make sensible suggestions unless we have this information.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>A Microsoft Rep ... told me it no longer was supported.</p>

<p>The program has reached end-of-life as far as Microsoft is concerned. That doesn't mean that it no longer works, just that Microsoft have nothing to do with it any more. I don't know what the customer service person meant by
<em>Windows Live Mail cannot support this change. </em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Please reply with the information I asked for.</p>

</p>
<p>

<p>After making any change to security settings, it's a good idea to close down Windows Live Mail and wait a few minutes for the program to complete its housekeeping and store the new settings. Then re-launch the program and test by sending a new test message.
 Be sure to empty the outbox beforehand.</p>

    <title>Why is folder size not displayed when viewing in details mode&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> muskegon  say:</h3>
<h2>            Why is folder size not displayed when viewing in details mode&#63;</h2>
                    <p>
There's something about Windows that has always puzzled me. &nbsp;Let's say you have a directory in which there are some additional directories (folders) and some standalone files. &nbsp;When in that directory you select details for your viewing mode. &nbsp;Right click on
 a standalone file, select properties and you'll see the file size. &nbsp;Do the same for a folder and you'll see the folder size. &nbsp;This tells you that the information about the size of the file or folder is present. &nbsp;Yet when you select view details, the size of
 the standalone files is displayed but the size of the folders is not displayed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
The first thing I thought of is Microsoft does this is because they make money selling software to people who get annoyed with this. &nbsp;I don't think this is the case, as I was easily able to get free third party vendor software to display the folder size. &nbsp;And
 while I was conducting searches for such software I didn't see that Microsoft sells any software which accomplishes this. &nbsp;So it's unlikely the reason is because they'll make a bunch of money selling software.</p>
<p>
It was suggested that the reason could be because it takes up a lot of system resources to display folder size. &nbsp;That can't be the reason folder size isn't displayed, as if I right click on a 120 GB folder with some 12,000 files, it takes no longer to display
 the full properties than if I right click on a 1 MB file. &nbsp;And even if it did take up more resources, Microsoft could easily create a toggle mode in which the user could toggle on or off the folder size view.</p>
<p>
Perhaps it was an oversight on Microsoft's part. &nbsp;I can't imagine that could have been the case, as there are millions of Windows users around the world and I can't imagine no one pointed this out to Microsoft even as early as Windows 95. &nbsp;Furthermore, a company
 such as Microsoft must have a substantial product development department in which they review potential issues like this.</p>
<p>
So this leaves just about one possibility. &nbsp;Could it be some sort of marketing reason - perhaps they're waiting for a new version of Windows to come out which they know won't be much of an improvement, but they'll fix the folder size issue to help sell this
 new version. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
Does anyone know why Microsoft doesn't display the folder size?</p>

            FWIW - I suspect it is the overhead required to calculate it every time you click on a folder.&nbsp; If there are a large volume of files and possibly many sub-folders that could introduce significant delay.&nbsp;&nbsp; Try selecting your Windows folder and right click
 for properties.&nbsp; You'll see it take quite a while to calculate it.&nbsp; Windows has to iterate every sub-folder and their sub folders and add up the file sizes.<br />
<br />
I agree that a switch to enable or disable that capability would be a nice option though.<br />

<h2>            Windows 8 default drivers incompatible with OpenGL</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a problem with my windows 8.1 machines. By default windows installs a microsoft driver for the onboard intel video adapter. But this driver doesn't support OpenGL correctly. So I installed the older windows 7 driver instead and everything worked fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now windows automatically replaces the windows 7 driver with the newer windows 8 microsoft driver in the background. How can I prevent windows from doing this?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried the following:</p>
<p>- I've uninstalled the windows 8 driver in the driver manager incl. deleting driver software (checkbox checked)</p>
<p>- I've turned off automatic driver download from windows update at system properties&nbsp;</p>
<p>- I've enabled a GPO to prevent the installation devices with a certain device id</p>
<p>
</p><p>But nothing helped...</p>
<p>
</p><p>The GPO prevents me (=administrator) from installing a video driver but the windows os itself still replaces the driver. I cannot determine when windows performs the driver replacement but after some hours or after a day the driver is changed suddenly.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope someone can help me!</p>

<p>
</p><p>When I uncheck the option</p>
<p>
</p><p>"Automatically get the device app and info provided by your device manufacturer"
</p>
<p>
</p><p>the driver remains and will not be replaced. This checkbox can be found at system properties behind the device installations settings button.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>But I don't understand, why this option must be unchecked. I would be very glad if you can tell me what this option effects.</span><br />

            <p>Hello Jeff,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your question on Microsoft Community Forum.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you restore the drive from the backup, drive will not return to same defragmented state.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, backing up data before doing anything with drive is always recommended.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disk Defragmenter rearranges fragmented data so your disks and drives can work more efficiently.</p>

<p>OK, I will try to track it down.&nbsp; I seem to recall it was on the "READ" document of the defrag utility itself, but I do not explicitly remember.&nbsp; At the time I was doing a LabView install &amp; typically before I do that process I did a defrag &amp; system image
 beforehand because LabView can be quite an interactive &amp; tedious process versus other software installations.&nbsp; If something goes wrong &amp; it has in the past you cannot simply uninstall.&nbsp; To get rid of the entire installation it pretty much mandates a COMPLETE
 reformatting of the drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You would think this is unnecessary &amp; it should be, but if you have hardware you are running based on a utility that is no longer being updated by NI &amp; you install a new version of LabView without realizing this then the hardware is no longer recognized.&nbsp;
 So to reinstall the old hardware driver cannot be done without removing the new version of LabView &amp; it has to be a COMPLETE removal which involves the registry.&nbsp; So the quickest way is reformat &amp; reinstall the older version.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyway, sorry for the long-winded &amp; annoying details, but my fundamental question does a restore/recovery eliminate the issue of defragmentation or does the fragmentation of the drive get preserved in the system image?&nbsp; I thought about doing an experiment
 on a dormant laptop, but I thought someone in Microsoft would already have the knowledge on this.</p>
<p>

<p>Oh, by the way.&nbsp; What I stated above is NECESSARY for LabView installed on WINDOWS.&nbsp; This is not the case for other systems.&nbsp; So to dig a DIRTY knife this is a MICROSOFT issue versus NI.&nbsp; That might be a bit of a sensitive statement, but I have experience
 on this.</p>

<p>So if I understand you correctly that if I intend to do a bckup/retore then dfragging beforehand is completely unnecessary?&nbsp; Also, can dfragging potentially mess up the registry &amp; cause the system to become unbootable?&nbsp; I seem to recall (this was some time
 ago) a discussion on this topic in WINDOWS 7 forum which is another website separate from MICROSOFT.</p>

<p>
</p><p>NO I think what you're considering will take much much longer. First of all it would've been helpful if you had said how big your HD is and also how full it is.&nbsp; If you have a large HD like say ...... 1TB and&nbsp;its pretty full and you haven't&nbsp;defragged it&nbsp;in
 years it might take&nbsp;3-4&nbsp;&nbsp;hours.&nbsp;Plus, I don't see the point in backing up your HD prior to doinga defrag&nbsp;either. Defragging a HD isn't going to ruin your files. In fact you can use your pc while you defrag it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you choose to reformat your disc and then restore it from the back up you better make sure you do the back-up properly as an ISO Image.&nbsp;&nbsp;it will take more than a full day&nbsp;to do&nbsp;the defrag, back-up and recovery reinstall.&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as you defrag first then
 your system image recovery back up file will include the defragged&nbsp;HD files in your image disk.&nbsp;But you also seemed to be concerned that a defrag isn't thorough - that's not necessarily true. Its just that some files cannot be put back to their original place
 - this in no way effects the functioning of your computer. If your that concerned I suggest you download a free clean copy of your ISO image file of your OS here:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><a href="http://www.heidoc.net/joomla/technology-science/microsoft/14-windows-7-direct-download-links" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Win 7 OS File</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Be sure to choose the correct version of your OS and the correct encryption. Once you download it burn it as an ISO Image to a disc and you'll have to use the product key code from your original OS to install it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I just read your other post. I also looked up LabView. Its a software program suite which includes drivers for your hardware. Your hardware is your computer ok?&nbsp;The instructions for installation tell you that you must download and install it and the drivers&nbsp;in
 a certain order.&nbsp; If the order is incorrectly installed your pc will not recognize the drivers.&nbsp; That doesn't mean your hardware (your computer) is no longer recognized or stops functioning. And you certainly do NOT need to reformat your HD to get it off your
 computer. There are lots of FREE 3rd party uninstaller programs that uninstall software programs thoroughly taking out every file out even from the registry.&nbsp; IOBIT uninstaller is included in there utility program of multi-functions called Advanced System
 Care is one that comes to mind. Its free or paid and the free version works just fine.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The easiest way to do this is to simply create a restore point on your pc BEFORE you install the program. If you insist on defragging first you can also create a restore point before you do that as well. But its really unnecessary to format your HD either
 way.</p>

<p>Wow, you put in a lot of information in your response &amp; I am responding to be sure I interpret your advice correctly.&nbsp; I will do it point by point.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The 1 thing about LabView, the drivers are not for the computer but for peripheral devices that either collect data from sensors or send control signals to a system that is separate from the computer itself.&nbsp; My computer is simply an interface, other than
 that it does NOTHING.&nbsp; However, if new versions of LabView no longer supports or updates the driver that is already installed on your computer then you run the risk of not being able to interface with these EXTERNAL devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This unfortunately seems to be more of an issue with WINDOWS operating systems as opposed to others.&nbsp; I have speculations as to why this is the case, but it is mere SPECULATION.&nbsp; My most recent incident occurred last Oct in a control &amp; data acquisition system
 for a JET TURBINE.&nbsp; The external hardware including the turbine cost approx. $100K.&nbsp; We had to update to a newer version of LabView because WINDOWS 7 no longer supported the older version of LabView.&nbsp; After installing the newer version I lost the capability
 to interface with the external TURBINE hardware.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The company that sold us the TURBINE had to embark on an effort to redo their software &amp; hardware so that it would be compatible with the drivers on the newer&nbsp; version of LabView.&nbsp; However, in the interim I had to completely WIPE the computer harddrive to
 get rid or all of the registry entries for the newer version of LabView.&nbsp; I then reinstalled WINDOWS &amp; the older version of LabView &amp; everything is OK for now.&nbsp; Eventually, I will have to reinstall the new version of LabView along with the vendor updated software.&nbsp;
 That will probably be a 2 day effort on my part, because I will need to backup the system beforehand in case the new software still has problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So that is a response to one of your points.&nbsp; I will follow on the others because those are the matters I am interested in &amp; I think you were providing advice &amp; I want to be sure I am interpreting that advice correctly.</p>

<p>OK, I think you are telling me that defragging the drive does NOT pose a problem to the WINDOWS system itself.&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words it will not compromise the system to the point it cannot REBOOT.&nbsp; So backing up the system prior to defragging is COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY?</p>

<h2>            Dell xps15z Bios does not recognize charger</h2>
                    I updated to windows 10 and everything was working fine. I have 2 chargers that work and after disconnecting the battery, I am able to power up with each power supply. With the power supply plugged in, the battery does not drain, but does not charge either.
 I checked the bios and under ac charger it says unknown. I take it this is the problem. Anyone have an answer as to how to fix this ?

            <p>If you are sure the charger is strong enough to run your laptop (wattage is correct or stronger than required)</p>
<p>Then, you can turn off this warning in BIOS Settings under the POST Behaviour Section - uncheck 'Adapter Warning'</p>
<p>
</p><p>Dell's are very particular about the power supply used on their laptops, if it is not the correct one, it may not charge the battery. If it is the correct one and the battery is not charging, then either your battery is on the fritz or this may be caused
 by a driver issue</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are sure the adapter (charger unit) is correct and want to check for a driver issue follow these Steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disconnect Power Supply</li><li>Remove battery</li><li>Connect Power Supply</li><li>Turn on the laptop</li><li>Control Panel - &nbsp;Device Manager</li><li>Under the Batteries category, right-click all instances of Microsoft ACPI Compliant Control Method Battery , and Uninstall</li><li>Shutdown</li><li>Disconnect Power Supply</li><li>Insert battery</li><li>Connect Power Supply</li><li>Turn on the laptop </li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>I hope this Answers your Question!</p>

            Thanks for the reply. No luck following those steps. In the bios it says none or unknown for ac charger and this is causing the battery not to charge. Everything else works fine. I can power my computer with or without the battery. I do not get any warning
 signs for anything. The computer just doesn't recognize the charger. Would reinstalling the bios help? Thanks again for your response.

            <p>Are you using the recommended charger for the laptop?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are, then possibly, flash your BIOS with an update from Dell</p>
<p>
</p><p>If not, then there is no simple work around, there are ways, but they are not for the faint hearted . . . and not for this Forum</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Hope this Helps!</p>
