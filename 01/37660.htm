            This seems to be happening to several users, my solution is to manually set up the account rather than allowing the mail app to enter the server details.
<br />Incoming Mail (IMAP) Server - Requires SSL
<br />imap.gmail.com
<br />Port: 993
<br />Requires SSL:Yes
<br />
<br />Incoming Mail (POP3) Server - requires SSL:
<br />pop.gmail.com
<br />Use SSL: Yes
<br />Port: 995
<br />
<br />Outgoing Mail (SMTP) Server - Requires TLS or SSL
<br />smtp.gmail.com
<br />Port: 465 or 587
<br />Requires SSL: Yes
<br />Requires authentication: Yes
<br />Use same settings as incoming mail server
<br />
<br />Full Name or Display Name: [your name]
<br />Account Name or User Name: your full Gmail address (user...@gmail.com). Google Apps users, please enter user...@your_domain.com
<br />Email address: your full Gmail address (user...@gmail.com) Google Apps users, please enter user...@your_domain.com
<br />Password: your Gmail password
<br />If you have two-factor authentication on your account then an app specific password will be required instead of the account password.

            Not sure how I did this but I did go to the gmail account and change it to less secure apps.&nbsp; It now works.&nbsp; I really appreciate your providing guidance.

            Great news.
<br />Did you change that setting within the mail app or via your Google account?

            On most Windows 7 PCs there is a hidden hard disk partition that lets you perform a Factory Restore without installation DVDs. Check the manufacturer's home site for detailed instructions on how to use it.<br />

<p><span>This problem occurs because there are incorrect entries in the Shell folder of the user who is logged on to Microsoft Windows. When Windows Installer
 accesses the Shell folder assignment of the user who is logged on to the computer, Windows Installer cannot locate the correct entry. The solution is in</span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/886549" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/886549</span></span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>The steps to correct this problem involve editing the Windows Registry.&nbsp; Modifying REGISTRY settings incorrectly can cause serious problems that
 may prevent your computer from booting properly. Microsoft cannot guarantee that any problems resulting from the configuring of REGISTRY settings can be solved. Modifications of these settings are at your own risk.<span>&nbsp;</span>I suggest you first
 backup your registry as follows: </span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Back-up-the-registry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/Back-up-the-registry</span></span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Here are the steps to fix it.</span></p>
<p><span>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Click Start, click Run, type<strong>regedit
</strong>in the Open box, and then click OK.</span></p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Locate the following registry key:</span></p>
<p><span>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders\</span></p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Delete the entries that show the path that is listed in the error message.</span></p>
<span>From KB 886549</span><span><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/886549" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span>http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx/kb/886549</span></span></a></span><span>:<span>&nbsp;</span>Open
 Regedit again.&nbsp;In the left pane, right-click <strong>User Shell Folders</strong>, point to<strong>New</strong>, click
<strong>Expandable String Value</strong>, type the Name value that you want to reinstate (AppData)&nbsp;and then press ENTER. Right-click that&nbsp;value, click<strong>Modify</strong>, type the value in the
<strong>Value data</strong> box for the Value name, and then click<strong>OK. The value data should be:&nbsp;%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming.</strong><br />
<br />
Step 8 of KB 886549 suggests that you also check the values in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders. However, in fixing my problem, I did not have to modify any of the values in that registry key.<span>&nbsp;</span>If
 this does not work, follow ALL the steps in the referenced article.<br />
<br />
Good luck.</span>

<h2>            Windows 8 setup, how to remove hotspot shield</h2>
                    <p>Hello All, I have got stuck on my windows 8 install because the installer still thinks I have Hotspot Shield installed even though I have uninstalled and rebooted. This is what I have done so far:</p>
<p>1. Uninstalled Hotspot Shield</p>
<p>2. Removed all hotspot shield entries from registry (searched 'hotspot')</p>
<p>3. disabled hotspot shiels add-on in IE (cant see how to remove it)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet still windows 8 installer thinks I still have it and requires me to 'Manually Uninstall' it</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any help greatly appreciated</p>

            You have to look at the TrayApp in the Fix It App. Remove the "TrayApp" as it belongs to Hotspot Shield. Also Go into registry and search for Anchorfree and remove what you find. Also search in the registry for "Hss" and I repeat don't forget to remove
 "TrayApp". This is the most common mistake as nobody thinks that something named entirely different may belong to Hotspot Shield. Then after you reboot your Network drivers would be missing as they would be removed along with Hotspot Shield but don't worry
 as all those drivers are in the system and all you need to do is go to device manager and look for the Yellow marked network hardware then select it and install drivers automatically.

I have successfully managed to upgrade to Win 8, retaining all files and applications. Though AmnaBilal makes a good point, in my case "TrayApp" was not found. See below my route to success.</p>
<p>Note: I used an ISO burned on to a DVD for my installation.</p>
<p>I removed all Registry traces for Anchorfree, "Hss". I also removed all registry traces for taphss. This is the sys file that is used for the service. I also deleted the files from windows/system32 folder. Note that removal of some registry keys required
 changing permissions to the current user (full permissions) and change it back to as it was. Reboot.</p>
<p>msconfig was already configured to cleanboot (ie. load only MS Services)</p>
<p>I continued the MS 8 installation and this had not resolved the problem. </p>
<p>I decided to install Win 8 retaining only the files ( I was prepared to lose my apps!). All looked fine until the installation failed at 73%.</p>
<p>So the next step was to uninstall all the NICs. I feared that even though I had removed any Hotshield associations in the NIC properties, it may still have some remnants. I uninstalled the wired and wireless NICs. I also uninstalled VMWare workstation as
 this had 3 virtual NICs.Reboot</p>
<p>Launch the Setup again. This time, it started from the beginning and I chose to retain my Applications and Files. We were back in business! All went well (but rather slow...). In the end it prompted for a reboot...and then the dreaded message that Windows
 8&nbsp; installation was not successful. Google search turned out several results showing frustrated users (I don't blame them!) There were some posts that suggested removal of certain applications like Trusteer, iTunes, etc. I removed just Trusteer and another
 app (I wish I can remember!). Some posts also suggested user profile issues. I deleted all the "unknown" accounts that existed in my user profile list.</p>
<p>At this point I decided to look at msconfig and I could see that there were 3 boot options. I then took a chance and rebooted my laptop. And after several hours, I was running Windows 8 with all my compatible Applications and files! Windows automatically
 installed updated NIC drivers and enabled them.</p>
<p>Hope this post is of use for some others who have not been so successful!</p>

            I had this same problem when trying to install Windows 8.1. For anyone coming here on a search, I used the "Everything" search software (Google "everything software", the official site is down), searched "hss," and found that the program Expat Shield is
 a rebranded HotSpot Shield. Uninstalled that and everything is good to go.

            I used Revo Uninstaller because it was recommended by HotSpot Shield's Support. Revo has a free program and a paid pro plan. Upon signing up you can get a free trial of the pro for 30 days. I used it and was able to completely remove HotSpot Shield and
 download the new Windows 8.1. Now I can't load HotSpot Shield back onto my computer, but anyway that's how you can completely uninstall it.&nbsp;

    <title>How to go about preparing a new hard drive and installing Windows XP - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to go about preparing a new hard drive and installing Windows XP on it on a Thinkpad A30p&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have an IBM Thinkpad A30p which was running Windows XP. But now I have a problem. When I try to boot it up the splash screen appears with the progress bar but nothing further happens. I used the recovery console and found that boot sector is corrupted.
 Hard to remember all the tests I ran, but the bottom line seems to be that the problem is not fixable and I believe I saw something about physical damage to the drive.</p>
<p>So now I want to buy a new hard drive. First I'd like to know what hard drive to buy and where I might buy it. Next I'd like to learn what to do with the new drive when it arrives. I doubt that I can just remove the old drive and replace it with the new
 drive. I suspects there some other steps I need to take before I pop my Windows XP disk into the Thinkpad A30p and install XP on the new drive. I'm no techie, but I think I can do this with some step by step instructions if someone will be kind enough to provide
 them.</p>
<p>My specific questions:</p>
<p>1. What would be a good hard drive for me to get for this Thinkpad A30p?</p>
<p>2. Which mail order outfit should I use?</p>
<p>3. When the drive arrives what should I do, e.g. remove old drive, insert new drive in its place.</p>
<p>4. What steps do I take next?</p>
<p>Your help is very much appreciated. Thanks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>You visit IBM site and determine what / type of&nbsp;HD is used then you locate a supplier, who depends on your location.</p>
<p>Accprding to IBM site it was supplied with a 48gb drive, probably ide, its very unlikely you will be able to scource a new drive of the same size. Without delving to deep to determine what size drive your bios supports, or what sp level your winxp installation
 disk is, i'd suggest a drive no larger than 128gb as a replacement.</p>
<p>Then you replace the drive and reinstall winxp <a href="http://michaelstevenstech.com/cleanxpinstall.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

<p>I have a similar problem to Dejola.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I had a hard drive go bad a few days ago.&nbsp; Windows XP wouldn't load - Geel Squad ran&nbsp;it's diagnostics magic to confirm the bad hard drive.</p>
<p>Since, I've successfully installed a new hard drive and rebuilt my system.&nbsp; All is functioning, and now it is time to attempt recovery of data from the old hard drive.&nbsp; Both the old and new drives are SATA.&nbsp; This morning I reconnected the old drive to the
 system, checked the BIOS on reboot to see if the old drive was recognized.&nbsp; And it was, first good sign in a few days.&nbsp; XP started succesfully, and ran CheckDisk on the old HD.&nbsp; Errors were detected, but the process finished and XP activated as it should.&nbsp;
 I then went to the MY COMPUTER screen to see if I could open the drive, and did so successfully.&nbsp; All I really want off of this drive is my data in the&nbsp;Documents and Settings/"personal" folder.&nbsp; This folder&nbsp;was a password protected folder on the old HD, and
 is now giving me a Access Denied Error.&nbsp; All the other folders (Guest, etc) under the Documents and Settings folder are accessible.&nbsp; What can I do to regain access to this folder?</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

If you have the old drive slaved to your system, then you should just be able to navigate to the drive in Windows Explorer and<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/308421" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> take ownership of the drive, or folders</a>. if the system your using is XP Home,
 then you would have to<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315222" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"> boot into safe mode</a> in the Administrators account to get to the security tab

==========================================<br />
<br />
Stage 1 : Please do all the below even if you have done some before as it is often the total
<br />
process which solves the issue.<br />
<br />
Try this - Control Panel - Device Manager - CD/DVD - double click the device - Driver's Tab -
<br />
click Update Drivers (this will likely do nothing) - then RIGHT CLICK the drive - UNINSTALL -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the default driver stack. <strong>Even if drive is not shown&nbsp;continue
<br />
below.<br />
</strong><br />
Then work your way through these - remember the drive could be bad, could have a loose
<br />
cable or slight corrosion on the contacts (usually for a laptop) and other issues.<br />
<br />
Your CD drive or DVD drive is missing or is not recognized by Windows or other programs<br />

<br />
Another possibility is that the cables are loose. Remove ALL power, then check cables in both<br />
ends. Remove and replace, do not just snug. For laptops you can often clean the power and<br />
<br />
Some DVD&nbsp;drives do not use the Windows default drivers so check with the System maker and<br />
device maker to see if there is firmware or drivers for you drive if needed.<br />
<br />
===============================<br />
<br />
Stage 2 : You could have drive issues as the CD/DVD is actually 4 drives in 1 case ( CD &amp; DVD
<br />
burn and CD and DVD read). So it is not unusual for 1 or 2 parts to not function while the others
<br />
do so properly. <br />
<br />
Did you complete the troubleshooter for the drive that still does not work? There are some
<br />
registry entries that the troubleshooter does not fix and those "might" be the cause.
<br />
<br />
Check with your System Maker and Device maker for both possible <strong>firmware updates</strong> and
<br />
the correct Registry entries for your drive. <br />
<br />
These are the keys I think are the ones in question&nbsp;- for the CD/DVD drive sub-keys of course
<br />
as there will other sub-keys in these keys. Be sure to ask for specific keys involved as well as
<br />
the settings.<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Hardware Profiles\0001\System\CurrentControlSet\Enum\IDE<br />
<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Class\{4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}<br />
<br />
-----------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
You probably can find more info here and maybe even the exact registry settings for your CD/DVD
<br />
drive from someone with the same model.<br />

<h2>            Broadcom 802.11</h2>
                    When I start Windows 10 I get the following sidebar message: "This app can't run on this PC - Broadcom 802.11 - &nbsp;Network Adapter. Wireless network controller doesn't work on this version of Windows".&nbsp; So it does not load the app because they say it may
 damage the system.&nbsp; My computer works fine so how do I get rid of this annoying message or how do I get the app that works with Windows 10?

                    My Windows 10 desktop PC today 7/26/18 decided to display a warning continuously that the battery is low and to plug the computer in.&nbsp; I shut it down and changed the plug from UPS to a power bar which my printers which are on are plugged into.&nbsp; Still get
 the warning message.&nbsp; The battery icon in the system tray shows 6%.&nbsp; It always used to say 100%.&nbsp; I went to Cortana and typed troubleshoot, enter and followed the instruction to troubleshoot hardware. and devices&nbsp; Nothing was found.

            Hi Richard.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Check the manufacturer's Support web page for your full model number to  see if there is a battery issue or recall for it.   
<br />
<br />Run the battery recalibration here:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/172271/how-to-calibrate-your-laptops-battery-for-accurate-battery-life-estimates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/172271/how-to-calibra...</a>
<br />
<br />Then generate a battery report and post it back here:  <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/generate-battery-report-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/generate-batte...</a>
<br />
<br />Right click Start to open Device Manager, under Battery choose the battery device, then Driver tab, then if available Roll Back the driver.  If not available, choose Uninstall Driver, restart PC to reinstall. 
<br />
<br />If this was caused by April Version 1803 update can roll back Version 1803  in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br /> If this was caused by Windows Updates then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br /> 
<br />
<br />If nothing else helps then you might need to replace the battery. However I will tell you that most OEM after-market batteries and chargers have problems so I would only buy the official manufacturer's battery from the PC maker to be sure.
<br />
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            </span>
            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Batteries 
<br />Right-click Microsoft ACPI-Compliant System. 
<br />Choose Update Driver Software. 
<br />Make sure you are connected to the Internet, the check for updates. 
<br />
<br />Check if its working...
<br />
<br />Other things you can try....
<br />
<br />1. Run Windows 10 Battery Diagnostics
<br />
<br />If your battery isn’t fully charging, the first thing you can try is the Battery troubleshooter in Windows 10.
<br />
<br />    Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Update &amp; security &gt; Troubleshoot
<br />    Scroll down then click Power
<br />    Click Run the troubleshooter
<br />
<br />Complete the wizard then restart your device to see if the problem is resolved.
<br />
<br />Most laptop computers include their own factory diagnostics utilities, too. It is recommended you also use those to test your battery. Accessing the diagnostics will vary by manufacturer, so, consult the documentation that came with your computer. Before you run a test, you might need to first fully charge the device to 99 or 100 percent, disconnect the AC adapter, boot into the diagnostic utility then run the test.
<br />
<br />2. Check if Your AC Power Supply is Properly Connected
<br />
<br />Sometimes the power cable connected to your AC power supply brick might be loose. Check to make sure it is fitted and secured properly.
<br />
<br />3. Try a Different Wall Outlet and Check for Low Voltage and Electrical Issues
<br />
<br />The other day, my house had some serious electrical issues going on. You would be amazed how much voltage issues can affect the performance of your system. Plugging in my laptop into an outlet within my room dimmed the light, while an outlet in the living room caused it to wink.
<br />
<br />Another room it remained constant but charging was horribly slow. This, of course, meant I had low voltage issues and with so many appliances competing for the little bit of faulty energy, it made it even worse. Ultimately, I ended hiring an electrician to sort out the issues. After fixing it up, my laptop started charging normally.
<br />
<br />4. Test with Another Charger
<br />
<br />I mentioned the AC power adapter earlier. It’s possible your charger might be the culprit. If you have a working spare laying around the home, give it a try to see if it charges. You can also borrow one from your work colleague if you don’t have any. If you don’t have access to another charger, try yours on another laptop to see if it charges the device.
<br />
<br />If you are mixing and matching laptop power adapters, make sure you choose the correct power supply (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=outlet+tester" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=s...</a>). Read the brick and make sure it has the same polarity and voltage as the adapter for your laptop.
<br />
<br />5. Remove All External Devices
<br />
<br />If you keep external devices such as a smartphone, a USB external drive, mouse, printer and anything else attached to your system while charging, it will take longer for your battery to reach 100%. Make sure you disconnect all of those devices so your system won’t be competing with all the other electronics.
<br />
<br />6. Check Your Connectors for Dirt or Damage
<br />
<br />If your laptop has a modular battery, remove it then check for any damage or to see if it needs cleaning around the contacts and inside the battery compartment. Also, check if there are any dust particles inside the charging port that might be preventing the battery from charging.
<br />
<br />7. Check for BIOS and Chipset Driver Updates
<br />
<br />Sometimes your system might be overdue for an update for components such as your BIOS and Chipset. Updates can help resolve bugs that might be preventing the battery from charging efficiently.
<br />
<br />8. Press and Release Power Button Reset
<br />
<br />Sometimes unknown glitches can prevent the battery from charging. An easy way to fix it is to power down your computer, hold down the power button for 15 to 30 seconds, plug in the AC adapter, then start the computer.
<br />
<br />9. Disable Apps and Check Battery Usage in Windows 10
<br />
<br />Going back to Windows 10 a bit, recently, I noticed my Surface Pro was taking an unusually long time to charge and the fans started to rev up. Little did I notice the culprit was right there on my Taskbar all along. Slack’s Windows client was waiting in an attempt to connect to the Internet. So, checking your apps to determine whats running in the background can help you not only conserve battery life but limit what prevents it from charging faster.
<br />
<br />There are a couple ways to do that. Open Start &gt; Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Background apps. Scroll down then toggle off the apps that might be preventing your device from reaching a full charge.
<br />
<br />Still in Settings, open System &gt; Battery &gt; Battery usage by app. This will tell you which apps are using the most battery and you can make a decision what to do, whether to let Windows decide if it should run in the background while not sacrificing battery life.
<br />
<br />10. Replace Charger or Battery Module
<br />
<br />Ultimately, if you don’t see any improvements after trying all the above, then it’s maybe best that you replace either the charger or battery itself. This will require contacting your laptop manufacturer and placing an order. Batteries and the chargers are not necessarily cheap, especially if its an older system. But, if you have no choice, its something you will just have to do to get your system back in working order.

<div><span>Went to play GTA V.. but didnt have enough room on my xbox for the install. I plugged in my hard drive and have been using that, prior a notification showed up saying that I might experience some difficulties etc. Ive been playing
 the game for 2 day with no problems, until tonight when the screen went suddenly black. I restarted my xbox but then the game wouldn't load. So I turned my external hard drive off and it loaded. So it's clearly a problem with the formatting or what ever with
 the hard drive... HOW DO I FIX THIS?<br />

<p>None of the above works! &nbsp;Suddenly, when I tried to send, reply or forward, I get 2 error screens...the first sez, "A problem occurred while trying to open this message. A problem has occurred. Please try again." &nbsp;Click on "OK," and another screen sez, "An
 error occurred replying to or forwarding this message."</p>
<p>I have Windows 8.1, Internet Explorer 11 (but I use Chrome!) and Windows Essentials 2012. &nbsp;I have rebooted, uninstalled, rebooted, reinstalled, deleted accounts, uninstalled, rebooted, reinstalled, added the accounts back in (what a mess that was!)...nothing
 works!!! &nbsp;Someone said it is maybe stuck on "Work Offline" but it shows working online...went to internet explorer to "File" to make sure "Work Online" but there is &nbsp;no option for that in IE11!!! &nbsp;I am so frustrated. &nbsp;I prefer this email program as I use a
 provider (Verizon) that the other programs don't accept.</p>
<p>I might add I am very frustrated trying to contact Microsoft about this and with the responses that others have received...mostly getting outdated information!<br />
Forgot to say I have also done the "Repair all Windows Essentials programs"...several times!!!</p>

<h2>            Laptop keyboard doesn&#39;t work right on Windows 8.1</h2>
                    I have a new Dell Inspiron 15R laptop that came with Win8.&nbsp; I upgraded to Win8.1.&nbsp; For some reason, whenever I either come out of hibernation or boot up the computer and I start typing, the keyboard doesn't respond with the keys that I am pressing.&nbsp; It
 brings up the Ease of Access center.&nbsp; Let me be clear: ALL options in the Ease of Access center are turned OFF.&nbsp; I googled this issue and the only "fix" I found was to press the Windows key + F9.&nbsp; That works and when I do that it allows my keyboard to work
 normally.&nbsp; I.e., if I type an "L", then an "L" shows up on the screen - it doesn't open the Ease of Access center.&nbsp; But I shouldn't need a "fix" because of a bug in Win8.1.&nbsp; Why is this happening?&nbsp; Why doesn't Microsoft fix this?&nbsp; Anyone?&nbsp; I really hope Win9
 gets here soon and that it actually works.&nbsp; Win 8 is a total fail.&nbsp; I hate the tiles.&nbsp; I hate the swiping off screen (I did not buy a touch screen laptop) be

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It must be difficult when things do not work as expected. I appreciate the feedback provided.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since you are unable to work with the keyboard after hibernation, there could be a chance that the device is not set to wake up after the computer is in sleep mode.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let's perform the steps provided here and check the results. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><font color="#000000"><span>a. Open Device Manager by swiping in from the right edge of the screen, tapping
</span><b><span>Search</span></b><span> (or if you're using a mouse, pointing to the upper-right corner of the screen, moving the mouse pointer down, and then clicking
</span><b><span>Search</span></b><span>), entering </span><b><span>Device Manager</span></b><span> in the search box, tapping or clicking
</span><b><span>Settings</span></b><span>, and then tapping or clicking </span><b><span>Device Manager</span></b><span>.‌ You might be asked for an admin password or to confirm your choice.</span></font></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)"><font color="#333333">b. </font>Then right click on "<strong>keyboard</strong>" drivers on at a time. After that, click on "<strong>Properties</strong>" and choose "<strong>Power Management</strong>" tab. Uncheck the option
 which says "<strong>Allow the computer to turn off this device to save</strong> power".</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(62, 62, 62, 1)">Hope this information helps. Reply with the status so that we could help you further.

            <p>Hi Frank,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please answer the below questions for the better understanding of the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>2. Do you mean that after scanning, instead of sending the scanned copy to the computer, it prints the data?
</p>
<p>
</p><p>If this is the case as in Q2. then, please contact the HP support team as they can assist you further related to the issue.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Do you have any error message that you can share with us?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try running ChkDsk to check your drive for errors. Right-click your Drive icon/ Properties/ Tools/ Error Checking.&nbsp; Try it first by not checking either box (this will run it in a Read-only mode) to see if it flags any hard drive or file problems.&nbsp; If it
 does, restart&nbsp; it by ticking both boxes, and rerun it to allow it to attempt to fix any found problems.

            Hi HeatherMundy,
<br />
<br />Is it possible you could send through a screenshot of this?
<br />
<br />I can see a recent update from the 28th of August 2018 from the following: <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/skype-for-ipad/id442012681?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://itunes.apple.com/app/skype-for-ipad/id4...</a>
<br />

Watch out for ads on the site that may advertise products frequently classified as a PUP (Potentially Unwanted Products). Thoroughly research any product advertised on the site before you decide to download and install it.
<br />
<br />If you are unable to update, you could try uninstalling the application from your iPad by holding your finger down on the app until they start to wobble, and then pressing the little red x on the corner of the app. 
<br />
<br />You could then try installing Skype from the app store. 
<br />
<br />Please let me know how this goes.
<br />
<br />Looking forward to your response,
<br />Nathan

            Did you try launching the app store on your iPad then try updating through it?
<br />
<br />I noticed version 8.29 was released for the iPad 3 days ago.
<br />
<br />Also, which version of iOS is currently installed on your iPad? If your iPad is not running iOS 10 or later, it cannot run the latest versions of Skype.

<p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Apart
 from that url are you able to play other url’s on the system without any issues?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Were
 you able to see the videos before on the system?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Since
 when are you facing this issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Do
 you remember making any changes to the system?</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Where
 is the file located?</span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Error message</span></strong><span>: "Windows Media Player cannot play the file because the specified protocol is not supported.
 If you typed a URL in the Open URL dialog box, try using a different transport protocol (for example, "http:" or "rtsp:")."</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Windows Media Player can't play the file because the specified protocol is either not supported by the Player or not supported by the server.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you encountered this error by clicking a link on a Web page, the link might not be valid.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If you encountered this error by typing a URL in the Open URL dialog box, try opening the file by using a different transport protocol (for example, "http:" or "rtsp:").
 The following list shows the protocols that are supported by the Player and examples of the correct URL syntax:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>• mms://server/filename (for example, a file with a .wma, .wmv, .asf, or .mp3 extension)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>• http://server/filename</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>• rtsp://server/filename</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>• mms://server/sami.asf?SAMI=http://server/sami/sami_demo.smi (SAMI file)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the Player supports the protocol that you used in the URL and you still can't play the content, verify that the Player is configured to use all of its supported
 protocols.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>To configure protocol settings</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>In
 Windows Media Player, on the Tools menu, click Options.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>In
 the Options dialog box, on the Network tab, in the Streaming protocols area, select all the protocol check boxes (Multicast, UDP, TCP, and HTTP), so that a check mark is displayed in each.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Note that the supported protocols can be used only to stream digital media files. Windows Media Player cannot be used as a browser.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the above fixes don't work, you can rename the networking information folder for the Player so that it can rebuild its networking information files after you restart
 it.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><strong><span><span>To rename the Player networking information folder</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span><span>a.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Close
 Windows Media Player. (To do this, on the File menu, click Exit.)</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>b.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Click
 Start, and then click Run.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>c.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>In
 the Run dialog box, type the following (exactly as shown):</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>%UserProfile%\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Windows Media</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>d.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>This
 step opens the following folder on your computer:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>SystemDrive:\Documents and Settings\UserProfileName\Local Settings\Application Data\Microsoft\Windows Media</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>e.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>In
 this folder, rename the folder 10.0 to 10.0.bak. For more information about renaming folders, see To change the name of a file or folder.</span></span></p>
<p><span><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> the folder name will be different for Windows media player 11.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><span>f.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Start
 the Player and try to stream the content again.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Thank you and Regards. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<h2>            How do you dismount a secondary HDD after bootup&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Vista SP2</p>
<p>
</p><p>If a spare secondary hard drive is installed and used for backups only, how does one prevent it from mounting during the boot process?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't want this volume available until the time I actually do backup, so as to prevent the possibility of virus attack.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A mount-vol batch file or script &nbsp;being run duing/after boot would be acceptable, but I prefer the volume isn't available to the system until the mount-vol command is issued after the OS is booted.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I need an example of a batch or script that I can use for both mount and dismount.&nbsp;</p>
