    <title>Time jumps ahead for an hour or more on Windows 10 when time is set - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> anonymous42rw  say:</h3>
<h2>            Time jumps ahead for an hour or more on Windows 10 when time is set for three different zones.</h2>
                    <p>Original title:Windows 10 time wrong after sleep, or shoutdown</p>
<p>
</p><p>I realize several questions have been asked around this topic but none address my issue. I have a brand new HP Spectre x360 with only Windows 10, so the "old CMOS battery" and "multiple Operating Systems" scenarios don't apply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case I have 3 timezones showing in my clock: US Pacific, Germany, Kenya</p>
<p>
</p><p>What I noticed is that the time only jumps forward by full hours. Sometimes it jumps to the Kenya time, even though my main timezone is still US Pacific. Sometimes it jumps forward by more than that. It has jumped as much as 2.5 days. I suspect it is a multiple
 of the timezone differences between the 3 I have showing, but I have not proven that yet.</p>
<p>
</p><p>No matter whether I set the clock to update manually or sync automatically, it regularly happens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>People have been asking questions around this topic for years and multiple versions of Windows. I can't believe this has not been fixed once and for all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So far I have not found a solution. I just turned off the other time zones and will update here if that helps.</p>

    <title>Using recorded sound effects - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> slapsnapper  say:</h3>
<h2>            Using recorded sound effects</h2>
                    On my Windows XP, I could add certain effects to the sounds that I recorded with Sound Recorder, such as echoes and being able to speed the sound up. Is there a way that I can add effects on Windows Vista? Whenever I use Sound Recorder, It forces me to
 save the sound directly into the file before I can even play it back, let alone add effects.

<br />
Thanks for using the Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
I'm not aware of a program that comes with Vista that can add effects to sound files.<br />
You may have to use a third-party program to accomplish this.<br />
<br />
Hope this Helps.<br />

Thank you for posting to the Microsoft Answers Forum.<br />
<br />
On the McAfee DMSetup.exe, right click on click on "Run as Administrator". Does this allow you to install the program?<br />
<br />
Please reply back so we can assist further if needed.<br />

<br />
<br /><a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/products/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.malwarebytes.com/products/</a> - download the free home version (make sure you opt out of the free trial of their active anti virus while setting up)

<br />Download and install Malwarebytes and ADWCleaner, and see if they can detect and remove the malicious items on your PC.

            If this pops up when you visit certain web sites, then it;s likely a scam to get you to install a program that purports to get rid of the "infection" when, in fact, you're not infected with anything. What program appears to produce the pop-up?

</p><p>Microsoft's compatibility database is continually being updated with new data. What you can do is periodically run another scan to see if the database has updated information about your hardware. Even though you might get this message, you can always run
 Windows Update after installing Windows 10 and download the latest driver too. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently installed Windows 10 on an HP Elitebook to see how well the most recent Windows 10 build performs. The Elitebook is a fairly recent model notebook which includes an assortment of hardware technologies. Out of the box though I did not get a complete
 system, for instance the Intel HD Graphics 3000 was not detected and I was instead limited to the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Apart from this, I had wi-fi ready, which meant, I could connect to the Internet right away.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Installing drivers through Windows Update</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows Update is the premier starting point to resolve most common driver issues you might experience immediately after installing Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Simply launch it from <strong>Start </strong>&gt; <strong>Settings </strong>&gt; <strong>
Update and Security </strong>and click <strong>Check for Updates</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>or</p>
<p>
</p><p>Press <strong>Windows key + R</strong></p>
<p>Type: <strong>wuapp</strong></p>
<p>Hit Enter</p>
<p>
</p><p>Click Check for updates (make sure you have an active Internet connection). </p>

<p>Immediately, Windows Update will detect your system configuration and download all the appropriate drivers for your system. As you can see in the above screenshot, my Intel HD 3000 Graphics was installed automatically. I did not even have to reboot the system.
 In addition to that other hardware components were also detected and installed which includes my LAN adapter and card reader.</p>

            <p>I had a problem with my Graphics card being incompatible and therefore was unable to upgrade to Windows 10.</p>
<p>I installed&nbsp;&nbsp; NVIDIA 210 graphics card including drivers. When I tried to get Windows 10 it still told me that my card was incompatible because my PC wasn't scanned again to find my new card.</p>
<p>I went to Drive C, $Window.-BT. Set-up and tried to set-up windows myself. Within five seconds I got an Error 80070002. I googled the error code and found a Microsoft link that dealt with this code. The trick was to delete all new updates and temporary files
 to take the PC back to when I first received the Windows 10 offer to reserve. I followed the instructions meticulously and eventually I received a note saying that I can reserve Windows 10. I accepted and straight away I was informed that my PC was compatible
 if I wanted to install the upgrade. I declined and did a new Windows update for Windows 7.</p>
<p>On completion of the update I accepted the upgrade and from then on I let Windows do its job.
</p>
<p>One word of warning, this procedure will take quite a long time so be patient.
</p>
<p>Something else that might happen is that Windows 10 will finish configuring and it will try to shutdown to restart the PC. It may freeze on the shutdown operation. Wait ten minutes and turn the PC Off, wait ten seconds and turn On again. Windows 10 will
 start installing straight away and will let you know when it's ready. Patience is a virtue in this case.</p>

<p>Thank you.&nbsp; I haven't got to the actual download of Windows 10 yet - I merely want to have the 'Get Windows 10' app. to the stage where it no longer states that a compatibility issue with my NVIDA display prevents Windows 10 from running on my P.C.</p>
<p>
</p><p>NIVIDA's own web site offered an app. to scan my computer, but amazingly this then stated it was unable to locate
<em>any </em>NVIDA on my P.C.&nbsp; Nothing else on their web site produced any help and I received no reply to a message left.&nbsp; I finally used a Driver Booster program which promptly updated the driver without any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have to await the monthly (?) Microsoft scan to see whether my P.C. is deemed acceptable for Windows 10!</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks for your help.</p>

            <p>Ok......same thing happened to me, and I did the following to restart the upgrade.</p>
<p>First go to this page and follow the instuctions to remove the windows update files that have the old
</p>
<p>"scan" of your computer with the incompatible drivers/card.&nbsp; Copy and paste:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://betanews.com/2015/09/11/remove-unwanted-windows-10-upgrade-files-from-windows-7-and-windows-8-x/</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will have to remove 3 windows 10 updates for windows 7, so don't restart every time you remove one, &nbsp;just wait till the last one is removed to restart.&nbsp; Your computer will reconfigure for a minute or 2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After restart, go to your control panel and then go to uninstall a program, and remove any and all of your old drivers that are/were associated with your older Graphics card/board.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then after you have removed those, simply search "get windows 10 update" and click the update box and you should be good to go.&nbsp; Worked on two of my upgraded video card boxes.......Good luck!</p>

            <p>I have the same desktop all-in-one computer as you Julian, I was apalled and disgusted to find out that acer wasn't supporting the upgrage process of the OS to windows 10 after having spent more than 1000€ on the purchase. Then again acer hasn't bothered
 updating any of the driver since 2012.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to upgrade to windows 10 I had to use the installation program/ISO which is available to download from microsoft. When upgrading remove every device you have connected and disable the wireless/wired adapaters you use to connect to the internet,
 in the case that it is a cabled connection just remove the cable. You might want to consider disabling the graphics card as well as this the main culprit as to why they won't let you upgrade in the first place.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 should install properly however it will install with Microsoft's basic graphics driver, I was able to overcome this by downloading the originals graphics driver provided by acer in the support section for the Z5710. To install the driver you may
 have to go into driver manager and select the graphics card and from there search for the driver installation file that you have downloaded.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>You should now have a functioning Z5710 desktop computer with windows 10 since windows update will install any drivers that requiere updating, alternatively you can select the devices in device manager and search for the software one by one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It should be noted that in Windows 10 if you wish to update the graphics card nvidia 240M to the latest driver not only will you have to modify one of the configuration files of the installation so that your card is supported during installation but you
 will also have to boot the computer so that the digital signature recognition is switched off, if you don't then you won't be able to install the driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not using the most up-to-date graphics driver provided by Nvidia however it is one of the most recent ones that support windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It should also be pointed out that one of the problems that the Z5710 suffers with windows 10 has to do with the power configuration, for some reason if you use the configuration which maximizes performance and you try to restart the PC you are more than
 likely to find yourself with a frozen "restarting" screen which hangs eternally. To overcome this problem, and you will find yourself doing this a lot in order to install updates etc, you need to change the power configuration to economy (make sure that the
 settings are set to default). This doesn't always work 100% and may requiere you to shut down the PC first before booting up and then restarting.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I hope i have helped clarify some of the problems/issues that other Z5710 owners may be experiencing.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 not working after install on a gateway desktop</h2>
                    I did the free windows 10 install and after I rebooted, it goes through the setup in the blue screen and never fixed my pc. I called Microsoft and they said that I have to go back to my default windows 7 when I purchased my PC 4 years ago. I would have
 thought that it would not allow to install if it was not compatible. &nbsp;I spent my whole day trying to restore from last night but can't get to the setup menu. Called Dell and they help me with storing my documents before installing win 7. Four years, lost of
 applications that I installed as some were downloaded from purchases. Now I have to find all my disk and serial numbers. Not a good way. I think I will purchase Apple computer next. Too much work to install my applications. I lost my computer, time and money
 as I have to paid to get it install.&nbsp;

            As a computer re[air person I can tell you Apple computers and OSX have their own issues just as bad and just as difficult to fix when things go wrong. If you're going to apple for any reason other than you just like OSX... you're wasting time and A lot
 of money. Also OSX has about a 1 3rd the number of programs available to it that windows has in the market place. Bear that in mind should you decide to switch. Apple is the best for multimedia such as video production and editing and music production and
 editing otherwise it's at a distinct disadvantage when it comes to software diveristy especially gaming and office software.&nbsp;<br />
Best Wishes.&nbsp;

<p>That might be an unhelpful error message generated by the operating system or Itunes to cover the unknown error that is really your problem?&nbsp; You would know if you were running in Safe Mode because the words "Safe Mode" would appear in the four corners of
 your screen.&nbsp; Believe me you would know if you were in Safe Mode because it would be totally different view to Normal Mode in any case.</p>
<p>Are you logged on as an Administrator user?</p>
<p>Have you tried right-clicking on&nbsp;any shortcut to the uninstaller of Itunes (if it has one on the Start Menu/ All Programs/ Itunes),&nbsp; and selecting the "Run As Administrator" option?</p>
<p>Have you checked in Services via Control Panel\All Control Panel Items\Administrative Tools\Services, and seeing if the Windows Installer Service is Disabled, it should be set to Manual as the Startup Type?</p>

<h2>            Network File Share on two Windows 10 computers</h2>
                    <p>I have two Windows 10 computers. I want to be able to share files between them. In the file explorer "Network" on the desktop I can see the laptop (and desktop) and can drag files from the laptop to the desktop. In the Network on the laptop however I cannot
 see the desktop computer. (It is crucial that I be able to see the desktop on the laptop.) I had a Win 7 laptop that worked perfectly with the desktop.</p>

            Hi Peter, in version 1803 of Windows 10, Microsoft removed the Homegroup functionality . . .
<br />
<br />Click your Start Button, type Services and hit Enter
<br />
<br />When the Services app opens, scroll down to find the following services, then double click each one in turn, set their startup type to Automatic and start the service if necessary
<br />
<br />1. Function Discovery Provider Host
<br />
<br />2. Function Discovery Resource Publication
<br />
<br />3. SSDP Discovery
<br />
<br />4. UPnP Device Host
<br />
<br />Save that and close the Services app
<br />
<br />Restart your PC
<br />
<br />That's It!

<p>Thanks for the replies. I found most of this information earlier today and it seems to be working.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have to say this was a clusterf$ck waste of time. I had a Windows 7 laptop networked with my Win 10 desktop. It took six minutes to setup and worked perfectly for years. I get a new Win 10 laptop and it has taken six hours to setup the file sharing/networking.
 It's so unfathomable to me this is how MS works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>BTW - since I changed all the file sharing/security permissions to allow "Everyone" my hard drive on the desktop is grinding away. Any thoughts on what that's about?</p>

<h3> shonenknife_  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#34;Missing Operating System&#34; after Windows 10 Upgrade</h2>
                    I have a Lenovo 7723, and recently upgraded from Windows 7 to Windows 10. &nbsp;Now, whenever the machine restarts (like, after an update) it gets hung on "Missing Operating System." &nbsp;If I do a hard power off and power back on, it comes up fine. &nbsp;But, it's
 annoying that I come to my computer to see a "Missing Operating System" error because Windows did an update since I last used it. &nbsp;I've read I can fix the MBR with bootrec, but when I do that from the command prompt, it tells me that bootrec is not recognized
 as an internal or external command. &nbsp;I also can't do it from the Windows 10 installation disc because it was an upgrade, so I have no installation disc. &nbsp;Thank you for your help!

<h2>            Windows 10 File History Error</h2>
                    <p>When in File History, after selecting the backup drive, clicking the "Turn on" button results in the following error message:</p>
<p>
</p><p>File History</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Could not enable File History</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The service cannot be started, either because it is disabled or because it has no

            I'm having the same problem.... and it cannot be that my device "is not supported by Skype": I've been using Skype on this telephone for 3 years with no problems. &nbsp;Has a new version of Skype been installed on my phone that is no longer compatible with
 it, even though it has been compatible up to now?

    <title>thumbnail vs icon view in File Explorer - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> zoe0640  say:</h3>
<h2>            thumbnail vs icon view in File Explorer</h2>
                    <p>I have recently had to tick "always show icons, never thumbnails" due to an inordinate delay to deleting what should be empty folders (the thumb file remains for several minutes, by which time I've moved on to something else).&nbsp; This is fine for 95% of my
 files.&nbsp; However, I want photo files (based on file format or based on the type of folder) to show as thumbnails.&nbsp; How do I do this?</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>Then try unchecking the option <em>('<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">always show icons, never thumbnails')</span></em> you already changed and see if performance is better . . .</p>

<p>Hi Zoe,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Since you can't modify the settings of Windows File Explorer due to corporate restrictions, we suggest that you contact your company's IT department and inform them about the issue you're having. This is so they could consider the options that they have
 to address your issue with Windows File Explorer.</p>

<p>Hi OBI Support IT,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To better help you, could you please clarify the following information:</p>
<p>1. Are you talking about Skype or Skype for Business (since you have mentioned Skype invitation as well as Skype for Business)?</p>
<p>2. Since the error message said "web", are you using the web (Skype or Skype for Business) instead of the client?</p>
<p>3. What you have performed (ie, click a button) while you got the issue?&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Currently, my understanding is that you got the issue for the "Skype meeting", right? It is recommended that you provide more details so that we can move forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
<p>Alan</p>

<h2>            Windows Key Does not function Properly to get to Tablet View</h2>
                    <p>I have spordaic problem with the Windows key. &nbsp;If I boot my PC the Windows key works fine and when I click it the Windows Tablet (start) screen appears.</p>
<p>
</p><p>After I use the PC for a while the Windows key stops functioning and when I press the Windows key nothing happens. &nbsp;If I click on the icon in the system tray nothing happens and if I click on Windows icon in lower right nothing happens. &nbsp;If I reboot everything
 works fine for a while. &nbsp;Sometimes, if I am patient, the Windows key may start working again if I wait a long time, some times an hour the windows key may start working again for a while.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would appreciate any suggestions for fixing the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC is an HP upgraded from Win 8.1 to Win 10 and it is a touchscreen</p>

            <p>Hi Neil,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in&nbsp;Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I can imagine the inconvenience you are experiencing and will certainly help you in the right direction to fix the issue. However, I would appreciate if you could answer a few questions to narrow down the issue in order to provide you with better assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>a. &nbsp;</strong>Are you talking about Windows login password or PIN when you refer to "Windows key" or are you referring to the Windows key (button) on your keyboard?</p>
<p><strong>b.&nbsp; </strong>Did you make any significant changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I understand you correctly, with Windows key you are referring to the Windows button on your keyboard that does not function properly when you sometimes boot your PC. The issue might arise due to hardware problem with the Windows logo key or due to some
 incorrect keyboard settings for the specific key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In order to diagnose the issue, I would suggest you to try the following methods and check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1:</strong></p>
<p>You may restart the “<strong><em>Explorer.exe</em></strong>” process from the task manager and check if the Windows key works.</p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>a)</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Press “<strong><em>ALT</em></strong>” + “<strong><em>CTRL</em></strong>” + “<strong><em>DELETE</em></strong>” keys on the keyboard and
 click on “<strong><em>Task Manager</em></strong></span></span><span><span>” from that list.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>b)</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>This will open the
<strong><em>Task Manager</em></strong></span></span><span><span>on the screen.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>c)</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Now, on the
<strong><em>Task Manager</em></strong> window, click on “<strong><em>File</em></strong>” and then select the option “<strong><em>Run new task</em></strong></span></span><span><span>” from the file menu.</span></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span><span>d)</span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>In the “<strong><em>Open:</em></strong>” box, type “<strong><em>explorer.exe</em></strong>” and then click on “<strong><em>Ok</em></strong></span></span><span><span>”
 and check if the key is working.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still exists, proceed to the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2:</strong></p>
<p>Run the related PowerShell command and check if it helps retaining the Windows key functioning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>a) Right click on your Start menu button.<br />
b) Click on <em>"</em><em><strong>Search</strong></em><em>"</em>.<br />
c) Type <strong>"</strong><em><strong>Power shell</strong>"</em>.<br />
d) Right click on power shell from search results.<br />
e) Click on <em>"</em><em><strong>Run as administrator</strong></em><em>"</em>.<br />
f)&nbsp;Execute below code :</p>
<p>
</p><p><em><strong>Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}</strong></em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue still exists, proceed to the next method.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Method 3:</strong></p>
<p>Make the following modifications in the registry settings and check if these help.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Registry disclaimer:
</span></strong><span>This section, method, or task contains
 steps that tell you how to modify the registry. However, serious problems might occur if you modify the registry incorrectly. Therefore, make sure that you follow these steps carefully. For added protection, back up the registry before you modify it. Then,

 the registry in Windows</span></span></em></a></span></p>
<p>
</p><p>a)&nbsp;In the Start search type and select <em>"<strong>Run</strong>"</em>.<br />
b) Type <em>"<strong>regedit</strong>"</em> and press Enter.<br />
c) Click&nbsp;<em>"</em><em><strong>OK</strong>"</em> when notification window prompt.<br />
d) Go to <em><strong>HKEY_CURRENT_USER&gt;Software&gt;Microsoft&gt;Windows&gt;CurrentVersion&gt;Explorer&gt;Advance</strong></em><br />
e) Create a <strong>Dword </strong>with name <em>"<strong>EnableXamlStartMenu</strong>"</em>.<br />
f)&nbsp;Give it value 0.<br />
g) Log off and login again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Your Windows key should work now.</p>
<p>

<h2>            Itunes has no audible sound, yet &#34;appears&#34; to playing properly.</h2>
                    
<p>Okay.&nbsp; I have a Dell Inspirion 1525 with Windows Home Vista Installed.&nbsp;&nbsp; I also have an IPhone and as a result I have ITunes installed on my computer.&nbsp; Yesterday everything was working perfectly fine.</p>
<p>This morning when I turned on my computer ITunes is not playing "audibly".&nbsp;&nbsp; My sound on the computer itself is working.&nbsp; All tests I do work fine.&nbsp; If I run Windows Media Player it's fine.&nbsp; ITunes does not show that's it's muted at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Per Apple, I've uninstalled ITunes and reinstalled it to make sure it wasn't an ITunes issue.&nbsp; That didn't work.&nbsp; I've gone to the control panel and looked at my sound devices and all seem to be functioning properly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Basically after looking at everything nothing seems to be causing it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Any ideas?&nbsp; (Yes I've rebooted, I've check volumne controls, everything.)&nbsp; ITunes is the only thing that is not kicking out any sound and after reinstalling it, we're thinking it has
 something to do with it and Vista?</p>
<p>Any help would be grand.</p>
<p>Thank you!</p>
<p>Holly</p>

<p>Hi StuartMarsh1:<br />
<br />
You've posted your question in the Windows Vista board.&nbsp; Please let us know if you have a different operating system and we'll ask the Forum Moderators to move your question to the correct board for better exposure.<br />
<br />
If you uninstall Slimware's DriverUpdate from Control Panel | Programs | Programs and Features and still see these pop-ups then I believe the
<strong>Malwarebytes Free v3</strong> scanner should detect and remove the last remnants of this program as
<a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/detections/pup-optional-driverupdate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>PUP.Optional.DriverUpdate</strong></a>.&nbsp; If you have a Vista SP2 install Malwarebytes Free v3.5.1-1.0.365 (the legacy version for Win XP and Vista) from
<a href="https://downloads.malwarebytes.com/file/mb3_legacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://downloads.malwarebytes.com/file/mb3_legacy</a>.&nbsp; For Win 7 SP1 and higher download the latest version (currently v3.7.1-1.0.568) from
<a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.malwarebytes.com/mwb-download/</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have an antivirus installed I'd suggest disabling the 14-day trial version of the Premium real-time protection features of Malwarebytes (Settings | Account |
<strong>Deactivate Premium Trial</strong>) as instructed in the support article <em>
<a href="https://support.malwarebytes.com/docs/DOC-1033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How-To: Deactivate Malwarebytes Premium Trial</a></em> to avoid possible conflicts with your antivirus and use Malwarebytes as a manual on-demand scanner.&nbsp; Start with
 a <strong>Threat Scan</strong> and if nothing is detected then move on to a <strong>
Custom Scan</strong> (full system scan) that includes all the partitions of your entire hard drive - see the support article
<a href="https://support.malwarebytes.com/docs/DOC-1156" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<em>How-To: Manually Scan With Malwarebytes</em></a>.&nbsp; I also have Settings | Protection | Potential Threat Protection set to
<strong>Warn User </strong>for lower-risk PUPs and PUMs (potentially unwanted programs / system modifications) as shown below so I'm always prompted before any lower-risk threats (e.g., browser toolbars or third-party utilities like a disk cleaner or driver
 updater) are removed just in case I want to keep them.</p>

                    Hi, I'm looking for a new tv for my bedroom and was looking at a tv which happened to have passive 3D on it and it made me wonder what Black Ops 2 is like in 3D, anyone with a 3D tv and plays COD Black Ops 2 can you tell me whether it works well and whether
 its worth spending a bit extra money on a 3D tv?

<p>I don't know much about the 3D, but it isn't very popular (in general). Getting a new TV, I highly recommend an LED Samsung Smart TV with a 40" screen. They're light &amp; flat with plenty of screen space &amp; the screen is big enough to see things you may not
 be able to see on smaller screens while still being relatively affordable. I recommend Samsung because they have the best quality, reliability, &amp; visuals in the business (look into their visual settings, like auto-motion plus or whatever they call it nowadays
 - it makes the screen bright and pop-out by adding depth without actually going 3D). If you don't prefer Samsung, Sony makes a very close 2nd in almost every respect.</p>

<p>Samsung 55 inch 3D flat panel. I actually haven't tried it on 3d yet. Maybe I'll give it a go. I'm playing on a 46inch Sony upstairs but the good tv is far from my router so I may have to switch over to test it out. It'll prolly make you dizzy though.</p>

<p>I haven't tried blops2 in 3D yet, mainly because blops1 was terrible.</p>

<p>The last gears of war was good. I have both types of 3DTV and if you do decide to get one I would recommend the polarised version rather than the active shutter.</p>

            <p>Virtual PC is not compatible with Windows 10, you need to use Hyper-V if you are running Windows 10 Pro and your&nbsp;computer supports it or Oracel VirtualBox.

While Hyper-V is a great out of box solution because of its tight integration and robust performance, it does have certain limitations and complexities. In particular, it does not play nice with other Virtual Machine utilities including VirtualBox itself and VMWare Player if you have it installed. Also, configuring it is not as simple as VirtualBox. For instance, VirtualBox makes network connections easier, I don't have configure switches and configure Internet sharing especially for wireless networks, it does all of that for me.

<h2>            XGL are now Recruiting&#33;</h2>
                    
<div><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi55.photobucket.com%2falbums%2fg144%2fPotleg%2fXGL2011logosmall.png" /></div>
XGL are now looking for new players to join our ranks, we are looking to boost our Call of Duty: Black Ops team with more active players as we are currently participating in a few Clan Leagues recently. We are also on the lookout to build a new FIFA 11 team
 and further in the year we will also recruit for Gears of War 3 and Battlefield 3 so 2011 is going to be a big year for XGL. In short XGL is a clan created in May 2002 and we are still competing today in clan matches and in clan leagues and have expanded lately
 to competing in many clan leagues primerily on Call of Duty: Black Ops. We have a strong base of clan members and we aim for our new recruits to be able to fit in and compete as hard as we do in our matches, we aim to win our matches but we take any defeats
 on the chin and move on from them no matter the result we have a great squad with great attitudes and can provide a bit of banter in the lobbies we also respect our opponants and learn from our matches to help us to improve. We are looking for new members
 who are 18 and over for Call of Duty: Black Ops as we have a mature group with us and we feel younger players cannot dedicate thier time to clan matches as our matches tend to be from 9pm and can be too late for the younger gamer. we are currently looking
 to add 5-6 new members to our roster through recruitment so their are available places but we look for new members to fit in and also to not be part of another clan as we don't take on players to play for us just for league matches. We have recently opened
 recruitment for FIFA 11 and we look to build a team to be able to compete in clan leagues and also online clubs however we do currently prefer to play in online team play as it doesn't rely on the stats of the pro's so thier is no restriction to what your
 fifa pro can be to be able to join the team. age restriction for this team will be 16+ but i must say that we do play quite late on FIFA mainly after matches on Call of Duty. if your looking to join a new team that is currently building up then the XGL FIFA
 team is the place for you. We look for new members to be active on XGL forums and on Xbox Live, we dont expect you to be on every day but 3 times a week will be enough as we tend to have many league matches aswell as the odd clan night on a regular basis.
 The Clan tryout can last anything upto two weeks as you will be required to join us regulary on xbox live in matchmaking or any organised friendly matches that we have at the time and we will look at how you are and clan members will give thier opinions of
 you which will determine if you join us or not. thier will be a review a month after acceptance into the clan and this review will determine whether you would remain with us or not and will depend on your activity and how you perform in your matches. XGL is
 a casual gaming clan who like to compete to a good standard in clan leagues we are primerily a HC-SND based clan on Call of Duty games we do like the HC mode so we do sample with hardcore based leagues as from May 2011 we have entered: XBCL, The WGL, WCL Clan
 Leagues. XGL are recruiting for: <b>Call of Duty: Black Ops,Call of Duty: MW3,FIFA 11,FIFA 12,Gears of War 3 &amp; Battlefield 3</b> if we sound like the clan for you then head on over to our website then post an application at: http://www.xglclan.co.uk Visit
 our youtube channel at: http://www.youtube.com/user/XGLTV
