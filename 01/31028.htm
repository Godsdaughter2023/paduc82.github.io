<h2>            Headset echoing sound</h2>
                    <p>I&nbsp;had&nbsp;a issue with my Headphones. The issue stretches back a few days but I'll keep it short.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Originally, my other set of headphones started to produce an Echo sound through the headset, and when using Apps like TeamSpeak 3, it would pass these sounds through the microphone so everyone could hear them. Ie, if I was watching a video and listening
 through the headset, it would output it into the TeamSpeak room I was in, and everyone could hear.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So... I removed the headset and then started by using my spare one to resolve the issue. However, that didn't work. Even with the new headset, it still echo'd through the mic.</p>
<p>
</p><p>So... again, I uninstalled TeamSpeak, and reinstalled it. Still no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p><del>And the final step I did was uninstall both the driver for my Headphone jack and the driver for my Mic jack. I rebooted Windows to find that it only reinstalled the&nbsp;headphone driver, though it still doesn't recognise the device being plugged into the
 jacks or taken out..... so..</del></p>
<p>
</p><p><del>Is there any way to install some default driver or for Windows to recognise the mic and headphone&nbsp;using software, because it simply won't recognise it though any normal means, and I'm out of ideas. Maybe this will solve the echo, as it seems that this
 could have been the cause.</del></p>
<p>
</p><p>The mic still echoes and transmits a large amount of noise even though there is no sound to pickup. this image shows exactly what I mean. It does this through both the sounds coming from my PC (through headphone speakers), and sound by&nbsp;other users.</p>

            <p>Hello Lewis,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Welcome to Microsoft Community and thank you for posting your query.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry for the inconvenience caused, I will certainly help you with this issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate if you could answer the below questions to narrow down the issue and to provide you better assistance.</p>
<p>1. What is the make and model of the computer?</p>
<p>2. Are you facing this issue with External speakers?</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;Did you make any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 1: You may also refer this article which can help you identify and fix common sound problems in Windows, including no sound coming from your speakers or headphones.</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/fix-sound-problems#v1h=tab01" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/fix-sound-problems#v1h=tab01</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>If issue persist, proceed to next method. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 2: I would suggest you to run "Playing audio" troubleshooter to diagnose and fix the issue.</p>
<p>Follow these Steps to run Playing Audio Troubleshooter in Windows 8.1<br />
a. Press "Windows Key".<br />
b. Then type "Troubleshooter" in the Search box and hit enter.<br />
c. In the Troubleshooting window, tap or click View all. <br />
d. Select "Playing Audio".<br />
e. Follow the On Screen instructions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This sometime happens due to sound cards drivers and also maybe bad socket. There are touching contacts which carry audio to the speaker. When you plug in microphones, the contacts to the speaker should be disconnected and the audio signal passes instead
 to the jack and your microphones. There is either a problem with the socket or microphone. Since you already tried a different microphone it could be issue with the socket. Also try pushing in the plug deeper.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Method 3: You may download the latest available drivers from the manufacturer's website and try to install the drivers in compatibility mode and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please follow the below steps for the same.<br />
a. Right click/tap twice the driver setup file and select Properties then tap or click the Compatibility tab.<br />
b. Place a check in the Run this program in compatibility mode for: box. <br />
c. Tap or click the drop down box and select a previous operating system, then tap or click OK.<br />
d. Try installing the driver/software and check.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would recommend you to check for latest Windows Updates. Go to Settings &gt; Update &amp; Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; Check for Updates. If you have any pending updates remaining to install, kindly install them and check if it helps.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Hope the information helps. Do reply if you need further assistance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            My issue has changed and was changed 2 hours before you replied. The issue I have now is that I have echo through my Microphone. The thread should have updated with the crossed-through words and with more information.

    <title>Installing OEM version on my personal computer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Installing OEM version on my personal computer</h2>
                    
<p>Hi</p>
<p>A couple of days ago I bought windows 7 ultimate 64bit, I found on the package that this was an oem version, honestly I didn't know what this mean, so I used the serial number to upgrade the preinstalled windows on my laptop, then I did a little search on
 the internet saying that it is illegal or not allowed to install the oem version on my personal computer, and it should be installed on new built PCs to be sold.</p>
<p>So, I need to know, is it ok to download this version on my personal pc, or it is not, and if it is not ok, what should I do, Should I go to the authorities to tell them about these companies that sell oem versions to end users, without clarifying the difference
 between it and the full retail version.</p>

<p>Well, OEM versions of Windows 7 are really meant to be sold to System Builders building new PC's. Its not an enforced restriction though. I assume part of the reason for this is avoid presenting the complexity of the OEM licensing which is not same as a
 retail upgrade or full package version of Windows 7:</p>
<p>OEM versions of Windows 7 are identical to Full License Retail versions except for the following:<br />
<br />
- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel<br />
<br />
- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on<br />
<br />
- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard<br />
<br />
- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system</p>
<p>You don't encounter the following restrictions above the retail versions, thats why Microsoft recommends that it be sold to system builders instead of the general public, but there is nothing other than preventing you from using it. In fact, its even more
 affordable.</p>

<div>&gt; What do you mean by it can't be transferred to a new PC.</div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Exactly that. Once installed, an OEM license is *permanently* bound to </div>

<div>This is the main reason some people avoid OEM versions; if the PC dies </div>

<p>Yes, you can, just&nbsp;<strong>don't </strong>purchase from Amazon Marketplace. The copies sold on Amazon Marketplace are not genuine.</p>

</p><p>Also, if the prices are too good to be true, avoid. Estimated retail price is $119 (Home), $199 (Pro).</p>

            <p>I have the same issue.&nbsp; It isn't just the alarm.&nbsp; It is SMS notification, phone ringing and if you want to play any audio books and use your phone speaker it doesn't work.&nbsp; Checked updates and no updates available to fix it.&nbsp; Also, I did a soft reset and
 that didn't fix it either.&nbsp; I've seen a few more posts similar to this so I am thinking this was a software bug that was deployed.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>******</p>
<p>Updating my post&nbsp;- so shortly after I posted this - I dropped my phone on the tile display first and the screen shattered.&nbsp; So I ordered a new display off Ebay and a toolkit to do the work to replace it.&nbsp; After replacing the display and putting the phone
 back together the phone speaker now works fine.&nbsp; Two things happened during this process:</p>
<p>#1 - I did shut the phone off and remove the battery so it was completely powered off
</p>
<p>#2 - I did transfer my number to an old Lumia 920 and then back to the Lumia 950</p>
<p>However, I never did a clean reset of the phone once I transferred it back to the Lumia 950.&nbsp; So if someone has tried to shut the phone off and remove the battery please let me know for future reference if that fixes it.</p>

This is completely unacceptable. This solution is a catch all solution that does not address specific problem. Furthermore it's ineffective &amp; a month ago. I need this bug fixed now&nbsp;or I need anther phone. Thinking the Lumia 950 purchase was a big mistake.

            I found that if I turn on alarm notifications in lock screen it works. Also turned media volume up. Not exactly what I wanted (like to fall asleep to BBC &amp; not at alarm volume) but at least I won't be not late for work....again.

    <title>Update 8.1 causes automatic shutdown after start up. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> louisbrogan  say:</h3>
<h2>            Update 8.1 causes automatic shutdown after start up.</h2>
                    <p>I recently installed some updates on my sell lattitude tablet running windows 8.1. This immediately caused a problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I start up the tablet and log in it shuts itself down. From the moment I press the power button to shut down, I have probably 40 seconds before it switches off again. I've tried holding f8 whilst restarting and don't have enough time to get the settings
 to engage 'safe mode'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Does anyone have a solution?</p>
<p>

<p>Hi LightandHarmony,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Normally, there's a <em>Save as</em> option where you can select your desired save location every time you download or transfer files or photos via Bluetooth. If you did not see that&nbsp;option when the transfer got completed, then by default, those transferred
 photos are saved in a temporary folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To look for the photos, please navigate to&nbsp;<em><span>C:\Users\&lt;profile&gt;\AppData\Local\Temp\</span></em> and search for it. You can sort the date to easily find the recently transferred files or photos. You may then move or save it to a
 different folder or location.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have additional questions, or if the issue persists after the troubleshooting steps above, please let me know by replying to this thread. This way, I'll get notified and respond back to you as soon as I can</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards.</p>

<h2>            &#34;C&#58;&#92;CD&#92;WINDOWS&#92;SYSTEM32&#92;CONFIG&#34; Can&#39;t find Dir</h2>
                    Hi <br />
<br />
My friend has a laptop and I'm trying to fix it. Like everyone's issue about trying to use restore point but unable to do so, due to LOCAL S DRIVE has a problem due to the system protection is not enabled on drive.&nbsp; I have looked over the posts and have one
 to be very simiular to my problem. I go to the cmd prompt type everything in correctly only to get an error stating can't find directory. So I can't follow thru with the repair.<br />
<br />
P.s I am using a wind 7 64bit home premium repair disk, it belongs to my system and I dont know if she is using 32bit or 64bit does that make a difference? Also can I just do a complete update on her pc with my windows 7 cd?&nbsp; How do I find out what version
 she has since I cant get into her pc?<br />

Sure, GTXND. Forgive me if I oversimplify but I'll include each step in case you're not familiar with navigating command lines (I was a
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>tech </span><span>support</span></a> guy in college 20 years ago; old habits die hard). Also, changing registry files can be VERY DANGEROUS... I would only do it as a last resort before reinstalling
 Windows 7.<br />
<br />
I first booted from the Windows 7 install disc to get to the <a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<span>system </span><span>recovery</span></a> console. I then selected Command Line. From there, I had to change from the X: drive to the C: drive by typing "C:". I then typed "cd \windows\system32\config" to get to the registry file directory. By typing "dir"
<span>system </span><span>recovery</span></a> console. I then selected Command Line. From there, I had to change from the X: drive to the C: drive by typing "C:". I then typed "cd \windows\system32\config" to get to the registry file directory. By typing "dir"
 I could see that two of the five hive files (default, sam, security,software, and system) had recent copies with an "rmbak" extension: default.rmbak and software.rmbak. I then executed the following commands:<br />
<br />
ren software software.bak<br />
copy software.rmbak software<br />
<br />
ren default default.bak<br />
copy default.rmbak default<br />
<br />
I would suggest you execute the "ren" then "copy" commands as above for any other hives that have "rmbak" backups with the same date/time stamp. This ensures your registry remains in sync. You can now reboot and see if your computer comes up.<br />
<br />
Here is an alternative suggestion if you don't have these "rmbak" files (if the above worked, don't do these steps; these would be a last-last resort before reinstalling Windows 7). From where we left off above type "dir RegBack". See what the time/date stamp
 is on the hive files there. If recent (use your judgment; mine is a couple days old so I would have probably used it had I not had the rmbak files, as I hadn't
<a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>installed</span></a> much in that time), you could do the following to restore that backup registry:<br />
<br />
ren default default.bak<br />
ren sam sam.bak<br />
ren security security.bak<br />
ren software software.bak<br />
ren system system.bak<br />
copy RegBack\*.*<br />
<br />
Reboot and see what happens. If this worked, you may have to reinstall any software that was installed after the time/date stamps of the files in the RegBack directory.<br />
<br />
One final note: I did try to restore to an earlier restore point once I made the above fixes. It kept coming up with an error. Therefore, I suggest creating a new restore point once the computer recovers, just so you have a clean one.<br />
<br />
<br />
So now what do I do?&nbsp; Plse help me!<br />

<br />
You posted lots of stuff but some of the relevant details are missing, e.g.:<br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>What is the actual problem you're trying to fix?</li><li>What exactly do you mean with "System protection is not enabled on [that] drive? Do you mean that System Restore is not enabled? On the Windows System drive?</li><li>What exactly is on drive S:? What do you see on on drives C: and D: while you are in Windows Repair Mode?</li></ul>
<br />
If your current Repair CD works then you need not worry about the 32/64 bit issue.<br />

<h2>            windows 8.1 keyboard driver problem</h2>
                    <p>Hello everyone,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently installed windows 8.1 on my desktop computer. At first everything was working fine, but after rebooting a few times the keyboard suddenly stopped working. Windows detects it but device manager it says there's a problem with the keyboard driver.It's
 a standard usb keyboard, compatible with windows 8.1.</p>
<p>I've tried to switch of xhci mode in bios, but that didn't work. All usb ports are working fine, and i have a usb mouse which also works fine whichever usb port i plug it in.</p>
<p>the keyboard itself works, i've tested it on another computer.</p>
<p>any suggestions will be greatly, appreciated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>thanks,</p>
<p>simon</p>

            <p>Hi Bob,</p>
<p>
</p><p>In this case, there might be some software conflicts or some issue with indexing. I would suggest you to run the Windows search and indexing troubleshooter to check if there is any issues. Type 'Troubleshooting' in the serach box and click on the same in
 the search results. In the new windows,click on 'View all' in the left pane and then click on the Windows search and incexing troubleshooter. If the issue still persists, I owuld suggest you to boot the computer in safe mode and check. To access the advanced
 boot options and boot in safe mode, refer to this article:</p>

            <p>Ms. Gowda,</p>
<p>Thank you for your response. The issue at hand is the current inability to add programs or "applications" to the list of designated default programs. For my personal use, the programs I consistently use are not Windows 10 applications, not found in the Windows
 Store.</p>
<p>Those "applications" are unavailable to me as Administrator. On site security hardware and programming prevent changing status.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the programs desired have been duly installed to the hard drive &nbsp;, they do not appear as an option on the list of available programs. Methods of uninstalling and re-install do not change this. Nor do they appear as options within other default protocols
 or methods of assigning default file extension handling. &nbsp;<br />
While I have seen a few suggestions on alteration of the Registry; these were outdated, used in outmoded platforms, and sometimes conflicting. &nbsp;I am exceptionally reluctant to alter the Registry as the Shell Experience Host has crashed again; this following
 a clean install very recently. This is the reason for resetting all default protocols.&nbsp;<br />
My system is a HP P2126 Desktop, Win 10 v1511, b 10586.164<br />
Your time and assistance are appreciated.</p>
<p>MCC</p>

            <p>Hi MCC,</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make a program appear in the "Default Programs" list, it has to be registered as per the guidelines in the MSDN page:
<strong>Default Programs</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/cc144154%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/cc144154%28v=vs.85%29.aspx?f=255&amp;MSPPError=-2147217396</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>While the Default Programs registration mentioned in the above page works fine in Windows 10, certain things might change in Windows 10 and a note "This topic does not apply for Windows 10"&nbsp;has been mentioned in that page.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But the Default Programs registration procedure hasn't changed yet in Windows 10. It's the same as in Windows Vista/7/8.</p>

    <title>Computer will not go to BIOS - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> wernd  say:</h3>
<h2>            Computer will not go to BIOS</h2>
                    <p>I installed Windows 8 several weeks ago as an upgrade to Windows 7.&nbsp; All has gone well with no issues.&nbsp; Yesterday in cleaning up the start screen, I right clicked the magnifier to unpin it but somehow it opened.&nbsp; I was not able to do anything with it on
 so I decided to restart.&nbsp; This led me to my splash screen for ASUS.&nbsp; This is a self built desktop.&nbsp; It just hangs on that screen and I couldn't get to the BIOS.</p>
<p>I contacted Microsoft support and after several questions advised me that the resolution change was probably the culprit.&nbsp; They then created a boot disk on my memory stick from another computer that had windows 8.&nbsp; Same problem and that was the end as I
 was advised the Motherboard manufacturer needs to help.&nbsp; I have contacted them but don't know when i'll hear back.</p>
<p>I disconnected the hard drive and was able to get into BIOS and boot from the memory stick.&nbsp; Once that happened I did get a repair screen so I tried that and reconnected the hard drive.&nbsp; I received a message that the hard drive was locked, whatever that
 means.&nbsp; I finally got a light blue screen that just said I had a problem and need to restart or something like that.&nbsp; I was never able to make any progress beyond the light blue screen and whenever the hard drive is attached, it will not boot beyond the splash
 screen.&nbsp; Just freezes there.&nbsp; </p>
<p>So, here are my questions:</p>
<p>-Is there any way to get the hard drive to "unlock" if that makes sense.</p>
<p>-Is my hard drive the issue or the BIOS?</p>
<p>-If I get a new hard drive, how do I install Windows 8 which I downloaded from Microsoft.com?</p>
<p>-Will a new hard drive solve my problem?</p>
<p>-Who is at fault here?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>Try booting from a Win7 or 8 installation disk and try a REPAIR.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don't have or are unable to obtain one&nbsp;easily, try this to get to SAFE MODE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1) Ctrl+Alt+Del just before you would see Windows. ( right after POST)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2) When your computer tries to reboot, do it again.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3) The 3rd time let it go through the boot process.&nbsp; After a period of time Automatic Repair will start.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) If Automatic Repair doesn't find anything, continue through the Advanced and Troubleshoot options until you get to the one to RESTART.&nbsp; Look for something to select to boot in SAFE MODE. Then Restart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you can boot in Safe Mode you may be able to fix the problem, or get it unstuck.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            I had already looked at that help and it's too basic for this question; however, I was able to muddle through and figure it out on my own.&nbsp; For others who are having the same issue, I did the following:&nbsp; I selected the song and used the Split tool.&nbsp; Then
 I deleted the part of the song before the split.&nbsp; The song then moves back to fill that space but the song does not start at the beginning anymore since you cut out the beginning of the song.&nbsp; If you want the song splice to start later in the slideshow/movie,
 select the song splice, move the bar to the place in the slideshow/movie where you want to put the song, and then click Set Start Time.&nbsp;

    <title>Deleting contacts in Windows Live Mail - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jeremyctaylor  say:</h3>
<h2>            Deleting contacts in Windows Live Mail</h2>
                    <p>I have been attempting to delete duplicate and old contacts from my windows livemail 2011 running on Windows7, which erroneously got onto the contacts list when I attempted to synchronise with my android phone by importing a csv file from my phone.</p>
<p>Having followed the advice on previous threads, and having a clean set of contacts on a csv file, I want to clear the current contact list completely.</p>
<p>I have removed the link between livemail and google and Skype and having gone into livemail I have successfully deleted all contacts that had an 'address book' field. However this leaves some 270 contacts that will not delete (the delete cross remains greyed
 out rather than red).</p>
<p>I have also gone into MS People and deleted all entries in there so this is now clear.</p>
<p>I would be really grateful for any advice that you have to enable me to clear my current WLM contact list so that I can start again with a clean list.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Many thanks</p>

</p><blockquote>
<p>I have now established that the contacts that reappear are stored somewhere on my laptop,

<p>Contacts you see in the Windows Live Mail contacts window are always stored on your computer. In your case, there is some dysfunction in the synchronization process that tries to ensure that the contacts you see in Windows Live Mail are the same as those
 you see on the People page. I don't know, but this might be a result of using an obsolete version of the program. On Windows 7, you should be using
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/download-windows-essentials#wetabs=we2012" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Windows Essentials 2012</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, we can probably cure this by forcing the program to download the latest version of the contacts list at People. To do this,
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Add a <em>New</em> contact on your People page that currently only contains <em>
Echo123.</em><br />
&nbsp;</li><li>Sign out of Windows Live Mail&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</li><li>Close down all programs (at least, all those that might be accessing your Windows Live Contacts - e.g. OneDrive, Movie Maker, Photo Gallery ...&nbsp;)<br />
&nbsp;</li><li>In Windows Explorer, navigate to the folder containing your contacts databases. This will normally be<br />
<strong>C:\Users\</strong>{user}<strong>\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows Live\Contacts</strong><br />
&nbsp;</li><li>Right-click on the folder named with the email address of the Microsoft Account you sign in with and select
<em>Rename</em>. Remove the '@' symbol from the folder name.<br />
&nbsp;</li><li>Launch Windows Live Mail. When the default contacts list has loaded (it's empty in your case),
<em>Sign in</em>. </li></ol>
<p>This should re-create the contacts database for the account concerned, with only two entries.</p>

<h2>            Is there a way to make a printer backwards compatible with Windows XP&#63;</h2>
                    We have a Konica 7155 copier/printer/scanner which works beautifully with Windows XP. &nbsp;The boss just bought us new computers that are Windows 7. &nbsp;I know I can make programs backwards compatible with Windows XP. &nbsp;Is it possible to make a printer do the
 same thing? &nbsp;Konica hasn't released a new driver yet, and I don't know if they ever will. &nbsp;Any ideas?

This can help with some (but not all):<br />
1) Uninstall the program if it's already installed. Then when you install/reinstall it instead of double clicking on the install file right click it and select "Troubleshoot Compatibility"<br />
2) Then click "Try Recommended Settings" and in the next windows click "Start the Program" to install it.<br />
3) After it installs see if it works correctly. Please note - some programs may not be able to run in windows 7.<br />

<p>You could try setting up the printer through Windows XP Mode if you are running Windows 7 Professional or Ultimate (these editions give you access to the free Windows Virtual PC with Windows XP Mode software).</p>

<p>Print from a virtual machine<br />
There are several methods you can use to make a printer available to a virtual machine. The methods you can use are affected by whether a printer driver is available for Windows 7 and whether the printer is a local USB printer or a network printer. To share
 a local USB printer<br />
1. Note<br />
This method is appropriate when the printer driver is available for both the Windows 7 host operating system and the guest operating system. You only need to complete these steps once per virtual machine. This procedure assumes you have verified that the printer
 is working in the host operating system.<br />
Make sure the printer is turned on and that the printer driver is available for installation. For example, you can install the driver from the internet or from a CD.<br />
Redirect the printer to the virtual machine. From the virtual machine window, click USB and then click Attachdevice name.<br />
2. Install the printer driver in the guest operating system. You can install the driver from the internet or from a CD.<br />
3. Release the printer from the virtual machine. From the virtual machine window, click USB<br />
<br />
and then click Releasedevice name.<br />
4. Restart the virtual machine. From the virtual machine window, click Action and then click Restart.<br />
5. Navigate to the virtual machine desktop, and log on if necessary. (You will be logged in automatically if you saved the credentials.)<br />
6. The printer will be available for use in both the host operating system and the guest operating system. To configure a network printer for a virtual machine<br />
1. Navigate to the virtual machine desktop, and log on if necessary. (You will be logged in automatically if you saved the credentials.) Note<br />
The following steps are general, so the names of the buttons may differ from what is shown.<br />
2. Open Control Panel, and then open Printers.<br />
3. Click Add Printer. The Add Printer Wizard opens.<br />
4. On the Local or Network Printer page, select the network printer option and complete the wizard.<br />
If you are running Windows XP as the guest operating system, you must manually install the printer driver for each printer you want to use. The following steps describe this process. To install a printer driver in Windows XP<br />
1. Click Start, and then click Printers and Faxes.<br />
2. Under Printer Tasks, click Add a printer. The Add Printer Wizard opens.<br />
3. On the Local or Network Printer page, select Local printer attached to this computer and clear Automatically detect and install my Plug and Play printer.<br />
4. On the Select a Printer Port page, click the drop-down control and select one of the TS number ports and click Next.<br />
5. On the Install Printer Software page, select Windows Update or Have Disk and complete the wizard. To print from a virtual machine<br />
1. Navigate to the virtual machine desktop, and log on if necessary. (You will be logged in automatically if you saved the credentials.)<br />
2. Do one of the following:<br />
??From the desktop of the virtual machine, right-click a file and click Print.<br />
??Open any application that includes a print option, and then use the print command.<br />
3. All printers available to the virtual machine are listed. Select a printer, and then click OK.</p>

<p>
</p><p>I keep getting frequent BSODs for IRQL Not Less or Equal and also for Kernel Security Check Failure. The dmp files from the driver verifier are in the one drive link along with the data from msinfo32 and system specs from Speccy.<br />
<br />
All drivers are up to date as best as I can tell. I turned off all non-Microsoft services in msconfig and that stopped all the IRQL BSODs for a week or two, then they started again. The crashes almost always happen upon waking the computer up from sleep mode.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Pro client &#43; Windows 2000 Domain Controller&#58; trust relationship failed. I can&#39;t add a domain user account&#33; Help&#33;</h2>
                    I have a fresh install of Windows 7 Pro and am unable to create a domain user profile on my laptop at work. Our PDC is running Windows 2000 Server. I am told that "the trust relationship has failed" between my computer and the domain controller. I have
 tried everything.<br />
<br />
I disabled my network adapter, changed my computer's name, deleted the original local admin profile, created a new one, cleared the local DNS cache, deleted my computer's active-directory record and DNS record from the DC, re-enabled the adapter, re-joined
 the domain, and it STILL won't let me connect. <br />
<br />
The local machine's time is within a minute of the DC's (though I get an 'access denied' message when I try to resync it with the DC using w32tm), and I can't think of anything else it might be... Help!

<p>Right I had the same problem when I upgraded a Dell laptop from XP to Windows 7 Professional</p>
<p>I too am using a Windows 2000 Server PDC</p>
<p>I could create an AD entry for the laptop on the Domain controller but could not&nbsp;add a domain user within the same process.</p>
<p>I got the "Trust Relationship between this workstation and the Domain has failed" Error message</p>
<p>The answer for me was to switch user and log onto the computer using the &lt;DOMAIN&gt;\&lt;Username&gt;</p>
<p>This user&nbsp;MUST be a network administrator.</p>
<p>Then go to the Account manager and you will be able to add Domain users in the normal way.</p>
<p>Note</p>
<p>I setup a local user on the laptop initially with the same name and password as the network administrator and gave it administrator rights.</p>

<p>We are seeing a similar problem in a 2000 PDC environment, mostly on machines that have been imaged back to a default install.</p>
<p>We think it might have something to do with the SID's on the machine, but we need more information on how this is implemented in a 2000 domain with win7 clients.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The above solution does not always resolve the issue as an existing user and computer account may still lose its trusted relationship. If anyone may have an idea on this I can provide more detailed information.</p>
<p>Any help appreciated.</p>

            Yes, all you need to do is, change your dns settings in Control panle/Network and sharing&nbsp;center then click network connections and change your ipv4 connections dns settings to the ip of the windows server 2003 Domain server. if you need a video guide

    <title>Xbox One Wireless Hardware Problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> nocturnal nvy  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox One Wireless Hardware Problem</h2>
                    
<p>So every time I turn on my Xbox One it cannot detect my wifi. I follow the dialouge which takes me to the wireless settings. Then I click on test my network connection and once I do that it pops up with a message saying " You need to reset your consoles
 wireless card as there may be a defect with the wireless hardware" that's not the exact words but that's pretty much what it says, but the thing that confuses me is after I reset the wireless hardware in the console it says "every thing is good!" And from
 there everything acts normal and I can get on Xbox Live and go on with my day.</p>

<p>Why does it need to be reset every time I turn on My console and why does it work perfecly fine after I reset it? Is this something that needs a repair or could it be a bug because it only started about a month ago.</p>

            <p>Hey there&nbsp;Nocturnal Nvy!</p>
<p>Sorry to hear about the wireless issue! Let's start by power cycling your console after you reset your wireless card settings. Follow the steps below:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Press and hold the power button on the Xbox One console for 10 seconds, or until the unit is fully powered off.</span></li>
<li><span>Unplug the power supply from the back of the Xbox One console and let it sit for 5 minutes.</span></li>
<li><span>Plug the power back in and power on.</span></li>
</ul>
<p>Post back and let us know if it boots up fine after power cycling. :)</p>
