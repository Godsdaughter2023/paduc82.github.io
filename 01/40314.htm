    <title>Replacing CD DVD Burner Not Supported By Windows 10 - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Replacing CD DVD Burner Not Supported By Windows 10</h2>
                    I have an Acer Aspire 7551-7422 laptop which I upgraded from Win 7 Pro to Win 10 Pro. Everything works great except&nbsp;the CD DVD burner (Optiarc AD-7585H by Sony) which worked fine before the upgrade. I have tried a plethora of fixes to get Windows to recognize
 this drive with no success. It is listed in Device Manager under "Other Devices" with a question mark by it.&nbsp;I have tried the update drive option, but it doesn't find any drivers. Acer is not supporting&nbsp;my laptop&nbsp;for the Windows 10 upgrade, and Sony doesn't
 support this CD DVD burner anymore&nbsp;so I can't get any help there. I have no objection to buying a new&nbsp;CD DVD burner listed on the Hardware Compatibility List, but I would like to know if this will solve my problem, or is this an issue with my motherboard?
 If this is an issue with the motherboard, would an external USB&nbsp;CD DVD drive be a viable option?&nbsp;Any help resolving this issue will be greatly appreciated!

            Thanks for replying to my post. However, I am not having a problem with m graphics driver. My problem is a DVD CD drive that isn't recognized by Windows 10 even though it worked fine under windows 7 Pro. It shows up in Device Manager under "Other Devices"
 with a question mark beside it. I have repeatedly uninstalled and reinstalled the device with the same results.

            Just want to let everyone know that I have found a solution to my problem. The answer , at least for me, was to update the SATA controller driver. My laptop has an AMD motherboard, and after downloading the latest drivers from the AMD website, I used Device
 Manager to update the SATA driver by pointing the search to the directory I created for the download. Device Manager located and installed updated drivers&nbsp; I rebooted and my DVD CD drive was listed under CD/DVD Drives. I played an audio CD and burned the Windows
 10 ISO to a DVD with no problems. So to others who are having similar issues I would suggest updating your SATA controller driver. Thanks to all who replied to my post and offered possible solutions.

            I'm having (over a month now) axact the same problem with an Acer Aspire 7551<span style="color: rgba(106, 106, 106, 1)"><span><strong>&nbsp;(</strong></span></span>P322G25MN) laptop. &nbsp;Only, the CD DVD is&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">NOT</span>&nbsp;an&nbsp;Optiarc
 AD-7585H by Sony but a&nbsp;<strong>HL-DT-STDVDRAM GT30N by Hitachi-LG</strong>.<br />
<br />
Win 10 doesn't recognize the CD DVD drive; it is listed in 'Other Devices' (Device Manager) (as HL-DT-STDVDRAM GT30 and not as HL-DT-STDVDRAM GT30N ATA DEVICE in Win 7) ; I can not manually install the driver (nor update it); I tried everything mentioned before
 and in orther threads (regedit atapi Controller0, UpperFilters - LowerFilters, SFC.exe, FIXIT, troubleshooter, ...).<br />
<br />
Anyone?<br />
<br />
Many thanks.

            <p>Hi! I found a solution to the problem in the Acer Community (<a href="http://community.acer.com/t5/Windows-10/Optiarc-DVD-RW-AD-7585H-needs-drivers-for-Aspire-7551-Lost-them/m-p/382660#M1892" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://community.acer.com/t5/Windows-10/Optiarc-DVD-RW-AD-7585H-needs-drivers-for-Aspire-7551-Lost-them/m-p/382660#M1892</a>).
 Basically the problem is with the SATA controller on our AMD motherboard. Once you update that driver, at least for me and others) the DVD drive is once again recognized. You would probably be best served reading the full thread at the&nbsp;link above, but if you're
 impatient like I tend to be, here is the link to the updated chipset :drivers on the AMD website:

<p>Yeah, it works!</p>
<p><strong>--&gt;</strong>The&nbsp;HL-DT-ST DVDRAM GT30N in my AMD based laptop (= CD DVD; in Win 7: HL-DT-ST DVDRAM GT30N ATA DEVICE) is now after updating the chipset drivers a&nbsp;<strong>HL-DT-ST DVDRAM GT30N&nbsp;<span>SATA CdRom Device</span></strong>.
 Win 10 recognizes this device and is able to control it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Astonishing that Acer Europe, Belgium neither Microsoft Europe Belgium Technical Support came up with this so simple solution! &nbsp;So again... many thanks!</p>

            Hey, that's great! Glad this solution worked for you also. It was so frustrating since everything else worked properly after the Windows 10 upgrade. I'm really enjoying Windows 10 now that this one issue has been resolved.

<h2>            Windows automatic update has locked me out of my laptop.</h2>
                    <p>Dear community, </p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 was trying to update itself, but I have been clicking 'remind me later' as it was not convenient for it to continue with shutting down at that time. So when I got the computer out of sleep this morning, I suddenly have to put in the Microsoft
 password (which luckily I can remember). </p>
<p>
</p><p>I am so tempted to just try installing a Windows 7 that I had on my old laptop, because to me this is probably the top of a slippery slope of windows 10 doing unpredictable things.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts on why they suddenly require a password? I never had one set on this laptop.</p>

            I am unable to access my people app and therefore all my email addresses. When I click on the app it asks me to 'get started'. However, when I try to import my contacts, it tells me this account already exists and returns me to the 'start' page. No where
 does it ask me to sign into my already existing accounts. Result I cannot address an email. What should I do?

            In Word where it lists the size of the Font, I think in gives values from 8 to 72, try actually typing a number in the the Font Size box next to the drop down arrow, for example I typed in the number 400 and got a huge letter displayed in the Word Document.

            Word will allow much larger type than it advertises.&nbsp; Select your font, then type the point size you want to use.&nbsp; My copy of Word 2007 only offers 72 points as its biggest character size, however, I was able to enter&nbsp;720 in the size column (ten times
 the 72 points advertised) which produced a capital "A" big enough to almost entirely fill an 8 1/2 x 11 sheet of paper.&nbsp; The max size I can use 1638 points.<br />

<h2>            error code 80070002 in WIndows Update - Win7x64SP1</h2>
                    I have been getting error code 80070002 in Windows Update since November 2012.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Windows 7 64bit SP1.&nbsp; <br />
MSE antivirus up to date.&nbsp; <br />
<br />
I have done ALL of the suggested fixes multiple times.&nbsp; Cleaned the \windows\SoftwareDistribution\... files.&nbsp; Run the downloaded FixIt tools, etc.&nbsp; Fix IT Tool says update databases are corrupted and then fixes them.&nbsp; Says they are fixed.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
Windows Update still won't run.<br />
<br />
I have access to tools such as DaRT if there is anything useful that can be done with that.<br />
<br />
Unless someone has any other suggestions, it's time for a complete re-image.&nbsp; I'm at a loss.<br />

            Thanks, Vinod, for the prompt reply.&nbsp; I have followed the instructions in your link multiple times and it has not fixed the problem.<br />
<br />
I have downloaded the System Update Readiness Tool at http://support.microsoft.com/kb/947821 .&nbsp; No joy.<br />
<br />
I have downloaded the Fix It tool for windows update.&nbsp; It finds errors(so it says) and fixes them.&nbsp; Still no joy.<br />
<br />
I have downloaded the updatediag tool and run it.&nbsp; It finds:<br />
1.&nbsp; "Potential Windows Update database error detected".&nbsp; And marks it fixed.<br />
2.&nbsp; "Windows Update components need to be repaired".&nbsp; And marks that fixed.<br />
3.&nbsp; "Problem with Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS)".&nbsp; And marks that fixed.<br />
<br />
Still no joy.<br />
<br />
I have downloaded the ISO files of the monthly fixes from November 2012 to date and attempted to install the updates for my system manually.&nbsp; Each of them displays the message "This fix not appropriate for your system".<br />
<br />
I'm actually done with this.&nbsp; I've spent more time on it then a format and re-image would take.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your reply, I appreciate it.<br />

            <p><em>Assuming Win7 (64-bit) SP1 with <u>IE9</u> installed...</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please answer <em>each of the following </em>[admittedly tedious] <em>diagnostic questions</em> in a correspondingly-numbered list in your very next reply - preferably
<em>without </em>quoting my post:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1a. When (approx. date) did you purchase <em>the computer?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1b. Did Win7 (64-bit) come preinstalled on the computer when you bought it, did you do a clean install of Win7,
<em>or did you upgrade&nbsp;the&nbsp;computer&nbsp;to Win7? </em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2a. Was <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/security-essentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<font color="#0072c6">Microsoft Security Essentials</font></a> (MSE) originally offered &amp; installed via Windows Update or did you intentionally<em>choose</em> to install it?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2b. In <em>Windows</em> Explorer [<strong>WinKey+E</strong>], navigate to &amp; right-click on</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; • <strong>C:\Program Files\</strong><em><strong>Microsoft Security Client</strong> &lt;=this folder</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Select <strong>Properties</strong>: What is the <strong>Created</strong> date displayed on the resulting
<strong>General</strong> tab?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2c. What ANTIMALWARE CLIENT version is currently installed? To find out, open MSE &amp; click on the downward-pointing arrow to the right of HELP then select ABOUT SECURITY ESSENTIALS.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. What anti-virus application was installed <em>before you installed MSE</em>, was your subscription still current, and did you uninstall it before you installed MSE?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4a. Has a(nother) Norton application <em>or a McAfee application</em> EVER been installed
<em>since you bought the computer?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4b. Did a Norton free-trial <em>or a McAfee free-trial</em> [PICK ONE] come preinstalled on the computer
<em>when you bought the computer?</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>5. <em>Again assuming Win7 (64-bit) SP1 with <u>IE9</u></em><em> installed =&gt; </em>
Are ALL of the following updates listed in <strong>View installed updates </strong>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>6. Is Firefox, Chrome or any other alternate browser installed?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>7a. Is Java Version 7 <strong><em>Update 17</em></strong> (or higher) installed? TEST HERE USING INTERNET EXPLORER (<em>ONLY!</em>) =&gt;

<p>8. Are you in the habit of using "Registry cleaners" (e.g., Registry Mechanic; System Mechanic; RegCure; RegClean Pro; Advanced SystemCare; Registry Booster; McAfee QuickClean; AVG PC TuneUp; Norton Registry Cleaner; PCTools Optimiser; SpeedUpMyPC; PC Doctor;

            Thanks, Robear, for the reply.&nbsp; Below are the answers to your questions, but before you waste any more time on this, it appears I've got bigger problems than just this.&nbsp; While I was gathering your answers, I had an "explorer has stopped working, restarting
 explorer" error.&nbsp; And shortly afterwards I had a BSOD BAD_POOL_HEADER (19) which has not happened before:<br />
<br />
=================================================<br />
<i>BugCheck 19, {3, fffff900c27df260, fff9f900c27df260, fffff900c27df260}<br />
Probably caused by : Pool_Corruption ( nt!ExDeferredFreePool+118b )<br />
Followup: Pool_corruption<br />
BAD_POOL_HEADER (19)<br />
The pool is already corrupt at the time of the current request.<br />
This may or may not be due to the caller.<br />
The internal pool links must be walked to figure out a possible cause of<br />
the problem, and then special pool applied to the suspect tags or the driver<br />
verifier to a suspect driver.</i><br />
=================================================<br />
<br />
<br />
This PC is a media PC hooked up to the big screen.&nbsp; It's got a few videos on it, Skype, and not much else.&nbsp; I'm just going to re-image it and start again from scratch.&nbsp; Maybe put an SSD in it instead of a hard drive.<br />
<br />
Thanks again for your time!<br />

I've gotta problem with that: "Blowing away" the contents of that <strong>Download

            <blockquote>5. <b>NONE</b> of the following updates are listed in <strong>View installed updates.&nbsp; (I blew away the files in c:\windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download\&nbsp;&nbsp; directory.)</strong>
</blockquote>
<p><br />
&gt;&gt;I've gotta problem with that: "Blowing away" the contents of that <strong>Download
</strong>folder would delete your <strong>&gt;&gt;Update History </strong>but not the list of
<strong>Installed Updates</strong>. With that in mind, wanna try answering #5 again?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your instructions were "[1] <strong>Start | Control Panel | Programs and Features | View installed updates</strong> (in left-hand menu)".&nbsp; When I do that it says "NO UPDATES INSTALLED".&nbsp; I am assuming that, since I successfully used and updated this computer
 from March 26, 2011 until November, 2012, that there should be some updates showing.&nbsp; Since I accidentally removed the files in the Download folder, I thought that would explain the missing updates.&nbsp; At any rate, "No Updates Installed" means that the list
 you described is not showing on the PC.&nbsp; Again, Windows Update has worked fine on this PC until November, 2012 when I started getting the error code 80070002.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;Please read #2a again &amp; post an appropriate answer to my question.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>I always install a copy of MSE when I build a PC.&nbsp; Sometimes I will have it on a CD, sometimes I will have it on a USB stick, and most times I will download it from the 'net.&nbsp; This PC was built on March 26, 2011, so frankly I don't remember if it was offered
 during Windows Update, or if I had already installed it before allowing update to run.<br />

<p>&gt;&gt;&lt;QP&gt;<br />
</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;These actions might prevent an error like this from happening again:</p>
<br />
&gt;&gt;1. Download and install updates and device drivers for your computer from Windows Update.
<p><strong>You're joking, right?&nbsp; The major problem and reason for this request for help was because Windows Update will not run and errors out with error code 80070002.<br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p><strong>&gt;&gt;2, Scan your computer for computer viruses.</strong> [<em>emphasis mine</em>]</p>
<p>Full system scans have been run.<br />
</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>&gt;&gt;3. Check your hard disk for errors.</p>
<p>sfc /scannow has been run, although not since the BSOD.<br />

<p><b>Again, thanks for your help.&nbsp; I always appreciate people that offer assistance in forums and wikis and places like this.</b></p>

<p><b>BUT...&nbsp; Consider this issue resolved.&nbsp; I have spent way too much time on this already and seem to be just generating more issues.&nbsp; When I get a chance this weekend, I'm going to pull the existing hard drive out, replace it with a new WD black 1TB drive

                    <span>
                    <span>
<p><strong>My son owns a HP Compaq Presario CQ70-220OEM notebook, operating system Vista Home Basic (32 bit) with service pack 1.<br />
A couple of weeks ago he switched the machine on - it would not boot and he got the message "No bootable device - insert boot disk and press any key"<br />
<br />
Unfortunately he had not created recovery disks so we had to buy recovery disks from HP's "preferred partner" - company named Best2Serve B.V. in Holland.<br />
<br />
We have tried booting the notebook from the first recovery disk - the programme then looks for the partition and loads up the recovery software but after clicking on the proceed button we get a runtime error :-<br />
"Microsoft Visual C++ Runtime Library<br />
Runtime error<br />
Programme X:\windows\system32\RESTORE7.exe<br />
This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way"<br />
<br />
After clicking O.k. we get a second error:-<br />
"The exception unknown software exception (0x40000015) ocurred in the application at 0x00d2e851"<br />
<br />
Does anyone know what the problem and solution is - would really appreciate some help, thanks.</strong></p>

<h2>            Windows 7 - Error Code&#58; 8007007E &#40;Can&#39;t install KB915597&#41;</h2>
                    
<p>I have Windows 7 Home Premium 64bit and never had any problems with Windows Update until like 2 days ago. The latest Definition for Windows Defender - KB915597 (Definition 1.85.1714.0) will not install. It downloads, creates restore point, then it says Installing
 and fails after a few seconds with 8007007E error. That's the only update I have pending at the moment so I don't know if any other updates will be affected. I have rebooted a few times and tried to disable antivirus (up to date NOD32).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>It is a fresh install on a self built PC.</p>
<p>Yes, I have purchased a NOD32 licence.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>When I open up Defender it says <strong>A problem caused this program's service to stop</strong> . I have a chance to start it manually but after a while it says<strong>This operation returned because the timeout period expired. Error code 0x800705b4</strong>
 . Check for update option is greyed out. On the bottom of Defender window it says<strong>Last scan: 04/07, Real-time protection: Off, Definitions 1.85.1218.0 01/07/2010</strong> .</p>
<p>I tried manually updating definitions but nothing happens when I run the update file both normally and as an administrator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>EDIT: I've just had a new update - Games for Windows LIVE V3.3 and this one installed fine.</p>

<p>Not sure what you mean by the first question. It's a self built PC on which I installed Win7 Home Premium 64bit from scratch, it wasn't an upgrade.</p>
<p>As soon as it was released in the UK, was it October?</p>
<p>Until mid-April I had an old, 2.x I believe version of NOD32 which worked fine but the licence expired. So I downloaded Norton Antivirus trial and had it for a month. Wasn't happy so I went back to NOD32, installed the latest version of their Smart Security
 trial and had it for I believe a month, then uninstalled and purchased NOD32 Antivirus which I have to date. So I've had it roughly since mid-June.</p>
<p>I've already answered your last question - I tried but nothing happened. It briefly shows some progress bar but then no message, nothing.</p>

You are seeing the effects of a "hijackware" infection. You should have replaced NOD32 v2.x BEFORE the subscription expired.</p>

<p>Are you sure this is the case? The NOD32 licence expired which only meant I didn't get antivirus updates for maybe 2-3 days, right after that I installed another antivirus. So this would mean during these days some new threat managed to emerge and infect
 my system. Moreover, Norton Antivirus installed fine and full system scan revealed nothing, after that the latest version of NOD32 installed fine and also full system scan revealed nothing.</p>
<p>I've just done another full scan, nothing. Is there anything I could use to scan the system which would tell me I am infected? Apart from this issue with update I can see no abnormal behaviour whatsoever.</p>
<p>Thanks for the time you have already taken to help me but I would really appreciate some further investigation.</p>

That's more than enough time for the computer to get infected.</p>

            Had the same problem with a HP Laptop. Upgraded to SSD and moved operating system using Mini Partition Wizard. Windows 7 started fine, but when attempting to upgrade to Windows 10, I got the "We're having trouble determining if your PC can run Windows
 10". &nbsp; I found that the boot partition was marked active and not the "C:" drive. But Windows 7 worked fine which confused me. I then marked the C Drive "active" and Windows would no longer boot. I had to use a (any) Windows 7 disk to repair the boot partition.
 Windows 7 then rebooted fine. I rechecked and the C: drive was now active. Windows 10 upgraded after that.

            I was already running Windows10 and tried to upgrade to Anniversary when I ran into this problem.&nbsp; I had previously upgraded to SSD on my HP laptop.&nbsp; The Windows 10 DVD also has a boot repair option (boot the DVD, go through all the options, then select
 "Repair" rather than "Install").&nbsp; Thanks cdberkman!<br />

<h2>            Surface pro 3 and autodesk sketchbook some options missing</h2>
                    Hi so I recently downloaded the desktop version of autodesk sketchbook, and it worked the first time I opened it. However I was not able to locate the membership/save/exit buttons. ever since then no mater how many times I reinstall it it has this issue:
 it opens, but the canvas and main toolbars are hidden. I can still pull up the sub-bars like color and layers. The layers bar shows me making marks, but all I see is what I had open before. Is this a compatibility issue, Because my surface has the requirements.
 It even recommends to use a pressure sensitive device or computer. Does anyone know how to fix this?

<p>Save it somewhere on your PC for example in Documents. Then right click it and click Extract All...</p>
<p>Leave the folder to be extracted to as the default, this will create a folder with the same name as the zip file and in the same location. Inside that folder will be another folder, inside that folder double click the Setup(.exe) file.</p>

<p>Hi <strong>Andik06,</strong><br />

To show the Language bar<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp; Right-click the taskbar, point to Toolbars, and then click Language bar.</p>
<p>Once the Language bar is displayed, you can right-click it to display options for changing its settings, which include docking it on the taskbar or displaying it vertically instead of horizontally.</p>

<p>My account has been permanently banned and i need someone form the enforcement team to help and be understanding about my situation because right now no one is helping everyone just keeps saying "oh well you can just file a (UA) unauthorized assess claim"and
 they will fix it but every time it comes up clean when i got a clear email that my account has been logged in from cannada when I'm from texas and been playing games i haven't owned for months and they say theres no evidence of any one being on my account
 ..they even attempted to change my password so please if anyone is on the enforcement team and handles banns and stuff please try to help me i would really appreciate it i really don't want to lose 5 years of work and if anyone ttys to post and say to file
 a stupid (UA) claim or just make a mother account because making another account isn't going to solve the issue to me i find that stupid to just make a new account and pay for xbox live all over again like whats the point if everything you ever had was gone

<p>ok well today i called to see if they have tried to get back with me after a week of filling a case of unauthorized access to my account because some one from Canada had been on my account i live in Texas and surely don't know anyone in Canada and they said
 nothing came up and the case had been closed when i clearly had gotten an email showing the region the ip address and date and time it had happened as well as my password being changed and the next day it says my account had been suspended permentely bacuse
 &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Utilizing unauthorized methods to gain advantage or disrupt the competitive landscape of Xbox Live
</li><li>Intentionally playing with someone who is using unauthorized software, methods, or modifications
</li><li>Exploiting game vulnerabilities or glitches </li><li>Network interference or manipulation </li><li>Player feedback or complaint abuse </li><li>Console tampering &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; </li></ul>
<p>i had copied this directly from my email now i do not hack nor cheat i don't like hackers or cheaters but from what it sounds like is they were modding online and when i called Microsoft they had told me the last game i played is mw3 which i do not own so
 I'm guessing someone had used my account to host modded lobbies,mod the game ect... but i haven't owned mw3 in a while well over 6 months and they told me no one has been on my account this is total bogus because they are esentaly saying "were sorry but your
 account has been hacked and were banning it bacuse we could care less i would expect them to have better customer service and talk to me and help figure out what happened I've already posted on there and every one said to claim unauthorized access and they
 would get back with me and that is what i did and i had talk to some girl and all she did is refer me back to this stupid forum because there too lazy to take the time to help me out but can someone on here please help me out i don't want to loose all my stuff
 i have 4 years worth of gaming on my account and there banning me permentaly and they just say you could creat a new account if you would like ...serously like i can just make a new account and go about my day as if nothing ever happened like its no biggy
 I'm not going to cart a new account if they are seriously going to be this inconsiderate I'm jet going to sell my xbox one and 360 will some one please help me out is there any way i can get in contact with the people who are in charge of banning accounts
 or reviewing access to count please help !!!&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;ORIGINAL POST:</p>
<p>ok well today i was playing forza horizon and all of us sudden i get singed out and it says sing out because someone singed in else ware so i start freaking out thinking someones hacking my account and i keep trying to sign in hoping it will work and then
 I'm trying to get on my computer at the same time and and log in to xbox live thinking who ever is trying to hack me maybe i can change my password b 4 they can get a chance to do anything and i sing in and it says banned until 12/31/9999 and right after i
 see that my phone got an email saying i have been banned and why and it says i have been banned "due to cheating,inappropriate gameplay and or system abuse" and I'm thinking what the heck I'm never online and when i am all i do is play forza so then i see
 another email saying how my account had an unusural sign in and its from Canada and it shows the ip address so someone was on my account and my password had been changed and stuff like that so i call xbox support and they say they can't do anything to help
 me out because they don't have any contact with the enforcement team and they can't help but they just referd me to the xbox forums and saying if i post on here someone will be able to help me but when i talked to the employe over the support line he says
 i was last playing mw3 and at that point I'm really confused because i don't even own mw3 so i think some one had gotten a hold of my account and used it in order hack or attempt to mod or was just showing flat out wrong conduct in the game causing me to get
 banned i just hope someone here can help me out and if it is at all possible get restore my account and change the password and sucure my account from anyone who may have access to it .</p>
<p>SECOND POST:</p>
<p>&nbsp;my account isn't locked it says i am banned until 12/31/9999 when i try to sing in but I'm guessing they used my account to do something to get me banned is there any possibility i could get everything restored and back to normal like my password reset
 and change my security stuff and unbanned because I'm really upset i have years of gameplay lots of achievements and i have done so much online like ranks and one of my goals was to have every call of duty maxed out on my rank and guns and stats and so on
 ,on every call of duty up till the release of the ps4 and xbox one and i would hate for all those years of gaming to go to waist all because some kid probily thought it was funny to hack my account and get me banned which I've spent all day long trying to
 figure out how can fix this problem and yet all Microsoft dose is refers me to this stupid form which i retied because basically there saying "oh were sorry but &nbsp;it suck to be you you can go to our forums if you'd like have a nice day" like really i would
 except them to at last help and see what they can do like look up to see where my account has been who did it and see that i haven't been on in several days and give me a chance to change my password and get my account unbanned and do anything else they can
 do to make sure no one else has access to my account like they get paid to help ppl not just refer everyone to the stupid forums all day</p>

    <title>ISO file stuck in CD driver - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steeljaw11  say:</h3>
<h2>            ISO file stuck in CD driver</h2>
                    <p>I have no idea whats going wrong. But hopefully someone out there can help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Basically, I got my hands on an ISO file and tried to open it with Power2go cyberlink ISO viewer. Then I enabled virtual drive on it with driver Z. I open the file and poke around and get what I want out of it before I need to delete it, problem is, it wont
 unmount from the driver, and it wont let me delete the source ISO file because of that i think.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried switching to different drives and turning on and off again, and nothing seems to work. When I tried to use the drive tools and hit the eject button, nothing, an error message pops up saying "an error has occured while ejecting drive (Z:) new ISO".</p>

            Hello. I'm Rey, a Community Expert willing to help the users.
<br />
<br />Banners are displayed at the top of the screen when a notification is received. They will disappear automatically after a couple of seconds.
<br />
<br />Between having a Banner or an Alert when a new notification is received. Unlike a Banner, an alert does not go away automatically - you will need to acknowledge that alert by double-tapping on a button before it will go away and you can do anything else on your device.
<br />
<br />Best Regards

<p>I just looked into Nirsoft.net.&nbsp; It appears to have just what I was looking for, but I am not a programmer of any kind and much of the language is foreign to me.&nbsp; I don't want to mess up my Windows 7.&nbsp; I logged into
<a href="https://www.nirsoft.net/redirect/windows_password.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Stellar Phoenix</a>, but it looked like I had to buy a membership.</p>
<p>It looks like what was listed in in the link you provided kinda indicated that the option was really not available in Firefox, but the Password Recovery Tools are like a work around.&nbsp; Is that right?</p>
<p>Do I understand what you suggested?</p>

<p>Yes, it's my understanding that since Firefox 57, the export functionality for site passwords has been removed.&nbsp; You can look at and copy them one at a time manually in Firefox, but if you have many saved logons, that's very tedious, especially because you
 can only copy the logon ID or password separately.&nbsp;&nbsp; See the "Tips" at the end of the ghacks.net page and
<a href="https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/password-manager-remember-delete-change-and-import" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/password-manager-remember-delete-change-and-import</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>After doing a little more research on this topic, and assuming that you're going to continue to use Firefox after you move to Windows 10, my suggestion would be to either copy your entire Firefox profile to some backup media (e.g., a USB flash drive) and
 then copy that into the proper place on your new computer.&nbsp; Or, if you just want to copy the saved logons, just copy/replace the files key4.db and logins.json from the old profile to the new profile.&nbsp; Otherwise, you're going to have to use some other third-party
 utility to get the exported logonIDs/passwords back into Firefox (Firefox has the option to import this data from IE 11 or Chrome, but not from a standard *.txt or *.csv file).</p>

    <title>Files ready to be written to Disc 1 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> domiles  say:</h3>
<h2>            Files ready to be written to Disc 1</h2>
                    Why does desktop.ini ([.ShellClassInfo]<br />
LocalizedResourceName=@%SystemRoot%\system32\shell32.dll,-21815)<br />
constantly appear to be written to Disc (1)?<br />
This is a Vista Home Premium Disk that I have to run because programs I need for work are there.&nbsp; What will happen if I write it to disck 1, will it change any settings users or what?<br />
I can not replicate these programs, they were down loaded and installed and before the computer was delivered to me the install files were deleated.&nbsp; The previous user is dead so no help there.&nbsp; I can not replace them or get his information to download again,
 I am very nervous about this.<br />

    <title>Windows 10 Updated Destroyed my Acre Laptop that was running Windows - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> steveneugebauer  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Updated Destroyed my Acre Laptop that was running Windows 8.1</h2>
                    <p>NO ONE should be downloading Microsoft 10 update. &nbsp;It completely destroyed my laptop badly enough that I have to reformat the hard drive and start over on my business laptop where Outlook disappeared and I am no longer authorized to do anything to try to
 fix the problem probably because Windows 10 created new, unknown security codes. &nbsp;I uninstalled Microsoft 10 and it did not go away (I now have a mixture of Windows 10 and 8.1 all at once. &nbsp;Outlook is completely gone (all the .pst files are gone) and I'm told
 that as administrator I do not have authority to try to restore anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not let anyone download this product that is anything but free. &nbsp;After I end having to wipe hard drive on the laptop and completely reinstall everything it will take at least a day rebuilding including the re installation of all programs, reinstalling
 all contacts and dates in your outlook files, and reinstalling all apps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do yourself a favor; if you still must use Microsoft software use Windows 7 and NEVER download 10. &nbsp;Otherwise, get smart a realize that Microsoft is committed to provide us the worst products possible and could care less how many problems remain simply to
 meet release dates (I know because I used to work at Microsoft).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft does not care about their customers and is willing to provide defective products (remember Windows 2000, Windows ME, Windows Vista, Windows 8, and now Widows 10) and actually charge customers for product they know do not work at all and are loaded
 with bugs and memory time bombs.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft could care less if the destroy an expensive computer and ignore (does publish) know problems that not only create security problems but also cause numerous malfunctions. &nbsp;I use my computer for work, and I cannot fix the computer after the Windows
 download eliminated my security (it apparently changed all of this), no longer recognizes administrators, all .pst files are gone and cannot accessed so MS Outlook no longer works if you want to restore back to an pre-updated version, good luck, because all
 of the restore points are gone.</p>
<p><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/b20e8a9d-a495-4c98-b606-930ee31f1516" /></p>
<p>
</p><p>If you try uninstall Windows 10, your computer will be toast and nothing will work, which means you will need to wipe the hard drive and reinstall the original operating system (which with Windows 8.1 is almost as bad as Windows 10. &nbsp;Do not be fooled by
 Microsoft, this upgrade is no better than Windows ME was and do what I'm going to do, switch to Apple and Unix. &nbsp;Microsoft has chosen to turn out defective products routinely, Windows 10 is the pinnacle of their worst of the worst. &nbsp;Do not get sucked in by
 the offer of a free upgrade. &nbsp;It is not free after you spend all of the time to rebuild your computer, assuming you do have some backups. &nbsp;DO NOT reserve Windows 10 and watch you automatic upgrades (it try to install as a upgrade), and DO NOT ever load it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I plan to sue Microsoft in small claims court for the cost of my laptop and the programs I have lost and when I win, I will do what everyone else should to, buy and Apple or wipe your computer and download the latest version of UNIX (its often free). &nbsp;You
 will never have to deal with Microsoft again and you will be doing yourself a big favor, considering Microsoft has no problem releasing defective software simply to meet deadlines and this is one of the worst Microsoft has released in recent memory (as bad
 as Windows 8.1 is, Windows 10 is far worse (in addition to completely removing any privacy protections).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Word to the wise, DO NOT download Windows 10 and if your smart, stop using Microsoft products completely, there are much better options that are stronger, more secure, more powerful, and that have far less bugs.</p>
