            Thanks for the info. The hotfix is really old and since I update my computer regularly, I probably have downloaded it a number of times over the last three years.<br />
<br />
I picked a different time server and I'm hoping that solves the problem.<br />

I found it.&nbsp; It's the ARCHIVE attribute on the source files.&nbsp; On the new Robocopy, the presence of the "A" attribute seems to force the file to be copied.&nbsp; The problem is, Robocopy doesn't then reset the attribute.&nbsp;
<br />
<br />
And if you use /M (copy only "A" files, then reset "A"), any files without the "A" attribute set get ignored - even if they should have been copied because they don't exist on the target, etc.&nbsp; So that doesn't work.<br />
<br />
The solution "appears" to be to reset the "A" attribute on the structure you want to copy BEFORE you do the copy.&nbsp; Then your script "should" work.&nbsp; (Mine did.)&nbsp; I used:<br />
ATTRIB -A C:\MYDIR\*.* /D /S to clear the attributes.&nbsp; Then Robocopy started working.<br />
<br />
Of course, going forward, modified files will get "A" set, and then Robocopy will start copying those files every time again, so what I did was to add the ATTRIB command AFTER the Robocopy command in my script.&nbsp; Run Robocopy, then reset "A"s.&nbsp; That "should"
 yield the desired result, I hope!<br />

<p>Thank you so much; I had that same problem and your solution works! The only caveat is that the ATTRIB command seems to be very choosy with pathnames: if there are any spaces in a directory name it doesn't seem to recognize the path.</p>

            I mentioned earlier that it worked, but now it seems like it doesn't! For certain directories it copies every file, modified or not. When I try resetting ATTRIB on them by hand, without a batch file, using the command you provided, it seems to work just
 fine. Then Robocopy still copies every file! But for other directories, it skips the files as expected. There seems to be no rhyme or reason as to why it does this, and the problem is unique to Windows 8; Windows 7 and XP (SP3) work just fine. Thank you so
 much, however, for putting your finger on at least part of the problem so far.

            I've been using robocopy.exe for years on Win2k, WinXP, Vista and Win7 for daily scripted backups of selected files on my home PCs. The scripts copy from the PC's boot drive to another internal drive. (Other scripts copy files offsite.)
<div><br />
<div>I've seen the same Win8 robocopy problem that others have reported here. I appreciate Rocker-Rubino's suggestion to try a much older robocopy.exe. I tried the Win7 version and found that it still has the same problem. I'll give the WinXP version a try.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In trying the Win7 version, I experienced another anomaly: If my scripts call the Win7's robocopy.exe in the folder where the Win8 upgrade installer left it -- c:\windows.old\windows\system32 -- it runs cosmetically normally while displaying the excessive
 copying problem we're discussing here. If I move the Win7 robocopy.exe to another folder -- c:\myscripthome -- it shows an additional cosmetic problem: Robocopy's &nbsp;console logging is made without line feeds, causing the console to be more or less unreadable.
 This seems fairly odd. (FWIW, I'm using the "tee" parameter and haven't tried the script without it.)</div>
<div><br />
<div>An aside: In reading up on Win8's robocopy, I noticed a change that I'll make use of eventually: Robocopy now has the /J parameter for unbuffered file copying that Win7's xcopy introduced. Unbuffered copying speeds up large file transfers. Useful when

            I installed the Win2K3 version in a backup script this morning and it seemed to work OK in script runs today. At least, the scripts ran with the expected speed, rather than getting bogged down copying thousands of unchanged files.<br />
<br />
(I was thinking that robocopy came with WinXP. I see now that it did not, but the Win2K3 version worked on WinXP.)<br />

            <p>Thank you. I installed the one from the resource kit you mentioned on my Windows XP machine (which doesn't have Robocopy) as well as on my Windows 8 machine, on which I gave the robocopy.exe file from the resource kit a slightly different name, and it's
 been working just fine.</p>

            I'm sure that I don't fully understand what's going on yet, but here's some additional info I discovered through trial and error:<br />
<br />
Clearing the archive attribute flag on the source doesn't seem to fully stop Robocopy v6.2 (included in Windows 8) from finding "Modified" files and copying them.<br />
<br />
The "/A-:A" switch (which should remove the archive attribute form the copied files) seems to have no effect (at least when used over network).<br />
<br />
If I later modify the attribute(s) of relevant file(s) on either side, running the same Robocopy command will cause it to detect "Modified" files again, even if I (and especially if I do) change the attributes to be same between both sides.<br />
<br />
But, if I remove the archive attribute from all relevant files on the host side (the computer running the Robocopy command) and actually set the the archive attribute on those files on the guest (for lack of a better term) side, then Robocopy won't detect the
 files as "Modified" and otherwise work as expected.&nbsp; Interestingly, the reverse seems to work as well (setting Archive on host &amp; clearing on guest).&nbsp; So, there seems to be some messed up detection logic for "Modified" files over a network.<br />
<br />
<br />
TLDR: To get the new Robocopy to reliably not copy "Modified" files over a network, CLEAR the Archive attribute of files in the set on the host side and SET the Archive attribute of those files on the other side before running Robocopy.<br />

            Hi Alan, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            <p>Hi Touqirbhatti,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for providing us the opportunity to assist you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the issue description you are facing issue with the display while playing NFS game on your Windows 8.1 computer. The issue could be if the display drivers either get corrupted or need an update. So, I would suggest you to update the display driver
 and see if it helps you to fix the issue. For updating the device driver you may refer to the link mentioned below and see if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Drivers are updated occasionally. Windows can update them automatically, or you can install the updated drivers yourself. It's important for you to have confidence in the updated drivers you install. Windows notifies you if it detects a suspicious or unsafe
 driver you shouldn't install.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/all-drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Download and install drivers</a></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>If issue persists, try to update the display driver from the manufacturer's website and see if it helps you to fix the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do keep us updated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Regards,</p>
        </p>

<h2>            Touchpad two finger scrolling has disappeared on my Windows 8 HP.</h2>
                    <p>As soon as my two finger scrolling stopped working, I immediately tried to go to my mouse settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I did this, there was no touch pad option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I then found the "Synaptics Touchpad V7.5" icon in my control panel. When I tried to click on this to open the settings, it tells me that the computer was unable to connect to the Synaptics Device Driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have grown accustomed to using the two finger scrolling and swipe options on my touchpad, which is why I want to get this figured out.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To avoid the question, I did not make any changes to my computer, nor have I altered the settings in any way previous to this problem arising.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have seen that I should delete the device drivers, but I have no idea how to do that, and I don't want to delete things that would change even more settings on my computer.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>Hi geelox,<br />
<br />
- What’s the exact error message related to ‘regedit’ you receive?<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p><span>Microsoft Graphic Studio Home Publishing 99 is a really old program designed primarily for Windows 95, Windows 98.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Also the program is not listed in the Windows 7 Compatibility Center and hence its compatibility with Windows 7 is unknown.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>See&nbsp;<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Search.aspx?l=en-us&amp;type=Software&amp;s=Microsoft Graphics Studio home publishing 99" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Windows
 7 Compatibility for Microsoft Graphics Studio Home Publishing 99</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>However, you may try installing the program in&nbsp;<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-older-programs-run-in-this-version-of-Windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Windows
 95/98 compatibility mode</span></a> and check if that fixes the issue.</span></p>

<h2>            Xbox One S vs. Xbox One X vs. native 4K Budge Blu-Ray &#40;U875&#41; for Playing 4k Blu Ray Films</h2>
                    <p>Recently acquired a native 4K&nbsp;TV (which I'm still guessing is better than upscaling though I'm partially confused about the ups and downs of upscaling are if anyone can tell me&nbsp;)&nbsp; and currently have an Xbox 360 and am ready to upgrade.</p><p><br /></p><p> I&nbsp;have a question&nbsp;re: Xbox One X and/or Xbox One S&nbsp;vs. native 4K blu ray player (LG has one for $80 right now (UP875).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>Which is best/adequate/etc. for playing 4K movies? Is it&nbsp;better to fork out the dough for a&nbsp; (lightly or refurbished)&nbsp;used Xbox One X or get a&nbsp; (lightly or refurbished)&nbsp;used&nbsp;Xbox One S or the budget blu ray player?&nbsp; To put differently: the question is whether the Xbox One X or S (and I realize I've got Xbox fans here) can play movies (which I actually care about more than gaming--Blade Runner 2049 being my most favorite film) as *well* as a native 4k blu-ray player; the LG got high ratings from Cnet.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br />

            <p>Upscaling basically&nbsp;stretches the picture to match the resolution of your display (e.g. 1080p game/movie will be stretched to fit your 4K&nbsp;display resolution).&nbsp;The main difference between the S and X is the hardware, which is mainly utilized for games. The S will render games up to&nbsp;1080p and upscale to 4K. The X is able to render and output at native 4K (only&nbsp;if the game is "Xbox&nbsp;One X&nbsp;Enhanced").</p><p><br /></p><p>Both the Xbox One S and Xbox One X play 4K&nbsp;movies&nbsp;the same. They can both&nbsp;output movies in <em>native</em> 4K, as well as&nbsp;optionally support HDR&nbsp;(HDR10 profile). You just have to be sure that you are streaming in 4K or use a UHD&nbsp;Blu-Ray, and your TV set supports it.</p><p><br /></p><p>Go for the Xbox One S if you want a 4K&nbsp;movie player with the option to game. If its movies you only care about, and you want to spend the <em>least</em> amount of money, then go for the LG&nbsp;player you mentioned.</p>

            <p>My experience is that the consoles, both the One S and the One X, are problematic for disc playback. Title updates are slow to happen, audio output is only now coming up to par with stand alone receivers and sound bars and there are fidelity issues still with color spaces and how the Xboxes display them without overdriving (commonly called crushing) black and white ranges for HDR and 1080p display.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>To me a stand alone player from a major producer like LG or Sony will be easier to use and less frustrating going forward and take just a few minutes to update when firmware updates are released.&nbsp;</p><p><br /></p><p>As far as scaling non 4K content while it is dependent on the particular set most 4K sets do a very good job of this. It doesn't look fake. Motion Interpolation is what produces the fake look i.e. soap opera effect. That can be turned off in the TV settings. For gaming that is desirable as those modes introduce controller lag. </p>

<h2>            Laptop Keyboard Completely Messed UP</h2>
                    <p>Hello, So I had a drink spilled on my laptop and they keyboard was damaged, I took it apart and bought a new keyboard and installed it, I kept using my laptop with a USB keyboard, however when I installed the new laptop keyboard and I was trying it, most
 of the keys where not mapped correctly, although USB keyboard was fine..</p>
<p>
</p><p>for example<span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>'a' </strong></span>on the laptop keyboard is probably<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">
<strong>'F5' </strong></span>while <span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>'g' &nbsp; &nbsp; is &nbsp; &nbsp; 'w'
</strong></span>and <strong>'</strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>i' &nbsp;&nbsp; is &nbsp; &nbsp; 'f'</strong></span><br />
and maaany other keys are like that.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried reinstalling windows and resetting the whole laptop, no luck.</p>
<p>I tried reseating the keyboard FFC Cable, no luck.</p>
<p>I tried uninstalling keyboard driver from device manager and installing it again, no luck.</p>
<p>I tried using a remapping software, no luck.</p>
<p>I tried checking the region, language, and keyboard settings, no luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>PS, I am currently using the same laptop to write this post using a USB keyboard, no problem whatsoever, as long as I don't use the laptop keyboard which is still messed up..</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Laptop is ASUS K550L</p>
<p>Windows 10 Pro</p>

            Thanks for the prompt reply I have been in touch with dell and they tell me there is no driver upgrade for this device to windows 10 their only solution is to roll back to windows 7 as they do not regard&nbsp;my laptop as compatible with windows 10&nbsp;or buy a
 new laptop if I want to use windows 10

            <p>Just to inform you some more about the details and what actually caused the problem.</p>
<p>This Acer Laptop of mine since i had bought it, it kept causing backup problems every three to four months but at the end i made some full research on everything. even reloading everything (Acer Program &amp; Windows) but not long then it starts over again.
 Another thing when re-downloading or installing it automatically gives all the latest data but the problem i had it automatically restored the data ( Acer Program) like it was when i bought it. That's when i realized and a Acer Technician Confirmed to me that
 this Laptop is a Factory Mishaps (would rather not use my actual words) so the only option to stop all these problems where by removing all the Acer data but to keep all the Windows Data. Now the only Acer Program i have on it is the Acer Quick Access witch
 is meant for the display of Gaps lock and those details.</p>

<h2>            Windows Update not showing updates - DISM.exe unable to RestoreHealth - sfc.exe not working - System Restore not working - System Refresh not working</h2>
                    <p><span>Dear all,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Have a myriad of issues since a few days, suspectedly caused by the same (unknown) root cause</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Windows update is not showing any updates even though I haven't installed the batch from latest patch Tuesday (Office updates installed fine though)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /RestoreHealth&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>responds:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Error 14098</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The component store has been corrupted.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I can send DISM and CBS log files if requested.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>(CMD.exe run as adminstrator, running from safe mode or clean boot doesn't matter)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Running DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /RestoreHealth /Source:(disc) /LimitAccess</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>returns the exact same error, actually before it even accesses the disk drive</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. SFC.exe /scannow&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>responds:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Windows Resource Protection could not perform the requested operation.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>(CMD.exe run as adminstrator, running from safe mode or clean boot doesn't matter)</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>4. I tried system restore to the oldest restore point, it didn't work, I got a message that it didn't succeed due to not able to access some files.</span></p>
<p><span>It suggested to turn off virus scanner but as a ran from a clean boot I don't think this could have been the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>5. Windows Refresh doesn't work, returns message that the requested action couldn't be completed and nothing was changed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I know the logical next thing to try would be to completely reset Windows, but I would like to know if there's any solution without affecting my files.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to send my logs to QA of Microsoft so they can fix the issue for the future because it's possible it was one of Windows' own updates that caused
 the issue.</span></p>

            <p>Hi, </p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand the frustration when things don't work as expected. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I appreciate you for performing some troubleshooting steps in order to get the issue resolved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since <strong>Refresh</strong> was performed and it too didn't help in getting the issue resolved, so as you correctly pointed out
<strong>Reset</strong> would be the perfect troubleshooting step that needs to be done next.
</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><span>Swipe in from the right edge of the screen, tap <strong>
<span>Settings</span>, </strong>and then tap <strong><span>Change PC settings</span>.</strong><br />
(If you're using a mouse, point to the upper-right corner of the screen, move the mouse pointer down, click
<span>Settings</span>, and then click <span>Change PC settings</span>.)</span>
</li><li>
<p>Tap or click <strong><span>Update and recovery</span></strong>, and then tap or click
<strong><span>Recovery</span>.</strong></p>
</li><li>
<p>Under <strong><span>Remove everything and reinstall Windows</span></strong>, tap or click
<span>Get started</span>. </p>
</li><li>
<p>Follow the instructions on the screen.</p>
</li></ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> All of your personal files will be deleted and your settings will be reset. All apps that you installed will be removed. Only apps that came with your PC will be reinstalled. Please take a backup of the data.
</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If you upgraded your PC from <span>Windows&nbsp;8</span> to
<span>Windows&nbsp;8.1</span> and your PC has a <span>
Windows&nbsp;8</span> recovery partition, resetting your PC will restore <span>
Windows&nbsp;8</span>. You’ll need to upgrade to <span>Windows&nbsp;8.1</span> after the reset has finished.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> You'll be asked to choose whether you want to erase data quickly or thoroughly. If you choose to erase data quickly, some data might be recoverable using special software. If you choose to erase data thoroughly, this will take longer
 but it makes recovering data less likely.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Blue screen errors 0x0000007A and 0x00000116.</h2>
                    My computer running Windows 7 is giving me lots of issues. &nbsp;It is a hardware problem that triggers BSOD errors. &nbsp;I'm probably going to have a hard time even explaining half the story. &nbsp;The computer was giving me BSOD errors&nbsp;0x0000007A and 0x00000116. &nbsp;To
 fix the first bsod error, I replaced the hard drives and motherboard. &nbsp;On that old motherboard, no matter what settings I set (Default or manual set to hardware specifications), the BIOS would report "Overclocking failed" and revert to default. &nbsp;I have not
 seen the&nbsp;0x0000007A error since replacing the motherboard and hard drives. &nbsp;In the process of replacing the motherboard, I also replaced the BIOS battery. &nbsp;To fix the 0x00000116 error, I manually deleted my SLI graphics card drivers, and used a driver cleaner
 program to remove any remaining nvidia drivers. &nbsp;I then installed the latest nVidia GeForce drivers, and I haven't seen that error again. &nbsp;Now, on my new motherboard, the BIOS is doing the same strange stuff as my old motherboard. &nbsp;It will only retain BIOS
 settings if the PSU is plugged in and powered on. &nbsp;If I unplug or flip the on/off switch on the back, the bios always reverts to default. &nbsp;If I try to overclock at all, it fails instantly like my old motherboard (I didn't mention that earlier, but it never
 did overclock like others with the same hardware were able to). &nbsp;A few months ago, my new motherboard would not retain any settings even if the unit remained plugged in. &nbsp;I ran Memtest 86+ for 7 days on my new motherboard, and the RAM is fine. &nbsp;I ran Prime95,
 and it would trigger the 0x00000116 error, but not after I fixed that BSOD driver conflict error. &nbsp;How could two motherboards have the same problem? &nbsp;I tested my PSU, and it outputs the correct voltages (850 watt Corsair). &nbsp;Today, my new motherboard was unplugged,
 and when I plugged it in the BIOS reported "BIOS Checksum failed." &nbsp;I accidently booted it with the wrong settings, and I received BSOD error 0x00000050. &nbsp;I flashed the BIOS, and it still will not retain settings (as mentioned, I replaced the battery). &nbsp;Anyone
 know what's wrong?<br />

As you have already replaced the Mother board and battery, the issue seems to be with the hardware. I would suggest you to contact your computer manufacturer for better support.</span>

</p><p>I built this computer myself, and I am on an extremely limited budget.&nbsp; Some of my BSOD errors were software/driver issues.&nbsp; I'm not positive myself that this is only hardware.&nbsp; Any idea's about what needs to be replaced would help me.</p>

            <p><span>Hi Erik,</span><span><br />
<br />
The error 0X00000116 is usually caused by video card. But as per the description provided by you have already updated your video card drivers.
<br />
<br />
</span><span>I would also suggest you to post the event viewer logs here, so that we can check it and identify the exact issue.
<br />
<br />
<br />
Refer these steps:<br />
<br />
</span></p>
<p>a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Go to the Start Screen, type in Event Viewer. This will bring up the Event Viewer tile, Click to open the event viewer.
<br />
b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the left pane, expand out Windows Logs. Click on Application log and highlight the first event in the log and use your arrow keys to scroll down.<br />
c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of your event will be Information. You may see Yellow Warnings or Red Errors. If you see any red error, you can double click on it to bring it up and copy the contents to a document.<br />
<br />
</p>
<span>&nbsp;Hope this helps. If the issue remains unresolved, please get back to us and we’d be happy to help.</span>

</p><p>I checked the event viewer.&nbsp; Nothing of use showed up.&nbsp; Only the Critical report that the system had rebooted without shutting down properly.&nbsp; The system now is restarting without BSOD automatically, and the crash dump initialization fails to make a mini
 dump.&nbsp; Seems like power supply, I don't know.</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Check with both the Motherboard Maker's Support and the memory maker's support.<br />
And it is even possible the video card (if not on the motherboard) is involved, as well<br />
as other hardware.<br />
<br />
Over-clocking significantly adds to instability and heat related issues.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

<p><strong>References to Vista also apply to Windows 7. <br />
<br />
</strong>This is my generic how to for proper driver updates : (update video driver and BIOS).<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView - set VIEW to
<br />
Hide Microsoft drivers - update those without Dump in their names. (Also update&nbsp;the BIOS
<br />
and chipset drivers.)<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free - utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system.<br />
For each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver,<br />
description, version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a>&nbsp;<br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model<br />
of your video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click
<br />
Update Driver (this may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right
<br />
Click - Uninstall - REBOOT this will refresh the driver stack. <br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party<br />
with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have. <br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples) (as rollback) and then Device<br />
Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for<br />
BIOS, Chipset and software updates at System Maker's site while there.) <br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them - Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after<br />
each installation. <br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually<br />
shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers<br />
particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as<br />
needed. <br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at Device Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check<br />
manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

Installing and updating drivers in Windows 7 (manually updating using the methods above are<br />
preferred to ensure the latest updated versions of the drivers are found at the system maker<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows<br />
Updates, this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually<br />
be older and cause issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it)<br />
and then go look for new ones manually if you wish. <br />

<strong>Memory issues are NOT usually the cause of this Bug_Check though it is possible.<br />
</strong><br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even for
<br />
sticks that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system behind
<br />
slower memory. So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for those even if all<br />
memory tests fail to show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

<strong>1.</strong> Check with ASUStek Support, their on-line documentation and drivers, and ask in their<br />
forums about any known issues. Update the BIOS, low level chipset drivers, and the<br />
major on-board and separate device drivers (see driver update methods below - note<br />
there are a lot of old drivers on your system).<br />
</p>
<br />
BiosVersion = ASUS A8N-SLI Premium ACPI BIOS Revision 1303<br />
BiosReleaseDate = <strong>08/10/2006&nbsp;</strong> &lt;--- BIOS is pretty old&nbsp;as are the chipser drivers and others.&nbsp;<br />

</p><p>Thanks Spirit MS.&nbsp; My drivers appear outdated, sadly they are the latest available.&nbsp; My BIOS is the newest version on Asus, I flashed it awhile ago.&nbsp; My chipset is nForce 4, no Win 7 drivers were released.&nbsp; Only Vista.&nbsp; I ran Memtest for 7 days, no errors.&nbsp;
 I'm not overclocking.&nbsp; I really just need to buy a new computer, if I could replace one part to fix this problem, I would.&nbsp; It seems the PSU and graphic cards and maybe the RAM are bad.&nbsp; I already replaced the motherboard.&nbsp; Unless there is one part that could
 fix this, it looks as if there is not much I can do with this computer.&nbsp; Sometimes the computer restarts without even making a dump.&nbsp; That's new, and that indicates PSU.&nbsp; However, what makes a new motherboard with a new battery revert to stock settings when
 PSU power is disconnected?&nbsp; It has symptoms like my old motherboard, not retaining settings.</p>

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
Well you need to check with ASUStek Support and their forum about that settings issue.<br />
<br />
Run Driver View as I indicated above (exactly how) and check the various device makers'</p>
<p>sites for even newer version of those drivers.<br />
<br />
Uninstall any of those old programs and drivers you really don't need.<br />
<br />

    <title>Windows 10 sudden unactivated. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> champfish  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 sudden unactivated.</h2>
                    I had a Windows 8 OEM laptop that I upgraded to 10. Everything worked fine, but now suddenly in settings under Activation I am getting "Windows can't activate right now. Try activating again later. If that doesn't work, contact support. Error code: 0x80070005".
 When I open images with the photos app I get a "No applicable app license found." Similarly voice recorder is not recording anything (but Discord detects my voice fine). I am on the Windows Previewer version&nbsp;Windows 10 Core (10.0.10586.29) 64 bit. The only
 thing I have done recently that I can think of is install Windows Movie Maker.&nbsp;Any help would be appreciated.
