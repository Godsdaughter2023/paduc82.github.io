<h2>            Absolute power corrupts absolutely&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>First of all we are all gamers.Second we are humans.Put yourself in &nbsp; my shoes.I am a 30 years and I'm playing in the night when I arrive home with my friends and with my wife.i had xbox 360 for 3 years and an xbox one from day one,I paid xbox live for 6
 years and over 100 games.Well done microsoft you got my money! &nbsp;2 Months ago I ordered an xbox elite from microsoft store and I was very happy. Good.2 days ago I went to sleep and forget my xbox turned on .I see the light in the morning and push the power
 to switch off the xbox.In the evening I switch the xbox on I was very excited to play The division beta in the 18 .Know my xbox i shows an error code.xbox live had problems these days and I've restarted the router. OK that doesn't work.Next restart the console.Next
 factory Setting.Ok the xbox ask for first day update another error,OK check connection and it shows console banned!Now you guys tell me I've been robbed for thousands of dollars by this corporation or no?OK don't answer that I know we live in a free world
 on paper but actually freedom of speech and rights doesn't exist anymore!Every microsoft call ,every support chat (dozens ),twiter or any chanel I use ,I was send to Enforcement Team.Ok first of all at check console doesn't have a box for Xbox One.Second you
 can not contact never and you can not receive an explanation or email from xbox or Microsoft. The enforcement team forum is closed.So we live in an Kim Jong IL dictatorship like world where some desk mouse can rob you of your hard worked money and not even
 give you a reason or a thank you note for helping paying their salaries. &nbsp; &nbsp;I never engaged in conversation with other players only my adult friends,I never entered an argument, I never cheated or did something wrong,I never did nothing only give them money!Put
 in my shoes and after you judge! &nbsp;My question that you can answer freely is I'm gone buy another xbox I have a guarantee they don't gone be robbed again and get banned.My account has a perfect record!</p>

<p>the only people that can assist you are in the enforcement forums, the post will not go live straight away as they have to approve them, if the console has been banned but not your profile then you have not lost anything, if your profile has been banned
 then you lose everything, im not judging as i don't know what you might have done but they don't ban for no good reasons, when you open the xbox and make a profile you are agreeing to there terms of use and if banned will lose access to all licences for the
 content purchased as we don't own any games.</p>

<p>Absolutely! </p>
<p>It's a Dog eat dog world where Bussiness subjects are consumers or Gov subjects are citizens (both spelled with a lower case c.) are born, live and die all the while wearing Milk Bone underwear.</p>
<p>Few examples here in the US. </p>
<p>1) We have The Right to fine you for catching rain water.</p>
<p>2) We have The Right to Fine you for downing The Kings Deer out of season and without a licence.
</p>
<p>Don't matter if you have NO access to 'city water.' Nor that the deer would have helped feed you and yours for a month.
</p>
<p>Bussiness. </p>
<p>1) We have The Right to track everything you say and do, even in your own home simply because you bought and used our product.
</p>
<p>2) We have a Right to sell your info to other companies. </p>
<p>Now that that's out of the way and you now realize that you have no rights, freedoms or liberties. Lets move on to your console bann.</p>
<p>Why do you feel that the bann was in error? </p>

<p>They normally&nbsp; ban xbox ones if there have been several accounts on that console all getting suspensions.</p>
<p>That may not be the reason but there is a reason,they don't just ban consoles for the fun of it.</p>

<p>I'd also like to inform you that the Xbox Live service is a service, through and through, and as such you are subject to its Code of Conduct and Terms of Use, just like with any other service that is provided. You don't have the same freedoms you may have
 as a citizen of whatever country you may come from, because the service is not your country of origin - far from it, in fact. To use their service, you must agree to their terms, rules, and regulations, which you have already done, since that's part of the
 process of signing up to Xbox Live. Since you have, by your own admission, been banned, then that means you have likely violated those terms, so you have been terminated from the service. As a company, Microsoft has the right to refuse service (with a few
 minor stipulations, regarding human rights, of course) and has simply done so with you. That's really all there is to it.</p>

<p>Lol,nice one "it must be a reason ,they don't ban consoles for the fun of it"! Remember this : one account all this year's never signed a second account on my new console.My account has a perfect record and is fine.I can even join enforcement team beta after
 verification. The last xbox one I had it for 2 years,not even a minor problem!This xbox elite just for two months.It doesn't &nbsp;work not even offline now so all of you think I must done some wrongful act,But if I didn't &nbsp;,if there are many more like me?if you
 are next?if this can happen to anyone? Others tell us what to think these days,what is righteous and what is wrong. I tell you guys again I never done anything wrong &nbsp;,I'm gone fight it ,Lucky &nbsp;for me I'm in Europe where we still have rights and where microsoft
 has been fined billions! &nbsp; Finally an exercise for the mind;Buy a car ,after 2 Months is dead .You can not repair the car elsewhere, and the dealership won't give you a reason,but now You have rust bucket without breaking any rule!

<p>The problem I am having with all this is the "banned for no reason"... &nbsp;everyone is an innocent victim. OP, maybe you did not cheat but could someone else have used your console while you were not around? There is always two sides to a story.</p>

            Hi MicrosoftHasAbandonedItsUsers 
<br />
<br />The ideal way to do that would be to set up a mobile phone on a tripos and use a group call to stream the wedding to the other users, but you say you do not want to conference call - that really is the way to do this . . .
<br />
<br />Another option would be to create a group on WhatsApp and stream the wedding from a Mobile Phone to that group . . .
<br />
<br />Either way, you need to create some sort of group video call to accomplish this. .

<p>A conference call is not an option so of the people involved have not spoken to each other in a long time the results might be close to wwiii.</p>
<p>Is it possible to use the same account for multiple simultaneous call, 4 phones one for each remote viewer. The problem with WhatsApp is that the remote are in Canada and I am in NZ and some of the remotes are not computer savvy.</p>

            I also lost sound, after a windows update. I ran trouble shooters and it showed nothing wrong. Then I checked and found that my sound card was disabled and drivers were removed. Contacted Microsoft and they sent me a site to go to. When I went to the site
 they wanted $49.95 for their program to fix it. Why should we pay when Microsoft updates caused the problem? I am still talking to them and they say buy the program. I think after this I will get a MAC or Apple and not use any programs that come from Microsoft.
 Good luck. Hope someone can come up with a fix that does not cost. I live off disability and can not afford to buy a fix. Again, Microsoft should pay to fix our computors since they are the cause of the problems......

<p>&nbsp;As for this, this is more of the MANUFACTURERS fault. They should tell you or put in a program that tells you there are updates for your computer's driver. Although,&nbsp;microsoft is partially to blame. They shouldn't try to capatalize off the incompatibility
 of drivers when there is a free way.</p>
<hr />
<p>Anyway...</p>
<p>The EASY way, OTHER, than the restoring your computer to it's last know good configuration:</p>
<p><span>Sound Card FIX:</span></p>
<p><span>Start&gt;Control Panel&gt;Device Manager&gt;Sounds&gt;look for HD Audio (If you are not sure which one your sound card is&nbsp;post the options and I will tell you which one.)</span></p>
<p><span>Write down description make and model, double click on it, go to the&nbsp;drivers tab, write down version.</span></p>
<p><span>Right Click&nbsp;on it and UNINSTALL&nbsp;and restart the computer this will rebuild the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Go to&nbsp;the manufacturers&nbsp;site and look for the&nbsp;latest driver Download for your sound card. (You should know the sound card name, if you wrote down the info above), When you find it download it:&nbsp;SAVE&nbsp;IT DO NOT HIT RUN(Save it to your desktop for easy access.
 Go to the file you have just saved and&nbsp;right click on it&nbsp;and select&nbsp;RUN AS ADMIN(Now install it.).&nbsp;RESTART after each driver installation.<br />
<br />
Something else I found out:</span></p>
<p><span>Sound drivers often rollback, so check to make sure the version you just installed is still there. If not, keep installing the driver untill it sticks, it really shouldn't take more that three
 times</span></p>

<p>Grosso modo, you installed something that upset your sound set up.</p>
<p>If you have to install a sound device driver 3 times something is seriously wrong. Here's an alternative to the B/S above :</p>
<p>* Download this :</p>
http://www.piriform.com/ccleaner&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; then :<br />
<p>* Un-install ANY reference to your sound device in the HardWare Manager.</p>
<p>* Run Ccleaner, but click on the Registry option, then scan for issues. Because you've "deleted" your sound device drivers it will probably find the ____ (the C in it's name) left over. You can safely delete what it finds. Save before final deleting, you
 can always restore if a problem arises. Run your antivirus.</p>
<p>* Download and install XP specific drivers for your sound evice.</p>

<p>Yes yes yes !</p>
<p>Your comment is pure B/S</p>
<p>I've used Ccleaner since god fell of the bus, and NEVER had a problem. On Xp, and currently on W7 x64 !!!</p>
<p>BTW, you can, if you choose, delete only what you want with this programme. So you can rub out ONLY those references to your sound device, not other proposals.</p>
<p>I would agree however, that some OTHER registry cleaners have potential to do dammage, but this one does not because of its restore capabilities.</p>
<p>Installing a sound device driver 3 times : well, you risk having all sorts of ____ (ie left over file entries) in your registry. So using Ccleaner is a viable option. Let the OP decide.</p>

<p>Yes yes yes !</p>
<p>Your comment is pure B/S</p>
<p>I've used Ccleaner since god fell of the bus, and NEVER had a problem. On Xp, and currently on W7 x64 !!!</p>
<p>BTW, you can, if you choose, delete only what you want with this programme. So you can rub out ONLY those references to your sound device, not other proposals.</p>
<p>I would agree however, that some OTHER registry cleaners have potential to do dammage, but this one does not because of its restore capabilities.</p>
<p>Installing a sound device driver 3 times : well, you risk having all sorts of ____ (ie left over file entries) in your registry. So using Ccleaner is a viable option. Let the OP decide.</p>
<p>Also, sound device drivers do not roll back unless you tell them to. Where did you get hold of that one ? One simple re-install should suffice. If not, you've got corruption somewhere.</p>

Did I say install it three times?</p>
<p>No, no I did not.</p>
<p>I said, if you go back and check your driver, and the version, you JUST installed wasn't there. Reboot and install it again.</p>
<p>If it doesn't stick after THREE times, then we will try OTHER troubleshooting steps.</p>
<p>A registry scan/clean being on the LOWEST and LAST option.</p>
<p>I would rather use a system restore that have something scan my registry, then go through and manually delete the ones I'm supposed to. What happens if&nbsp;I accidentally delete one?</p>
<p>I would have to take the "Looser option" and Reinstall windows.</p>
<p>Sound drivers roll back. I have TWO computer shop owners that can vouch for&nbsp;this, AND the post that I actually got my Sound Card fix from.</p>
<p>As for registry cleaners, no I'm sorry I do not even think Ccleaner is good.</p>
<p>I have seen what happens when non-experianced users use it and accidentally delete data in their registry.</p>
<p>This is like SOMEWHAT like&nbsp;attempting to run a dskchk. (I used to think this was all good and fine, but it's NOT)</p>
<p>There is NO need to edit the registry, nor scan the registry.</p>
<p>Unless my above method DOES NOT work. Even then, I still wouldn't use a registry scanner/cleaner.</p>
<p>Just because it worked for YOU does not mean it works for ALL.</p>

<h3> mesonak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Stuck in Reboot Loop</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Recently, I have been unable to install Windows 10 updates; every time I restart the computer to install them, it reboots saying that it was unable to install the updates and that I have been reverted to a previous version of Windows 10. However, today,
 the problem has worsened substantially; upon turning on my computer today, I appear to be trapped in a boot loop, where the computer will never fully boot itself to a login screen, but rather continually shut down, restart, attempt to boot, and shut down again.
 I have uploaded a video of the process so you can see for yourself (it is mostly just loading screens).
<a href="https://youtu.be/4yBPVZz9e1o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">That video can be found here.</a><div class="AnswersExternalContent"><div class="video-container"><object aria-label="video player"><param name="movie" value="https://www.youtube.com/v/4yBPVZz9e1o?fs=1"></param><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true"></param><param name="allowscriptaccess" value="sameDomain"></param><embed src="https://www.youtube.com/v/4yBPVZz9e1o?fs=1" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowscriptaccess="sameDomain" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object></div></div></p>
<p>
</p><p>I'd greatly appreciate some insight regarding this, but more importantly, I'd like to know of any way possible to salvage my files on the computer. I can't afford to lose them, and as I'm seemingly unable to boot into safe mode or repair my computer in any
 way, I'm a bit lost as to my recourse to save my files.&nbsp;</p>

            Hey Mesonak,
<br />
<br />I think I can help you the front of salvaging your files. Greg Carmak has a *brilliant* article on how to salvage your files: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/rescue-files-when-windows-wont-start/862c143f-9239-4e63-8968-635e8ba9efd6">https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/for...</a>
<br />
<br />Depending on the size collective of your files, I recommend you get a flash drive greater than 8 GB. If you do not have a 32 GB or larger flash drive, FAT32 has limitations on storing files, like if a file is greater than 4 GB, it won't store it. exFAT would be a perfect counter for this, maybe the Media Creation Tool would handle this.
<br />
<br />Otherwise, follow that article. Go on another computer, use the Media Creation Tool to prepare your installation media, boot into the Windows 10 installation media, head into Command Prompt (once you see the welcome screen, you hit SHIFT + F10), run "notepad.exe", then navigate to File &gt; Open, then navigate through your files, cut any files you want to salvage, then paste it into the flash drive.
<br />
<br />Best of luck, Mesonak. Hopefully you can salvage those files.       
        </p>

            Hi Mesonak, try these options from the Windows Recovery Environment - they will all preserve your files . . .
<br />
<br />Start your PC, just as Windows attempts to load (spinning dots), press and hold Power Button for 5 - 10 seconds to perform a Hard Shut Down 
<br />
<br />Do this twice 
<br />
<br />On the third start Windows will boot into the Recovery Environment and from there you can access System Repair, Safe Mode, Command Prompt . . . etc. 
<br />
<br />Please try each option one at a time, then see of Windows will boot . . . 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Repair 
<br />See if Windows startup can repair itself 
<br />
<br />Go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - System Restore 
<br />Check to see if you have a restore point you can go back to 
<br />
<br />If you do not have a Restore Point, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Option - Startup Settings and click Restart 
<br />Upon restart, press 4 to enter Safe Mode 
<br />Once in Safe Mode, backup your data if you do not already have a backup 
<br />Open Device Manager and check to make sure all your Drivers are up to date 
<br />Reboot to see if Windows will start Normally 
<br />
<br />If the above fails, go to Troubleshoot - Advanced Options - Reset this PC 
<br />Choose to keep your files and apps, just your files or to keep nothing 
<br />Then start the Reset

            Power on and off your computer three times
<br />
<br />How do you do that?
<br />
<br />Power on, when you see the Windows Logo - power off
<br />
<br />Power on, when you see the Windows Logo - power off
<br />
<br />Power on, it will then your computer will boot into the Advanced Recovery environment
<br />
<br />You might be asked to sign in with your Microsoft Account or Local Account password. 
<br />
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />Click Troubleshoot
<br />Click Advanced Options
<br />
<br />Click System Restore, see if you can go back to an earlier time.
<br />
<br />If not, boot into the recovery environment again, then try performing a startup repair.
<br />
<br />If that does not work, boot into the recovery environment, then click 'Go back to previous version of Windows'
<br />
<br />If that does not work.
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

            Hi Toni.   I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Have you updated the latest Display, Webcam, Chipset, BIOS and all other drivers from the PC or device Support Downloads web page.  This can make a big difference on lags or freezes.  
<br />
<br />Otherwise you can go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

    <title>Sort files AND folders by &#34;Date Modified&#34; in File Explorer - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Sort files AND folders by &#34;Date Modified&#34; in File Explorer</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there a way to sort folders and individual files by "Date Modified" together? Right now, when I sort by "Date Modified," folders are automatically put at the bottom below files, even if they have been modified more recently than a file. When I'm quickly
 scanning a list, this is very distracting. How can I fix this?</p>

<p>There is no option in Explorer to sort folders with files for any property in a regular Explorer view. So your options are:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>A third-party file manager that has this option.</li><li>PowerShell: using a command like:<br />
<strong>gci | sort LastWriteTime</strong></li><li>Using Explorer's Search bar</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>If you type an asterisk (*) in the Search bar of an Explorer window, the results will be all files and folders in the folder
<em>as well as all subfolders</em>. But you can then use <strong>Group by -&gt; Folder Path</strong> and right-click
<em>on a Group heading</em> and select <strong>Collapse all groups</strong> and then expand only your target folder. As with a normal Explorer view, column headers in Detail view can be clicked to sort on that column.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>All users that are allowed to share need to have account on<strong> all the computers</strong> that they are allowed to connect to.</p>
<p>User accounts are set and edited via Control Panel / Users Accounts.</p>

<p>Once the user has an account his name will appear in the Permission configuration Window.</p>

<p><strong>Permission and Security issues with Vista/Win7, check the <strong>following</strong> settings.</strong></p>
<p>Point to the a Folder that meant to&nbsp; to be share. Right click and choose properties.</p>

<p><strong>In both the Security panel, and the Permission panel you have to highlight each User/Group and examine that the Permission Controls are checked correctly.</strong></p>
<p>When everything is OK, Reboot the Network (Router, and computer).</p>

<p><strong>**Note</strong> . All users that are allowed to share need to have account on<strong> all the computers</strong> that they are allowed to connect to.</p>
<p><strong>Everyone</strong> is an account, it means a group of all of the users that already have an account and been established as users. It is available to avoid the need of configuring permission to each on its own, it does not mean<strong> Everyone</strong>

<h2>            Windows Installer - Preparing to install opening on clicking &#39;Documents&#39; folder</h2>
                    <p>Whenever I open 'File Explorer' and open 'Documents', Windows Installer opens up trying to install something but I don't know what. It continues to load and on clicking cancel it keeps showing 'Cancelling'. This in turn makes the 'Documents' folder 'Not
 Responding'. This can be stopped only by closing the 'File Explorer' which abruptly closes the Installer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not able to access my 'Documents' folder because of this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried all solutions mentioned in&nbsp;https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-performance/windows-installer-preparing-to-install-pop-up/f1135a38-efbd-49e6-ade0-0ab37da78dc3 by Mohammed_Imran. None of them worked.</p>

            <p>Not sure if this is still a problem for you, but I figured it out.&nbsp; </p>
<p>More steps are needed.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp; Open up the control panel the old fashioned way or do the windows key + x and type in control.exe.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>Typing in <strong>/name Microsoft.Mouse didn't work for me, so I probably did something wrong.&nbsp;
</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp; I just typed Mouse in the search bar in the control panel. You should see Mouse with several options -- I clicked the change mouse settings link. (I'm fully aware this is the slower way to access it, but it worked, that's all I care about).</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.&nbsp; Once the Mouse Properties Window opens, select the Pointers Tab.&nbsp; &nbsp; Under the Section that reads "Customize" -- find the pointer you want to change and select it.&nbsp; Then click browse and give it a minute for the icons to display in the list as well as
 the file names.&nbsp; </p>
<p>
</p><p>For me, the normal arrow pointer and link select "hand" icons are ridiculously small, so these are the 2 examples I&nbsp;will use.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.&nbsp; Example 1: The default link select pointer (white arrow) is aero_arrow (I think).&nbsp; I browsed to aero_arrow_l (they give you a preview of the size in the Browse window).&nbsp; I'm assuming this means aero_arrow_large.&nbsp; There's also an xl that's even bigger.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Example 2:&nbsp; The default link select pointer (hand pointing) is aero_link (I think).&nbsp; I browsed to aero_link_l (they give you a preview of the size in the Browse window).&nbsp; I'm assuming this means areo_link_large.&nbsp; There's also an xl that's even bigger.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't know that I care to bother with the other pointer options at this point, but hopefully if you want to do the others, there's a large version of the icon that you can browse to and find.&nbsp;

<p>I used to have a very effective workstation running Windows 7.</p>
<p>I foolishly clicked the wrong button on the insistent daily hectoring messages to change to W10.</p>
<p>This has been a disaster.</p>
<p>I cannot use my work station.</p>
<p>I cannot use my software.</p>
<p>I desperately need to exterminate Windows Ten and revert to Windows 7.</p>
<p>Even my mouse arrow is virtually invisible so I cannot do anything with my workstation.</p>
<p>I followed the steps you Ashish Sondhi gave me - and the result:</p>
<p>Windows cannot find control.exe/name Microsoft.Mouse</p>
<p>I cannot give you the screen dumps as you helpfully do not provide this ability.</p>
<p>Help please before I go crazy.</p>

<p>Hello, first time poster</p>
<p>I have a Samsung Ultrabook running windows 7 with a 1TB Seagate external HDD which contains every single information and media whereas I only install programs on the laptop itself due to its low 128GB SSD. One day I decided to plug my external HDD to my
 tv directly through usb to watch a movie, while accessing a specified folder, the tv froze and couldn’t do anything else, so I unplug the HDD and restart the tv and no longer watched the movie. The next day I plug the external HDD to my laptop and one of the
 folders is showing a blank page icon with 0 bytes of data and it’s type is File and when double clicked, prompts to choose a program to open this file. All other files and folders are intact but realized they all have a file in them called “desktop.ini” and
 all my songs show their album art picture next to it.</p>
<p>Extra piece of information to know is that my external HDD is partitioned into A, B, C. and every partition has a list of folders with subfolders in them. So the folder that is showing a blank icon is in partition A and is also the partition that has the
 “desktop.ini” in every folder.</p>
<p>Now I am very sure that the files inside the blank icon folder are still there because the remaining space on that partition is still the same and a recovery software is still showing them but under a different hidden folder name with all the original sub-folder
 names. It is showing them under directory: A:\found.000\dir0000.chk\Original Subfolder name\, where “found.000\dir0000.chk” is the directory I don’t know. And the recovery software “Piriform Recuva” is showing them as Not Deleted, so I can’t recover them.
 So I think that just the folder’s directory is corrupted.</p>
<p>I have tried and delete IconCache from AppData – Local and restart computer thinking it was an icon issue but didn’t work.</p>
<p>Now the main reason I said all these is if someone can help me in recovering that folder and be able to access it as its content are important.</p>
<p>Thank for your help in advance and appreciate it.</p>

<p>If you cannot access the folder, how do you know this contents still exist?</p>
<p>
</p><p>About the contents of C:\Found.000: The files in there are all of the same size and do not resemble the original files in any way. In my many years of working with Windows I have seen anyone who was able to make use of these files. You need to restore the
 lost files from your external backup.</p>

            I believe if you read my first post, you would have a better understanding, because i stated i am having this problem on my external HDD. The reason i know why it's content still exist is because the software Recuva still shows them under the section of
 "NOT DELETED" and is showing them under the directory&nbsp;<span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><span>A:\found.000\dir0000.chk\Original Subfolder name\ with its with it's correct subfolder name and size. Another
 reason is that the folder is of huge size and the remaining space on the&nbsp;partition&nbsp;is not affected. So if it was to get corrupted and deleted, i would have more free space but i have the same amount of space before the problem started.&nbsp;</span></span></span>

            Before the mentioned situation, it was just a normal folder where i can enter and view my university documents. But now it is a white page icon, Type: File, Size: 0 bytes. and when double clicked, it opens the menu where to choose what program to open
 this file type.

<p>This means that the entity is no longer a folder but a file. It therefore cannot contain any files. The fact that the disk space is still used suggests either of these:</p>
<ul>
<li>The files are now stored in the folder A:\Found.000 in a fairly useless form.</li><li>There are lost clusters which the next run of chkdsk will clean up.</li></ul>
<p>If your recovery software is unable to retrieve any files then I see these options for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. Rename the strange file by adding some suffix of your choice. <br />
2. Create a folder with exactly the name of the original folder.<br />
3. While in Windows Explorer, right-click this folder.<br />
4. Left-click <em>Restore previous version.</em></li><li>Restore the files from your external backup. If you did not believe in regular backups until now then this is a good time to review your backup policy. Lots of people change their view after suffering a major disaster.</li></ul>

 (Recommended) setting in Folder Options of Windows Explorer. and then the folder&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">found.000</span><span style="color: rgba(20, 20, 20, 1)">&nbsp;appeared.
 i changed its security permission to allow to take full control of the folder and renamed it back to the original folder's name and thankfully it worked. the folder is now accessible with all my original sub-folders in it with all their original files, is
 like nothing ever happened. once thank you for your assistance.</span>

            <p>Hello Mike,</p>
<p>The bottom line is that you need the Webcam application to use the camera. Do this, go to
<a href="http://support.toshiba.com/drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.toshiba.com/drivers</a>&nbsp;and input your C660 model in the part number box, and when the list of applications and drivers shows up, select "Camera" from that list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That'll bring up the Toshiba Web Camera Application which is all inclusive driver and application. Download and install the application and have at it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let me know if this fixes the issue for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>BearPup</p>

                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Skype for Business Basic installed through my Microsoft 365 subscription.&nbsp; I am trying to make calls to an outside organization and the dial pad and other Skype options are not visible in the desktop application.&nbsp; It appears that the program has limited
 capabilities compared to previous versions that I have used.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How do I make calls and share my screen with outside users using a Skype for Business Basic account?&nbsp; I've changed the settings in the Admin panel of the office 365 site to communicate with outside organizations but it still isn't working.&nbsp; It keeps referring
 me to Microsoft Teams as well but I'd prefer to use Skype.</p>

</p><p>You mentioned that you want use the dial pad to call other users, do you mean you want to&nbsp;<span>call regular phones or&nbsp;</span><span>other Skype for Business users? If you mean you want to

    <title>Unknown Charges - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> o infect3d o  say:</h3>
<h2>            Unknown Charges</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I just purchased a new Slim Xbox 360 and when I went to download some old DLC I realized that a lot of my Microsoft Points were missing (I just activated a 4,000-point card last month). I logged onto both xbox.com and billing.microsoft.com and they both
 show several downloads that I never purchased.</p>
<p><strong>10/13/11 - Battlefield: Bad Company 2 (-1,600)</strong></p>
<p>I now realize I was missing 1,600, just never noticed because of the extra 4,000 I had added. I have no need to own this game, I played it enough when I owned the disc.</p>
<p><strong>11/1/11 - Shotguns Launch Collection Weapon Skin - Gears of War 3 (-1,200)</strong></p>
<p><strong>11/1/11 - Cerberus Network - Mass Effect 2 (-1,200)</strong></p>
<p><strong>11/1/11 - Horde Command Pack - Gears of War 3 (-800)</strong></p>
<p><strong>11/1/11 - Mark of the Assassin - Dragon Age II (-800)</strong></p>
<p>I have never played Gears of War 3 or Dragon Age II (my Recent Games will show that) and I know 100% that I never downloaded the Cerberus Network for Mass Effect 2.</p>
<p>Thinking about it now, recently (probably around 11/1) I was forced to change passwords when trying to access one of Microsoft's sites. Does this mean I was hacked? Or was there a glitch with the system? I haven't noticed anything else wrong with my account
 so far.</p>
<p>Not really sure where to go from here, any help would be much appreciated.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>It seems to me that your account was compromised. I would suggest contacted xbox customer support and filing a fraud claim for the purchases. Your account will be taken for approximately 25 days while your account is investigated, but they will be able to
 determine whether or not the purchases were made by you, and will grant refunds as necessary.</p>

<h2>            Xbox One Downloading Games Much Slower Than Network Speed</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>

<p>Just wondering if anybody had any experience where your console downloads much slower than the network speed?</p>

<p>I've tested my <span style="text-decoration-line: underline">wired</span> connection on my xbox and its download speed is 62Mbps and I've been downloading the Elder Scrolls Online (55GB) for 5 hours now but its only got to 21% even though at my network speed it
 should only take 2-3 hours to download. I've tried resetting my xbox and router but there's no improvement.</p>

<p>Anyone know of any fixes as this is a complete joke at the minute</p>

<p>Xbox live uses content delivery networks to distribute downloads and updates.</p>
<p>What country are you in?</p>
<p>There is currently a problem with some of the CDN servers in the UK that give pathetic download speeds. The problem has existed for weeks now.</p>
<p>Your DNS settings determine what CDN server you connect to.</p>
<p>If I use my ISPs DNS it connects me to a faulty server which means extremely slow downloads. A couple of weeks ago it took nearly 3 hours to download a system update.</p>
<p>So if you are currently experiencing extremely slow downloads you should cancel the download then try a different DNS server. You can change DNS in the network settings app.</p>
<p>A couple of DNS servers you can try are </p>
<p>Google DNS and openDNS</p>
<p>For google enter 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4 in the primary and secondary dns slots</p>
<p>And for openDNS try 208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220</p>
<p>You need to restart the console after changing the DNS.</p>

<p>Hi guys,</p>
<p>Thanks for the responses, managed to fix it.</p>
<p>My router had assigned my Xbox One a IPv6 primary DNS even though the router itself had IPv6 connections disabled. I was unable to change the DNS setting on the console as it kept reverting to the IPv6 DNS so had to go into my router using TelNet and make
 a few changes using that to redisable the IPv6.</p>
<p>Xbox One now has the IPv4 DNS servers and is now working much quicker.</p>

<h2>            Change Defult Storage Location</h2>
                    <div>
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I recently purchased a new computer where the hard drive is partitioned into a smaller C drive which is just a boot drive and larger D drive which is meant for everything else. I am having trouble because the C drive is the default drive for installation
 of new programs, saving user files, etc. but my C drive does not have sufficient space for this. While some programs allow me to choose an alternative address for installation, other programs do not and just use the default drive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried switching the default under Setting/System/Storage, but the problem persists. I also tried manually editing the program directory via Regedit, but this just caused problems when trying to install new programs as the installations would crash.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would be very grateful for any advice anyone can offer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks!</p>

            To illustrate your problem, please open the Disk Manager (diskmgmt.msc), then use snippingtool.exe to take a snapshot of the Disk Manager frame. Save the snapshot to your desktop, then attach it to your reply.

<p>You actually have two <strong>disks</strong>: A 120 GByte disk (the System disk) and a 1,000 GByte disk (the data disk). On the System disk you have 40 GBytes free space, which is plenty for applications. To preserve this space you need to move your data
 libraries to drive D:, i.e. your Documents, Music, Pictures and Video folders.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since these are library folders you must not move them by dragging them about in File Explorer. A special technique is required. Post again if you need full details.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do not under any circumstances hack the registry. Doing so will cause serious problems.</p>

            Hi Darren
<br />
<br />With 3rd party software, some manufacturers provide you with the opportunity to choose an installation location, others do not, this cannot be changed.
<br />
<br />It is not safe to use any of the hacks that will move Program files, you will brick your System
<br />
<br />For new Windows Apps and games and be re-routed using that Settings - System Storage - Choose where new content is saved option
<br />
<br />With regards to your User library folders, you should move those you your Data drive
<br />
<br />Right click your Documents folder, choose Properties
<br />
<br />Choose the Location Tab and in the location box, type D:\Documents, then apply that and confirm the move
<br />
<br />When that completes, do the same for Pictures, Videos, Music, each time provide a different folder location, for example, Pictures will go to D:\Pictures
<br />
<br />Unless you run a huge amount of Software, that should be enough to keep your SSD managed. please Note, an SSD must be at the bare minimum 1/4 free space to be efficient

</p><p><span>Cortana is different from other apps, like Xbox, where your parents can give you permission to use it. Due to child protection laws, Cortana can’t be used by people under 13, even with parental permission.</span> .</p>
