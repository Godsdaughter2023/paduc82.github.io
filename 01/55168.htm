            <p>Are you playing the free version?</p>
<p>If so the only way to get rid of adverts is to pay for a copy.</p>

<h2>            Windows 8.1 - Update and Recovery &#62; Windows Update ... Options won&#39;t display</h2>
                    <p>OK so I updated 8.0 to 8.1 and applied all the latest updates (it has been a long time since I powered on this laptop). However now when I want to see the status, or check the history, I cannot get past the Windows 8 loader icon (the rolling balls thingy)
 ... and see any details at all. (I want to see something like this graphic: http://thewindowsclub.thewindowsclubco.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/update-and-recovery-option-1.jpg )</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anybody seen this? If so, any suggestions? I've tried these things:</p>
<p>1. Troubleshooting&nbsp;</p>
<p>- Troubleshoot as an administrator</p>
<p>- One or more Windows Update components [were] configured incorrectly - the troubleshooter "fixed" this 3x</p>
<p>2. Restarted the PC (4x, no change).</p>
<p>3. Ran Windows Defender scans:</p>
<p>- Quick scan - no issues found.</p>
<p>- Full scan - no issues found.</p>
<p>4. Changed from wireless to wired and ensured that power was plugged in.</p>
<p>5. Installed the latest updates (again).</p>
<p>6. Changed the settings to go to the Desktop instead of Start (tiles from h3ll), and other custom settings I liked from this article:&nbsp;http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-8/personalize-pc-tutorial</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other ideas? thanks!</p>

            <p>No replies from the community :(&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So here's my workaround, since Windows 8.1 Settings &gt; Change PC settings &gt;</p>
<p>1. Go to Desktop.</p>
<p>2. Right-click the Start icon (lower left) &gt; Control Panel.</p>
<p>3. Navigate to Control Panel &gt; System and Security &gt; Windows Update &gt; View update history.</p>
<p>4. Scan the Status to see if any of the updates failed. (In my case, some did.)</p>
<p>5. Click the Name header to reorder the list by update.</p>
<p>6. Scan down the list for any failed updates; ensure that they actually DID succeed.</p>
<p>(In my case, 2 updates failed once, then succeeded; a third update failed three times, then succeeded.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>So the old Windows 7 style Control Panel works, but the Windows 8.1 style Settings feature does not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will probably get on with my work for now, then when I can, later today, backup my PC (data), then try the Settings &gt; Change PC Settings &gt; Update and Recovery &gt; Recovery &gt; Refresh your PC without affecting your files. This will change all my PC settings
 back to default and remove my apps installed from disc or websites (Windows Store apps will be kept). Then I'll reinstall my apps (luckily not a lot of those).
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Wish future-me good luck!</p>

<p><span>Hi there, </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you&nbsp;for that. Going back to your query, may I know what Skype you are using now. Is it the built-in/pre-installed Skype Preview or the stand alone Skype application/Skype for Desktop?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>These two apps have different interfaces. Also, have you tried to do troubleshooting steps, like uninstall and re-install Skype application? Are you using the latest version&nbsp;of Skype?
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am using the Skype that comes with office 2016 and I have more uncool issues with it:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. It always starts with windows. There is no option, to disable that. Neither in the task manager (autostart tab), nor in the App itsself</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. When I minimzie the window, skype disappears completely. It is not in the taskbar or in the menu on the right. It simply disappears. I also do not get any notification that someone send me a message, then.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Uninstalling isn't possible. It does not appear in the Programs lists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>How can I remove it from my PC?</p>
<p>I want my old skype back!</p>
<p>This version is total crap, in my opinion, and not really usable.</p>
<p>MS shouldn't release Software, that doesn't work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Lars</p>

<p>But I found a way, to install the old skype again. :)</p>

<p>Please don't let this thread die, as I'm also having this problem!</p>
<p>I have the normal "Skype Preview" installed from Windows Store on Win10 Pro.</p>
<p>And it also keeps going offline when the windows is minimized or is in background. This is really annoying as it sometimes can take up to several hours until I notice some important message.</p>

            I am having the same issue. I hadn't noticed until I was contacted by a potential employer about an important link that he had sent that i never received. I had to log out of Skype and go back in to update the messages but they will not update on their
 own. This is severely limiting; I too am running Windows-based Skype, the issue appears to happen on my Mobile version as well. Since this question hasn't even been touched since October last year I am hoping there is some solution out there. And yes; I have
 already re-installed Skype.

<p>Yup, the app is acting up, and we can't download the software on Windows 10. </p>
<p>It's forcing us to go with the app "for a better experience". The app kinda dozes off in the background and I have to move around it to go back online? What the heck, microsoft you're Windows 10 upgrades are really ****, dangerous, and opens us up to a
 lot of threats!</p>

<p>This issue has been left unaddressed in the Skype packaged with Windows 10 since the beginning.</p>
<p>
</p><p class="contentHeader2">Skype for Windows Desktop (legacy version)</p>
<p>The legacy version for Windows Desktop always seemed to operate the way we all want it to:
<em><strong>"Online"</strong></em> -when we say we're online, and <em><strong>"Away"</strong></em> -when we CHOOSE it to show us as away. In the latest version of Skype Desktop (version 8-something), this problem ("away" -when app is in the background) has
 now surfaced there too. I uninstalled it and went back to version 7.41.0.101 which works as we want it to. You can get it online if you search for it. By doing this, I have to deal with the
<em>"Do you Want To Update Now?"</em> window at boot up, but I'd rather have that then this insipid problem with status.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have complained about this for a while online with it NEVER getting addressed. Seems like a simple thing but maybe we ask too much? I am currently looking into a different type of application that will replace Skype. Hands down, one of the dumbest bugs
 (or intended functions) I have ever seen.&nbsp;</p>

<h3> stan abk  say:</h3>
<h2>            Built-in Administrator account and user account is disabled.</h2>
                    <div>
<p>I am dealing with this terrifying problem which says <br />
"Account has been disabled. Please see your System Administrator”</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is the whole story how I reached to this critical situation:<br />
Last night my laptop went to sleep mode. When I turned it on it was frozen and was not showing me the sign in option. So I did a forceful shutdown by pressing the power button.
<br />
Next morning when I turned the laptop on and logged in with my user account it was like a whole new laptop for me like it was when I bought it.
<br />
It showed me a message: "You are logged in with temporary profile. This issue cannot be solved often. You need to sign out and sign in again." So I did sign out and sign in couple of times but I didn’t see any change. My system settings were lost.
</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>So I googled this problem and checked some articles with similar problem and did this:</div>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;1. Logged into PC with safe mode.<br />
&nbsp;2. And then I enabled the built-in administrator account using command prompt.<br />
&nbsp;3. Then I typed "whoami/ user" and copied my user accounts SID no. <br />
&nbsp;4. Then I went to registry editor. Navigated to "HKLM/SOFTWARE/microsoft/WindowsNT/Current Version/Profilelist/"<br />
&nbsp;5. There I found SID number of my user account.&nbsp; There was no any ".bak" extension in it. So I renamed it by adding ".tmp" at the end since it was a step of the article. (Here I guess I messed up my user account.)<br />
&nbsp;6. Then I exited the safe mode and logged in again. There was no any change. So I opened the command prompt and disabled built-in administrator account too.
<br />
&nbsp;7. Then I restarted the laptop. And now I can't see my user profile name and I can't even log in with administrator account since I disabled it.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:<br />
&nbsp;1. System image recovery.<br />
&nbsp;2. Enter with safe mode.<br />
&nbsp;3. Enter with safe mode and command prompt.<br />
&nbsp;4. Resetting the PC.<br />
&nbsp;5. Going back to previous build.<br />
&nbsp;6. And all advanced options in recovery mode except Factory reset since I don't want wo lose my personal data.</p>
</div>
<div>All these above listed problem takes me to one screen: "You need to log in with administrator account, but there is no any administrator account on this PC."
</div>
<div>So if you know the solution of this irritating problem, please help. <br />
</div>

            Yeah, I already tried this one. Here's what happened:<br />
When I clicked on command prompt for first time, it popped up. So I thought of enabling the built-in administrator account again by typing "net user/administrator active:yes"
<br />
But after restarting it was the same. <br />
And when I clicked on the command prompt again it says: "You need an administrator account for this but this pc doesn’t have one."<br />

                    <p>Hi, internal ide slave hd is no longer detected by XP SP3.&nbsp; It's NOT a hardware problem. The&nbsp;slave drive is fine as it boots and works when placed as Main drive.&nbsp;External usb drives are detected. My guess is its a registry problem. Have run numerous utilities
 like WinUtilities , Glary Utilities, registry cleaners/fixers but no change.&nbsp;This must be a glitch in the registry.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Any guidance would bemuch &nbsp;appreciated.</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>Please can you clarify what it is that leads you to say <strong>"hd is no longer detected"</strong>?</p>
<ul>
<li>No drive letter(s) in My Computer?</li><li>Not listed in device manager?</li><li>Not listed in Disk Management?</li></ul>
<p>Assuming that this drive was detected at one point, have you altered jumper settings and are you sure that they are now correct? You will need to check diagrams on the&nbsp;HDDs or&nbsp;refer to the drive manufacturer's website to check this.</p>
<p>Have you altered the position of the drives on the ribbon cable?</p>
<p>If you don't know how to start device manager or disk manager...</p>

            <p>Hi Tricky, YES on your 3 questions. No drive letters iin My Computer, Not listed in device manager,Not listed in Disk Management.&nbsp; I have a backup&nbsp;CLONE drive from 3 months ago which if substituted as the "Main" drive Does recognize the slave properly. However
 since then several MS windows updates have been installed, but no jumper&nbsp;changes have been made to the computer or any or any "settings" changed.&nbsp; I don't want to go back 3 months as my data has changed considerably since then.</p>
<p>Something happened within windows in the past many weeks to cause this particular problem.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>This doesn't sound like a Windows problem to me, but that doesn't mean it isn't. The fact that you say a third drive is recognised OK strengthens my belief.</p>
<p>I am going to use the terms master and slave as that is the correct terminology for two IDE drives on the same ribbon cable.
</p>
<p>Master and slave are not necessarily indicative of whether a hard drive is bootable. It is possible to boot from either, though normally the master would be the bootable drive.</p>
<p>Normally the hard disk drives are put on the primary IDE controller and optical drives on the secondary IDE controller, but this does not have to be the case.</p>
<p>Turning to the pair of drives that you are having problems with...</p>
<p>What are the brand and model numbers? How are the jumpers set for each? When answering about the jumpers please give an actual&nbsp;description rather than what you believe to be the case. When describing, do it from the point of view of looking at the back of
 the drive with the manufacturer's label on top, i.e. with the ribbon connector on the left and the power connector on the right.</p>
<p>Also, what position on the ribbon cable are they connected to (middle or end)?</p>
<p>As an example of what I would do if answering the above questions, which is a description of two old drives that&nbsp;I have just pulled out of my 'spares' box...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Western Digital Caviar 26400 on end connector of ribbon cable</p>
<p>two rows of five pins (10 in total), jumper on&nbsp;third pin&nbsp;across rows</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fujitsu MPA3035AT on middle connector of ribbon cable</p>
<p>two rows of three pins (6 in total), jumper on top row first two pins,&nbsp;jumper on third pin across rows</p>

            <p>Tricky, please pardon my late response but I have a ranch to run and had to leave the computer to take care of more critical issues.
</p>
<p>OK here are the details on my system. Computer is Sony Vaio Desktop dinosaur with 1gb memory(not expandable) pentium 4 3.2 ghz. 2 Maxtor IDE 6L200RO HD's internal master drive C: and D: partitions&nbsp;and slave drive G: and H:&nbsp;on one ribbon cable. Master has
 jumper on "Master" pin&nbsp;position. Slave has NO jumpers installed as required. Normally &nbsp;I have no need for the slave drive as it too is a clone of the master. Additional 10 that's TEN Maxtor same model drives are used for cloning the master drive to allow fast
 recovery in case of HD failure and to have a historical&nbsp; recovery possible. I only use 5 drives for recent history and those provide approx 2 to 3 months&nbsp;of history. the rest of the cloned drives go further back in time for several more months.&nbsp;There is also
 an external Maxtor USB drive for data backup XP recognizes that no problem.Also usb flash drives are detected OK. &nbsp;I had no reason to check if&nbsp; XP &nbsp;developed this particular non recognition problem with slave IDE drives until deciding to adjust partition sizes.
 That's when I discovered the problem a few days agoi in My Computer and Control Panel.&nbsp; I then began to roll back the most recent drives and discovered that XP had the same problem on all these recent clone&nbsp;drives until I rolled back 3 months and suddenly
 XP recognized the slave.&nbsp;Going further back these historical drives also show XP detecting the slave.&nbsp;This means XP developed the problem since June. I cannot afford to loose&nbsp;4 months of new programs and older program updates that I need to use but do not
 have the ability to reinstall. So I need to solve this with my current master drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The&nbsp;clones of the master are identical and&nbsp;I use a separate&nbsp;drive duplicator for cloning the master every couple of weeks&nbsp; I then replace the master with a clone to verify itegrity of the cloned drive. Need more info? just ask.</p>

<p><br />
This implies that you have to change jumper settings after cloning.</p>
<p>In order to assist I must proceed as if I had your hardware in my possession. Obviously I cannot physically examine your hardware myself, so I deliberately asked for you to supply that information objectively. Because information is missing in your reply
 (ribbon cable connector in use)&nbsp;and also not in the format I requested it,&nbsp;I can only assume that you have an unshakeable belief that you know what you are doing when it comes to changing jumpers and ribbon cable positions and&nbsp;that what you
<strong><em>think</em></strong> is the master position <em><strong>actually is</strong></em> the master position.</p>
<p>That being the case, it is not clear to me&nbsp;why the device does not show in device manager or disk manager and I can only suggest that you wait for someone with alternate ideas to respond. At which point, if they provide the solution, we will both have been
 educated.</p>

            <p>I very much appreciate your trying to help me, but I am convinced the problem is within XP and NOT elsewhere.&nbsp; As I mentioned above, the cloning is done on an external drive duplicator. There is NO jumper adjustment. In fact if jumpers were changed, the
 duplicator would NOT function and give an error message. Also as I mentioned before, the BIOS recognizes BOTH the Main AND the SLAVE. This obviously means there are no mechanical problems such as a bad cable&nbsp; or wrong jumper setting. It looks like I'll have
 to hire paid Microsoft support so some engineer can dig deep into XP to find out what's going on here.</p>

            <p>The chipmunk sound is a side-effect of speeding up audio but not fixing the pitch.&nbsp; Older versions of Movie Maker (e.g. Windows Movie Maker 2.1 on XP) would do that.&nbsp; But newer versions compensate for the video speed-up by using the correct pitch on the
 audio, not the chipmunk audio.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short, there isn't a way with the latest versions to get the high-pitched chipmunk sound on your video.&nbsp; The only way to do this would be to split the audio out separately and then use an audio editing program like Audacity to speed up the sound and increase
 the pitch accordingly.&nbsp; Then you could bring the sound back in as a music or narration file.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply but the links supplied do not seem relevant to my query about SysPart. Also these tips are for Windows 8 and 8.1 while I'm using Windows 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any further advice you can offer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: I also have a previously unresolved issue where Disk Cleanup does not work on this machine. See image below:</p>

            <p>This issue is still prevailing. Further analysis shows SYSPART actually seems to contain a duplication of everything on the regular C: Drive but I can't see where to access it to delete anything.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>This computer has 4 user profiles and in the scan, all 4 profiles are listed in C: and in SYSPART. Three profiles are listed with duplicate amounts in SYSPART and in C: Drive, while the other one strangely enough has storage in SYSPART and 0GB in the C:
 Drive. </p>
<p>
</p><p>Also to your suggestion about Disk Cleanup, I'd already mentioned (including a screenshot) above that this doesn't work on this computer.</p>

<p>Anyway, I suspect you're chasing a phantom. Where does this "Syspart" folder exist? Would it be C:\Syspart? If so, what do you see when you do this:</p>

<li>Click the Start globe.</li><li>Type <em>cmd.exe</em> into the Search box and press Enter.</li><li>Type the following command and press Enter:<br />

            <p>Yes LemP, it is a Lenovo G780 bought on amazon.com and shipped overseas to us. We haven't done a reinstall but I think they must have changed something before shipping.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe they were signs of a problem when we got it, but not being computer savvy enough to pick it up, and also not caring for the hassle of shipping it back overseas, we only acknowledged how serious it was when we started running out of space.<br />

            <p>Follow up with Frederik Long's suggestions.&nbsp; As he suggests, you may simply be misled by the way Windows Explorer reports disk usage.&nbsp; The dir command used in a Command Prompt window works more in the way most people expect.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is SysPart reported to be on the C: drive (i.e., C:\SysPart) or is it a separate (perhaps unlettered) volume?&nbsp; That is, if you run Disk Management (Click Start, type "diskmgmt.msc" (without quotes), and press Enter), is SysPart shown separately?&nbsp; Note that
 it is normal to have a small "System Reserved" partition with no drive letter.</p>
<p>

<p>
</p><p>If it turns out that there is, in fact, a real folder named C:\SysPart that duplicates most of the rest of C:\ you probably should get in touch with Lenovo support or ask on the Lenovo support forum
<a href="https://forums.lenovo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://forums.lenovo.com/</a> to learn if you can safely delete it.</p>

<h2>            WHEA_UNCORRECTABLE_ERROR and SYSTEM_SERVICE_EXCEPTION BSOD&#39;s when playing Battlefield Hardline</h2>
                    <p>I just today started having my computer freezing and BSOD'ing when playing BF:Hardline. &nbsp;I have never had any issues with it before. It's a custom built system I put together about 6 months ago, running windows 8.1. &nbsp;Everything is current, latest BIOS version,
 Nvidia Drivers, etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I pulled two .dmp files from the crashes today. &nbsp;I ran them through BlueScreenView and it points to ntoskrnl.exe and hal.dll. I was wondering if anyone else can take a look at the dump files and see if they can help me make any more sense of these issues
 and help me figure this out. &nbsp;I can't seem to get a BSOD or freeze with just normal computer use, but after about 15 minutes of playing the game then I'll get the freezing. &nbsp;Again this just randomly started today, I haven't had this issue with any other game
 or anything else. &nbsp;I just recently played all the way through Dying Light with no issues whatsoever.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I dumped my system stats from Speccy, you can view them here: </p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p><span>Thank you for letting us know your concern.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue could have occurred due to corrupt or outdated display card drivers.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I would suggest you to un-install the display card drivers from Device Manager and then install the latest Display Card Driver from NVidia website by searching the exact model.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>First, Search for the exact model of the Nvidia Driver that has been installed on your Computer. Follow the below steps:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Open the Run Command by tapping windows + R key simultaneously and type in "<strong>msinfo32</strong>".</span></p>
<p><span>2. On left side, click on "<strong>Components</strong>" and then click on "<strong>Display</strong>".</span></p>
<p><span>3. Check the exact Model of the Nvidia Display Driver and note it down.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Now you need to uninstall the driver from Device Manager. Follow the steps below:</span></p>
<p><span>1. Open the Run Command and type in "<strong>devmgmt.msc</strong>" and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span>2. Click on <strong>Display Adapter</strong></span></p>
<p><span>3. Search for Nvidia Driver, right click on that and select <strong>Uninstall</strong>.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Finally install the latest Nvidia display card driver. Please go through the below link to install latest Display Card Driver:</span></p>

=======================================<br />
<br />
Could be a driver related issue. Update your drivers manually by looking at System maker and<br />
Device maker's sites.<br />
<br />
This is&nbsp;my generic how to for proper driver updates :<br />
<br />
This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded :<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded on your system. For
<br />
each driver in the list, additional useful information is displayed: load address of the driver, description,
<br />
version, product name, company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the most current.<br />
Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down the make and complete model of your
<br />
video adapter - double click - Driver's tab - write down the version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this<br />
may not do anything as MS is far behind certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall - REBOOT<br />
this will refresh the driver stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard if 3rd party with their<br />
own software and drivers and any other major device drivers you have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and then Device Maker's site
<br />
(Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their latest versions. (Look for BIOS, Chipset&nbsp;and software
<br />
updates at System Maker's site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - REBOOT after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are installing actually shows up. This<br />
is because some drivers rollback before the latest is installed (sound drivers particularly do this) so install a<br />
driver - reboot - check to be sure it is installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - check manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
If you update drivers manually then it is a good idea to disable Driver Installations in Windows Updates,<br />
this leaves Windows Updates ON however it will not install drivers which will usually be older and cause<br />
issues. If Updates suggests a new driver then HIDE it (Right Click on it) and then go look for new ones<br />
manually if you wish.<br />

How to Do a System Restore in Vista<br />

<br />
BBCode: 7a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0x0000007a<br />
<br />
7a<br />
<br />
<strong>Cause</strong>
<p>Frequently, you can determine the cause of the KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR bug check from the error status (Parameter&nbsp;2). Some common status codes include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>0xC000009A, or STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_RESOURCES, indicates a lack of nonpaged pool resources.
</li><li>0xC000009C, or STATUS_DEVICE_DATA_ERROR, typically indicates bad blocks (sectors) on the hard disk.
</li><li>0xC000009D, or STATUS_DEVICE_NOT_CONNECTED, indicates defective or loose cabling, termination, or that the controller does not see the hard disk.
</li><li>0xC000016A, or STATUS_DISK_OPERATION_FAILED, indicates bad blocks (sectors) on the hard disk.
</li><li>0xC0000185, or STATUS_IO_DEVICE_ERROR, indicates improper termination or defective cabling on SCSI devices or that two devices are trying to use the same IRQ.
</li></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>These status codes are the most common ones that have specific causes. For more information about other possible status codes that can be returned, see the
<em>Ntstatus.h</em> file in the Microsoft Windows Driver Kit (WDK).</p>
<p>Another common cause of this error message is defective hardware or failing RAM.</p>
<p>A virus infection can also cause this bug check.</p>
Resolving the Problem
<p><em>Resolving a bad block problem:</em> An I/O status code of 0xC000009C or 0xC000016A typically indicates that the data could not be read from the disk because of a bad block (sector). If you can restart the computer after the error, Autochk runs automatically
 and attempts to map the bad sector to prevent it from being used anymore.</p>
<p>If Autochk does not scan the hard disk for errors, you can manually start the disk scanner. Run
<strong>Chkdsk /f /r</strong> on the system partition. You must restart the computer before the disk scan begins. If you cannot start the computer because of the error, use the Recovery Console and run
<strong>Chkdsk /r</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Warning</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;If your system partition is formatted with the FAT file system, the long file names that the Windows operating system uses might be damaged if you use Scandisk or another MS-DOS-based hard disk tool to verify the
 integrity of your hard disk from MS-DOS. Always use the version of Chkdsk that matches your version of Windows.</p>
<p><em>Resolving a defective hardware problem:</em> If the I/O status is C0000185 and the paging file is on an SCSI disk, check the disk cabling and SCSI termination for problems.</p>
<p><em>Resolving a failing RAM problem:</em> Run the hardware diagnostics that the system manufacturer supplies, especially the memory scanner. For more information about these procedures, see the owner's manual for your computer.</p>
<p>Check that all the adapter cards in the computer are properly seated. Use an ink eraser or an electrical contact treatment, available at electronics supply stores, to ensure adapter card contacts are clean.</p>
<p>Check the System Log in Event Viewer for additional error messages that might help identify the device that is causing the error. You can also disable memory caching of the BIOS to try to resolve this error.</p>
<p>Make sure that the latest Windows Service Pack is installed.</p>
<p>If the preceding steps do not resolve the error, take the system motherboard to a repair facility for diagnostic testing. A crack, a scratched trace, or a defective component on the motherboard can cause this error.</p>
<p><em>Resolving a virus infection:</em> Check your computer for viruses by using any up-to-date, commercial virus scanning software that examines the Master Boot Record of the hard disk. All Windows file systems can be infected by viruses.<br />
<br />
--------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
This is my generic bluescreen troubleshooter which might help.<br />
<br />
Look in the Event Viewer to see if anything is reported about those.<br />

<br />
-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />
<br />
Here are some methods to possibly fix the blue screen issue. If you could give the Blue Screen info that would
<br />
help. Such as the BCC and the other&nbsp;4 entries on the lower left. And any other error information such as STOP
<br />
codes and info such as IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUAL or PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA and similar messages.<br />
<br />
As examples :<br />
<br />
BCCode: 116<br />
BCP1: 87BC9510<br />
BCP2: 8C013D80<br />
BCP3: 00000000<br />
BCP4: 00000002</p>
<p>or in this format :</p>
<p>Stop: 0x00000000 (oxoooooooo oxoooooooo oxooooooooo oxoooooooo)<br />
tcpip.sys - Address 0x00000000 base at 0x000000000 DateStamp 0x000000000<br />

<br />
<br />
Many BlueScreens are caused by old or corrupted drivers, especially video drivers however there are other causes.<br />
<br />
You can do these in Safe Mode if needed or from Command Prompt from Vista DVD or Recovery Options if your
<br />
system has that installed by the maker.<br />

            Thanks for the reply. Tried your recommendations without success. It turns out that both my Nexus 7 tablet and Nexus 5 phone show up as portable devices in both my Win 10 desktop and my Win 7 laptop. They worked fine as recently as last week, no Android
 or Win 7updates. I don't know what could have changed. The flash drive I mentioned also has the same problem on the Win 7 laptop. UPDATE: Reformated flash drive, now it works in both computers.<br />

            <p>Seems to be an Android 6.0 glitch. The fix (which needs to be done every time you connect to a Windows computer) is:<br />
</p>
<p>1. Connect Nexus device to computer (should show up onscreen in File Explorer).</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Go to Settings/About phone/Build number. Tap on Build number exactly 7 times (really). That enables Developer options. Open Developer Options and find Select USB Configurations. Should be set to MTP (Media Transfer Protocol). Open and change to Charging.
 Now change it back to MTP (Media Transfer Protocol). </p>
<p>
3. Refresh computer screen. Nexus should now show up as storage. <br />

            <p>0x80070003 means "The specified path couldn't be found - ALLUSERSPROFILE Microsoft network dir doesn’t exist.". &nbsp;This is one of the more intelligible error codes!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The file path can be expressed as C:\Users\All Users\Microsoft\Network. On this computer the Network has two subfolders, which are Connections and Downloader. The Connections folder is empty and the Downloader has two files, qmgr0.dat and qmgr1.dat.. These
 two files were part of the original Windows 7 installation&nbsp;and are seemingly updated as updates are downloaded.&nbsp;The missing folder structure can easily be recreated but the missing files are&nbsp;not so easily recreated. Perhaps this explanation is an interesting
 diversion but it does not solve your problem.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not 100% positive, but I believe 'Arrival' was the last one for Mass Effect 2. &nbsp;Curious that they didn't release it a little later though, even if the original target date was for Christmas. &nbsp;I think that all we can hope for in the way of ME2 DLC is another
 'Alternate Appearance Pack', maybe even a speedo for Zaeed...hee hee...:-)</p>

<h2>            Gateway NE56r41u TAPPING option missing from synaptic driver</h2>
                    <p>The touchpad has the tap-to-click feature and it's driving me nuts when I try and type and the palms touch the keyboard. I cannot find a fix for this. I have the latest Synaptic driver, and all google results tell me to go to the control panel, hardware,
 mouse, and click on the synaptic tab. However, when I do this, the tapping feature that I've seen in so many screenshots is NOT THERE. Synaptics V17 for Windows 7 doesn't work on this machine. I'm running Win 7 Home Premium on a Gateway NE56R. HELP, PLEASE!</p>

<li><span><span>When was the last time it was working fine?</span></span></li><li><span><span>Do you remember making any changes to the PC prior to this issue?</span></span></li><li><span><span>What is the make and model of your PC?</span></span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Try the following methods and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
<strong>Method 1: Run the Hardware Troubleshooter</strong>
</p><p>
</p><p>If your computer is having problems with a recently installed device or other hardware, try using the Hardware and Devices troubleshooter to fix the problem. It checks for common issues and makes sure that any new device or hardware attached to your computer
 was installed correctly. </p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 2:
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Step 1: Try
<strong>Safe Mode</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Safe mode is the configuration of Windows, when it is running on only basic set of drivers and all the startups are disabled.
 To know more about safe mode, follow the article below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue is resolved in safe mode, follow step 2 after restarting the computer in regular mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Step 2:
<strong>Clean Boot</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This
 helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. To know more, follow the article below:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><em><span><span>Note: After troubleshooting, refer to this section ‘<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>’.</span></span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 3: Update the drivers</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Uninstall and reinstall the touchpad&nbsp;drivers and check if it helps.</span></span><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I would recommend you to visit the computer manufacturer’s support website and download the compatible drivers for your touchpad.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Once you have downloaded the drivers, uninstall the existing version, restart the PC and install the drivers.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Hope this information was helpful.</span></span></p>

            <p>As in the headline, it's a Gateway NE56r. I bought it second hand and installed all the drivers for Win 7 HP from the Gateway website.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This has been an issue since I installed Windows last week. I did install an app called "TouchFreeze" which helps a little when typing, but that's not the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue is that I can tap the touchpad and it's just like I "left-clicked" the existing button below the touchpad.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All drivers are current and all Windows updates have been installed. The option to disabled "tap-to-click" doesn't exist as it states that it should on Synaptic's website and from all the screen shots I've seen while googling a fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This is driving me crazy. Especially in facebook. I'll be typing a comment and suddenly the cursor will move sporadically somewhere else, causing me to lose my place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I should also note that this PC is out of warranty, so contacting Gateway will cost me money I do not have as I am disabled waiting on a social security hearing. That's why I'm reaching out here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I will try your suggestions and get back to you.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Nate</p>

            <p>The suggestions you provided did not work. It is as if the "tap-to-click" feature is turned on and there is no way to disable it. The touchpad driver is from Synaptic. They stated for me to download the driver from Gateway's website, which I'd already done.
 There are missing options for the touchpad under the control panel. I even tried different drivers from Synaptic. None of them work except for v15 that is on Gateway's website.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is also a palm touch option that is missing. The only options I have are for the left and right buttons.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Other threads show it SHOULD look like this: (notice the tapping option)</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the update on the issue.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This issue is usually with the driver or the firmware version that is installed on the PC. This is not provided by Microsoft as it is hardware specific. A lot of users face this issue depending upon the firmware version and hardware installed on the laptop.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>For this issue, I would suggest you to contact the hardware support team for your laptop manufacturer and check.</p>

    <title>Game not appearing in ready to install&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> starry maika  say:</h3>
<h2>            Game not appearing in ready to install&#63;</h2>
                    I was trying to play a game earlier today and when I tried to launch it I was met with an error message saying i had to log into the account that it was bought on or downloaded on. I was told I could fix the problem by uninstalling and then reinstalling.
 Later, I couldn't find the game in my ready to install and that I could fix that by soft resetting my Xbox One. The game still isn't in my ready to install and it's acting like I never even owned the game in the first place. What should I do?

<p>To add a couple things to what Geth said.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you try and start a game the system will look for the license for the game there are a few ways to get a license for the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Physical disc- The disc HAS to be in the system in order to play the game and any account on the console can play the game as&nbsp; long as the disc is in the disc drive.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Digitally- This can be done 2 different ways.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; A. Be signed in with the account that purchased the game No matter what console the account is signed into it will be able to play the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; B. If an account that owns the game has the console set as its home console then ANY other profile on that console can play the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now there is also a few different ways for an account that once had a digital license to lose the digital license for a game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. The purchase was refunded for one reason or another.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You can check the status of an order by signing into your account at account.microsoft.com and going to your order history.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. If it was a Xbox One Games With Gold then you do have to maintain the Gold subscription in order to maintain the license for the game.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You can check the status of your Gold subscription by going to account.microsoft.com/services</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. If the account that purchased the game no longer has the console set as its home console and you are trying to play the game on an account that did not purchase it digitally.</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You can check whether the account has the console set as its home console by signing into the account and going into settings and under the personalization tab going to Home Xbox and it will tell you whether or not that console is the currently signed
 in profiles home console or not.</p>

<p>I have had a similiar issue with <strong>digital game</strong><strong>s</strong> where a game did not show up in ready to install list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>After some web searches I found a solution:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just go to the Microsft Store and search for the game in question. Once found select it and it should show "Install"</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Please note that this solution will only work with digital games</strong></p>

<p>Hi there,</p>

<p>If so, then be sure to check out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxinsiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxinsiders/</a> since there was an issue in certain Rings where content didn't show in the Ready to Install section which should be fixed in the latest update (for specific Rings) as mentioned here:

            This happens to me from time to time as well. A game just won't show up in my Ready to Install, even though I own it and it should. What I do is I just manually search for the game in the Store, and when you pull it up, it will say Install there. I just
 install it from there.

<h2>            Can see Windows XP computer in network map but can&#39;t connect</h2>
                    
<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I've set up a network with a Windows 7 laptop (named TABLET) and a Windows XP desktop (named Matt2). I have LLTD installed on the Windows XP desktop, and while I can view the Windows XP computer on the network map, it doesn't show up under the list of network
 computers. I can connect to it manually by typing its location in the address bar, but can't do so through the normal network screens. It only shows up in certain places when I've already connected to it manually. How can I fix the problem and have it show
 up normally?</p>

<p><span>Hi mg_ma,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span>Have
 you installed any Security Software and/or any third party firewall on your Windows XP computer?</span></p>
<p><span>b.&nbsp;&nbsp;Can the Windows XP machine access Windows 7 machine?</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:</span></strong><span> If you have installed any third party Security Software or firewall
 on your Windows XP machine, try disabling it for the time being and check if the issue is fixed.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue is fixed, you may have to contact the program manufacturer to know about the settings that can be changed or if there are any other updates for this
 program.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Note: Make sure you enable/turn on the Security Software and/or firewall once you are done with the test.</span></p>
<p><span>If the issue is not fixed, try the following steps.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2: Enable Link Layer Topology Discovery (LLTD)</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If the computer is running<span>Windows&nbsp;7</span>and the Link Layer Topology Discovery (LLTD) protocol is disabled on the network adapter.<span>Windows</span> uses the
 LLTD protocol to map computers and devices on a network. To enable LLTD, follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span><span><span>Open
 Network Connections by clicking the</span></span><span><span>Start</span></span><span><span> button, clicking</span></span><span><span>Control
 Panel</span></span><span><span>, clicking</span></span><span><span>Network and Internet</span></span><span><span>,
 clicking</span></span><span><span>Network and Sharing Center</span></span><span><span>, and then clicking</span></span><span><span>Manage
 network connections</span></span><span><span>.</span></span></p>

    <title>Devise Connect and Disconnect sound when opening PC and Black screen - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> erikjohnson_465  say:</h3>
<h2>            Devise Connect and Disconnect sound when opening PC and Black screen interruptions.</h2>
                    I have been getting a Devise Connect and Disconnect sound when opening up my PC. It started when I started using my HDMI cord when watching Netfix. The sound happens when plugging in the HDMI cord or unplugging it as it should, but why when opening the
 PC? Something is wrong. I also have been getting a full black screen lately. It randomly happens, probably about every hour and has a white strip on top. It just lasts a second and then stops. I have seen it mostly, if not always on sites where there are videos
 like youtube, twitter, facebook, but never happens while I'm watching a Netfix movie. Anyways, I don't know if the sounds problem and the black screen are connected, but both piss me off. Just bought this PC about 4 mo. ago. Windows 10, Chrome, both updated.
 Both problems happened before and after windows 10 update.

            Hey Erik.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 10 year Windows MVP here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Update the Display driver from the PC or Display adapter maker's Support Downloads web page for your exact model number, HP Serial Number or Dell Service Tag - from the sticker on the PC.  
<br />
<br />While there check also for newer chipset, BIOS/UEFI firmware (very important), network, sound, USB3 and other drivers, comparing to the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.
<br />
<br />if this doesn't give you the latest or ideal driver for what you need, compare it to the driver offered by the Intel driver update Utility here: <a href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/detect.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/...</a>
<br />or the Nvidia Update utility here: <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=en-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/Scan.aspx?lang=e...</a>
<br />or the AMD autodect utility here:  <a href="http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/Pages/auto_detect.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/us/gpudownload/windows/P...</a>
<br />
<br />For Display issues one fix that is working is to Roll back or Uninstall the Driver on the Display Device &gt; Driver tab, restart PC to reinstall driver.
<br />
<br />You can also try older drivers in Device Manager &gt; Display device &gt; Driver tab &gt; Update Driver &gt; Browse &gt; Let Me Pick. 
<br />
<br />Then you will know you've tried everything in addition to Windows Update drivers. 
<br />
<br />2) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files, and also Step 16 to test a new Local Admin account.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly. 
<br />
<br />3) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1903 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.   
<br />
<br />4) I would also use the included one year warranty during which time the manufacturer's support must fix any problems or replace the PC.  
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br /> I hope this helps. Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes. If you'll wait to rate whether my post helped you, I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Erik
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />First, try restarting your graphics driver:
<br />Press Windows key + Ctrl + Shift + B
<br />
<br />If that does not work...
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Properties
<br />Click Driver tab
<br />Click Rollback driver if the option is available 
<br />
<br />If not
<br />Right click the current display adapter 
<br />Click Uninstall 
<br />Check the box that says, "Delete the driver software for this device.” 
<br />Exit Device Manager 
<br />Restart 
<br />
<br />Go to Start -&gt; Settings -&gt; Update &amp; security, then Check for updates and install any available updates.
<br />
<br />You might need to update the display driver from the manufacturer of your computers website.
<br />
<br />If you have an nVidia, AMD ATI video card or Intel HD graphics installed, you can download the latest drivers from their website. 
<br />
<br />First, determine what type of graphics you have installed. 
<br />
<br />Press Windows key + X 
<br />Click Device Manager 
<br />Expand Display adapters 
<br />
<br />Once you have determined the graphics driver, go the vendors website and search for the driver in the download section:
<br />
<br />Intel - Downloads for Graphics Drivers - Drivers &amp; Software - Intel
<br /><a href="https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/Graphics-Drivers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://downloadcenter.intel.com/product/80939/...</a>
<br />
<br />nVidia - <a href="http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx</a>
<br />

<br /><a href="http://support.amd.com/en-us/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.amd.com/en-us/download</a>

            Thanks Greg. Well I tried alot of things, but nothing fixd the black screen from periodically coming on for a second. So in the end I just changed my browser from Crome to Firefox and that did the trick. I have an HP laptop and have always had one. I do
 remember always having small probs. with Chrome on HP but always went with Chrome. Sometimes the simplest solution is the best one. still get the Devise plugged in and out sound, only when using my HDMI cord, probably needs to be replaced.<br />

            Glad you made some progress. I am wondering its hardware acceleration in Chrome that is causing the problem. 
<br />
<br />You could try disabling it to see if it work.
<br />
<br />    Open Google Chrome.
<br />    Click Customize and Control Google Chrome &gt; Settings.
<br />    Click on Show advanced settings and scroll to the System section.
<br />    Uncheck Use hardware acceleration when available and restart Google Chrome.
<br />
<br />I would also recommend you file a bug report; send me the short link so I can vote on it and bring it to the attention of the Windows engineers.

            Hi Erik-
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Chrome then you can try resetting it to see if that makes it worth keeping as a secondary browser.  I also use Firefox as default, but rely heavily as well on Edge and Chrome.   
<br />
<br />Reset Chrome:

<br />
<br />If that's not enough fully uninstall it, restart PC and then reinstall from a fresh download:

            <span>Shutting down a computer the way your husband did is equivalent to stopping your car by slamming it into a brick wall instead of using the brakes. The operating system (Windows) may be too corrupted by his actions to save. Nevertheless,
 below are general shutdown troubleshooting steps:<br />
<br />
Shutdown issues are generally caused by a program and/or process that is refusing to exit gracefully. The program and/or process can be from malware or can be legitimate (such as an invasive antivirus like Norton or McAfee). If you are using a Norton or McAfee
 product,&nbsp; uninstall it and replace with a better program such as NOD32, Kasperksy, or Avast (free). The Windows Firewall is adequate for most people. Shutdown issues can also be caused by old/poorly written drivers so make sure all drivers are updated, particularly
 on Windows Vista and Windows 7.<br />
<br />
A.The first step is always to make sure your computer is virus/malware free.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.elephantboycomputers.com/page2.html#Removing_Malware</a>
<br />
<br />
B. If the computer is virus/malware-free, drivers are current, and no Norton or McAfee programs are installed, then do clean-boot troubleshooting to see which program/process is the culprit:<br />

<br />
Standard caveat: If troubleshooting the issue is too difficult - and there is absolutely no shame in admitting this isn't your cup of tea - take the machine to a computer repair shop. This will not be your local BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place. Get
 recommendations from family, friends, colleagues.</span>

<p>Hi Purple Heart,</p>
<p>Well first off, as devmgmt.msc&nbsp;(device manager)&nbsp;is a system file, I would recommend doing an system file check to attempt to repair this file. Here are instructions on how to do this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If it doesn't work, run&nbsp;a SFC scan to see if it can repair the damaged system files.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Running the&nbsp;System File Checker…</p>
<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click&nbsp;Start, click&nbsp;All Programs, click&nbsp;Accessories, right-click&nbsp;Command Prompt, and select&nbsp;Run as Administrator.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Click&nbsp;Continue&nbsp;or supply Administrator credentials if prompted.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the&nbsp;Command Prompt&nbsp;window type the following, and press&nbsp;Enter:</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
sfc /scannow</p>
<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should see the following on-screen messages:</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
Beginning the system scan. This process will take some time.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
Beginning verification ph</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
ase of system scan.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
Verification % complete.</p>
<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once the scan has completed you will receive an onscreen message resembling one of the following:</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
…found no integrity violations</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
…found corruption but repaired it</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
…found corruption that it could not repair</p>
<p>6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please reply with the completion message that you received.</p>
