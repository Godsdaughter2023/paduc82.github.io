    <title>Reinstalled Win 10, now DVD drive reads extremely slow - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Reinstalled Win 10, now DVD drive reads extremely slow</h2>
                    <p>I reinstalled Win 10 tonight, and now my Optiarc DVD drive is running so slowly that it is essentially useless. At the rate it's reading it would take days to install only a few hundred MBs. It is recognized in the device manager, it says it's running properly,
 and the driver is up to date. I'm not sure what else to do. Also, when I insert a disc, it spins up, the read light comes on and a prompt asks me what to do with it, but it doesn't show in file explorer. It simply sits there spinning until I eject the disc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone know what could be the issue? Appreciate any help.</p>

<p>Hello Kale,</p>

<p>Hi Helen,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are you on an Xbox One console or Windows 10 PC?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once the car has downloaded it should appear in game in the garage or wherever it is you claim your new cars.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have an Xbox One, confirm the car has downloaded by pressing the Menu button while hovering over the game in your games section and then select "Manage game and add-ons". From there you will see Installed or Ready to Install.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you confirm the car was downloaded but the car is still not in game, then go ahead and do a

<h3> chrisjozwiak  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 Missing media driver &#40;installing&#41;</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>My laptop is a Dell Inspirion 5520. I have Ubuntu 15.10 on it right now and I am trying to put the demo version of Windows 10 onto it now.&nbsp; I plan to buy it but I would like to install it first.&nbsp; My problem lies within the first step of the installation
 process.&nbsp; When I click install now an error message pops up prompting me for a media driver that is missing.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Further testing of the iso file to make sure it wasn't damaged via VirtualBox proved that the iso file was fully functional because I was able to get a full install out of it within a virtual environment.&nbsp; All my USB ports are 3.0 and I have downloaded the
 drivers for them; not sure if this would have made a difference.&nbsp; I was right.&nbsp; I couldn't even locate the folder on my USB drive.&nbsp; Only Windows directories were displayed as if it loaded everything in from the USB drive and forgot it was even plugged in.
</p>
<p>So my question is, what can I do next? </p>
<p>I'm not sure if the partitions on my drive may be causing Windows 10 to not detect my hard drive.&nbsp; If this is the case a clean wipe and format with diskpart utilizing shift + f10 would do the trick correct?&nbsp; I haven't tried it because I'd like to have a
 fallback in case it doesn't work.&nbsp; If I wipe the OS and I still can't install, I'm left without a computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you in advance to anyone that helps out with this.</p>

<h2>            Unable to log into Windows 10 after system reset</h2>
                    I was having some issues with my machines performance so I decided to reset Windows 10 with the built in option. I chose to keep my files and proceeded with the reset. After the reset was complete, I was unable to log in. I knew I was typing my Windows
 account password correctly but I decided to reset it anyway. I confirmed while resetting that it was linked to my Microsoft account email that I use on my computer, my daughter's Win10 computer, my Xbox one, and the Xbox app on my phone. After a password reset,
 I am still unable to log in. I am able to log into the other devices with the same email and password, just not on my Windows 10 computer. I have tried more password resets and I even reset Windows 10 again through the boot up options (this time it prompted
 me for my Windows account password and I tried the new one I reset it to, but it actually accepted my old password before I reset it), but still unable to log in with any password (old/new). I get an error that I am not using th

    <title>WMP and the unsaved playlist - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            WMP and the unsaved playlist</h2>
                    
<p>Hello, I'm sure this has been mentioned before, but I am unable to find any answers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>My issue is that when i play a file, it gets "saved" to an unsaved playlist.&nbsp; So if I play a file, close WMP12 and come back 1 hour later and open WMP12, the file is still up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would like an answer about how to stop WMP12 from saving anything to an unsaved playlist.&nbsp;I dont want to clear cache or history, because that does not affect this issue in any way. I have all the boxes in options set to unchecked for saving recent/frequent
 items, so it shouldnt be saving them.</p>
<p>I just want WMP12 to stop saving the last file I played to an unsaved playlist. Is there a way to do this?</p>

<span>Hi Juliocongado,</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>Follow the methods listed below:</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<strong><span>Method 1:</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-the-Windows-Media-Player-Library-troubleshooter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>Open the
 Windows Media Player Library troubleshooter</span></a></span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Method 2: Rebuild Windows Media Player database</span></strong></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If the troubleshooter doesn’t fix the issue, rebuild the Windows Media Player database and check if that fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. Exit Windows Media Player.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Click<strong>Start</strong>, type<strong>%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Media Player</strong> in the&nbsp;
<strong>Start</strong> search box and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Select all the files in the folder, right-click and select&nbsp;<strong>Delete</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note:</span></strong><span> You do not have to delete the folders
 that are in this folder.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>d. Restart Windows Media Player.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Note</span></strong><span>: Windows Media Player automatically
 rebuilds the database.</span></p>

            Juliocongado, the 'last played' playlist is stored at&nbsp; <span>
<strong>%LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Media Player</strong> , as a file called&nbsp; <strong>
lastplayed.wpl</strong> . Try making that file read-only, that should prevent WMP from writing to it, thus from saving the last played file.</span>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting your query in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I understand your concern, I will be glad to assist you with this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that favourites are arranged alphabetically by default therefore, you need not make any changes. However, you do have the option to move the favorites up or down depending on your preference. Simply left click a favourite while holding
 down the mouse button and drag and release the favourite. To rename a favourite, right click on the favourite and select "rename".
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have any Windows related queries in the future, let us know. We will be glad to help.</p>

    <title>How to refresh MediaCenter&#39;s Waterfall&#47;checkerboard album - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevek_924  say:</h3>
<h2>            How to refresh MediaCenter&#39;s Waterfall&#47;checkerboard album Images cache&#63;</h2>
                    I am on Windows 8 x64 but MediaCenter appears to be near identical to the Windows 7 Version.<br />
<br />
<u>The problem</u><br />
In MediaCenter when playing music a moving background of album covers is displayed. I have heard this referred to as both 'waterfall' and 'checkerboard'. The pictures are taken from the album covers of music loaded into MediaCenter/MediaPlayer.<br />
<br />
I accidentally added a ‘Party’ folder to MediaCenter and although now removed still have some awful and frankly embarrassing album covers waterfalling down.
<br />
<br />
<u>Solution Attempted</u><br />
<br />
I have already unhidden 'hidden files/folders etc' and shown 'protected operating system files'.<br />
<br />
I have browsed to C:\Users\*user*\AppData\Local\Microsoft\eHome and Deleted the 'Art Cache' folder.<br />
<br />
I see it reload the images (takes a few min) when opening MediaCenter and upon going to the ‘Art Cache’ folder can see the images it has just re-loaded. The unwanted album covers are not in the ‘Art Cache’ folder anymore but still show on the 'Waterfall'.<br />
<br />
<p>It must be creating another cache file for the waterfall but after a good internet hunt I cant identify where it must be.</p>
<br />
<p>Please help!, Cheers,</p>
<p><br />

<div>close media center, go to the desktop and rename the party folder. </div>

            Hi, Thanks for the quick response.<br />
<br />
I have tried your suggestion but it did not make any change to the 'Waterfall'. In fact I have gone a step further...<br />
<br />
I have removed all music from the library by unchecking all the watched folders from within Media Center. I closed media center and opened MediaPlayer, this confirmed there was nothing in the library. I then deleted all the music folders from my computer (they
 are externally backed up). Back within MediaPlayer I went to Tools&gt;Advance&gt;Restore Media Library and did that just incase.
<br />
<br />
I then put just one album back onto my computer into a folder and added only that location into the library in media player MediaPlayer.
<br />
<br />
When I relaunched MediaCenter and played the lonely test album ALL the previous album covers still waterfall down.
<br />
<br />
Since i have pretty much obliterated my MediaCentre already I could remove/reinstall MediaCenter entirely and start from scratch, but I will probably want to refresh it again in the future. While searching on forums trying to find the solution myself I have
 seen several others looking for the same answer so It would good to help those people out too if possible.<br />
<br />
I expect there is an image cache somewhere specifically for the waterfall, If that could be identified and deleted it would probably rebuild itself and resolve the issue.<br />

            Hi Barb, <br />
<br />
As mentioned in my first post I have already tried that to no avail. I have used that before to correct wrongly associated album covers, so knew about that folder. Its surprising the waterfall isn't using the same image cache but it doesn't appear to be.<br />
<br />

            <div>HNY to you, too. I wonder what would happen if you did a system restore to a</div>
<div>point before the folder was added. That is a crummy solution, but worth a shot</div>

            Hi, <br />
<br />
I have avoided the problem this time by installing Windows 8 afresh on my new SSD. I usually go a few years on the same OS install but decided to upgrade the HDD while my OS was still fresh and avoid going through the whole setting it up thing again later.<br />
<br />
I will try plugging my original HDD back in and try the System Restore idea when I get a chance as it could be a work-around as I'm likely to do something clumsy like this again at some point.
<br />
<br />
I would still&nbsp; like to know (and im sure others would too) if anyone does Identify the cache file as that would be the preferred way of resolving it if its possible.<br />
<br />
Regards, Stephen<br />

            <div>you most likely need the sledgehammer approach to rebuild the entire WMP</div>
<div>database. WMC shared the database with Windows Media Center.</div>
<div><a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itpromedia/thread/48688cf4-4f2b-43d1-9608-bd0640fefc92" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itpromedia/thread/48688cf4-4f2b-43d1-9608-bd0640fefc92</a></div>
<div>has the steps that work for W7 which should work for W8, so basically you need</div>
<div>to delete more than just the art cache (I would move them elsewhere as a</div>
<div>backup). Navigate to the %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Media Player folder and delete</div>
<div>the files (not the folders) as the databases are in these files. </div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>then you will need to rebuild all the indexes using libraries or WMC.</div>

<h2>            Stuck in a Automatic System Repair Loop on W</h2>
                    <p>I left my laptop in sleep mode over night and when I opened it up, I vaguely remember the screen going gray. So I forced shut down. Now when I switched it back on, the Dell screen loaded but then it'll go black and after a couple of minutes it'll prepare
 automatic restore and then the screen goes black again and all I can see is my mouse pointer which I can move around but I can't see anything. Then after thirty some minutes the blue screen will appear and say that it's diagnosing my PC or something. This
 screen stays on for a good one or two hours before it attempts repairs and fails within the first ten- twenty minutes. I have searched the threads online for solutions but I seem to be having multiple problems so I think I do need a thread of my own. I'll
 be willing to send background information if needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>It's a Dell Inspiron laptop which I bought September, 2012. it originally ran Windows 7, and I recently upgraded to Windows 10. I'd be happy to provide all the needed information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It'll be a huge service if someone can solve this problem and save my files because there a lot of memories on this laptop as it was my first. Sorry to get all sentimental. Anyways, I want to thank all contributors in advance.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>I really doubt that this issue has anything to do with Mr. Gates or Windows per-se.</p>
<p>However if you can provide technical info, and&nbsp; explain what Modem means (there are at least 100 kinds of modems), what type of Internet connection you have and how the Connection credentials work, we might be able to find out what are you missing in your
 logon credentials.</p>

<p>The modem is a Draytek Vigor 120 ADSL2+ internet modem.&nbsp;&nbsp; The internet line is provided by BT.&nbsp; The modem works every time with a laptop running XP&nbsp;&nbsp; but "sulks" when another laptop running Win 7 is attached. The logon credentials are as supplied by BT&nbsp;

<p>Win 7 prompts for these as does XP but win 7 fails to connect</p>

<h2>            Game will not go past intro movie</h2>
                    
<p>I recently installed Forza 5(Disk) on my xbox one and after the initial install and download the game worked. A few days later I tried to play the game and it loads, goes to a screen that says hit "A" to continue, and when I do this it loads the intro video.
 If I hit any button the game goes to a load screen then the same video plays again. If I just let the video play thru it does the same thing and reloads the intro video. I have uninstalled the game two times and downloaded the files needed and it keeps doing
 the same thing. &nbsp;Very frustrating. &nbsp;Any help would be appreciated.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes I finally got it to work. What you have to do is; go to home screen, then apps games, find the game, go to manage, start by erasing saved data on xbox, if that doesn't work then you will have to delete progress from cloud and start again. Those are the
 steps that I can remember. &nbsp;Be sure to do a system shut down and restart after deleting files. I had to call microsoft support and this is a common problem. Been playing steady for two days with no problems. &nbsp;Hope that helps.</p>

<p>I have had this problem it usually a problem that can be fixed by clearing the system cache here's how to it. since I don't know what system you have I list instructions for the Xbox One and Xbox 360.</p>
<p>Xbox One:</p>
<p>Power down your console, then unplug the power cable from the back of the Xbox One. &nbsp;Wait for two minutes, then plug the power cable back into the back of the Xbox One, and monitor the power brick, waiting for it to cycle from a white light to an orange
 light, and then turn the power on. &nbsp;This will perform a cold restart of the system.
</p>
<p>Xbox 360:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Press the Guide button on your controller, go to Settings, and select System Settings.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Select Storage or Memory. </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Highlight any storage device, and then press Y on your controller. (It doesn't matter which storage device you select; the cache will be cleared for all storage devices.) Select Clear System Cache. &nbsp;When prompted to confirm storage device maintenance,
 select Yes.</p>

<h2>            After Update&#58; Still having same HDR issue</h2>
                    
<p><span>Good morning, </span></p>
<p><span>I apologise if this has been brought up before. I recently purchased the XBOX One S as the console includes a 4K UHD player. But I have been having trouble with the HDR content as like many others have said the image is washed
 out and too bright.</span></p>
<p><span>The TV I am using is a Samsung JU6740. The new update for the console, dated 04/10/16, has had no impact on the issue. The TV has been calibrated, using the on-screen XBOX calibration and also with the TV settings.&nbsp;There is
 no issue when playing Blu-ray discs or DVD's only when playing UHD discs using HDR.</span></p>
<p><span>I recall reading that the update was to resolve the HDR issue with "certain TVs". Is anybody else still having the issue with HDR?</span></p>
<p><span>Any help or feedback would be greatly appreciated.</span></p>

<p>Hello</p>
<p>Samsung JU6740 as far as I know did not have HDR support initially but I believe they were updated since they were 2015 models.</p>
<p>Having said that, they also lack 10 bit panels and wide color gamut which are necessary to appreciate true HDR so at this point technically, you are not really getting an HDR picture since you need those features which the newer 2016 models do such KS series
 from Samsung.</p>
<p>You may need to calibrate the TV while running HDR content to get a better perspective.</p>
<p>Here is a link on the review of this model: <a href="http://ca.rtings.com/tv/reviews/samsung/ju6700" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
ca.rtings.com/.../ju6700</a></p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply. The JU6740 has a function called HDMI UHD Colour for the HDMI1 port. When off the console won't recognise HDR but when the UHD Colour function is set to on the console shows that the TV has HDR and everything (including allowing
 10-bit) is ticked off in green.</p>
<p>At the moment the best way to view in 4K using HDR appears to be with having the TV mode set to Dynamic as it adds colour and the black levels are a bit more like what they should be as opposed to them being grey/washed out. But I would prefer to use the
 Movie mode as the TV has auto-dimming (that cannot be turned off) on the other 3 modes. The Dynamic mode's colour doesn't seem natural enough.</p>

<p>Have you looked through the settings to see Is there any way to turn them OFF. Perhaps a latest update from Samsung. I know the 2016 KU models can change local dimming which I have, but for gaming I do use the KS model.</p>
<p>There should be a built in manual in the TV that you can access. Have you looked through it to see if you can turn off local dimming. Sometimes the dimming is attached to black level and dynamic contrast so maybe try adjusting those.

<p>I have the same issue on the LG 55EG920. As soon as HDR kicks in the picture goes very dark and washed out. I've posted in a separate topic with pictures so you can see if it's the same as your issue</p>

<p>I'm also experiencing that problem with the</p>
<p>Xbr55x850c 2015 Sony Bravia model</p>
<p>I believe the many people who are experiencing hdr </p>
<p>Issues are the ones using older models that aren't 2016.</p>
<p>The problem is firmware updating it alone hasn't seem to bring these tvs</p>
<p>Up to par with their 2016 counterparts</p>
<p>My tv which is a 2015 model shows hdr content washed out and dimmer worse then</p>

<p>I agree as those TV's (2015) weren't designed with HDR in mind as they require wide color gamut, local dimming and rgb screens to work well. Having a 10bit panel makes it even better. The reason it may go dark is due to the older Tv's not having higher nits.
 Such as 2016 have higher nits and the higher end models have more and that basically means they get very bright.</p>
<p>I personally have a 2016 model and have not had issues with HDR so on that basis, the older 4k models are limited as they don;t have those features.</p>
<p>Hope this helps</p>

<h2>            How do I perform Assassinatons correctly&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I have performed Assassinations before. I have performed over 7 of them. Whenever I sneak up behind an unsuspecting enemy, I hold down RB like the other gamers say but I just end up performing a melee and end up injuring him or killing him.</p>
<p><br />
Am I doing something wrong?</p>

<p>Lol I doubt you meant it this way, but it sounded like you though 7 assassinations is a lot.</p>
<p>Anyway, there's this odd player model fault in Halo. One of the shoulders, I can't remember if it's the right or left one, will not allow you under any circumstance to assassinate or beat down the person. It will only allow you to melee them. So if you're
 consistently hitting this shoulder, that would explain it.</p>
<p>However, if you are actually just coming up behind them and holding down the melee button, then it should assassinate them every time possible.</p>
<p>The only thing I can attribute it to is lag. Maybe the people you're sneaking up on are actually in the process of turning around when you hit them from the back, but on your screen it doesn't look that way due to lag. That's what I imagine could be happening.</p>

<p>They don't even know that I'm there. I will usually hide behind a wall where they walk past me and I walk up to them and try to assassinate them. I should probably just hold it and walk up to them just like you said. Maybe that would work?</p>

<p>It could be lag or your probably just to far away, try getting closer and then holding RB and I mean really close, about kissing range

<p>It's not the range that is the problem. I've actually assassinated people from about 4 feet which seems to be the furthest you can possibly assassinate people. I'd have to agree with Noble and say that Reach simply has a finicky assassination system and
 that sometimes you just don't get the assassination. Try to hit them at the center of their back and after 150 assassinations or so, you'll start to realize when and where to ambush them.</p>

<p>Fluffers and Noble have it down.</p>
<p>Firstly, a Spartan doesn't run in a flat line, so the right, I believe, shoulder is dubious to hit, and practice is your key to overcoming that, as Fluffers said.</p>
<p>It's a bit hard to explain but you'll see eventually. Try practicing on a spare controller if you have any

                    <p>Hi I am having problems updating my Windows 8.1 with some recent updates. There are about seven updates waiting to install - my internet speed at home is very fast but I cannot download and install these updates. I always get the errors -&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Here it is in April of 2016 and nobody has helped you. Your problems sound very similar to mine. I have an event twice a second that is event 4, reporting that CFMRD (a Comodo driver that is no longer on my system as I have uninstalled all Comodo software
 and searched for cfmrd.sys to no avail) is not able to attach to my hard drives and returns with an error it doesn't recognize. Evidently, Comodo has redirected the Microsoft fltmc system filter to report as if they are Comodo filters and pretty much leaves
 the registry is this abnormal state. One company on the internet claims it will fix this problem if you buy their system repair software, but I have doubts it will fix this, no guarantees. Comodo should supply a free fix for this. Even manual registry editing
 does not cure the problem as the true MS filter is still running through this kludge and the needed deletes from the registry are stopped as they are tried. Suggestions from others on attaching the drives and unattaching these drives do not work or are stopped
 cold. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It gets back to the old XP routine of saving what you can and reinstalling Windows fresh. The added security of pop-ups to make sure we are allowing these changes to be made do not fix this as Comodo is doing this by manipulating the registry after you have
 given system permission to do this before installing their software. My latest try of installing a current Comodo program so that I&nbsp; can uninstall it and hope they have improved their uninstall to completely change the system back has not been tried. I have
 little hope of it working, but it's worth a shot. I would willingly pay for the software to put my registry back as it was, but the changes were done years ago, and the problems don't show up until much later, possibly because of updates to Windows or a real
 problem that needs to be addressed but the services being reported are incorrect or not able to deal with the new problem that true Microsoft software used directly w/o going through the uninstalled now obsolete Comodo services have screwed up.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Other software providers could do the same kind of things as this. you cannot idiot-proof all software from all suppliers.&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp; do regularly backup to removeable hard disk, but not from years past, and that old a backup would not be a help anyway. If Comodo
 will not release a fix for this age old problem of their making, all we can do is boycott their software and try to encourage them to release a fix.&nbsp; They called their filter a "safe to delete filter".....&nbsp; Replacing certified MS files with modified 3rd party
 drivers is not good practice, but I am certain you as myself was not advized of the goings on here. So much time has passed that I do not remember even the Comodo software I had installed, but remnents left abandoned in my system registry say it was an Internet
 safety program. I've seen others in researching this that have the same type of problems from many of the comodo offerings. I will steer clear of it all in the future, and advise friends and relatives to do the same. If Comodo releases a fix for thier CFRDM
 integrated into FLTMC evidently through the registry I would certainly be willing to try the fix, and perhaps change my recommendations in the future.

<h2>            Can&#38;quot&#59;t connect to Live, Error Code 80151909</h2>
                    
<p>Never had any problems before &amp; this started&nbsp;a few&nbsp;days ago.I have followed&nbsp;suggestions in other threads except going through the process of deleting my profile since&nbsp;I can't access live to even try to retrieve it. I'm sure internet is working fine because
 I'm using my laptop now to do this. UI would appreciate any help in fixing this problem.</p>
<p>I'm in Hawaii. I have tried other devices to ensure my internet is working properly, restarted both the modem and xbox numerous times, cleared xbox system cache (3 times in a row), and reset xbox to factory connection settings.</p>
<p>My modem is a Toshiba pcx 2600 &amp; my isp is Time Warner. I don't use a router and hardwire directly to the modem..<b><br />

    <title>Cursor is jumping to top left corner in Window 10 Apps - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Cursor is jumping to top left corner in Window 10 Apps &#40;Settings&#41; and Windows Store Apps only.</h2>
                    <p>I can't find similar issues in the Community and this is a first for me.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All my Windows 10, Setting, Windows Start Menu and any Apps from Windows Store, the cursor position goes to the top left corner.&nbsp; I've tried to see if it was a key stuck on the keyboard,&nbsp; I'm on a desktop, I don't have a trackpad.&nbsp; Also when I try to move
 within the Setting option screen I can select boxes with my mouse, but I can't seem to open any links to open within Settings screens.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All my other software Microsoft Office 365, Sage 50, ScanSnap software works fine.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have Windows 10 Pro Edition, Version 1803 with the OS build 17134.228.&nbsp; I would really like it If I wouldn't need to re-install Windows and have to re-install other software.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone suggest a fix?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
