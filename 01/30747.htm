<h2>            Task View Crashing</h2>
                    So I've been trying to make use of task view on my laptop but for some reason it keeps crashing. No matter if I use three fingers to swipe up on my trackpad, or try to access it via my task bar, the task view would open and then, in less than 2 seconds,
 it automatically closes before I can do anything with it. Can someone help me figure out how to solve this issue?

            Hi Northmelon
<br />
<br />My name is Sarah Kong and I am an independent adviser that is here to try and help you with your issue.
<br />
<br />This maybe an issue with a system file being corrupt.
<br />You can try a couple things.
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />In Command prompt type sfc /scannow and press enter.
<br />Restart the computer.
<br />
<br />If that doesn't work then try this, 
<br />
<br />Right click your start button and select Command prompt (Admin) to bring up elevated Command prompt.
<br />
<br />In the Administrator: Command Prompt window, type the following commands. 
<br />Press Enter key after each command:
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Scanhealth
<br />
<br />DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
<br />
<br />Important: When you run this command, DISM uses Windows Update to provide the files that are required to fix corruptions.
<br />To close the Administrator: Command prompt window, type Exit, and then press Enter. 
<br />Restart your computer.       
        </p>

<p>Hi Sarah,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried to do the sfc scan but it told me, "You must be an administrator running a console session in order to use the sfc utility." Not really sure what this means....</p>

            Ah... so go to start - settings - accounts - your info.
<br />do you see your account as an administrator?
<br />
<br />if so make sure you right click the command prompt when you search for it and select run as administrator.

            Okay, I managed to run the scan on the Command Prompt but is says "Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them" and I'm not sure how to go about it from there.

            If you can log into Windows:
<br />To repair Windows without losing any data then you can try an in place upgrade repair:

<br />This will also upgrade you to the latest version of Windows - currently 1809.

            <p><span>Hello Roy,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The issue description seems a bit unclear and I would like to have a better understanding before we start working on it. I would appreciate if you could help me with more information.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>1. Which email client are you using for sending emails? Like: Outlook, Windows live or Mail app.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>2. Are you logged in using Microsoft account? When you say “he email icon is not even illuminated”.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>3. Are you trying to setup the Gmail account as a default mail address for sending pictures? When you say “I WANT/NEED my default from my picture viewer to be my Gmail account”.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Refer the links for more information:</span></p>

 that says: there is no mail account associated to perform the requested action. &nbsp;Please install an email program or, if one is already installed, create an association ".... &nbsp;in the default programs control panel.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I go to Control panel.... the default says "use current email account".... &nbsp;or something like that..... &nbsp;</p>
<p>

</p><p><em>Send to &gt; Mail recipient</em> and similar are Windows functions. All versions of Windows from 98SE to Vista included a mail client program (first Outlook Express, then Windows Mail). Windows 7 included no mail program, and Windows 8 comes only with the
 Mail app, which is not a true mail client. To use these Windows functions on W7 and 8, then, you have to install a mail client
 the default program.</p>
<p>

</p><p>Microsoft were required to pay hundreds of millions of dollars in fines for incorporating a browser into their operating system. It's not surprising they no longer take the risk of&nbsp;incorporating a mail client.</p>

<p>ok, so why are you still here?</p>
<p>i don't see a problem, other than you're only picking on 2 game series that have a new game every few years, Xbox does have a number of other games, plenty of new IPs this gen, and i've always heard Xbox being referred to as a shooters platform, no one really
 seems bothered by that... uppity fanboys excluded.</p>

<p>I just looked up that game and it looks like a bunch of cartoon chicks with big boobs. I'd rather see real ones so this game has zero interst to me.</p>
<p>I do agree that the competition has way more in terms of choice but I don't think the Xbox is dead because of it. Besides there is plenty of diversity on this console.</p>
<p>I've had my share of action games like GTA 5 and Watch_Dogs and RPG'S like The Witcher 3 and Dragon Age Inquisition and my racers and fighting games and FPS and my horror and my puzzlers and platformers and my point and click and strategy games and kids
 games for my kids. Let's not forget Sunset Overdrive which is brilliant and has some of the best controls and fun gameplay. I never have a problem finding a game that suits my needs at the time. All this was on Xbox 1.</p>
<p>There is plenty of variety on this console. I don't think people are flocking to the PS4 because of this game and a few others. They went there because of the hype of the powah of that console. Their lead that they have this gen has nothing to do with variety
 in my opinion.</p>
<p>Also don't forget about Uncharted Big Planet God of War 17.</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">brandiesel thank you, at least you see the problem. But it's not just "one" Game, it's a lot of Games. With each Game less that will be anywhere from a few hundred to tens of thousands of Players who own both Consoles that spend
 their money and time on just one Platform.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 1)">The loss of Games on the Xbox Platform is going to end it.&nbsp;When it's pretty much one Console Platform left,&nbsp;there will be no one or nothing to help Gamers. AAA and 1st Party on one Platform will be a long, cold and dead Gaming
 world. <br />

<p>as Genchy stated, that is your opinion, and so far you appear to have the biggest problem with this, as for your Senran Kagura problem, MS has tried in the past to bring JRPG and anime style games to the Xbox platform and for the most part received a lukewarm
 response from gamers, but there are other non-shooter games, in fact, i think that soda drinking sim might be to your liking.</p>

<p>Speaking of Senran, what type of game is it? All the videos show transformations and finishers so I'm assuming it's a fighting game?</p>
<p>I do remember thinking a few months ago that the competition is getting so many games that we are not. I'm not worried though as there are at least another year worth of games out now that I want to play. I'm planning on a PS4 anyway. &nbsp;I'm just waiting for
 the new God of War before I get it. </p>
<p>I think MS have an ace up their sleeve that we will see at E3.</p>

    <title>1903 update becoming a problem&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> stevelangton  say:</h3>
<h2>            1903 update becoming a problem&#33;</h2>
                    <p>Since updating Windows 10 to 1903:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Start button doesn't work with left click</p>
<p>2. Search bar doesn't work (at all)</p>
<p>3. Cortana doesn't work</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have tried:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Restarts, etc</p>
<p>2. Re-install Windows apps via PowerShell (fails)</p>
<p>3. Directly running StartMenuExperienceHost from the relevant Windows folder (fails, won't run)</p>
<p>4. Re-install Windows (1903) -keeping apps - from an image on USB (fails - erm, why?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am considering:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. Accepting the situation and waiting for some sort of corrective update</p>
<p>2. Reinstalling from scratch (very bad option as I'm writing up a PhD, I have a lot of related apps such as stats programs that would be difficult to reinstall, or would take more time than I have)</p>
<p>3. Install 3rd party shell (any suggestions?)</p>
<p>
</p><p>Advice, please. Thanks</p>
<p>

<p>Don't say it, Steve, I know you tried PowerShell reinstall already. And I assume you were knowledgeable enough to use the Admin Privileges.</p>

<p>Yes, tried everything!</p>
<p>Have now abandoned build 1903 and rolled back to the previous build, which fortunately works.</p>
<p>Maybe I'll try 1903 again in the future when more issues are fixed.</p>

<p>OK. Personally I haven't noticed any issues with 1903 but it is possible that your computer is reaching the age where updating becomes problematic. 3-5 years is currently the expected lifespan of most computers because of the speed of progress in the field.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is like (but even faster than) music players. You'll remember they started out with the old Edison phonographs that played wax cylinders...then they shifted to the more recognizable "licorice pizza" design flat, round, black discs.</p>
<p>They ran through 78RPM discs, 45RPM discs, 331/3rd RPM discs, and even 16RPM discs (those last were mostly talking books.)</p>
<p>When I came along in the 1950s all "phonographs" were equipped with those speeds and I had discs in all those speeds. The 78s were really fragile but worked great as Frisbees as long as someone caught them. This is because they were still being made of wax.
 The others were made out of vinyl by now which didn't crack or break as easily.</p>
<p>Meanwhile they'd gone from wind up phonographs where you made recordings by shouting down the megaphonic speaker (that also doubled as a microphone) to electronic recordings and from high fidelity (all the rage in the 1950s) to stereophonic. THEN IT BEGAN
 TO SPEED UP. Reel to reel tape was always there but now came 4 track tapes....then 8 track tapes...then cassettes...then CDS...then MP3s and THEN</p>
<p>People discovered vinyl again.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you were like me, you ended up buying your Beatles Collection in about 6 formats and wondering when Sir Paul was going to issue gift certificates for the next format upgrade so you wouldn't have to buy it in&nbsp; a SEVENTH format.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Well, that's how computers are changing, Only a LOT faster than people can actually get used to.</p>

                    i have 4desktop computers and a laptop all have windows 10 reserved for download, is there a way i can download on one computer then install it on the rest it would sure save a lot of bandwidth and i wouldn't have to keep on top of different computers
 and downloads especially when 3 of them are running wirelessly and it would take FOREVER to complete each download and upgrade<br />

<p>You can download a .ISO file and upgrade each computer offline. The ISO should be available by the time Windows 10 launches.</p>

This represents an unprecedented change in Microsoft's business model of requiring purchase of a license. Windows 10 will be offered two ways to existing Windows 7 and Windows 8/8.1 users. You will be able to download the update through Windows Update or you can download .ISO media and use it do an in place upgrade. For many persons, using ISO media will be the preferred method since you will have a backup copy for reinstall purposes if needed. Also for persons with limited bandwidth, this will be an excellent way avoid the need to download the update more than once if you have multiple computers. So lets take a look at upgrading

            <p>Looking to install on more then one computer - my recommendation is download the ISO or USB Key from the following Microsoft site:</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10</p>
<p>
</p><p>As an added bonus, you do not need to wait for your turn in the queue for the Reservation install.

            Thanks for the input i have installed it on my Laptop Seems fine but as soon as i try on my acer desktop it says the video card driver is incompatible and i get stuck with a generic windows driver at 1024x768 on a 27" monitor icons are too big for me,
 I like the computer the way it is windows 7 Home runs just fine...Like i saidabove leave well enough alone and it won't bite you in the long run...the Desktop keeps telling me i should upgrade but i just click out of it, I tried it twice and until all driver
 issues are ironed out and it's stable i WILL NOT upgrade to it again<br />

            Well it seems that the Upgrade copy of windows 10 refuses to accept Nvidia drivers of any sort i tried the geforce experience and it tried to download drivers for my video card and it outright came back with these drivers are NOT compatible with your video
 card i have a Nvidia GTX750TI that i just bought december 2014 and my other computer has a gefore 7650oc card and it keeps resetting the computer every half hour to hour as in soft reset and then windows was not shut down properly. FOR the time being WINDOWS
 10 will NOT be installed in my computers till either microsoft fixes this issue with nvidia or i am forced to upgrade and i will just avoid the windows 10 update and reinstall my windows 7 OEM copy from manufacturer.. This is a known issue that people are
 having on the net if you google it so it's just not me having this issue with the upgrade copy but people that bought it seem to have no problems at all. Microsoft should in good faith sent out copies of windows 10 so that we can do clea

            <p>Windows 7 has the .NET Framework 3.5 and earlier (2.0) redistributables already installed however some application installers are looking for very specific .NET 2.0 files and or registry entires that may not be in the ?Windows 7 versaion of .NET 3.5 (which
 included .NET 2.0) which can cause error messages:</p>

<p>Example:<br />
TurboTax 2009 can fail to install because it thinks the .NET Framework is not installed, even when it is<br />

With "Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5.1" expanded place a check mark in both options.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Your tax return is *not* in TurboTax. It's in a file on your computer. Worst case, you could copy that file to a thumb drive or CD, take it to the computer of a friend who is successfully running TurboTax, and print it out there.</p>

            How did you format Bitlocker? There are options that allow for automatic boot up without entering a key and an option that requires it.

<p><span><span>2. </span></span><span>Make is the make and model number of your computer?</span></p>
<p><span><span>3. </span></span><span>Are you experiencing this issue only with Internet Explorer or all the application?</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the article below to change the resolution of your computer:</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 1:</span></b></p>
<p><span>Change your screen resolution</span></p>

<p><span>If the issue is still not resolved, I would suggest you to uninstall the display drivers and re-install the same and check if that fixes the issue.</span></p>
<p><b><span>Method 2:<br />
</span></b><span>a. Click Start, type Device Manager in the Start search box and hit Enter.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Locate Display adapter and expand the same.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Select the display adapter you wish to uninstall.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Right-click and select Uninstall.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow the on-screen instructions. Restart the computer, if prompted.</span></p>
<p><span>After the computer restarts, visit the manufacturer’s website and download and install the latest chipset and display adapter drivers and check if that fixes the issue.</span></p>

    <title>How to change a .package file back to an &#34;Unknown application&#34; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            How to change a .package file back to an &#34;Unknown application&#34; when opened</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>&nbsp; I decided one day to play around with my .package file and accidentally pressed an app for the "open with" option.&nbsp; Now all my .package files go into photo albums when opened.&nbsp; The icon of the .package files also look like the photo album icon.&nbsp; I have
 watched many videos and read many threads on how to fix this issue but for some reason when a solution works for others it doesn't for me.&nbsp; For example, I watched a video explaining how to do the exact thing I want done.&nbsp; To revert my .package files back to
 being the default without a program to open it with.&nbsp; The video explains how you open up regedit into the search bar for Windows.&nbsp; The video then explains these further steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FileExts</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\FileExts\.package</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp; For me, since my issue has to do with the .package files, I went into the .package key.&nbsp; I later followed the instructions on deleting the UserChoice key and subkeys.&nbsp; I then deleted the subkeys in the OpenWithList key except for the top once that is called
 the DEFAULT subkey, as what was instructed by many forums and on this video.&nbsp; After doing all that and restarting my computer, the .package files still have the photo album icon and still has the photo album as its program to always open with.&nbsp; The first time
 I restarted my computer and nothing seemed to have changed, I went back into regedit to see if the files were there that I just deleted.&nbsp; They weren't.&nbsp; I then click on one of the .package files and it automatically opened up in photo albums.&nbsp; I decided one
 again to look into regedit and found that the subkey files in the OpenWithList had reappeared.&nbsp; No matter how many times I delete them they reappear if I click on the file.&nbsp; If I don't click on the file, the subkeys remain deleted but the .package files still
 have the photo album icon and still open in photo albums automatically.&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Because of the icon problem I decided to watch a video on how to change the file icon back to its default.&nbsp; I followed all these steps in the video and surprise, but nothing changed either.&nbsp; In that video you are instructed to go here&nbsp;
<span><span style="color: rgba(17, 17, 17, 1)"><span>%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local in task manager. (to run a new task) Then you are instructed to delete the IconCache. I did that which should have
<span><span style="color: rgba(17, 17, 17, 1)"><span>%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local in task manager. (to run a new task) Then you are instructed to delete the IconCache. I did that which should have
 put all icons back to their defaults. That did not work for my .package files either. I am at a loss and have run out of ideas on how to fix this. It anyone has any suggestions that were not mentioned in this post I would be happy to hear it. And again, what
 I want to be fixed are my icons for my .package files and would not like them to automatically be opened in photo albums. I want the .package to go back to its defaulted icon and to NOT open with ANY programs.</span></span></span></p>

    <title>UpdateOrchestrator Reboot task bug - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> marlon_tucker  say:</h3>
<h2>            UpdateOrchestrator Reboot task bug</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've disabled the group policy of "Enabling Windows update power management to automatically wake up the system to install&nbsp; scheduled updates" in the hope of stopping my computer from waking up from hibernate - it's a fairly loau desktop so it waking up
 means I wake up.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Disabling this policy changed the Reboot task to run a action of "Schedule Restart" - but that task still has the flag set to enable it to wake up the computer. So in affect, it wakes up my desktop to ask me when to schedule a restart... great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried writing a powershell script which fires on hibernate and disables this specific task, but seemingly it only works some of the time.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Editing the reboot task does not work, it must get routinely deleted / recreated by windows.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems like an immensely stupid condition to have, and I can't imagine I'm the only one with a desktop in my room.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Microsoft - please can I have *some* power back...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone got any sure fire methods of killing this task for good?</p>

 something's corrupt?&nbsp; The only thing corrupt is Microsoft thinking they need to take total control of our computers and not letting people who know what they're doing have any control at all.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Yesterday I applied the latest updates and rebooted to finish them.&nbsp; Yet Microsoft *still* set the Reboot task in UpdateOrchestrator to reboot my machine at 3:30am.&nbsp; WHY?!?&nbsp; There was nothing left to finish.&nbsp; You know I rebooted my machine.&nbsp; So why schedule
 it again?</p>
<p>
</p><p>It wouldn't be so bad if Microsoft wakes up my machine in the middle of the night to do whatever, but it NEVER PUTS IT BACK TO SLEEP!!&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; So I wake up to a machine that's been on and doing who knows what (since you never tell us what) all night long.&nbsp;
 You didn't even tell me that the reboot task was set so I get to wonder what's going on and spend MORE of my time researching it.&nbsp; Thanks so much!</p>

<p>It's 6 AM here, in a few minutes. I usually wake up at 8 AM, but today is a very special day.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I had a weird dream, it woke me up. Trying to fall asleep again, I noticed the silent hum of my PC's fans. I put it to sleep again by a few key strokes, lied on the bed again and tried to fall asleep. A few moments later, not sure how long after, I heard
 it waking up from sleep mode again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But what woke up my PC? I have Wake on LAN disabled, I have Power Settings set so that no scheduled tasks wake up PC from sleep. I have even gone as far as setting UpdateOrchestrator's Reboot task not to wake up my PC. But I was suspecting this one and I
 was damn right about that. When I found that task, it showed that it successfully ran just few minutes ago.</p>
<p>
</p><p>And it was all enabled again. To wake up my PC and make my life a walk in hell. So I didn't stick to just disabling it. I went to Windows/Tasks folder, made myself the sole owner and administrator and locked SYSTEM users out of doing anything but reading
 and executing. Am I sure this is safe? Nope.</p>
<p>
</p><p>But especially when I go to work, I want to have a good night's sleep. I was deprived of that today. Please find out what incompetent bunch of fools made UpdateOrchestrator to bypass the Power Settings configuration. Don't tell them. Don't fire them. Just
 keep waking them up every single night at 2 AM to 5 AM when it hurts the most. Until they realize it is not a great idea to do that to users. Thanks in advance. (Even though I doubt anyone will do that.)</p>

<p>At least, please, stop doing all that shady business at night. It might be useful if the PC is in an office where most people don't stay overnight and nobody sleeps there. It could also be nice for saving CPU time in business hours, some large US corporations
 use laptops with ULV dual-core Intel CPUs as a standard equipment for software development. Doesn't that sound well, honey? I could be grateful for the CPU intensive tasks to run at night. Restarting the PC is a big "no" anyway, PCs sometimes work at night,
 too.</p>

</p><p>It is straight BAD when it happens at home. It might have been slightly useful in the single-core past times, but not anymore. If it doesn't wake up anyone, at least it wastes money on electricity bills. I keep setting it off, but new Windows, new ways to
 wake you up. Could you instead show me some notification bubble that Windows Update wants me to restart the PC, instead? I know, I'm a user, I am supposed to be an idiot. But I am not.</p>

<p>I have Three Dell computers <strong>waking up</strong> randomly from <strong>hibernate</strong> (Dell Optiplex GX620, Dell Optiplex 620, Dell Optiplex 755) and I have tried all known remedies on the Internet, including an old registry fix.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows 10 v1703 was OK (apart from AppxStaging and Restore Point failure); Windows 10 v 1709 is NOT OK.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is either a Microsoft issue or a Dell issue.&nbsp; I have deleted most of the tasks listed in task scheduler.&nbsp; Currently I am in Task Manager disabling items on a suck-it-and-see path to success/failure.</p>
<p>
</p><p>UpdateOrchestrator and Windows Update are clear candidates as are Remote Procedure Call (RPC); DCOM Server Process Launcher; RPC Endpoint Manager.&nbsp; Reboot doesn't delete or disable and it isn't possible to get ownership of it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Don't waste too much time on the orthodox remedies on the Internet.&nbsp; Not a Power Options problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not a software engineer but my progress is faster than Microsoft's to date.&nbsp; If you have any success please post on TenForums or SuperUser since I am SimonFastEddy...the fastest at getting out of bed in the West.</p>

<h2>            Yubikey login support</h2>
                    I have an older Yubikey (2.4.2), which does not do CCID and is therefore not compatible with Windows Hello. Is there a way to use it in conjunction with my password to enable two-factor identification to login to Windows 10? I have been unable to find
 a way to do so thus far.

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If <em><strong>Microsoft Paint</strong></em> automatically opens when viewing images on your device, then it is possible that it is set as the default image viewer. To turn off/change this feature, you can follow the steps below:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Click the <strong>Start</strong> menu or <strong>Windows</strong> icon.</li><li>Select <strong>Settings</strong> or the <strong>Cog</strong> icon.</li><li>Select <strong>System</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Default apps</strong>.</li><li>Under <strong>Photo viewer</strong>, click the default application and set it to
<strong>Photos</strong> to view pictures using the <strong>Photos</strong> app.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Once you're done check if the issue persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We'll appreciate if you can send us an update.</p>

<h2>            Touch screen stops after wake up &#40;possibly&#41; caused by EAS</h2>
                    <p>All,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>I have an Acer R7-371T convertible touch screen laptop and have been having issues with touch screen malfunction from the start. The problem is that if the PC is enforced into sleep mode the touch screen is not functioning after a wake-up. A reset is the
 only option.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I discovered that the EAS (Exchange Active Sync) policy enforced by my employer may be the cause of this. Looking at the Exchange policy rules I could not find any reason for this but let me explain what happens:</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. After a clean install of my Laptop there is no issue whatsoever. Personally defined power rules about screen-off and sleep are not causing the no-touchscreen issue and in fact, the laptop is working as it is supposed to work;</p>
<p>2. After installing the EAS mail in the Windows Mail app ("metro", not outlook) the policy of my employer is pushed (and accepted) on my laptop. One of the policy rules is that after five minutes of inactivity the lock-screen is pushed enforcing me to re-enter
 my password. And within a minute after the lock screen is shown the PC-screen is switched off. From that moment on, after awaking the laptop, the touch screen is malfunctioning.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a known issue? How can I resolve this? What can I ask my employer to change in the policy to stop this malfunction?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks and best regards,</p>
<p>Ben</p>

            Sometimes it takes some time to get this reflected in your account. But it should reflect in your account within 1 min to 30 mins. Try following - 
<br />
<br />1. Login to your account on Web portal and verify that your purchase has gone through (look into Purchase history) and your account is updated with the info. 
<br />
<br /><a href="https://secure.skype.com/account/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://secure.skype.com/account/</a>
<br />
<br />2. Open your Skype of desktop, sign out and sign-in again. The credit should reflect now.
<br />
<br />3. Now if it is still not reflecting in your account,  I will advise you to talk to a live agent and get this reflected in your account.
<br />
<br /><a href="https://go.skype.com/help.support.skype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://go.skype.com/help.support.skype</a>
<br />
<br />Not all options in chat support allow you to chat with a live agent. When you click on above link, choose following to reach out to a live agent as per your problem category.
<br />
<br />Choose a help topic - Payment &amp; Orders
<br />Choose a related problem - Any option is OK
<br />Next
<br />Now you will the get the option of - Text chat support

<br />Do let me know if you have any more question or require further help. If above didn't work, I will supply more troubleshooting steps to solve this problem.

            <p>Once you have done the Anytime Upgrade exercise, the Windows&nbsp;7 Starter product key can no longer be used. If you had not activated Windows 7 Starter prior to upgrading, then you might have to start all over.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are using a Windwos 7 Home Premium retail full or upgrade license that was previously in use; then you will need to reactivate by telephone:</p>
<p>
</p><p>&nbsp;How to activate Windows 7 manually (activate by phone)<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1) Click Start, and in the Search box type:&nbsp;&nbsp; slui.exe&nbsp; 4<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2) Next press the 'ENTER' key<br />
&nbsp;<br />
3) Select your 'Country' from the list.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
4) Choose the 'Phone Activation' option.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
5) Stay on the phone (do not select/press any options) and wait for a person to help you with activation.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
6) Explain your problem clearly to the support person.<br />

</p><p>You have the option of trying direct phone activation during the week and see if someone else can help:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Direct Activation number: (888) 725-1047</p>
<p>1-800-936-5700</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Resetting to original factory state:</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>New computers that come preinstalled with Windows 7 often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into when you start your computer by pressing
 a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular makes..</p>
<span>
<p>For Dell, press F8 on the keyboard until the Advanced Boot Options menu appears on the screen.</p>
</span><span>
<p>For HP, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For LG, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</p>
<p>For Toshiba, press and hold '0' BEFORE and during the power up</p>
<p>For Acer, press and hold ALT + F10 as soon as you see the logo</p>
<p>For Asus, press F9 as soon as you see the Asus logo.</p>
<p>For Samsung, press F4 at power up.. </p>
<p>For Fujitsu, press the F8 key repeatedly directly after powering up</p>
<p>For Advent, restart your computer. Then Press F10 repeatedly until the message "Starting System Recovery" is displayed</p>
<p>For Sony VAIO, restart and press "F8" or "F10" repeatedly until the "Advanced Boot Options" screen appears.</p>

I did do&nbsp;a factory reset many moons ago (for&nbsp;entirely different reasons) but that&nbsp;factory reset option&nbsp;seems to have disappeared in this mishap. I did manage to salvage my files, thanks goodness.

<p>
</p><p>On salvaging the&nbsp;netbook itself which is a stock&nbsp;eM350, what is the latest operating system that I&nbsp;can put on the machine? One that I can still buy?&nbsp;It may be&nbsp;the last chance to prolong the useful&nbsp;life of the machine.</p>

            If the Windows 8.1 product key came as a part of that machine, then the answer is no, you can't transfer it else where. If its a retail store bought Windows 8.1 product key, then yes, you can use it.

</span></p>
<p><span>I think it may be related to the Raid drivers or possibly a usb serial adapter</span></p>

<p>Problem is fixed for me! The problem originated because I was getting a message saying that Microsoft updated their user agreement, and I could play until I signed in and agreed to the new terms, but when I tried to sign in, I'd get the error code.</p>
<p>FIX: I used a different browser (internet explorer) to go to www.xbox.com. Once there I tried to sign in from there and the new user agreement popped up. Once I agreed to the terms it signed me in. Then when I went back in through solitaire, it signed me
 in no problem - no error codes!</p>
<p>Hope this helps you guys - good luck! </p>

<h3> l3en 93  say:</h3>
<h2>            xbox live rewards - are the stats broken&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>so this chart puts all the times youve played either a singleplayer or multiplayer game on a chart along with the amount of time youve played it for.</p>
<p>But on mine the stats must be wrong because it says the in april and may i apperently played singleplayer for just under 700 hours in each month</p>
<p>and it cant be accumulatated game time over the months because in june it goes down.... to 600 hours</p>
<p>another reason why it cant be right as it means that in one month i played singleplayer for 29 days&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Has this happened to anyone else or am i just being stupid?</p>

            No.<br />
<br />
It is NOT an Upgrade path.<br />
<br />
32bit and 64bit are two completely different Operating Systems.<br />
<br />
The only way to change&nbsp;32bit Ultimate to 64bit Ultimate&nbsp;is to do a clean install with a FULL Vista&nbsp;Ultimate 64bit&nbsp;Operating System.<br />

<h2>            how to stop Windows 10 desktop auto lock after 1 minute of inactivity requiring password</h2>
                    I am operating Windows 10 and my machine automatically goes into lock screen after one minute of inactivity. My settings for screen saver and lock screen are not set for one minute and this automatic one minute lock gets very frustrating. Please assist
 in a solution to stop my machine from automatically going into lock screen after one minute.
