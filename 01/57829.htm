                    <p><b>Hi, thanks for visiting Xbox Support! I'm Faith F.<br />19:29</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>Hello. How are you today?<br />19:29</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>Im good thanks<br />19:29</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>That is good. How may I help you?</b></p><b>

<p>19:30</p>

<p>Me<b>i keep getting that error code when trying to set up my sons xbox<br />19:30</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>Can you tell me the Error code that you are getting and where you are at when you are getting the error code.&nbsp;<br /><br />19:31</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>0x80a40008<br />19:32</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>Thank you so much for that. Can you tell me what it is that you are doing when you get that and where you are in the setup&nbsp;process?<br /><br />19:32</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>i get the error code when trying to set his account up<br />19:32</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>it states he needs a parent account to set it up<br />19:33</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>Hello<br />??<br />19:36</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>I am more than happy to help you with that. I do apologize that my system is going through some updates. Whenever you put that on the console you will have to set up a parent account to the child account.&nbsp;<br /><br />19:37</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>I can help you get that set up today! Do you have your own Microsoft Account already or would you need to set one up?<br />19:37</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>i have one its the one im using for support. I also have his account<br />19:38</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>My account : *** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />Sons Account : *** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />19:39</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>Ok great. All you need to do is put your account on the console, then you will put his account on there. We will go into the settings and then set up the Family. Once your family on the Xbox is set up then you are good to go.&nbsp;<br /><br />19:39</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>Go ahead and go on the console and go to Add/Manage then select Add New. Then add your account to the Xbox console.<br />19:39</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>Ive done that my account is on there when i try to finish the family i get this error<br />19:40</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>Ok. What we need to do is remove the profiles and re add them. For some reason something isn't going through right. Do me a favor and go ahead and remove your profile and his.&nbsp;<br /><br />19:42</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>Go to Settings &gt; Account &gt; Remove account. There you will be able to remove his&nbsp;and your account.<br />19:43</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>ok one sec<br />19:43</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>I used to be on a family account asa child my self but this ended when xbox one came out ... I think this is the reason as i had issues with this in the past. with it asking for my farthers password<br />19:44</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>its still doing the same , its very annoying<br />19:45</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>OK. So is the Adult account that is going on here still in another Family?<br /><br />19:45</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>Maybe as it ended it was before family was created it was the 360 version where you got a deal on 5 gold accounts for Â£100<br />19:47</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>1 parent account and 4 child accounts<br />19:47</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>according to my Microsoft account im in a family account&nbsp;<br /><br />account holder *** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />19:49</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>Ok. If you are in another family you will have to be removed from that Family before you can be in another family. And if you are still getting the error then what we need to do is remove every single account from the console and turn it off. That is the solution to the error code that you are getting. If that doesn't work then we will go ahead and reset the console.&nbsp;<br /><br />19:50</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>And if you are in a family with that account holder then you won't be able to set up a family today until you are removed from the other family<br /><br />19:50</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>How can i get out the account the guy dont like 60 haha<br />19:50</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>can i leave on my own free will?<br />19:51</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>What you will have to do is have that Family or any one of the Adults in that Xbox Family to remove you. Are you an Adult in that family or was the account put on there as a child account?<br /><br />19:52</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>I was a child but obviously ive grown up now<br />19:53</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>im out of it how can i get him in it can you do it ?<br />19:54</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>Ok. Whenever you are in a family with another Xbox. Then you will have to have one of the Adults of that family remove you from that family.&nbsp;<br /><br />19:54</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>Do you have any way to contact who you were in the family with.<br />19:54</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>no<br />19:56</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>he like 60<br />19:56</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>he will have no idea what im even talking about<br />19:56</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>this is a nightmare<br />19:56</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>I really do hate that. I do know that at this time in order for you to set up an Xbox Family or be in a Family with other Xbox accounts you will have to be removed from the other Xbox Family. As soon as you are removed from the other Family you will be able to set up a new Xbox Family.&nbsp;<br /><br />19:57</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>how if i cant i mean im 30 now !!!<br />19:59</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>Right. I understand what you are saying. What you would more than likely have to do until you can get out of the other family is create a new adult account just for this Family so you can control your sons account. I do know that when you have a Child account set that the Parent account has to control in order for them to do most things then you will have to go in there account and change all of their settings for them to have the permission to get on certain stuff. That can all be done but you will have to either remove yourself from the other family or create a new adult account.&nbsp;<br /><br />20:01</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>seems like a cop out ... surely you have the power to take me out ?!<br />20:03</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>The only way that I can mess with your Family is to help add a member to your Microsoft Family. Your Microsoft Family and your Xbox Family are completely different. In order for you to be in the Xbox Family you will have to be out of the other Family first. This is only to help prevent children from getting out of your Family and getting into a Family where the Adult account is just going to let them do whatever they want and there is no way for you the actual parent to control their account because they are in another Xbox Family.&nbsp;<br /><br />20:05</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>But im 30 im not a child my account has my date of birth on ... i mean come on ... I dont want to be in this family any more<br />20:07</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>Right. I more than understand what you are saying. If I had any way to remove you from the other Xbox Family I would have already done that for you. All you have to do is get any other Adult that is in the Xbox Family that you are in and remove you from the Family or go to where the Family was created and just remove yourself from it. I really do hate this for you and I hate that this is happening. Hopefully it wopmn<br /><br />20:09</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>Hopefully you can get out of the other Family and get this one set up.<br />20:09</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>it states im an adult on my acvcount<br />20:10</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>David Blick&nbsp;<br />*** Email address is removed for privacy ***<br />Adult&nbsp;<br /><br />I cant screenshot<br />20:11</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>Right. I know that you are an Adult. All you have to do is remove yourself or have another Adult remove your self from that other Family and you will be good to go.&nbsp;<br /><br />20:14</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>Ive done that now, this is not fun at all<br />20:15</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>my step dads given me his password im gone and out<br />20:15</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>now how can i add my son to my family account :/<br />20:15</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>Ok. Whenever you are dealing with Adult Accounts and Child accounts, what do you mean that your step dad gave you the information to his account?<br /><br />20:17</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>yes step dad gave me his old password all is good in the world<br />20:18</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>thanks i think i done it<br />20:18</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>Haha. Ok. As soon as you get that set up you just invite the child account and the child account will have to accept the invite to be in the Family. Once that is done then you are done. Were you able to get it added or what part are you at?<br /><br />20:19</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>i still get same error message :@<br />20:22</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>Ok. What you will need to do is go ahead and remove every single profile from the console. And then we will need to do a Factory Reset to Default Settings. The error code that you are getting is a specific code. If you are positive that none of the accounts that you are messing with are in another Xbox Family then we need to go to Settings &gt; System Settings &gt; Console Info and Updates &gt; Reset my console And Keep My Games and Apps.&nbsp;<br /><br />20:24</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>done that including reset did that<br />20:28</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>Ok. You have already done that before or you just did that now?<br /><br />20:28</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>whilst we was talking<br />20:28</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>Ok, and you are still getting the error code?<br /><br />20:28</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>did it before before i tried to sign in again as i knew that would be the next thing you would say<br />20:29</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>Im getting the exact same error code<br />20:29</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>what does the error code mean?<br />20:29</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>This is the error code.&nbsp;<br /><br />20:30</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b><br /></b></p><p><b>This may mean one of the following things:</b></p><b>

<ul><li>There's an Xbox Live connectivity issue.</li><li>You entered the wrong Microsoft account information (email address or password).</li><li>There's an issue with your Microsoft account.</li><li>You have too many accounts saved to your Xbox One console.</li></ul>

<p>20:30</p>

<p>Faith F<b>Go to this link for me.&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/error-code-lookup?code=0x80a40008" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/error-code-lookup?code=0x80a40008</a><br />20:30</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>I can use my account but his is brandnew , never been signed into except on the PC just now to join the family<br />20:31</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>the xbox is also fresh out the box<br />20:31</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>Other than removing all of the profiles and everything, it does say that the final solution is to do a Factory Reset on the console. It does look like at this time if you are getting the error then there are too many accounts on the console. Or there is an issue with the Microsoft Account that you are using when getting this error code.<br /><br />20:32</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>there is only two accounts and yeah they is an issue with my account thats why im on to support<br />20:33</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>So is your account still in the other Xbox Family?<br /><br />20:33</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>haha, no no no, lets not go back there<br />20:34</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>im in my own famiuy now<br />20:34</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>with my son as the child account and me as the adult account<br />20:34</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>I was able to refresh your account and see that there is a child that was successfully added to your Microsoft Account Family. So whatever is happening on the console is something that is just not going through right. Have you went on the sons email and accepted the invitation to be in the family?<br /><br />20:35</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>yes i did via my account though, it asked for his password to sign in andf then stated he was now in my family<br />20:36</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>Ok great. What is the exact step that you are doing on the Xbox that gives you that error code?<br /><br />20:37</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>after my son signs in it ask for an adult to sign in. So I do .... i then gives an error code but still lets me sign in<br />20:40</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>then the process repeats<br />20:40</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>Ok. Have you completely removed all of the accounts from the console and then added the Adult back first then the Child account back second?<br /><br />20:41</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>no i havent tried that i dont think its worth a try i suppose<br />20:41</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>Ok. Because that is one of the steps in the solution to your error code. Do me a favor and bring up this link for me. This is the error code that you are getting, the reasons that it is happening and the solutions to fix that.<br />20:44</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b><a href="http://support.xbox.com/en-US/error-code-lookup?code=0x80a40008" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.xbox.com/en-US/error-code-lookup?code=0x80a40008</a><br />20:44</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>Im doing a factory reset as well just to spice it up a bit<br />20:46</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>Ok. That is the last solution in your steps to fix that.&nbsp;<br /><br />20:46</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>I think that it is going to help you get this cleared up!!<br />20:46</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>I really hope so<br />20:46</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>I do too. I really do believe that this is going to help. Whenever that comes back up go ahead and put the Adult Account back on first and then the child account second.&nbsp;<br /><br />20:49</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>same error code FML<br />20:51</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>I think my account is acctually broken<br />20:53</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>OH MY GOSH. I really do hate all of this for you. Did you say that this console is brand new?<br />20:53</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>yes bought today<br />20:54</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>Ok. You might need to take this console back and get a new one. Have you had any other issues with anything other than this on this console.<br />20:55</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>I have another in the house if i try on that can we assume its my account ?<br />20:56</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>Yeah that would great. If you can go ahead and try it on the other Xbox,.&nbsp;<br /><br />20:56</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>Guess what , still the same issue<br />20:59</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>Ok. What you might have to do is create a new account for the child account. I tell you what. Do me a favor and go to this link for me before we do anything else&nbsp;<a href="http://login.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">login.live.com</a>&nbsp;and just log into your account for me. If that goes through then we are going to try something else.<br /><br />21:00</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>I don't mean create a new child account I meant create a New Adult account to attach to the child account. But we are going to look at just&nbsp; few things before we do that.<br />21:00</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>yes it lets me log in<br />21:03</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>My account is UK and American, would that be an issue<br />21:04</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>Ok perfect. Now stay there for me. On your console are you going to your Settings and then going to Add Family Member and then signing into the child account that way? And what do you mean. I know that the region that is on your Microsoft Account needs to match the region that your console is set to. So everything should be set to the United Kingdom.&nbsp;<br /><br />21:04</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>its currently set to UK<br />21:05</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>Ok.<br />21:05</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>This is what we should be doing on your console.&nbsp;<br /><br />21:05</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b><br /></b></p><ol><li><b>press the&nbsp;Xbox&nbsp;button&nbsp;to open the guide.</b></li><li><b>Select&nbsp;Sign in.</b></li><li><b>Scroll down and select your account to sign in.</b></li><li><b>After you're signed in, press the&nbsp;Xbox&nbsp;button&nbsp;to open the guide.</b></li><li><b>Select&nbsp;Settings.</b></li><li><b>Select&nbsp;All Settings.</b></li><li><b>Under&nbsp;Account, select&nbsp;Family. This section shows all the current members of your family.</b></li><li><b>Select&nbsp;Add to family.</b></li><li><b>Select the profile for the person you want to add, and then press the&nbsp;A&nbsp;button&nbsp;on your controller.</b></li></ol><b>

<p>21:05</p>

<p>Me<b>no i sign in as me then sign in as my son then it prompts for adult to sign in<br />21:06</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>And it is talking about the Adult Account at the beginning of that. You will do all of this from the Adult Account. Not the child account.&nbsp;<br /><br />21:06</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>i will try that now<br />21:06</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>Ok. Perfect.<br />21:06</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>Let me know if you need any help with that.&nbsp;<br /><br />21:09</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>still dont work<br />21:10</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>his account states somthing weird though<br />21:10</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>Ok. Whenever you are going on your console. You are signing into the Parent account and then you are going to the Family. Then you are trying to add him to the Family under that Adult account. What is his account saying?<br /><br />21:11</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>SampleBug431768<br />allister<br />21:11</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>That is his gamer tag.<br /><br />21:11</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>we never got that far<br />21:11</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>The Allister isn't apart of it but the SampleBug431768 is the Gamer Tag.<br />21:11</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>Ok. Sign out of everything and go to your account and sign in. Sign out of his account and go to your account and sign in.<br />21:12</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>ok he never chose that<br />21:12</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>Yes that is ok. That is the very first pre generated Gamer Tag that was given to the account. The account that he is on will be able to customize that the first time for free.<br />21:13</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>Are you on the child account on the console now or are you on the Adult account?<br /><br />21:14</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>ok done that still the same issue .... cant keep doing the same thing<br />21:15</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>Im the adult gamer tag<br />21:16</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>i go to family it sees my son i sign in multple times<br />21:16</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>it gets error code<br />21:17</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>Ok. I do hate that this is happening. If you are not able to sign into the Adult account and then go to the Family and set that up then you might need to create a New Adult account. Whenever this is happening over and over and on the other console then it sounds like maybe there is something wrong with the account. If you are still getting the same error code and you have already removed all of the profiles and done a Factory Reset on the console then you are going to have to create a New Adult account just to control his account with. That is the only thing that you would need to use it for. Because there is something that is preventing your account from controlling his account.<br />21:18</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>Exactly i want him to have my xbox live ect though i want to monitor him easily as he is only 11 and is a handfull already ect .... i need this to work or he has to use my account.... last time i doid that on his 360 he bought games on my account somehow :'( i need this fixing pllllease<br />21:20</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>Ok. All you have to do is go to your account and set your account as the Home account. Then he will be able to get on his account and play the Gold on his&nbsp;account. Even if you set up a parent account only to control his account then you can put that account on the console. There is something on your current account that is blocking this. You can still game share and gold share with him even if this is not the parent account that is attached to the child account.&nbsp;<br /><br />21:22</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>So there is no way to escalate this to some guy who can find out whats blocking this<br />21:24</b></p><b>

<p>Faith F<b>At this time there is no Escalation that is set up for this issue. What we have to do is figure out what is blocking that. What you can do in the mean time just to get this going is set up an account to just purely run the child account. And you are positive that you or your child isn't set up under any other Family or Xbox at this time? What about on the other console. Is the Child already set up under a Family or is anything like this already set up on the other console?<br /><br />21:27</b></p><b>

<p>Me<b>no fresh account setup today<br />21:28</b></p><b>

</b></b><p><b><b>Faith F<b>Ok. The child account was set up today. What about your account. Is your account set up on your other console in the Family at all?<br /><br />21:28<br /></b></b></b></p></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b></b>

    <title>Backup and Restore fails when volumes are re-ordered or extended - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Backup and Restore fails when volumes are re-ordered or extended</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">I decided to upgrade from my 250GB SSD to a 500GB one due to running low on space. I'm using Acronis True Image 2017 to do this. I'm using Acronis "Recovery" with drive signature (rather than disk cloning
 directly). The normal drive layout on the original SSD (and backup image) is like this:</span><br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi16.photobucket.com%2falbums%2fb19%2fsuraj8707%2foriginal%2520ssd%2520layout.jpg" /><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">And once the image has been recovered to the new drive, it's like this:</span><br />
<br />
<img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fi16.photobucket.com%2falbums%2fb19%2fsuraj8707%2fnew%2520ssd%2520layout.jpg" /><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">The issue I'm having is that whenever I extend C: to use the rest of the unallocated space, or even just having the unallocated space between C: and the 450MB Recovery partition - backup and restore fails.
 The error codes are different for each case.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">With the unallocated partition moved to the left of the 450MB recovery, and then C: extended to use the unallocated space - Backup spits out the error: Windows Backup encountered an internal error. Please
 review your settings and retry the operation. Details: Incorrect function. Error code: 0x81000001.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Even with the unallocated space being left between C: and the 450MB recovery but not being utilised, it fails with the error: Windows Backup failed while trying to read from the shadow copy on one of the
 volumes being backed up. Please check in the event logs for any relevant errors. Error code: 0x81000037.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">What's even more interesting is that when using "AEOMI Partition Assistant" to move the unallocated space back to the end of the drive - it slightly increases the recovery partition to 454MB. But despite
 this - the backup then succeeds. I expected it to fail due it not recognising the recovery as a 450MB partition.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">After trawling through google for hours on the first error code I came across a couple interesting pages which stated that Backup has some sort of 150GB (roughly) file size limit. Any single file beyond
 this size, and backup and restore fails. Someone suggested that perhaps Backup is seeing the additional 227GB of free space as a "file" and hence the error code?</span><br />
<br />
<span style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">In both cases the backup fails right at the end (pretty much gets to 99%). Anyone got any ideas? I'd like to carry on using it if possible.</span></p>

<p>Your feeling was correct. I just started from scratch and it does work.&nbsp; I simply deleted the whole folder, and started over.&nbsp; I should have renamed or moved it just in case, but the PC was running good so I took a chance.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm guessing it's a security feature, or some inherent algorithm in the code, that blocks the attempt because the partitions are not the same as the original.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In my case, all I did was copy C: drive to a larger drive; changing nothing.&nbsp; Partition Magic assumed I wanted to extend the partition, which was true, and it did.&nbsp; There was only one MBR partition--no Reserved or Recovery.&nbsp; Mine is a W10 Anniv. upgrade
 from 7.</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 unable to get updates</h2>
                    I have turned on the option for automatically updating Windows 10, but it doesn't seem to work. The only windows update installed are for Windows Defender. And it's not showing any updates to install or whether there are no updates to be installed.

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you are not getting any prompts to install Windows 10, I would suggest you to use the media creation tool to download the ISO file and perform an upgrade installation. You can download the media creation tool from the following link:</p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/windows10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/software-download/windows10</a>
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Once you have the ISO file, you can open the ISO file in the File Explorer and click on the 'Setup.exe' file to initiate the upgrade. Make sure that you don't perform a clean install (by booting from the installation media) as this will make your PC ineligible
 for the free upgrade.</p>

<p>Hello Kobi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>This glitch from your monitor can be caused by several factors like software issues and applications conflicting with your settings. To help you resolve this,
<strong>clean boot</strong>, follow the simple steps below:</span></p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li><strong>Start your PC in safe mode to use it while in a basic state</strong>. This means that the your device will only use a limited set of files and drivers. To perform this, follow the guide from this
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12376/windows-10-start-your-pc-in-safe-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
<strong>link</strong></a>.</li><li><strong>Perform a clean boot in Windows</strong><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">.
</span>This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 10<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">. For the instructions, check this
<strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929135/how-to-perform-a-clean-boot-in-windows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">article</a></strong>.</span></li></ol>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)"><em><strong>Note</strong>: </em></span><em>Please go through the section: "How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting" of the Kb article to boot the computer in normal startup after fixing the
 issue. </em></p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue is still there after following the suggested methods above, we suggest that you run the Microsoft Safety Scanner. Note that a<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">ny data files that are infected may only be cleaned by deleting the file entirely, which
 means there is a potential for data loss. Access the tool <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">here</a></strong>.</span></p>

How did you purchase it?<br />
&nbsp; <br />
How are you attempting to install it?<br />

If I have read what you described correctly - it's not automatically installing.&nbsp; This is not surprising as best practices is for things to NOT automatically run without end-user involvement.&nbsp; Although autorun and autoplay were convenient, in terms of security
 and their potential danger, it was best to be rid of them.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
There is another possibility: your system cannot even read the media.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Which is it?<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Can you open "Computer" and browse (explore) the CD/DVD drive with the media in it to see the contents?&nbsp; If so, what happens when you double-click on any "setup.exe", "setup", "install" or such named file(s) you find there?<br />
&nbsp; <br />
You do need, I believe, other components (C++ redistributable and .NET Framework 3.5 I think) installed to make it run correctly and perhaps even install.&nbsp; Although the installer may handle that for you.<br />

            It is a limitation in the 32bit system.&nbsp; The ~1.5 gigs that are unavailable are probably being used by your video card.<br />

I would not run that software as you have no idea what it contains.&nbsp; It could easily contain malware.<br />

    <title>BSOD&#39;s on returning from sleep - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mrquiksilver  say:</h3>
<h2>            BSOD&#39;s on returning from sleep</h2>
                    <p>I recently Upgraded my computer on 5/6/14 with a new motherboard (ASUS m5A99Fx Pro R2.0), CPU (AMD FX-8350), PSU (Corsair HX850), and GPU (XFX R9 290). Since i installed a bunch of new components i had to do a fresh install of windows and the BSOD's followed
 shortly after.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This doesn't happen every time I try and wake my computer up from sleep, sometimes when i attempt to wake my computer up from sleep i hear it start up but my screen remains black and my keyboard does not light up. It later attempts to resume windows after
 i press the reset button on my computer but takes a really long time to resume and occasionally says "windows explore has stopped working..." and the background turns white.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here are the Mini Dumps:</p>

<p>
</p><p>Thinking it was the HDD, I ran a disk check just the other day and here's the output:</p>
<p><a href="https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=697CD2CA8EC05636!186&amp;authkey=!AKFS8IYxxa8q8Hc&amp;ithint=file%2c.txt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=697CD2CA8EC05636!186&amp;authkey=!AKFS8IYxxa8q8Hc&amp;ithint=file%2c.txt</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>Things I have tried:</p>
<p>Replaced/ re-seated the SATA cable to the HDD</p>
<p>ran check disk</p>
<p>installed the latest video drivers&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Thanks for your help,</p>

            <p>Hi Josh,</p>
<p>
</p><p>We have various bug checks:</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><strong>KERNEL_DATA_INPAGE_ERROR (7a)</strong></span><br />
<br />
<em>This bug check indicates that the requested page of kernel data from the paging file could not be read into memory.</em><br />

</p><p>This is specifically an ATI/AMD based bug check. If we take a look at the call stack, we can see the AMD video driver called directly into the bug check as opposed to Windows going through its traditional fault handling, etc:</p>

You can run it via Windows or DOS. Do note that the only difference is simply the environment you're running it in. In Windows, if you are having what you believe to be device driver related issues that may cause conflicts or false positive, it may be a wise
 decision to choose the most minimal testing environment (DOS).<br />
<br />
Run all tests <em><strong>EXCEPT</strong></em>: Fix All and anything Advanced.</p>

            <p>Hi America Reef,</p>
<p>System Restore may help resolve the issue if a system setting was changed that caused the issue. If you installed any new hardware or software in the past week, make sure you have a way to reinstall.</p>

No, Microsoft would not call you unsolicited. Nor would they know if any errors <br />
existed on your computer. So those are frauds or scams, to get your money or <br />
worse to steal your identity. <br />
<br />
Avoid scams that use the Microsoft name fraudulently - Microsoft does not make <br />
unsolicited phone calls to help you fix your computer<br />

            Hi OBX-HUNTER,
<br />
<br />Are you wanting your computer to auto-log you in on startup? You can auto-login to your account by opening the run dialog (Windows key on keyboard + r) and typing netplwiz then press enter.
<br />
<br />In the User Accounts window, select your account in the list, then  un-check the "Users must enter a user name and password to use this computer" then click apply. 
<br />
<br />You will be prompted for your account password.

<br />
<br />
<br />2. Remove the need for a passowrd on login
<br />
<br />Open the Settings App 
<br />Go to Accounts - Sign-in Options

<h2>            Unable to perform updates on Windows 10.</h2>
                    <p>Good morning,</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I do a cold boot, it appears two sets of Windows updates install fine but then one does not and ALL of the installation is undone.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here is my version:</p>
<p>Version 1511 (OS Build 10586.218)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I ran the Windows Update Troubleshooter and no issues.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Should I try this as a cold boot update or should I try to get a Windows 10 ISO and reinstall Windows 10 with all the latest bells and whistles?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help greatly appreciated.</p>

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This issue may arise due to third party application conflicts and to assist you better, I would like to know whether you had installed any third party security application and what does it exactly mean when you say, "
</span>two sets of Windows updates install fine but then one does not and ALL of the installation is undone"?</p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>I suggest you to place the computer in a clean boot state and check if you are ble to perform updates successfully.</span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows
 7, or Windows Vista. You may also troubleshoot or determine what conflict is causing the problem by performing a clean boot.</span></p>

            <p>I had created a new request for help as after looking at the endless other requests for help with Windows Updates not installing, I was hoping a different approach to the title might get someone to read what I had already tried.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My solution was actually simple but took a bit.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1) Got the latest version of Windows 10 in .iso format and burned a DVD</p>
<p>2) Downloaded the MediaCreationTool</p>
<p>3) Set my computer to boot off the DVD&nbsp;</p>
<p>4) Inserted the windows10.iso DVD and simply let it run.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I now have the latest version with updates installed and no longer get the continual attempting to install, error installing and backing out the updates.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This might not be for everyone but it gives me a nice clean install of Windows 10 and I no longer have the updates problems and there were no registry edits, disabling of services or anything else, just installation of the operating system.</p>
<p>
</p><p>One final note. &nbsp;I was admonished by a moderator for creating another message to try and get help. &nbsp;However, in the message I explained why I was doing so and though I speed read, the vast majority of the responses were negative with regard to helping. &nbsp;I
 guess I have to accept the admonishment but once the same question has 10's of pages of various attempts at help, something really needs to be done at consolidating them and coming up with a common, reliable solution. &nbsp;Possibly doing what I did might be one
 such? &nbsp;I know far too many people are giving up and going back to 8.1.</p>

            <p>I may just stay at this version or go through the whole process again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I spent almost 40 years as an analyst and programmer across many platforms and I admit, I loved working with Windows based applications the most because the development packages were simply wonderful.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, as a customer using Windows 10 now and the "support" available for issues, I have to admit that I am less than impressed. &nbsp; A perfect example is this problem of what should be a simple update for my box. &nbsp;I keep it clean. &nbsp;No new hardware. &nbsp;No new
 applications. &nbsp;It is used for only a couple of applications, one being Blender and another being a game that I am helping to Beta test. &nbsp;I delete the game before I reboot to get the updates and I also delete Blender since I get it through Steam and the download
 is less than five minutes. &nbsp;My point is that there are NO hardware changes and since I visit something like three internet sites, one of them being msdn.microsoft.com, my machine should be a piece of cake for updates but there was something in that third set
 of updates that did not like something though nothing had changed. &nbsp;No McAfee to worry about, no strange AV at all as believe it or not, on that box only, I use Windows Defender and pray a lot plus run trusted malware detectors which are also deleted, not
 disabled before I do the updates. &nbsp;My machine stays up a lot as I do not sleep very much anymore due to reasons that nobody would be interested or care about hearing. &nbsp;I have a checklist I go through before I put her down cold to get the updates that show
 up. &nbsp;As I said, it should be a piece of cake but it has been a nightmare and I kind of know what I am doing. &nbsp;I cannot imagine what other people are going through.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have had multiple friends tell me that they are being bombarded with calls from a country other than the US offering their Level 5 technicians who, if you give them administrator access, will remotely take care of any possible problems with your machine
 for a minimal monthly cost. &nbsp;Granted, you have no idea what they are doing or if they copy anything while they are working. &nbsp;Yes, I am not a very trusting person when it comes to my personal data and remote access even when I keep items in a doubly encrypted
 folder in an area where probably few would look and has a very innocuous name. &nbsp;Other than keeping everything on paper in a fireproof safe, it's about the best I can do. &nbsp;I generate extremely strong passwords and using my checklist change them every two weeks
 and yes, I do have a port watcher that I WROTE to keep an eye on uninvited access. &nbsp;All this for a box that is used for two applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But again, there is no realistic reason that the updates should not have worked. &nbsp;The complete installation worked perfectly though I went through two pots of coffee watching it work. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So, I am considering the problem resolved. &nbsp;If the upcoming updates don't like the box then rinse, repeat. &nbsp;I can start it when I go down for breakfast and it should be done and ready for me to work with Blender when I come back upstairs. &nbsp;I wonder if they
 will ever remove the ability to go back to 8.1. &nbsp;Guess I should take a look at when they stop supporting it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks to those who tried to help.</p>

<p>So you're not going to install any further updates or upgrades (e.g., <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/upcoming-features" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Win10 Anniversary Update</a>), is that correct? </p>

<p>I'm afraid there there is no option to automatically download any updates in the background for the console, games or apps on the xbox 360.</p>
<p>That feature is only available on the Xbox One when it is set to the Instant-On mode.</p>

            <p>Is it possible to change the tile colors on the Win 10 start menu to be different colors, so you can differentiate between them. Right now they are all one color? Also how do you rename them?</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>From what I can see Wordpad does not have the equivalent of Word's 'Insert Page Break' facility. All that I can see that you can do is hit return repeatedly until the text you want is on the next page. You can use Print Preview to see whether or not you
 have left enough space.</p>
<p>This is would appear to be an example of the drawbacks of using a primitive word processor like Wordpad instead of a sophisticated product like Word.</p>
<p>Tricky</p>

            <p>Hello, again and irregardless of the issue currently at hand, I wish you both a Merry Christmas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you enabled Aero Transparency as seen here?&nbsp; (check mark)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/282-window-color-appearance-change.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/282-window-color-appearance-change.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're going to use these advanced settings, I don't believe aero will go into effect.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/282-window-color-appearance-change.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.sevenforums.com/tutorials/282-window-color-appearance-change.html</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your screenshots show the options 1) Enable desktop composition, 2) Enable&nbsp;transparent glass</p>
<p>are missing in Visual Effects</p>
<p>When trying to access CBS log and you receive "access denied", do this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Open an administrative command prompt and create a copy of the CBS.log:<br />
&nbsp;Start &gt; Right click on Command Prompt and select Run As Administrator</p>
<p>Type "cd C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\" (without quotes)</p>
<p>Press Enter<br />
Type "copy cbs.log cbsbackup.log" (without quotes)</p>
<p>Press Enter<br />
Type "cbsbackup.log" (without quotes) </p>
<p>Press Enter and this should open in notepad<br />
&nbsp;<br />
CBS.log cannot be opened when it is in use, this is the reason for your error.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Try TrekDozer's suggestion- reinstall drivers</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Start &gt;&nbsp;Right click on My Computer</p>
<p>Select Manage</p>
<p>Click Continue on UAC window</p>
<p>Select Device Manager</p>
<p>Click the + next to Display Adapters</p>
<p>Right click on Adapter and select Uninstall</p>
<p>Click the + next to Sound Video and Game Controllers</p>
<p>Right click on controller and select Uninstall</p>
<p>Close Device Manager Window</p>
<p>Reboot Computer</p>
<p>Windows will reload the drivers on restart.</p>
<p>Go to the manufacturer's site and look for updated drivers<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check that your computer meets the minimum hardware requirements for running
<span>Aero</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1-gigahertz (GHz) 32-bit (x86) or 64-bit (x64) processor</p>
</li><li>
<p>1 gigabyte (GB) of random access memory (RAM)</p>
</li><li>
<p>128-megabyte (MB) graphics card</p>
</li></ul>
<p><span>Aero</span> also requires a <span>
DirectX</span> 9 class graphics processor that supports a <span>
Windows</span> Display Driver Model Driver, Pixel Shader 2.0 in hardware, and 32 bits per pixel.</p>
<p>For best results, you might also want to follow these graphics processor recommendations:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>64 MB of graphics memory to support a single monitor with a resolution that is less than 1,310,720 pixels (for example, a 17âinch flat panel LCD monitor that has a 1280 Ã 1024 resolution)</p>
</li><li>
<p>128 MB of graphics memory to support a single monitor with a resolution from 1,310,720 to 2,304,000 pixels (for example, a 21.1âinch flat panel LCD monitor that has up to a 1600 Ã 1200 resolution)</p>
</li><li>
<p>256 MB of graphics memory to support a single monitor with a resolution greater than 2,304,000 pixels (for example, a 30âinch wide-screen flat panel LCD monitor that has up to a 2560 Ã 1600 resolution)</p>
</li></ul>
<div>
<span><span>Are you using older applications/programs on your system?&nbsp; Aero may stop working because of this if you are.</span></span>

            Hi Francis.   I'm Greg, a volunteer installation specialist and 8 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />Is this the Fall Creators Version 1709?  What I would do if you haven't yet is manually install Fall Creator Version 1709 by installing Media Creation Tool and choosing to Upgrade Now.  <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>.  
<br />
<br />This the most stable method to upgrade to the new version (which you need anyway) and will bring you fully up to date with reinstalled Windows that often will solve any other problems you have.    
<br />
<br />You can use the same tool to download the ISO or create bootable media so you only need to do it once, and have the bootable media for repairs or possible Clean Install.   
<br />
<br />If there are any hurdles during the Upgrade see these steps to optimize the install as this is evidence it's corrupted: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/overcoming-windows-10-upgrade-failures/682df9cf-aecf-4d52-8df7-19e9f8dba4cc">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />If you want to try to repair and use buggy Windows Update to do this, 
<br />There is a new guided walk-through from Microsoft for repairing Windows Update that leads up to resetting components if necessary:  <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/fix-windows-update-errors" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/10164/...</a>
<br />  
<br />You can also go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />But remember that a factory or Upgrade install are inferior installs that most enthusiasts would never run in the first place because they'd expect endless issues.  Most prefer to do the gold standard Clean install from this link which has had no reported issues:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I'll keep working with you until this is resolved.
