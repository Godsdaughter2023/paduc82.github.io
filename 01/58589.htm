<h2>            C&#58;&#92;Windows.old -- Why&#63;</h2>
                    <p>On ‏‎2018-11-06 14:04:52, a new folder: 'C:\Windows.old', appeared.<br />
<br />
I performed a search for "14:04:52" and got a hit in 'C:\Windows\Logs\MoSetup\BlueBox.log'. Here's the pertinent entries:<br />

<p>Good question, eh? I assume you mean these lines:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">2018-11-06 14:04:52: BoxDeletePath: Error deleting path [C:\$Windows.~WS]!&nbsp; Error = 0x80070005<br />
2018-11-06 14:04:52: BoxDeletePath: Last file path: [C:\$Windows.~WS\Sources\wpx.dll]</p>
<p>I don't know. There is no 'C:\$Windows.~WS\' folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>
<p>What do you see in File Explorer?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, I don't generally use File Explorer. TotalCommander is a lot more powerful. But to the point, File Explorer shows the same. There is no 'C:\$Windows.~WS\' folder.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have run all the usual checks: 'CHKDSK', 'SFC /SCANNOW', and 'DISM /ONLINE /CLEANUP-IMAGE /SCANHEALTH' (in that order). Still, Windows apparently felt compelled ot "fix" itself.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It's a mystery. I hope someone with some Windows Architecture knowledge will demystify it.</p>

<p>Thank you both for your concerns and your thoughts. The issue appears to one of system integrity, not convenience.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><blockquote>

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for the suggestion, but the files are not the issue. The issue is stealth updates. I write "stealth" because Windows cannot update, or at least I don't think so. I've disabled all the update services, and Windows is blocked at the firewall and
 cannot access the Internet -- I have absolutely confirmed this. Now, I see in the registry that there are stealth outbound firewall rules that are beyond my abillity to even understand them because of the way the regkey data are coded (and I'm really good
 at firewall rules and the registry). If actually there are stealth outbound firewall rules that Windows thinks that it can use, then I'll log in as THE Administrator and nuke them, but I'd like to avoid that extreme measure. But I don't want Windows making
 any stealth modifications. I don't want Windows to even think about "fixing" itself. If Windows needs fixing, I will fix it.<br />
<br />
Regarding update history, there is none. My laptop has never been updated. It also runs zero anti-virus. Don't be alarmed by that. It is essentially not connected to the Internet. In case you wonder how I'm accessing 'answers.microsoft.com', I'm writing this
 in Linux because I don't allow Windows on the Internet. I don't trust Windows.<br />

<p>
</p><p>Thank you for your input. Absolutely nothing is hidden in my system. I do what I need to do to maintain access to everything.<br />
<br />
You may think I'm a nut (and you may be right), but this is my computer, not Microsoft's computer, and it's not a cell phone, no matter how much Microsoft tries to make it a cell phone. My Windows 10 doesn't even look like Windows 10. That's the way I like
 it.<br />
<br />
So, why am I here on this forum with this thread? It's a sad story.<br />
<br />
My laptop has 2 GPUs, one Intel and one NVIDIA. It uses a technology called "Optimus" that provisions the NVIDIA, and its 1538 cores, as a 3-dimensional graphic co-processor. All was joy, but then I made the mistake of believing NVIDIA tech support and I installed
 the latest NVIDIA display driver. It broke Optimus. I used DDU (Display Driver Uninstaller), an extremely well regarded tool in professional tech-support circles, to clean the system. Then I reinstalled the correct display drivers. It was only at that point
 that I discovered that my laptop's manufacturer, Acer, had installed some (many) drivers that have no sources (or at least, no sources that I can get to), which means that I can't perform a system restore. In the process of performing forensic investigation
 (in order to force Acer's hired tech support company to take responsibility for its wreckless actions), I discovered that Windows is (may be) pulling the rug out from under me. So, I seek information (for example, why did 'c:\Windows.old' appear?) that will
 help me to stablize the computer system long enough for me to finish the forensics. In the mean time, I have to tollerate 2 or 3 display driver crashes each day. That's not a show-stopper because the display driver does recover, but it is an irritation that,
 I hope, can be overcome. I will probably move this effort to Microsoft TechNet.<br />

<h2>            Windows 10 - WWAN Mobile Connection - How to disable Auto-Connect in Registry</h2>
                    <p>There is a Option zu set the mobile connection to auto-connect or not. I dont want to auto-connect, so I disable the setting. But the changes are not saved. After I exit the application or i reboot the Computer, the settings for "auto-connect" are always
 "on"</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is the a registry-key where I can manage this settings? Unfortunatly it will not work in the GUI</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do NOT mean WiFi, it is the WWAN Connection over the cellular network.</p>

            <p>Thanks for the answer</p>
<p>
</p><p>First of all: I'm not talking about "wireless lan" - it concerns "WWAN over cellular network"</p>
<p>
</p><p>I Know the described steps 1 to 3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I go further with "Step 4 (doubble click on connection)" I obtain this window. There is not option "Wireless Properties/Connect automatically when this network is in range"</p>

            <p>Hello.&nbsp; I am an engineer on the Windows Cellular team.&nbsp; I can confirm the issue you are experiencing is a bug that exists in the Anniversary update of Windows 10.&nbsp; This is regarding the behavior around the auto-connect always resetting back to on.&nbsp; We are
 currently investigating this issue and will hopefully have a fix for it in a future release.&nbsp; At present I do not have a registry or a work-around for you.&nbsp; I hope this works.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you very much for reporting this.</p>

<p>Any update on this issue? I'm on Windows 10 1703 15063 and I can not disable auto-connecting. "Let Windows manage this connection" is disabled, but the mobile connection always reconnects after locking the machine, restarts etc.</p>
<p>
</p><p>This sucks because mobile never has unlimited data and sometimes you don't even know that you're back on mobile instead of the existing WiFi.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do not auto-connect my mobile / cellular.</p>

<p>When is this going to be resolved your costing me a lot of money in overage charges. &nbsp;People tend to forget to turn off the WWAN when they dock at the office and windows10 seems to prefer the WWAN connection over the local Ethernet for the internet as it
 is faster. &nbsp;This is getting very expensive for our company.</p>

<p>Hi</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have a Dell laptop with built-in WWAN card and it is running Windows 10 version 1709. The issue is still the same: Windows always reconnects the WWAN when there is no other connection available. As (for both historical and practical reasons) there are
 two different dial-up profiles that are in use, the automatically connecting WWAN is really frustrating to the end user. Is there any progress in fixing that?</p>

<br />
<br />You may need to convert the MPO files to other formats to be viewed by the above apps. It seems you can use MPO Master, or another app to do this:

<p>I've done a "search forum" and didn't find the solution to my problem, so I apologize if it's in here somewhere under a different title. I've looked on the microsoft site itself, as well as searched Google. Here is my problem:</p>
<p>I am trying to install a new font, but don't have the option in the file menu of my font folder. It simply isn't there. I am running Windows 7.</p>
<p>Thank you for any help you can give!</p>

            Hi,<br />
<br />
1. Did you make any changes to your computer prior to the issue occurring?<br />
<br />
I'd have you perform these steps and check if the issue persists.<br />
<br />
<br />
For the high CPU consumption issue, please use Performance Monitor to view performance data either in real time or from a log file.<br />
<br />
The new Resource Monitor lets you view detailed real-time information about hardware resources (CPU, disk, network, and memory) and system resources (including handles and modules) in use by the operating system, services, and running applications. In addition,
 you can use Resource Monitor to stop processes, start and stop services, analyze process deadlocks, view thread wait chains, and identify processes locking files.

    <title>Windows 10 VPN Connections no longer work, can&#39;t start remote - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> clancyp  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 VPN Connections no longer work, can&#39;t start remote access connection manager, error 2</h2>
                    <p>My VPN connections (windows built-in VPN L2TP) stopped working recently. They would hang on connect attempts. Opening the VPN page in settings had a significant delay. Creating a connection just hung and I had to cancel or go back. The connection was partially
 created, but the old network adapters page showed it wasn't created and missing drivers.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Tried two different VPN connections, both of which work fine from other devices, and both fail similarly on this machine, so I assume it is not the server that's at fault.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Seems like the remote access connection manager may be required, but it fails to start. When starting it manually it gives this error:</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Windows could not start the remote access connection manager service on Local Computer. Error 2: The system could not find the file specified.</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>No further info on what the missing file is from there or from event viewer.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- Lenovo ThinkPad P50, Windows 10 Pro, Domain Joined</p>
<p>- No other VPN clients installed</p>
<p>- Do have virtualbox installed (found an old reference to this) but uninstalling it didn't help, nor did reinstalling it</p>
<p>- All other networking functionality seems fine</p>
<p>- Tried sfc /scannow, nothing detected</p>
<p>- Rebooting doesn't help</p>
<p>- Nothing evidently wrong in device manager. Tried uninstalling all WAN Miniport drivers and they reappeared fine on reboot/rescan.</p>
<p>- All latest windows updates installed, and all Lenovo drivers up to date</p>
<p>- Can do system restore as I'm not sure exactly when this happened and may have done lots of work since that I don't want wiped.</p>
<p>- Nothing of consequence in tracing folder logs after running 'netsh ras set tracing * enabled' and trying to start the service.</p>
<p>- Tried running process monitor while trying to start the service and the only thing that seemed to be file-not-found related was for windows/system32/driverstore/en-us/oem86.inf_loc</p>
<p>- running 'netsh int ip reset' and rebooting didn't help</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<h2>            New laptop can connect to all wifi signals but my office, What should I do&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>So I bought a new Lenovo Ideapad 320-15ABR gen F yesterday, worked great at home.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When I came into my office today, I went to connect to our wifi, and for some reason it wasn't connecting, but both of my phones and the desktop were able to connect with no issues, so I tried rebooting both the modem and my laptop and reconnecting. No Luck.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Next I turned on my mobile hotspot on my phone and connected with ease, now I've gone through every basic troubleshooting solution to no avail (Do not have an ethernet cable available nor admin access to network settings.)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm thinking it has to do with my firewall or having to manually connect through IP, but have no clue what to do, couldn't find anything online regarding my situation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any ideas?</p>

<p>The driver being used for each network type might be incompatible with each other or might have a corrupted system file inserted that causes it's functionality to misbehave. We suggest that you follow these methods to troubleshoot the concern:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>We would suggest that you go to your Wi-Fi settings first and then reconfigure the connection:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Start</strong>, click <strong>Settings</strong>.</li><li>Go to <strong>Network &amp; Internet</strong>.</li><li>Select <strong>Wifi</strong> on the left pane.</li><li>Under <strong>Network Status</strong>, click <strong>Show available networks</strong>.</li><li>A menu will appear usually on the bottom right corner of your screen where all available detected networks are listed.</li><li>Right-click on the affected network and then select <strong>Forget</strong>.</li><li>Reconnect to the said network again, if password is required, please have it entered. If incorrect, please refer to your company admin for the correct Wifi credentials.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>If above method doesn't work, please proceed with the following troubleshooting steps:</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 1: Troubleshooter</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>First, you may run the Microsoft Easy fix diagnostic tool for network to automatically detect and fix any incompatibilities with your device and driver. Here are some that may apply to you:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_device" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Find and fix problems with devices and hardware</a></li><li><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_networking10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Find and fix problems with connecting to the Internet or to websites</a></li><li><a href="http://aka.ms/diag_networking10" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Find and fix problems with wireless and other network adapters</a></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>More easy fix solutions are available on this article:<span>&nbsp;</span><strong><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ph/help/2970908/how-to-use-microsoft-easy-fix-solutions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">How to use
 Microsoft easy fix solutions</a></strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, to run the manual network troubleshooter, please follow these steps:</p>
<p>
</p><ol>
<li>Go to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Control<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong>Panel</strong>, on the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Search<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong>Control<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong>Panel<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>bar
 located on the upper-right corner of the Control Panel window, type<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Troubleshooting</strong>.</li><li>Click Troubleshooting on the results pane.</li><li>On the left pane, click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>View<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong>all</strong>.</li><li>Look for<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Connecting to a Network</strong>, right-click, and have it<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Run<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong>as<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong>administrator</strong>.</li><li>Follow the onscreen instructions.</li><li>Once done, please check if issue still persists.</li><li>Please repeat the steps, and then run troubleshooter for<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Network adapter</strong>.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Method 2: Update driver</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>It is suggested to update a device driver to resolve any incompatibility issues with the latest version of Windows 10.<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>To Update a driver, please go to the<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Cortana<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>search bar beside the Start button. Type<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>devmgmt</strong>.<strong>msc</strong>. Hit<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Enter</strong>.</li><li>Expand<span>&nbsp;</span><span><span><strong>Network adapters</strong></span></span>. Look for your adapter.</li><li>Right-click, then select<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Properties</strong>.</li><li>Navigate to<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Driver<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>tab. then click<span><span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Update</strong></span>.</li><li>If options is grayed out, click<span>&nbsp;</span><strong>Update<span>&nbsp;</span></strong><strong>driver<span>&nbsp;</span></strong>instead.</li><li>Choose<span><span>&nbsp;</span></span><strong>Search automatically for updated driver software</strong>.</li><li>Follow the onscreen instructions.</li></ol>
<p>

<h2>            Windows 10 makes me sign-in twice</h2>
                    <p><span>This was not the case when I bought my computer 15 months ago, but as of about a month ago, EVERY TIME I sign-in to Windows 10, I enter the password and hit Enter; it starts to log me in, but after a few seconds it returns to the picture that
 appears when I am not signed in.&nbsp; When I re-enter the same password &lt;poof!&gt;* I am at the Desktop, making me think that it actually had logged me in, but for some reason is still displaying the 'not logged in picture.'&nbsp; I'm not sure how to confirm that. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Since it just started happening a month or so ago, my guess is that one of the updates is causing this, but since I cannot point to a particular day when it started, I cannot identify which update is most likely.&nbsp; (Initially, I thought I was
 just being sloppy in typing the password, but after a while of it happening every time, I realized it was not my error.)</span></p>
<p>* <span>"poof!" meaning it is essentially instantaneous; it does not take any length of time as if it is loading the apps and such, making me think that they
<em>were</em> being loaded after the first--supposedly failed--login.&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>

<h3> atty laura r.  say:</h3>
<h2>            Snip &#38; Sketch</h2>
                    <p>I LOVED the Microsoft Snipping Tool. I understand that Microsoft did away with it and replaced it with "Snip &amp; Sketch." While the concept to use it is the same, when I capture what I want as a "NEW" snip, it then appears simply as a blank screen within the
 Snip &amp; Sketch app. I believe that the app says it copies the snip to the Clipboard, so I attempted to open up a Word doc and a Notepad doc and "Paste" but still nothing appears.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's the Snipping Tool that's being phased out, not Snip &amp; Sketch.&nbsp; FWIW, I just used the latter tool and was able to paste the snip into a Word (Office 365) document.&nbsp; There was a point in the past when for reasons unknown, opening Word would clear the
 clipboard.&nbsp; If you're using an older version, you might want to try opening the document first, before taking a screenshot.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you prefer to use Snipping Tool, all you have to do (as I suggested earlier) is open the Start Menu and type&nbsp;<em>snip</em>.&nbsp;

<p>Thank you for clarifying what is being phased out - I already cannot use the "Snipping Tool" as it appears to have stopped working. Glad that Snip &amp; Sketch will continue to exist.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think I have found what the issue is: a security add-in for browsing financial records is blocking the screen capture for me. I have not found how to deem the screen grab in the snip&amp;sketch app "safe" but was able to temporarily stop it, which appears
 to have made the app useful again.</p>

<h2>            error 0x0000185</h2>
                    After starting my computer up it began an update. After that I had a quick error message reading something about KERNEL. I tried to get a pen to write it down, but it was gone when I came back.<br />
<br />
When I started the computer up again, it went to a blue screen and said there was an error with CI.dll (parts corrupt or missing, I think) and error 0x0000185.<br />
<br />
It also gave me 3 options:<br />
<br />
Enter to try again<br />
F8 to enter set-up<br />
Esc for UEFI Firmware.<br />
<br />
Now it only comes up with the 0x0000185 error and the 3 options above.<br />
<br />
I can't get past this, except into UEFI Firmware (non of the F8 options work, including the safe mode options, they just go back to the blue screen error message).<br />
<br />
My computer is an Acer E1-571 Aspire, which came with windows installed, and I don't have a boot up disk.<br />
<br />
Can anyone tell me what's wrong and how to fix it?<br />

<p><font><font color="#000000"><font>From what you have described, it appears that the issue is caused due to a conflict with the update that was installed recently. Since you are unable to boot to the desktop now, I would suggest you to perform an automatic
 repair and check. The Automatic repair can detect and fix the issues that prevent the computer from starting normally. You will need the Windows 8 installation disc to perform an Automatic repair. If you don’t have a Windows 8 disc, I would suggest you to
 download the Windows 8 installation files from another computer through this link and choose to create an installation media when the upgrade assistant prompts.

            Hi Ben,
<div><br />
<div>Thanks for the reply.</div>
<div><br />
<div>Unfortunately, I can't remember any of the information about the update. The message was too quick for me to write down, and the current error has taken up all of what little brain power I have, I'm afraid.</div>
<div><br />
<div>The full error message on the blue screen is as follows:</div>
<div><br />
<div>Recovery<br />
<br />
Your PC needs to be repaired<br />
<br />
The operating system couldn't be loaded because a required file is missing or contains errors.<br />
<br />
File: CI.dll</div>
<div>Error code: 0x0000185</div>
<div><br />
<div>You'll need to use the recovery tools on your installation media. If you don't have any istallation media (like a disk or USB device), contact your system administrator or PC manufacturer.</div>
<div><br />
<div><br />
<div>As my computer came with windows pre-installed and without a product key (I hate PC world), I'm unable to create an installation media.<br />
<br />
What I have been able to do, just to get the computer working, was to create a Ubuntu boot disk.</div>
<div><br />
<div>From starting up ubuntu, I've been able to look at the HDD. Unfortunately I can't access any files on the HDD, but I can see it's there. Apparently it isn't mounting.</div>
<div><br />
<div>In ubuntu, I can see the GUID partition table for the HDD which tells me that "<span>&nbsp;</span><span><span><span>assessment:
 Disk is likely to fail soon (30 degrees C/86 degrees F)." (The temperatures vary depending on when I turn it on, how long for, etc).<br />
<br />
I<span><span>It says size 750 GB, but doesn't say how much space.</span><br />
<br />
<span>The GUID partition table also says:</span><br />
<br />
<span>Recovery: Microsoft Windows Recovery Environment (System, No Automount), Contents: 419MB NTFS - Not Mounted;</span></span><span><span><br />
<span>ESP: EFI System (No Automount), Contents: 315 MB FAT (32-bit version) - Not Mounted;</span><br />
<span>Partition 3: Microsoft Reserved (No Automount), Contents: Unknown;</span><br />
<span>Acer Partition 4: Basic Data, contents 729GB NTFS - Not Mounted;</span><br />
<span>Push Button Partition 5: Microsoft Windows Recovery Environment (System, No Automount), Contents 20GB NTFS - Not Mounted.</span></span></span></span></span></span></div>
<div><span><span><span><span><span><span><br />
</span></span></span></span></span></span></div>
<div><span><span><span><span><span><span>When I try
 to mount the various partitions, the following happens:</span></span></span></span></span></span></div>

When I try to mount Partition 1 - recovery, the following message appears:</p>
<p>
Error mounting /dev/sda1 at /media/ubuntu/Recovery: Command-line `mount-t "ntfs" -o "uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid,uid=999,gid=999,dmask=0077,fmask=0177" "/dev/sda1" "/media/ubuntu/Recovery"' exited with non-zero exit status 14: The disk contains an unclean

 read-only with the 'ro' mount option. (udiskd-error-quark, 0)</p>
<p>
<span>Partition 3 (Microsoft reserved) doesn't give me the option of mounting - don't know if this is normal or what?</span></p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
Partition 4 - Basic data partition, gives the following message:</p>
<p>
Error mounting /dev/sda4 at /media/ubuntu/Acer: Command-lin `mount-t "ntfs" -o "uhepler=udisks2,nodev,nosuid,uid=999,gid=999,dmask=0077,fmask=0177" "/dev/sda4" "/media/ubuntu/Acer"' exited withnon-zero exit status 13: ntfs_attr_pread_i: ntfs_pread failed: input/output
 error Failed to read first NTFS_BLOCK_SIZE bytes of potential restart page. The file system wasn't safely closed on Windows. Fixing. ntfs_attr_pread_i: ntfs_pread failed: input/output error Failed to read NTFS $Bitmap: input/output error NTFS is either inconsistent,
 or there is a hardware fault, or it's a SoftRAID/FakeRAID hardware. In the first case run chkdsk /f on Windows then reboot into windows twice. The usage of the /f parameter is very important! If the device is a SoftRAID/FakeRAID then first activate it and
 mount a different device under the /dev/mapper/ directory, (e.g. /dev/mapper/nvidia_eahaabcc1). Please see the 'dmraid' documentation for more details. (udiskd-error-quark, 0)</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
Partition 5 (Push button reset) shows the following:</p>
<p>
Error mounting /dev/sda5 at /media/ubuntu/Push Button Reset: Command-lin `mount-t "ntfs" -o "uhelper=udisks2,nodev,nosuid,uid=999,gid=999,dmask=0077,fmask=0177" "/dev/sda5" "/media/ubuntu/Recovery"' exited with non-zero exit status 14: The disk contains an

 volume read-only with the 'ro' mount option. (udiskd-error-quark, 0)</p>
<p>
<br />
</p>
<p>
<span>Partition 2 (EFI system, contents FAT (32-bit version)) is the only partition that mounts, but doesn't do much.</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>I know this is in Ubuntu, but it's the closest I can get to seeing the HDD and get any information on it outside the blue error screen during a windows 8 boot attempt, or the UEFI, which
 doesn't give me much info or even options.</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>I don't know if this gives you anything useful.</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>
<span>I am going to try to get in touch with PC World for the product key, but I doubt I'll have much luck.</span></p>
<p>
<span><br />
</span></p>
<p>

            I ended up having to take my comp back to the store. They appear to have given it a new HDD, which means all the data was lost - I guess the HDD was either too damaged or corrupted to not only mount itself, but even to save.<br />
<br />
At least the fix was free - as the comp was still in warranty - but there was no chance of saving the files.<br />
<br />
I still don't know exactly what it all meant, but I was tearing my hair out from over a month of no progress on the issue, so I just had to bit my lip and take it in.<br />

            <p>I know this is years late but I wanted to share my experience and how I fixed this. I have been in IT quite a long time and could sense my drive is having problems. As per Claudia's case above here the drive may have been completely dead but mine was still
 clinging to life showing the same errors. I want to speak to a few parts of the post but first I want to say
</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am running a Toshiba Windows 8.1 laptop, 1 TB drive and the Manufacturer has a partition on the drive for recovery. &nbsp;I had the exact sane error after my computer froze and 0x0000185 and it would not boot. Windows auto repair could not fix it. NOR would
 plugging a bootable USB or CD Windows 8 recovery (Which I will call a Windows 8 REPAIR drive from this point on)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am not sure I sould have rebuilt windows either because to be honest, I JUST DID that a month ago and the PC FAILED again. &nbsp;So let me give the quick note to the uber geeksout there as how I fixed this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>run chkdsk .r without EUFI on C:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1) you will need a REPAIR disk from a windows 8 computer. &nbsp;You can create one by going here. &nbsp;I had a freind with windows 8 tablet and made a usb one. (Microsoft - please place your link here if you have a better one)</p>
<p>
</p><p>http://www.eightforums.com/tutorials/2855-system-repair-disc-create-windows-8-a.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>That said, you are indeed in this process simply running a chkdsk (pronounced Check-disk) on an NTFS partition. Therefore I am wondering if maybe even a windows 7 repair disk could do this.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>NOTE that running a chkdsk on a drive when it was failing has been a fix around for decades but this is the first time I had to navigate the EUFI nonsense to do it.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Esc for UEFI Firmware.</span></p>
<p>Hit ESC and go into the UEFI bios.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>3) Now every maker has different menus here but the one you are looking for is most likely in the advanced settings. What you want to change is:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>set the HDD settings from EUFI to SATA ACPI / compatibility. &nbsp;Meaning you don't want this computer &nbsp;to boot using the EUFI style drives.&nbsp;</li><li>Also in the boot order set USB and CD drives ABOVE the HDD harddrive so the computer boots to them first</li><li>Plug your USB/ or CD &nbsp;REAPAIR drive in, then hit F10 to Save changes and reboot. (or other keys to save- mine was F10)</li></ul>
<p>4) The computer should now bypass the harddrive for booting and boot from the REPAIR disk. What you did above here though was disable it from being a boot device for the time being anyway</p>
<p>
</p><p>5) Once I got to the windows 8 Repair screen I went to advanced tools and then command prompt. &nbsp;In there I typed the following</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>"C:" to see if the C drive was still recognized. My luck was it still was </li><li>then I typed the oldschool command "chkdsk c: /r" to run the checkdisk program</li><li>I got an error about "file handles" and that I would need to allow the drive to be unlocked" and I said "Y" for yes</li><li>then chkdsk started and let me tell you. I full blown chkdsk on a 1TB drive took about 4 hours. But let me tell you LET IT RUN! WALK AWAY! For those of you whom have never done this process, it will look like many times the computer has frozen and doing
 nothing. IT IS WORKING though. If chkdsk fails it will give an error. so NO ERROR? ITS WORKING STILL</li></ul>
<p>6) When it finished, I had a BUNCH of errors on the drive. That said, before the failure</p>
<ul>
<li>I had been running a Windows CHKDSK on boot up for weeks and it fixed errors and said it was good</li><li>Windows disk management said the disk was healthy</li><li>Windows said the drive was not fragmented&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>TO HECK it was. It was riddled with errors and bad sectors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>7) So now that the drive was repaired and it was 12AM on a work night, I rebooted but MAKE SURE you go back into the BIOS by hitting F1/F2 and the Manufacture splash screen or whatever it is to get there on your computer BEFORE you test booting up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Go into the bios and set everything in step 3 back the way they were. save changes, reboot, and I am typing you all this from my fixed computer!</p>
<p>
</p><p>END NOTE - I have read that many drives for Toshiba laptops in Windows 8 are failing. I DO NOT believe my computer is fixed for good. Its still acting sluggish and my guess is some part of this Windows 8/8.1 OS along with the EUFI bios stuff is corrupting
 the drive and my drive will fail again. I plan on replacing it BUT the first thing to go is:&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>back up all your files - good news I had a backup of all mine for the most part from last months DOA and reinstall so it was quick. So DO THIS now that your butt has been saved</li><li>create some Win 8 RESTORE CDs for your computer. If you do not have a CD, go get a 16G USB stick. I think that shouId work. I actually WON'T be using EUFI when I rebuild so I will be loosing Toshiba's partition in that process. You can get the rebuild partition
 out to a USB disk if you like thoruhg your manufactures rebuild app.&nbsp;</li><li>I actually might try the new windows 10 soon too, so I went an made WINDOWS 8 Installation USB stick. You can do this over the web now that your PC boots. Follow the link below. I used a 8GIG USB stick. Note that you will need the LICENSE KEY for windows
 8 and many of these are not a sticker on the outside of your computer any more.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>http://windows.microsoft.com/en-CA/windows-8/create-reset-refresh-media</p>
<ul>
<li>If you need the License key (and heck this is a great tool just to have for support info), go to belarc advisor and it will pull all the info on your machine for free. It brings up ALOT of data about it and all the serial numbers you need.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>http://www.belarc.com/free_download.html</p>
<p>
</p><p>You will find your 25 digit License key under Software licenses about 3/4 of the way down the report in this format</p>
<p>
</p><p>xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>THEN</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>I can't stress this enough ...EMAIL that BELARC stuff to you e-mail live or gmail account. Your drive could be dead and having it saved on your Local computer is not gonna help you when C drive crashes again</li><li>Keep the USB or CDs in safe place till the time comes to rebuild</li><li>Be patient with your computer for the next bit, try to give it time too cool off so don;t leave it run all the time or set your sleep settings to come on sooner.</li><li>If your cooling fan starts running fast, &nbsp; (like on a laptop) then just let it cool off and walk away.</li><li>Blow the dust out of the cooling fab with the system off try to not use it for hours on end</li><li>save some cash, buy and new HDD (I would say 100 dollars would do it) or if your PC needs to run all the time. GO GET A DRIVE SOON!&nbsp;</li><li>AVOID at all costs powering off your computer with the power button. This is what is causing a big issue as well.&nbsp;</li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps. I'm sleepy and gotta run to work.</p>

            <p>I' facing a vert similad problem. Im wondering if it might be &nbsp;a bad connectio/HDD. Im not sure if i can run cmd and do a check as the computer really can't do more than play the the bios. Here are the details:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Working on a Lenovo H430</p>
<div>Intel Core i3</div>
<div>
<p>Windows 8 64 bit</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I'm getting a blue screen on startup that says the system needs to recovery. &nbsp;Pretty much the exact same thing as this solved thread --&nbsp;http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_8-update/windows-8-error-code-0xc0000185/01330aee-06f5-4bc0-a669-b1efa850a502</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>
<p>I have a server so first I tried to restore the computer using the Windows Home Server &nbsp;Home Restore CD. &nbsp;I turned of secure boot and set boot order. &nbsp;It starts the disc up just fine and I select that I want to restore a computer with more than 512 MB RAM...
 then the screen goes black but I can tell the back light is still on. &nbsp;According to this (http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/12642/restore-your-pc-from-windows-home-server/) the system freezes right at disc initialization.</p>
<p>
</p></div>
<div>I then created a bootable USB .... the windows slash screen comes up with the logo and the loading circle starts to go around for a few seconds then.... same thing with the black screen and the noticable back lighting.</div>
<div>I then resort the the last option of a KillDisk. &nbsp;The screen loads and I click the option to start to configure the kill and it starts to try to load the pre-kill setup - &nbsp;the screen that loads before this is a black with the footer of the KillDisk all
 rights reserved. &nbsp;After about 5 seconds the screen flickers off then goes right back to that footer screen. &nbsp;Over and over and over.</div>
<div>I thought it was dust in because its a workshop computer so I blew out all the dust thinking maybe some got in the video card maybe? &nbsp;I don't know. &nbsp;I'm at a loss.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Any help would be greatly appreciated.</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>

            <p>Hi Pat,</p>
<p>
</p><p>if i am hearing you correctly, your repair cd will not work and you got an error 185 like the rest of the people in the thread. Did you try a chkdsk to confim your drive has no errors? My exeperience with video card failure is they cease to show anything!
 If you can see a blue screen at some point in the boot, and can read its txt, the card is fine, it's probably its drivers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>The main idea with the disk check here is you don't want to run a restore, or boot from any partitions on the harddrives until the drive is fixed. The goal is to have a repair tool boot the computer and run independently (in ram). Note that my long post
 above is how i was able to not have any services or dependencies running from the harddrive. I basically made the computer NOT be able to use the drive as a bootable option (by disableing UEFI) while i ran the usb repair disk. This is key to be able to release
 any handles or system dependancies on the drive.&nbsp;<br />
</p>
<p>If your server's harddrive is a UEFI boot device, &nbsp;disable UEFI booting in your bios. That blocks it from being seen as locked by the system. That process allowed me to access the entire drive, and all its partitions, to thuroughly scan for errors and have
 them repaired. Once it was complete for me My computer could boot. You may have to then run a repair CD after checkdsk, but you can do so knowing your Harddrive is not the problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope that helps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Everytime I try and install service pack 3 for XP (media edition) i get the error message:</p>
<p>"Service pack 3 setup error"<br />
"An error in updating your system has occured"<br />
"Select ok to undo the changes that have been made"</p>
<p>Once i click ok - it begins to undo everything until I get the message:</p>
<p>"Service pack 3 installation did not complete"<br />
"Windows XP has been partially updated and may not work properly"<br />
<br />
The error code is: <span>0x8007F070</span><br />
<br />
I have tried everything in the service pack 3 trouble shooting section of Microsofts website and I have run out of ideas. Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br />

<h3> paranormal pett  say:</h3>
<h2>            &#42;Spoilers for quest&#42; Skyrim Cidhna mine &#47; Makarth glitch fix&#33;</h2>
                    
<p>Hey people. &nbsp;If you have this glitch like I did, the one where you've already done the aforementioned quest but every time you go back to Makarth hold you keep getting spoken to by guards and it goes into a loop, can't go jail, can't pay a bounty, well here
 is what you do:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1)Transport to Makarth already crouching (if your sneak skill is high enough) or use a invisibility potion and go straight to the temple of talos.</p>
<p>2) (save here just incase!) talk to the 3 guards inside and use this method. &nbsp;"I've been framed" then "take me to jail" then importantly choose "....." next pick "madonach is behind the killing" and finally "fine i'll come quietly" they should then go hostile
 and attack you</p>
<p>3) Run OUTSIDE the shrine, then go back in again (this is to funnel you're attackers)</p>
<p>4)Kill the 3 guards (more will arrive but kill 3) and then lower your weapons of choice.</p>
<p>5)You can either pay the bounty 8040 (i believe) or go to jail, either option works here.</p>
<p>Then there you go glitch fixed! &nbsp;Only took a few hours to work that out, worth it mind. &nbsp;Also I won't tell you how to break out of jail, that would ruin the fun! &nbsp;</p>

<p>You are only getting this glitch because you have a Bounty for the hold Markarth is in (I think it's The Reach) and you've already broken out of the mine. &nbsp;One fix this is to go to any other guard in The Reach and pay off the bounty with them, only the ones
 in Markarth try to send you back to the mines. &nbsp;Once the bounty is gone you should be able to enter Marakrth fine.</p>

<p>When I returned, the same thing happened to me -- no option to pay the bounty, no option to use thieves guild leverage, no talking him out of it. &nbsp;So, I just agreed to go to jail (back to the mines). At that point, the guards lost interest in me and walked
 away. &nbsp;Has anybody actually been sent beck to the mines a second time? </p>

<p>[/quote]The glitch is that once you've broken out, you can't serve time, and you can't bribe the guards or pay off your bounty (perhaps only in Markarth proper), so the city guards become permanently hostile. That's what happened to me, anyway.</p>

<p>[/quote]&nbsp; I've got the same "hostile guards" glitch in Markarth. The guards stop or arrest me if I get close enough to them. When that happens, I simply agree to go to jail, they lose interest, walk away and leave me alone -- the whole thing takes a few
 seconds. I then continue whatever business or quest I was doing in Markarth.&nbsp; I did the entire Markarth portion of the thieves guild quests that way, so it's not a quest stopper.&nbsp; Have you tried telling the guard that you agree to go to jail?&nbsp; I was reluctant
 to do that at first because i didn't want to repeat that whole Cidhna Mine sequence. But, they don't send you back, nothing happens. It's a bluff.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p>I have, and when they say that I'm going to the mine, the only conversation option is "..." and the process starts over again. They didn't go away, so I just ran.</p>

<p>[/quote]I went back there. I tried everything before doing what I did, and I could never pay anyone off, or do any quests as I kept getting spoken to by the guards and getting into the loop.</p>
