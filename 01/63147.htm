<p>32bit Windows can only address 4GB of ram of which approx 3.2GB is usable!</p>
<p>
</p><p>2^32 = 4,294,967,296 = 4GB RAM</p>
<p>
</p><p>2^64 = 18,446,744,073,709,551,616</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, in reality, Windows 10 64Bit Home has a max of 128GB RAM and Windows 10 Pro has a max of 513GB - &nbsp;2TB RAM depending on hardware configuration . . .</p>

<p>32 bit windows might be the &nbsp;cause for this problem. You need to Install 64 bit OS in your system, that requires a clean Install. The max memory handled by 32 bit system is 4 GB whereas 64 bit can handle in some TBs.</p>

<h2>            Do I need to update my Kindle app&#63;</h2>
                    I was trying to save money by buying a textbook and downloading it on my Kindle app. My app is on my hp windows computer. When I bought and downloaded the book, Kindle said that I couldn't read the book in Windows 8. So I downloaded Windows 10, but when
 I tried to read my book, Kindle said that I couldn't read the book in Windows 8 still. Do I need to update my Kindle app? How do I do this?

            <p>I have the same issue with my Kindle app, both on my desktop computer and my Surface Pro 3. Both devices have been updated to Windows 10, and when I try to open a textbook I bought through Kindle on either device it says: "This title is not available on
 Kindle for Windows 8". My Kindle app is up to date, and I have auto-updates on. Still the textbook is unavailable to read.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I know the textbook is compatible with Kindle because I am able to open it fine using the Kindle app on the iphone 5s.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Are there any other ways to fix this problem?</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 Mail&#58; same email account but with two separate inboxes</h2>
                    <p>I have an email account. Lets just call it:&nbsp; *** Email address is removed for privacy ***</p>
<p>It is logged into the Windows 10 Mail client with IMAP, POP3 settings, etc.</p>
<p>A few months later, the company that I'm working for that manages that email told me that they are changing servers for my email into an Office 365 server. So they give me the login info (but I didn't save it, and for some reason they also lost it afterwards
 after they changed IT guys) and I start using that email on the Windows 10 Mail client. I didn't delete the old one. I just added a new email account but with the same email address and labeled the old one as "OLD *** Email address is removed for privacy ***" and I start using it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All is good for a couple weeks, then one day I get email in the OLD *** Email address is removed for privacy *** instead of the current *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and now some emails show up in the OLD account and some in the current account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>What's going on?</p>

            If the address is the same, autodiscover could have kicked in and switched accounts- or, if you use a generic server name (not mail.the-email-domain.com) , your old mailbox still exists on the old server and a dns server is still routing to it. This generally only happens with spam after the first 48 hours though.

<p>Thanks for the reply!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The address is the same for both. The old server is a generic server while the new server is an Exchange server. It's been a couple months already but what I have noticed is that only mail from my company is coming into the old server and mail from everybody
 else is going to the new server. There is one other colleague from the same company whose mail gets sent to the new server. The old IT had left and didn't leave all the information for the new server for the new IT guy.</p>

            Ah... it sounds like the sender is accidently sending from the old account, so it gets routed through the old server. It would be best if everyone exported their old mail to a pst file or into the Exchange account and removed the old account from their profile. 
<br />
<br />If the old account was pop3, all you need to do is remove the old email account from tools, account settings dialog. If it was imap or exchange, you need to export to a pst file before removing the account so you don't lose the data still in that mailbox.

            <p>No you can't. The Windows Vista license is tied to the computer it came with. This is called an OEM license.</p>
<p>- OEM versions do not offer any free Microsoft direct support from Microsoft support personnel</p>
<p><strong>- OEM licenses are tied to the very first computer you install and activate it on</strong></p>
<p>- OEM versions allow all hardware upgrades except for an upgrade to a different model motherboard</p>
<p>- OEM versions cannot be used to directly upgrade from an older Windows operating system
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, the Windows 7 Ultimate you have installed is an upgrade version, it used the Windows Vista license as a qualifying product.</p>
<p>You will need to purchase a full license for machine running Linux. </p>
<p>A work around would be to get a second hand copy of Windows XP (Home edition would work) or even Windows Vista Home Basic) full version and use that as the qualifying license then purchase a Windows&nbsp;7 upgrade:</p>
<p>Upgrade pricing:</p>

<h2>            SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH DOWNLOAD AND INSTALL</h2>
                    <p>Why are so many people having trouble downloading and installing Windows 10 ?? .Time after time people are failing . A seemingly endless stream of error codes some of which seem to have no way fix them ,failures to install ,in some cases very,very slow downloads
 ,some people are&nbsp; achieving only partial installaton before their computers freeze or in some cases shutting&nbsp; down and are unable to restart without major intervention by the user (eg. having to completely reinstall previous O/S&nbsp; or using a system image for&nbsp;
 recovery ). More problems are being reported when trying to revert back to previous&nbsp; O/S .WHY?? .Modern technology is&nbsp; supposed to make thing like this easier but more often than not&nbsp; it seems&nbsp; to become more problematic to do simple tasks .&nbsp; I admit that
 some people have downloaded and installed Windows 10 with a minimum of time and effort ,however the majority of people are getting sick and tired of continually trying to install and failing .&nbsp; This complete&nbsp; mess&nbsp; of none download and installation issues&nbsp;
 will understandably drive people away from Windows 10 and maybe from Windows /Microsoft altogether .Can't say i blame them really . Most people who use computers today just want a system that is simple to use ,download and install . The problems over the past
 week or so has been far from easy or hassle free for many .</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regards&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uncle&nbsp; Zeb</p>

            <p>Hello 888jay ,are you a qualified English teacher ? . Stop whingeing about punctuation and spacing and&nbsp; listen to the problems some people are facing . Many people are still having&nbsp; ,have had many problems trying to download and install this latest effort
 ,true exact numbers as yet are unavailable but as time passes numbers will no doubt&nbsp; be published .Out of the latest but not qualified quote of over 14 million downloads to date what percentage have had no problems ? . There is no way&nbsp; that such a large number
 ( if that number is even fact ) of downloads have been completed without any problems . Read some of the comments from&nbsp; people who have&nbsp; tried&nbsp; 5,6,9 or more times to download and install .Read and listen to the comments of&nbsp; people who say they have waited&nbsp;
 24 hours or more for a download only to have it fail , some have supposedly waited for that length of time but only have a partial download&nbsp; and ask them what they really think about it . Can you honestly say and verify that you have had no problems whatsoever
 .If you really&nbsp; have had no problems then good for you,but don't assume that every body has had a trouble free time with it . Drag&nbsp; your head out of&nbsp; the sand and come into the real world and just read some of the comments about download&nbsp; and installation
 problems on sites such as this one . I also stick with my remark that instead of technology making things easier it creates more problems to deal with .Just because technology is new its not necessary&nbsp; any better ! &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; . &nbsp; &nbsp; Are &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; these &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

            <p>People are remarkably inventive in the ways they manage to screw up their computers. I'm pleasantly surprised that the number of issues appears to be quite low as a percentage of the total installed base.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Because I wanted control over when the upgrade would be downloaded, I chose not to use the reservation system and downloaded the ISO directly from the Microsoft site. I have a basic 10MBPS internet service from my cable provider and on three computers the
 download never took more than 15 minutes. Had it taken longer, say, more than an hour, I would have aborted and resolved why my internet connection was not up to par (and that's on me, not Microsoft's problem). If your system is so messed up that it takes
 many hours to download the ISO then you are almost guaranteed to end up with a corrupted ISO file. And upgrading using a corrupted ISO file is extremely foolish as it will most certainly fail. Like punctuation and spelling, this is not rocket science.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello again 888JAY , so according to your reply you are&nbsp; the only one out there who has got a perfect internet service&nbsp; and have had no problems whatsoever ? . Get real ,plenty of people have got a good internet service and still failing to download and
 install . As for commenting on way people have "messed up " their systems i found that a little smug and self assured&nbsp; . Many would have prepared their systems correctly , following recommended advice to run good virus scans , get all updates needed etc&nbsp; ,some
 myself included went to the trouble of doing a clean install of whatever O/S they were upgrading from&nbsp; ,updating completely&nbsp; in the hope that things would be simple .Oh how wrong was it to even think that ! . As for the exact number of failures to download
 and install well to date nobody is sure but earlier today i went to this site and checked 220 posts and&nbsp; out of these 100 were complaints about download and installation issues (failures ) . Now a rough estimation would give a almost 48% failure rate ! . That
 number in my opinion is way too high , if you consider the millions of downloads that have taken place over the last ten days or so that is one hell of a lot people who in your opinion have "messed up " their systems ,somehow i think not&nbsp; . If you really had
 no problems then it appears that you are in the minority , do not try to belittle people who are having problems not of their own making .</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Regards&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Uncle Zeb</p>

            Hello jay ,again , another smug self appreciating answer&nbsp; i see . If so many people have succeeded why don't they come out to play and help the many people who are struggling&nbsp; ?? . Where did you get 100 out of 14,000,000 from ?. I really don't think you
 are reading any of the comments from any site . Just by reading a very small section of one site alone (this one ) the numbers of failure still come to around 48% .Take comments from other sites not to mention people who are not looking for help on sites like
 this then the number of failed downloads and installations&nbsp; must be staggering .If your own experience was so perfect&nbsp; then please feel free to let everybody know the secret route to a utopian (in your mind ) installation .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            Well Uncle Zeb, the world may little note nor long remember what we say here but I'll add my two cents worth and say that I've tried seven (7) times to install the upgrade from my Windows 7 PC and it's simply a no-goer. I've tried downloading directly
 from Microsoft and from the upgrade they sent to my computer, I've deleted my anti-virus program, and it still won't get past that magic 30-something percent during installation before it reverts to my old Win 7 configuration. So, you know what? I think it's
 a message from that god in Seattle who is trying to tell me I shouldn't worry about it but wait until Win 10 is ready to install without causing a raft of problems. Am I impressed? No. And I should add that it's installed quite well in the other two Win 8.1
 PCs in my household so I know it can be done. But like everything seems to be with Microsoft, the older one of their products is, the less important it is to them and the less support it receives. I can wait, my PC can wait so we'll see wha

            <p>This may be of help to you. I recently started researching into this problem of "<span><strong>A problem caused the program to stop working correctly</strong>.
<strong>Windows will close the program and notify you</strong> <strong>if a solution is available."
</strong>as many of my games have stopped working, even though they worked on Windows 7. I have not found a solution, but reading my post may help you. If you read just the underlined parts, you will find that the errors I'm experiencing specifically are related
 to sound. This may also be happening in your game.</span></p>

<br />
<br />What game are you playing, what type of game is that, is it a Microsoft Store game, a Steam game or 3rd party game?
<br />
<br />What do you mean by you have 'Block for Full Screen checked -where is that setting, is that in the game or in Windows and why if you want full screen games, is that option ticked?

<p>Some games &amp; video can only set to so much,R.click on desktop/personalize/display adapter/advanced settings/open the available video setting.High Color beats out True Color,&amp; set to highest Hertz,usually 75</p>
<p>.Also,install latest Chipset driver/Video driver/get these from pc mfg..Display Monitor also gets latest driver.With most pc games,editing the .inf folders/configuration/reset display,these settings should only be reset by the game players advice,its not

<h2>            Icons from taskbar disappearing</h2>
                    <p>Today I had this problem that happened twice on Windows 10, it seems totally random and without doing anything special:&nbsp;I was only having Edge and an Explorer&nbsp;folder&nbsp;open, I was using Edge and suddenly&nbsp;all application icons in taskbar disappeared.&nbsp;Only the
 three main icons were remaining: Start Menu, Cortana and the third one, but Edge and the Explorer folder icons were not showing anymore... When trying to start new applications, applications launched but without miniature icon in taskbar. When trying to restart
 explorer.exe it doesn't fix, I had to restart Windows to solve the problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Do you have any idea where it come from and how to prevent this to happen again? Thank you</p>

<h2>            Received a call from company saying they were from Windows&#63; &#40;www.smartguyssupport.com&#41; are they a legitimate company&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Received a call from company intially saying they were from Windows? Stating we have dangerous issues on our laptops that could cause them to crash,
</p>
<p>having been passed from the original female caller (had an Asian Accent but using English Names) to a tech guy again Asian but said his name was Harry Parker.</p>
<p>Harry explained I should look in "msconfig" at the services section to see how many programmes had stopped working, stating that our access&nbsp;and passwords could be taken. He said it would take them about two hours to rectify the problems,&nbsp;he then moved on
 to transfer me to their website,&nbsp;www.smartguyssupport.com and then said he needed me to complete an application and requested a fee of £154 payable by Credit or Debit card to rectify our problems, he said the service would have 2 year tech service support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have had similar calls like this previously, we don't trust them, can you advise if they are legitimate?</p>
<p>I have reason to believe that although their site has UK phone numbers etc., they could well be operating from India or an Asain Country?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please can you help, we feel they have accessed our computers and are turning off and stopping programmes etc., on a regular basis I'm having to go into "msconfig" to reinstate (ENABLE) many of microsoft programmes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regards</p>

            <p>Hello Mike,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is a Scam. Just ignore them. All they want is to access your computer so they can install an application that will give them access without you knowing. They then steal you personal data, bank details etc. You also have to pay them £154 for the privilege.</p>
<p>How do they know that you have problems with your PC? Did you tell them? No of course you didn't, they are simply guessing. There is no way that they could obtain this information unless it is from you personally. Windows uploads files to Microsoft periodically
 to let them know about system crashes etc. These files are uploaded anonymously and Microsoft have no idea whose computer they belong to. The uploads are simply used for analysis.</p>
<p>Unless you have a pre-paid support contract with Microsoft then no one from Microsoft will ever contact you regarding your PC problems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

            Did you give them remote access to your computer? Is your Anti-virus up to date and firewall enabled? If so, you are probably fine as long as you didn't run any software they said or let them have control over your machine.<br />
<br />
It's one of the biggest scams out there right now.<br />

                    As the title says I cant add my account to my PC. the account was originally on it but I deleted it and now I want to re install it (not ask why). When I go into settings I hit add someone else to this PC enter in my email *** Email address is removed for privacy *** and it says
 that there was a problem and that the account cant be added. OK strange then I try a different path and then it gives me this, this account already exists on this PC, but I cant log into it? I really need to get into this account, but I cant. Thanks for the

    <title>Is there a Product Key after upgrading from Windows 10 Home to Pro - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jim-wolfe  say:</h3>
<h2>            Is there a Product Key after upgrading from Windows 10 Home to Pro</h2>
                    <p>I have an upgraded PC from Windows 7 Home Premium to Windows 10 Home using the free upgrade offer from Microsoft. I just purchased the $99.99 upgrade from Windows 10 home to Windows 10 Pro from within Windows.&nbsp; I understand that the Win7 to Win10 upgrade
 is tied to my hardware and I do not have a product key that I can use to move this install to a new PC. My questions is, do I now have a Product Key that will allow me to transfer the OS to new hardware after buying the $99.99 upgrade to Pro. And where do
 I find that Key? Or is this install still tied to my hardware?</p>
<p>
</p><p>p.s. the hardware in question is an ATOM based desktop pc (no laughing please ;-) ) that I am looking to re-purpose and would like to be able to move Win10 Pro that is now installed on it to a new machine.

<p>Then I wouldn't be too concerned about it. This new Microsoft activation process is very confusing to all. I wonder if customers will ever have the actual key in the Windows 10 world. You can always use these commands to check your license activation.</p>

            You only get a product key for a full retail purchase of Windows 10, because a full retail purchase is transferrable between devices and so needs a Product Key - See the Windows 10 Licence. &nbsp;The Window's Upgrade doesn't, as its License is not transferrable
 to another device. &nbsp;The Windows 10 Licensed Device is registered in your Microsoft Account and also with Microsoft's Activation Servers, so you should never need a product key.

<p>So, do I have a retail copy of Windows because I paid the $99 or do I still have an upgrade version? And how can I tell?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried the commands KevNJ suggested on 2 upgraded machines. This one above and one in a VM. Both had lines that referred to a "Retail Channel" yet I only payed to upgrade this one machine.</p>

</p><p><span>Hello Kunal,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.
</span><span>I appreciate your efforts towards resolving the issue. I will certainly help you with the issue that you are facing.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>This could be caused by a driver conflict. Try the following methods and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span><span>Method 1:
</span></span></strong></p>
<p><span><span>Step 1: Try
<strong>Safe Mode</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Safe mode is the configuration of Windows, when it is running on only basic set of drivers and all the startups are disabled.
 To know more about safe mode, follow the article below:</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/start-computer-safe-mode#start-computer-safe-mode=windows-7</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>If the issue is resolved in safe mode, follow step 2 after restarting the computer in regular mode.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span><span>Step 2:
<strong>Clean Boot</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>A clean boot is performed to start Windows by using a minimal set of drivers and startup programs. This
 helps eliminate software conflicts that occur when you install a program or an update or when you run a program in Windows. To know more, follow the article below:</span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></p>
<p><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span><span style="color: rgba(5, 99, 193, 1)">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</span></span></a></p>
<p><span><span>&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><em><span><span>Note: After troubleshooting, refer to this section ‘<strong>How to reset the computer to start normally after clean boot troubleshooting</strong>’.</span></span></em></p>
<p>
</p><p><strong><span>Method 2: Uninstall / Re-install&nbsp;USB controller</span></strong></p>
<p><span>I would suggest you to uninstall the USB controller from the device manager. Then download and install the latest “Chipset” driver from the manufacturer’s website and then check whether your USB headset works.</span></p>
<p><span>Follow these steps:</span></p>
<p><span>a. Press “<strong>Windows key + R</strong>” from your keyboard.</span></p>
<p><span>b. Then type “<strong>devmgmt.msc</strong>” without quotes in the search box and hit enter.</span></p>
<p><span>c. Expand “<strong>Universal Serial Bus Controller</strong>”.</span></p>
<p><span>d. Right click on the each controller and select “Uninstall” option.</span></p>
<p><span>e. Then restart the computer for changes to take effect.</span></p>
<p><span>f. Then download and install the latest driver from the “Motherboard” manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Let us know the results. We will be glad to assist you further in issues related to Windows.</span></p>

            <p>Hello alialbream, <br />
<br />
1) Check in Safe mode to see if&nbsp; you still experience a crash. If not crashing, most likely a startup item.
<br />
If still crashes, try a clean boot to see if you can identify the software that is causing the crash.
<br />
KB 929135 - How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7<br />
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929135</a></p>
<p><br />
2) Scan for viruses and malware. If you don't have antivirus installed, you can download the free Microsoft Security Essentials from the location below:
</p>
<p><a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/security-essentials/download" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/products/security-essentials/download</a><br />
You can also scan with the Microsoft Safety Scanner to remove viruses and malware:
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/security/scanner/en-us/default.aspx</a><br />
3) Create a new user account and see if Windows Explorer crashes with a new account. If not, then it is likely your user account is corrupt.
<br />
<br />
4) SFC /scannow to see if you have any corrupt system files. <br />
</p>
<p><span>Click Start<br />
Go to Run command:<br />
Type: </span><strong><span>sfc /scannow</span></strong><span><br />
This will check for any integrity violations and fix any corrupted operating system files.<br />
Restart your system.<br />
</span><br />
5) Go back to a System Restore point to before you were having a crashing issue with Explorer.
<br />
To choose a System Restore point,</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From the Desktop click the Pearl (start) button
<br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Search Field type “System Restore” and hit enter <br />
·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once System Restore is open, select the option “choose a different restore point” and hit next
</p>
<p>Once on the next screen, pick a restore point to go back to when it last worked for you. Once you select the restore point, click next, then select finish, this will start the restore process.<br />
<br />
6) You can try a repair or reinstall of your Windows operating system. <br />
<br />
Also, check in the Event viewer to see if you have any errors about the time of the last crash.
<br />
<br />
Let us know the results of your testing. <br />
<br />
<br />
Thanks, <br />
<br />
<br />
Marilyn </p>

    <title>partitioning and creating a dynamic partition in order to install win - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            partitioning and creating a dynamic partition in order to install win 10&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Hello anyone helpful</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've looked around at reasons for Win 10 install fails. My assumption is that I perhaps require to extend the basic partition I have with Windows 7?</p>
<p>I've shrunk the C:/ drive by 1024 MG but yet cannot extend the System Reserve partition of 100 MG to any greater extent.</p>
<p>So, I figured perhaps go Dynamic?</p>
<p>This option is available, yet I am wary to use it.</p>
<p>Reason being as I click though to create a Dynamic Partition, the warning arrives that if I do I am then unable to boot from any volume other than the current boot volume on C:/...</p>
<p>My question is, if I do create a dynamic partition. Will Windows 10 &nbsp;occupy the said Boot Volume in place of Windows 7, and so I will not crash or fail during any point of installation.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Thanks heaps...</p>

</p><p>You can extend it as I did with a specialized tool like this&nbsp;one :</p>
<p><a href="https://www.paragon-software.com/home/hdm-personal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.paragon-software.com/home/hdm-personal/</a></p>
<p>
</p><p>With it, it is possible to extend the System reserved partition&nbsp;pushing the beginning of C:</p>
<p>
</p><p>Better to clone the os disk before working on the partitions. This too you can do with this tool.</p>

            <p>hi Mr Malik,</p>
<p>
</p><p>well the move to a Dynamic Partition did no harm atal.</p>
<p>Yet it did not solve the Win 10 install issue.</p>
<p>I had error C1900101 - 30018</p>
<p>The upshot is that the fail took place at the stage of 'Installing Features and Drivers' at 30% of the upgrade.</p>
<p>This is my typical problem.</p>
<p>The PC then reset and returned to Win 7.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any suggestions I'm all ears.</p>
<p>Thanks anyhow.</p>

            <p>A Dynamic partition is meant to span a partition across multiple hard drives.&nbsp; It should not be used on one hard drive.&nbsp; I have no idea what&nbsp; gave you the idea that this was necessary but it will&nbsp; take surgery to set it correct, since you only get the prompt
 to convert if there are the maximum number of primary partitions already.&nbsp; </p>

            <p>Below is the snip of the Disk Management screen.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There is only Win 7 on c:/ drive and the several programs. Not much data except that contained in 2 OneDrives I have and so in the cloud also.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have 1024 MG of unallocated disk space which I created to hopefully use to extend the Partition into.</p>
<p>I have an exterior hard rive also as you can see.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The notion for going Dynamic was the concept of extending partition size by allowing it to grow as required by new demands. I figured Win 10 was in need of greater than 100 Mg of partition which I am assuming is Drive B:/ as is displayed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let me know what you think...note: I can backup files but not create a System Image to any drive or because the Memory allocated to the Volume required is not enough. (I have had this issue constantly on Win 7.)</p>

            <p>&nbsp;An error would have been generated if the System Reserved partition is too small, which can sometimes happen when a drive letter is accidentally assigned to it in Disk Mgmt allowing a backup or other program to write to it.&nbsp;

<p>
</p><p>The easy workaround to that however is to simply extend the System Reserved to 300mb following

<div>I am also experiencing this same issue. I hadnt noticed the two occurances of iexplor.exe until now, but I expect this is related somehow.</div>
<div>All suggested troubleshooting stages do not change the freezing Windows Update page.</div>
<div>Did anyone find a fix for this - or is a Windows XP reinstall on the cards...?</div>

<p>Ok, so I have been doing some searched online and reading through the posts here:</p>

<p>http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/xbox_360_support/f/9/t/1656280.aspx?pi7406=2</p>

<p>. however, there still seems to be no resolution to this problem?</p>

<p>All I want to do is essentially convert my 11 year old son's offline Xbox Live profile and gamertag, to an online Silver member.&nbsp; It seems that by choosing the 'Join Xbox Live' options on the console and on the web, will set up a brand new profile for my
 son - something I do not want to do. He has points and achievements so I obviously do not want to set up a new profile or he will lose all this progress....??</p>
<p><br />
Can anybody help?!</p>

<p>if you do it via xbox.com you are right, this will create a new Profile without any savegames and achievements.</p>
<p>using "join xbox live" on your xbox360 will create an online gamertag from an existing offline Profile (one that is stored to your xbox and not yet connected with any Microsoft account). achievement Points and save games are supposed to be carried over,
 though i cant tell for sure, i didnt create my gamertag that way.</p>

<p>UPDATE - SUCCESS.....!!!!!!</p>
<p>So last night, I did indeed manage to convert my son's offline profile, to an online ,Silver member, profile AND kept all his gamer score!!</p>
<p>The steps I took were as follows (all from my Xbox 360):</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Signed into my son's offline profile.</p>
<p>2. Pressed the Guide button on the controller and chose the 'Join Xbox Live' option.</p>
<p>3. The console then asked for my son's email address (which he has had set up for years but it has never been associated with his Xbox Live offline profile) and password.</p>
<p>4. It then asked for his first name - which I entered, making sure if was written exactly like his offline profile.</p>
<p>5. It also asked for his surname - again, entered in the same way as above.</p>
<p>6. The console then confirmed his details and asked to confirm that it was a child account - his D.O.B was shown to be present and correct (perhaps it took this from his offline profile).</p>
<p>7. The console then asked me to confirm which profile, would be the parent profile - so I selected mine.</p>
<p>8. The console then asked me for my billing info so that it could confirm that I was indeed the parent of the child and that my online profile would be that parent profile.</p>
<p>9. The console then confirmed everything and came back with a gamer tag for my son. Initially, at this stage, I first thought that it had created a brand new online profile with a gamerscore of zero again however, when I then signed into his profile, I could
 see his new gamertag was placed against his existing offline avatar and that he had also retained his gamerscore (around 800 points!).</p>
<p>So, for me at least, this shows, that it IS indeed possible, to convert an existing offline profile to a new online one AND keep the gamerscore associated to the offline profile!</p>
