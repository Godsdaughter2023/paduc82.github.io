    <title>Custom Gamerpics - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Custom Gamerpics</h2>
                    <p>So custom gamerpic's are now a feature for everyone to use easily however you need to be 18 or above. I think this is unfair and should be available to more ages if not all ages. I don't see why 16 year olds or 13 year olds or any age can't have a custom gamerpic because some people would abuse this. But what if we as a community have to agree to some new terms when changing to a customer gamerpic like before changing a pop it saying something along the lines of&nbsp;"Changing you gamerpic should be used correctly and if you or anyone you come across has a inappropriate custom gamerpic you will report them&nbsp;helping&nbsp;xbox keep the community safe." just&nbsp;a message that shows that they trust us.&nbsp;</p>

 </blockquote> <p>Well at least then put some gamerpics up in the market cause the stock images are horrible, honestly as a teenager I do not upload anything inappropriate. Also 18 and up or young adults would do the excite same thing. This is now way that it is fair for them, there is mature teenagers and I think they should have a chance at custome images. Really this should be changed, also the young adults are also mature but most of them in the gaming community will upload something nasty. I have seen a ton of it already. So 1) change the limit or 2) add some other gamerpics to the market, also 3) bring better stock images then cause the current ones do not represent me and they are all very childish. Probably just adding gamerpics to the market will be fine.</p>

So again this restriction is really unfair in every way. It is not protecting me in any way it is making me upset. For it to protect me it would have to have been where I can view mature content that is a community folder of some sort then I would like to have that restriction in.

So this is no way protecting me or is being fair, also check the market no gamepics their and can't find them in achievements anymore.</p>

    <title>Using dial pad to enter conference call code while on group chat - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Using dial pad to enter conference call code while on group chat</h2>
                    <p>I've had a consistent issue with the following scenario:</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'll connect to a group call with two of my colleagues. We'll connect to a conference call by "adding participants". Once prompted to enter the conference call's "code", I'll bring up the dial pad to enter. However, there seems to be an issue where the tones
 of the dial pad are not transferring.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do not have this issue when I simply try to connect outside of a group chat. This seems to only be applicable to group calls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is this a known issue? If so, are there workarounds for it?</p>

            I have had the same issue which has just begun to occur since about July 1, 2017 when attempting a conference call to a conference call service provider (ex. AT&amp;T). &nbsp;I can dial in to the service provider successfully. &nbsp;However it seems that the pound sign
 ("#") is not recognized at the end of the numeric access code. &nbsp;Every conference call provider requires an access code and every one I have used also requires the pound sign after the access code.

    <title>Child Accounts - How can they now purchase DLC&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Child Accounts - How can they now purchase DLC&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I am currently a family account subscriber with 2 child accounts. In the past if either of the children wanted to purchase something I could give them an allowance via the Family Centre.</p>
<p>However I'm now hitting two issues,</p>
<p>1) MS are removing the Family option, meaning I can no longer give them an allowance.</p>
<p>2) As they are child accounts I am unable to register any kind of payment options against the account.</p>
<p>I'd love to get the new Mass Effect Mash-up pack for Minecraft for them but can see no way of getting money onto their accounts to complete the purchase.</p>
<p>If anyone can point me in the right direction I would really appreciate it.</p>

<p>I am in the same boat!! I got so mad today trying to figure all this nonsense out, I just went to the store and bought a 1600 MSP card. I then signed into my sons account on his console and went under settings, selected account management and the redeem
 code. At that point I entered the code and was credited $20 to his account. I was then able to purchase an add-on for him. Hopefully, this helps you somewhat. Also, I did notice while I was logged into his account under account management if you scroll over
 the last page or tab, it has the option to promote the account to adult. I didn't do it, because I was unsure of what it would do. So, that might be an option, to look into.</p>

<p>Thanks for your suggestion - I had considered getting a points card but didn't realise that it would convert the points to currency at this stage.</p>
<p>I'm also reluctant to upgrade one of the child accounts as he is only 10. I'd hate to see the credit card bill if I added that to his account :) - It might make MS happy though!</p>
<p>I'd like to see some way of being able to purchase a product and it give you a code you can use to redeem the product on another account. That way I could have full control over what is being purchased. It would also work well at Birthdays and Christmas.</p>
<p>Thanks again for your help</p>

<p>You could always purchase it on your account. &nbsp;As long as they are on the same console it'll work on their accounts too.</p>

    <title>Is the Spirit Stone really that impossible to find&#63; - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Is the Spirit Stone really that impossible to find&#63;</h2>
                    
<p>I've done ALOT of research on finding the stupid&nbsp;Spirit Stone.&nbsp; These are the 3 locations I've tried:</p>
<p>Rotting cellar (Act 2 - Path to the Oasis)<br />
Watch Tower (Act 1 - Nothern Highlands)<br />
Sheltered Cottage (Act 1 - Fields of Misery)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I've spent over 5-6 hours trying these locations and still nothing...</p>
<p>The Vendor at the Rotting cellar only has Heath Potions</p>
<p>The Vendor at the Sheltered Cottage sells junk, no spirit stone</p>
<p>Watch Tower, after over 50 tries I still haven't see it appear.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If someone has found it, can you&nbsp;please&nbsp;tell me where&nbsp; you found it?&nbsp; Also, what Level were you playing on?</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<p>I actually found mine from one of the Vendors you get in the keep for Act III and IV. &nbsp;The best and easiest route to do this is to check all the vendors and if no-one has it, quit the game an re-load and keep trying. &nbsp;Shouldn't take you long.</p>

<p>Well, I'll try anything at this point....What difficulty were you playing on? &nbsp; And how the hell did you get the 5M in gold? &nbsp;I've done 5 playthroughs and I only have around 1.6M. I guess now that I'm a Paragon 4 I'll start collecting more money, but is
 there's a good spot that you farmed for that? &nbsp; Thanks @LadyHawk</p>

<p>I got my 5million by playing the game virtually non-stop since it was released on the 360 and don't forget, its not how much money you have, its how much money you "pick up", so selling goods doesn't help towards the achievement.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Best way to check how much gold you've actually picked up is to check out the challenge itself.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>As to what difficulty I was playing on at the time, I happened to be on inferno, but it will be cheaper for you if you try it on easy, as obviously goods cost a lot cheaper!</p>

<p>Yes, the spirit stone is the Monks Helmet.</p>
<p>There are many different types of spirit stones that you can find.&nbsp; I have plenty that I got from enemy drops and chests.</p>
<p>I was trying to get the achievement&nbsp;"Shut Up and Take My Money!", which is "Buy each type of item from merchants.".&nbsp;&nbsp; The spirit stone is one of the items you need to buy from a merchant which I though was impossible until Lady Hawk came in and saved the
 day.</p>

<h2>            &#34;Host Process for Windows services stopped working and was closed&#34;.</h2>
                    
<p>Recently, I had to recover my laptop from the Antimal Doctor Virus and from Security Suite Demo. I have run Malwarebytes, Microsoft Security Essentials, McAfee, and Ad-Aware and managed to wipe all the problems from my laptop. It no longer re-directs, slows
 down, or shows any sign of the problems mentioned above. During all of this, though, I noticed that a warning window started to pop up that said "host process for windows services stopped working and was closed". After shutting the prompt, it re-directs me
 to the Windows Support prompt, asking me to check my Windows Updates. I have checked my updates, but have not found any essentials needed.</p>
<p>I also checked to see if I was out of date on anything, I'm not. I also tried to download a reccommended Bits program for my 32 bit version of Vista, but a window popped up that said Recovery for Bits was not necessary at this time. My laptop has not shown
 any issues of crashing, and the host process warning appears to pop up at random times. Even if I'm not surfing the web, chatting, etc, if I leave my laptop alone long enough, the warning will appear. I have tried this on both my Admin and a new Test Account
 and received errors on both.</p>
<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<h2>            Windows 7 64 bit &#38; lexmark x5470 printer</h2>
                    I have a new Acer pc running on windows 7 64 bit and I have a Lexmark x 5470 printer. &nbsp;The printer was working on my old pc, but each time (probably 3 times now) I have downloaded the necessary drivers from the lexmark site (cjs5400en.exe), &amp; ran it, I
 get a windows error message "5400 series - no driver found" even though some of the software is there. &nbsp; &nbsp;I try a test print &amp; the printer starts but then stops. &nbsp;It is also very difficult to cancel it from the print queue and generally I have to shut down
 the pc.
<div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Any suggestions please, before I go and buy a new printer &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div><br />
</div>
<div>Thank you</div>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>There are no Windows 7 32bit or 64bit Printer Drivers for that Lexmark X5470 Printer available.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is the Lexmark information for your Model Printer:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.lexmark.com/index?segment=SUPPORT&amp;userlocale=EN_US&amp;locale=en&amp;productCode=LEXMARK_X5470&amp;page=product&amp;frompage=null#1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.lexmark.com/index?segment=SUPPORT&amp;userlocale=EN_US&amp;locale=en&amp;productCode=LEXMARK_X5470&amp;page=product&amp;frompage=null#1</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 2000, XP and Vista are the only Supported Operating Systems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can try the Vista 64bit Drivers available there.</p>
<p>If they do not work, it is time to upgrade your Printer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

<h2>            Ghost mouse cursor on Surface Pro Touchscreen of sleep resume</h2>
                    <p>Since updating my Surface Pro 4 to v1809 of Windows 10 Pro in December I've started getting a 'ghost' image on the top left of the screen after the tablet resumes from sleep mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ghost image contains a small opaque half-circle at the top of the screen with a cursor inside it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When you move the mouse or touch the screen the 'ghost cursor' disappears only to return once the mouse movement has finished.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Here's a short video of it. https://1drv.ms/v/s!AkTZ_HpJzrXqzN11lykq-RLtXW8c_A</p>
<p>
</p><p>The ghosting disappears on a restart and stays away until the Sleep mode has been activated.&nbsp; Removing the "HID-compliant touch screen' driver removes the ghost image (and stops the screen responding to touch).&nbsp; Reactivation or reinstalling the driver sees
 the return of the ghost until a restart.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've tried updating the Touch screen drivers without success but as these are dated 2006 I suspect these are not the cause.&nbsp; Similarly the "Intel(R) Precise Touch Device" driver is dated 2017,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts on how to remove the ghosting altogether?<br />
</p>
<p>
</p><p>

<h2>            Audio in lifecam is mostly static.</h2>
                    Hi. &nbsp;I recently installed Microsoft's Lifecam for my Lifecam HD 5000. &nbsp;Immediately from start I have had issues with the audio, weather recording audio or trying to record video, having a weird uncomfortable static buzz really loud. &nbsp;I can hear myself
 some in the audio, but it's mixed in all of this garble. &nbsp;I use a program called "Free Sound Recorder" that works fine for the audio files I create with the webcam. &nbsp;Also It works fine on skype. &nbsp;So it seems to only be a problem with Microsoft's software.
 &nbsp;Thank's for any help and suggestions in advance!

<p>That is not the answer I was looking for. I saw an article last week
 where someone asked how they could get their Start Screen to look like Windows 8.1.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was something like Tablet Mode then Setting, but then I can't remember which settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I changed my settings and now want to change it back again.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>can you write <strong>a little bit more</strong> about your <strong>problem</strong>? Did the printer<strong> print ever before</strong>?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What you can do - reinstall driver of your printer.</strong></p>
<p>Here is how to uninstall first:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/kcs/document?c=us&amp;cs=04&amp;l=en&amp;s=bsd&amp;docid=DSN_332365&amp;isLegacy=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.dell.com/support/topics/global.aspx/support/kcs/document?c=us&amp;cs=04&amp;l=en&amp;s=bsd&amp;docid=DSN_332365&amp;isLegacy=true</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And here you can download new driver:</p>
<p><a href="http://support.dell.com/support/downloads/driverslist.aspx?c=us&amp;cs=04&amp;l=en&amp;s=bsd&amp;os=W764&amp;osl=en&amp;SystemID=PRN_INKJET_725&amp;catid=-1&amp;impid=-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.dell.com/support/downloads/driverslist.aspx?c=us&amp;cs=04&amp;l=en&amp;s=bsd&amp;os=W764&amp;osl=en&amp;SystemID=PRN_INKJET_725&amp;catid=-1&amp;impid=-1</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>select right <strong>"Operating system</strong>".</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>but how you can see here, your<strong> printer is not compatibile with windows 7 64bit</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/Windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Details.aspx?type=Hardware&amp;p=Dell%20725%20Color%20Inkjet%20Printer&amp;v=Dell&amp;uid=&amp;pf=0&amp;pi=0&amp;c=Printers%20%26%20Scanners&amp;sc=Ink-Jet%20Printers&amp;os=64-bit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/Windows/compatibility/windows-7/en-us/Details.aspx?type=Hardware&amp;p=Dell%20725%20Color%20Inkjet%20Printer&amp;v=Dell&amp;uid=&amp;pf=0&amp;pi=0&amp;c=Printers%20%26%20Scanners&amp;sc=Ink-Jet%20Printers&amp;os=64-bit</a></p>

    <title>Microtech scam&#63;&#33; - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ivansoliani  say:</h3>
<h2>            Microtech scam&#63;&#33;</h2>
                    unfortunately, I let a mob calling themselves Global Microtech Security convinced me that they were from Microsoft, and allowed them remote access to fix my computer problems. Although I was very dubious, they seemed to be very techically knowledgeable,
 so i let them go ahead. But then they said that they could not go any further because my software warranty had expired, and that i had to renew it first. When I saw the different packages available, and a price involved, alarm bells went off in my head. (too
 late I suspect)! So I told&nbsp; them that I could not renew it till my next pay, in 2 days. They said OK, but that I should delete their email, and not use the computer till then. (More bells).

<h2>            Error code for Chicony 2.0 webcam stating, &#34; Webcam driver open fail. Please restart camera or computer.&#34;</h2>
                    I have a gateway M-6752 model which had a chicony &nbsp;2.0 webcam built into it. Recently I started getting an error message stating,"Webcam driver open fail. Please restart camera or computer." I have tried to uninstall, modify, and repair the driver, along
 with uninstalling the program and reinstalling it offline to no avail. Are there any suggestions as to why this device stopped working, and how to repair the problem?When I purchased my laptop it had windows vista home premium installed onto it. At this point
 I don't know what to do other than possibly do a system reboot and see if that perhaps helps or do a factory reboot and get it working as i had it when i first purchased it. Any suggestions on the matter?&nbsp;

            Hi, <br />
Since you said it has worked in the past, I think a System Restore might be of help to you.
<br />
&nbsp;Please see this link: <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-vista/System-Restore-frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">

</a><br />
<br />
However, if it truly is the actual physical hardware that has gone bad, then you will need to speak with Gateway. If it were an external camera, I'd say visit the manufacturer's website, but since it was built into the computer, I'd say your best bet is with
 Gateway. <br />
