<p>This is complete bollocks. Nothing was fixed.</p>
<p>This, and im still getting booted from the game every 5 minutes. I dont think there is anyway to get your save game back. It was overwritten.</p>

<p>Just missed&nbsp;the upgrade&nbsp;- just my luck ...</p>
<p>I think these queries&nbsp;related to my other laptop -&nbsp;my other laptop is an Acer to which I changed when I was told the Sony didn't accept Windows 10 but I have since had nought but problems with both since I changed to Windows 10. I do use Windows Update but
 I'm not very conversant with solving problems. I gave up with it before but tried one last time.</p>

<p>Yes, &nbsp;officiallly Windows &nbsp;10 free &nbsp;upgrade is over. &nbsp;But, &nbsp;you &nbsp;can still get it free if you have a genuine version of windows 7/8/8.1. All you have to do is just tell a lie. To get Windows &nbsp;10 for free go to this link" https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/accessibility/windows10upgrade"
 , and click upgrade now. It will download the windows isntaller. &nbsp;Open the file and click upgrade this PC, next or OK &nbsp;accordingly.&nbsp;As far as I know your laptop supports &nbsp;Windows 10, but no problem. &nbsp;If it does not supports the installer will tell. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Waiting for your reply, inform me if that works for you.</p>

<p>Thank you for replying and the advice, and the trouble you have gone to in replying.
</p>
<p>The person who gave me the laptop did a clean install of Windows 7 (they say) - but - all this is clearly beyond me : the laptop had
<em>Windows Defender</em> and something called a <em>360 Total Protection</em> program which I thought worked (but they never seemed to do much). I've since had to dump the computer in question and&nbsp;I'm seeing if I can manage my few needs on a public network
 at the library on Wednesdays. Things were fine until they&nbsp;went wrong - my basic knowledge is obviously&nbsp;insufficient to solve these problems so I don't know if I will be getting another pc (I'm 65 years old, I don't play computer games but I did watch the occasional
 dvd on it as I don't&nbsp;have television). Thanks again.</p>

<p>You're welcome &amp; thanks for your followup. I think "dumping" the <del>user</del>
<em>used&nbsp;</em>computer was an EXCELLENT idea - good for you! [PS: I'm the same age as you.]</p>
<p>
</p><p>TIP: There are relatively inexpensive brand-new "netbook" computers on the market. Most can access the internet via mobile wireless (as well as true Wi-Fi at the library or other "hotspot"). Ditto for relatively expensive smartphones which you can use to
 browse the 'net as well as make "phone calls." <em>Yes, it's a brave new world and we're just trying to keep up with everything.</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>PS: You're not missing anything not having a TV, trust me. The good stuff (i.e., PBS) is available online at your library.</p>

    <title>Best settings to Burn an Audio Cd for car. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jpl327  say:</h3>
<h2>            Best settings to Burn an Audio Cd for car.</h2>
                    I have a 2004 Toyota Camry. In the owner's manual it states that the cd player "<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">may not be able</span> to play CD-R cd's". I've tried different burning programs/file formats/burn speeds, but the only ones I could
 get to play at all were burned with&nbsp;Media Center, audio cd (PCM format) at slow or medium speed. The trouble is it takes nearly a minute to start playing from the time I insert the disc until I actually hear music. Once the disc is playing I can FF &amp; Rew the
 track and it also will go into the next track with the normal delay between songs, but if I try to switch to a different track there is a 45sec delay berfore it re-reads and starts playing again. Are there&nbsp;any other configurable options that might help here?
 I'm only changing burn speed to medium (fast and fastest cause a read error in my car player) and PCM file type (automatic for Audio CD's)&nbsp;the songs are Mp3 before the conversion to PCM. Also, I've read about CD-R's designed for audio, but I can't find who
 makes them or where to get them. Would it even be worth the effort to try to find Audio CD-R's?

<p><span>Hi jpl327,</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>a. Have you tried burning using Windows Media Player 12 (WMP12)?<br />
</span></p>
<p><span><br />
CD-R is Compact Disc – Readable. You cannot erase the content, once burnt onto the disc. CD-Rs are ideal for making Audio CDs.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>If you want to make a standard music CD that will play in nearly any CD player, choose the Audio CD option.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>This is ideal for making custom music CDs that you can play using any car or home stereo..</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Content: Music only</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Capacity: Up to 80 minutes</span></p>
<p><span><span>·<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Playback devices: Almost any CD player, including those found in home stereos, car stereos, and computers.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>As you burn an audio CD, Windows Media Player makes temporary copies of the WMA and MP3 files in your burn list, converts the copies to another format
 (known as PCM), and then saves the converted copies to the disc.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You may select the lowest burning speed for best results.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

            I am using the Windows Media Player version that is included with Windows 7 Ultimate. I don't know how to tell what version it is , but I assume since it was included with Win 7 it is the most current version. Only the medium&nbsp;or the slow speed burn produced
 a playable disc. I was hoping to find some fine tune settings that might eliminate the delay when first inserting the disc or changing tracks.

<p><span>Hello, Jaalkaup</span></p>
<p><span>Try doing a clean boot of Windows, this will help rule out if another program is interfering with the backup process. To perform
 a clean boot, do the following:</span></p>
<p><span><span>1.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Log on to the computer by using an account that has administrator rights.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>2.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>Start</strong>, type <strong>msconfig.exe</strong> in the <strong>Start Search</strong> box, and then press ENTER to start the System Configuration Utility.<br />
If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click
<strong>Continue</strong>. </span></p>
<p><span><span>3.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the
<strong>General</strong> tab, click <strong>Selective Startup</strong>, and then click to clear the
<strong>Load startup items</strong> check box. (The <strong>Use Original Boot.ini</strong> check box is unavailable.)
</span></p>
<p><span><span>4.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>On the
<strong>Services </strong>tab, click to select the <strong>Hide all Microsoft services</strong> check box, and then click
<strong>Disable all</strong>.<br />
<br />
<strong>Note</strong> Following this step lets Microsoft services continue to run. These services include Networking, Plug and Play, Event Logging, Error Reporting, and other services. If you disable these services, you may permanently delete all restore points.
 Do not do this if you want to use the System Restore utility together with existing restore points.
</span></p>
<p><span><span>5.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Click
<strong>OK</strong>, and then click <strong>Restart</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>After you perform a clean boot try to create a backup. If you are able to run the backup there is likely another program causing
 it to fail. You will want to follow the troubleshooting steps at the link below.</span></p>
<p><span>For more information about the clean boot, refer to:

                    My printer has always worked before,but for some reason it won't work now unless I'm just making a copy of something. Anything I try to print from my computer won't print. In my control pannel it says my printer is "offline", but when I right-click on
 it, "offline" or "online" isn't an option. I tried updating the software &amp; drivers for my printer online, but it said I have the most updated stuff already. I've even tried changing the USB port&nbsp;I had the&nbsp;printer plugged into&nbsp;my computer, but that didn't help,
 of course! Any help would be great! Thanks to anyone who replies with any ideas!

<p><span>Hi
<span>hipbeachgirl,</span></span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft windows vista forums!</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I would like to know the following information to help focus in the right direction!</span></p>
<p><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Did you make any changes to the computer prior to this issue?</span></p>
<p><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Does this happen after you wake the computer from sleep?</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 1:
</span></strong><span>Check if your printer is set to sleep, if the printer is set to sleep, I would appear offline.</span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span></span><span><span>Open Device Manager by clicking the
</span></span><span><span><strong>Start</strong></span></span><span><span> button
</span></span></span><span><span><span>, clicking
</span><span><strong>Control Panel</strong></span><span>, clicking
</span><span><strong>System and Maintenance</strong></span><span>, and then clicking
</span><span><strong>Device Manager</strong></span><span>.</span></span></span><span><span>‌</span></span><span><span>
</span><span><span>&nbsp;If you are prompted for an administrator password or confirmation, type the password or provide confirmation.</span></span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the list of device categories, expand
<span><strong>Ports</strong></span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Right-click the entry for the printer, and then click
<span><strong>Properties</strong></span>.</span></span></p>
<p>
<span><span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>In the
<span><strong>printer Properties</strong></span> dialog box, click the
<span><strong>Power Management</strong></span> tab, <strong>
Uncheck</strong> the <span><strong>Allow this computer to turn off this device to save power</strong></span> check box, and then click
<span><strong>OK</strong></span>.</span></span></p>
<p><span>If this does not help then install the latest service pack
</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 2:<span>&nbsp;
</span>Put the computer in clean boot (to figure out if any third party software is hindering the process)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></strong></p>

<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>----&gt; How to troubleshoot a problem by performing a clean boot in Windows Vista or in Windows 7</span></p>
<p><span>Perform a clean boot (check step 1 of the link); if everything works fine after a clean boot, you can infer that some third
 party services are causing the problem.</span></p>
<p><span>Proceed with the remaining steps to pin-point out the third party service.
</span></p>
<p><span>Note: After you figure out the problem causing program, you may have to update or install a higher version of the program, if
 you seldom use that software you can consider uninstalling </span></p>
<p><span>Important: - remember to put the computer back to normal startup</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Step 3: Install the latest service pack</span></strong></p>

<h2>            Windows Update stalls on 0&#37;</h2>
                    <p>I'm pulling my hair out over this one. &nbsp;I can't figure this out. &nbsp;When I go to run windows update, I get stuck at downloading updates 0%. &nbsp;This is a clean install of Windows 10 Anniversary edition. &nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done the following posted by <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/profile/3e4d94c0-0e1a-4eaa-aeb1-31735e1f6eae" title="Uttam Yadav">

<p>
</p><p>The following services stop as soon as I start Windows Update:</p>
<p>UsoSvc (set to manual, but I start it; then start Windows Update and it shuts it down).</p>
<p>wuausrv</p>
<p>bits</p>
<p>
</p><p>I start them up again. &nbsp;But when I start Windows Update, they stop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I have no AV installed, so I'm out of ideas.</p>

<p>The troubleshooter said it didn't find any problems.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've done another clean install.&nbsp; This time the only thing I installed were drivers.&nbsp; No apps.&nbsp; I wanted to eliminate the possibility that there was something interfering with WU.&nbsp; It got further, but it eventually stalls.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Is there any kind of mailing list I can get on for a fix when it's available?&nbsp; It's pretty obvious that I won't get the fix through WU.&nbsp;&nbsp; :)</p>

<p>Well, the Clean install link is basically "Clean Install 101". &nbsp;Those are the steps everyone should follow (It's what I do).</p>
<p>
</p><p>Integrity checklist was cool. &nbsp;Bookmarked that one.</p>
<p>
</p><p>SFC the first time came back with repairs it said it made. &nbsp;Didn't fix anything. &nbsp;After the second clean install, SFC found nothing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now I did change something for the second clean install; I turned off the Intel hard drive stuff (can't remember what it's called off of the top of my head), and set the hard drive to AHCI instead. &nbsp;So, we'll see how that goes for a while.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 - Post-Install - Endless Spinning Circle When Booting Up - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> hmc844  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 - Post-Install - Endless Spinning Circle When Booting Up</h2>
                    <p>TL;DR - I updated my Windows 8.1 HP Pavilion laptop to Windows 10 last night. It is now stuck after the HP logo screen upon the "Please Wait" spinning circle. I can boot into Safe Mode.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Details -&nbsp;</p>
<p>I tried to update my laptop last year, when Windows 10 was first released. The update failed before it finished, and I was able to reset back to 8.1. I gave up on it until this week, since it was announced that the upgrade will no longer be free.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>This time, it seemingly installed everything. I went through the introductory screen (setting up my customizations, Cortana, etc.), then it attempted to restart. Ever since, it cannot go past the Please Wait spinning circle. After a few seconds, the message
 disappears, leaving the circles.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've spent most of the day searching through forums and trying various solutions, since I know this is a common problem. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to figure out what exactly is wrong. The trick of Ctrl+Alt+Delete and Shift+Restart to get to the
 Troubleshooting screen does not work for me. I have to force shut down with the Power button, and as soon as the HP logo appears, shut it down again, doing so three times until the Automatic Repair process begins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>These are a few of the solutions I've tried:&nbsp;https://www.quora.com/Urgent-My-laptop-is-stuck-at-please-wait-screen-Cant-restart-alt+Ctrl+del-and-even-f8-isnt-working-What-do-I-do</p>
<p>
</p><p>1 - Clean boot didn't work. Still only boots in Safe Mode.<br />
2 - SFC scan showed no errors.<br />
3 - Couldn't create new account.<br />
4 - No system restore points available.<br />
5 - DISM scan resulted in Error 87.<br />
6 - Said restoreoptin process did not exist.<br />
<br />
I also checked all drivers for updates in Safe Mode with Networking, disabled the video driver, removed the battery, and tried restarting both with and without my USB mouse plugged in. I let it sit for over 4 hours on the loading screen, seeing if it would
 eventually finish whatever it's trying to do. It seems like Windows 10 did indeed install, since I can see it all in Safe Mode, but it will not boot in Normal Mode.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have all my files backed up on an external hard drive, but if it comes down to resetting my entire laptop just for Windows 10, I'm not sure it's worth it. But I'm giving myself until the end of tomorrow to keep trying. After that, if it's still not
 working, I must revert back to Windows 8.1, as I need a functioning laptop for work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not very tech-savvy, so detailed instructions would be most appreciated. I'm currently using a borrowed Windows 10 (pre-installed) HP laptop to post this. Please let me know if you require any further information.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you!</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>As per the description, I suggest that you perform Power Drain and check if you able to access the desktop screen. To do so follow the steps below</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Unplug the charger and remove the battery of your laptop, if using a desktop remove the power cord.</span></li><li><span>Press and hold the Power button for 30sec
</span></li><li><span>Plug the charger/power cord and restart system</span></li></ul>
<p>
</p><p>Also,&nbsp;as described by you, you were able to load to Windows 10 Safe Mode and not&nbsp;normal mode. This might indicate that the drivers of the PC may be the cause of the issue. I suggest that you log into Safe Mode with Networking, uninstall the drivers via Device
 Manager and reinstall&nbsp;the drivers for your PC by visiting the manufacturer website. To learn how to perform the above, refer to the article below which outlines the procedure in detail.</p>
<p><a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_devices/how-to-install-and-update-drivers-in-windows-10/a97bbbd1-9973-4d66-9a5b-291300006293">How to: Install and Update drivers in Windows 10</a></p>

            <p>Thank you!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I let my laptop sit all night, and this morning, it had seemingly finished and I was able to log in normally. I went through the Settings to make sure everything was updated and running properly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>One of the drivers (I believe it was the audio one) needed an update and afterward, for the laptop to be restarted. I did so, and now unfortunately, I'm back at the endless spinning circle screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>It seems similar to this person's problem:&nbsp;https://www.reddit.com/r/Windows10/comments/48zrkb/windows_10_stuck_at_spinning_circle_login_screen/</p>
<p>
</p><p>If so, that may mean it's related to a Windows 10 update. However, I've checked the update menu in Safe Mode, and the most recent one is mandatory and cannot be uninstalled. And I still don't have any restore points available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>So at this point, I'm not sure whether to try the solutions you suggested in your post or to wait it out. Windows 10 otherwise seemed fine when I was in, but this rebooting issue is most inconvenient.</p>

            Well, I've let it sit for 12 hours to no avail. I'm trying your solutions now, but I'm not confident in my ability to mess with the drivers, especially since when I was in normal mode, they all said they were fully updated. But I'm doing my best.&nbsp;

            <p>FINAL UPDATE:</p>
<p>
</p><p>For anyone else having this problem, unfortunately, none of the solutions I tried worked. I even attempted to revert back to Windows 8, but it failed. So I had no choice but to Reset my PC, keeping my files.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>The first time seemingly worked, and I was able to even install the Windows Updates and restart without issue. But then, my laptop would shut down instead of sleep, and after I updated the display driver, the whole thing crashed, and upon reboot, I was back
 at the endless spinning circle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I reset again, and this time, everything seems to be working fine. I installed only Windows Updates, and my laptop sleeps normally. The downside, of course, is that I have had to reinstall all my programs, but luckily, that's been more of an annoyance, since
 I didn't have that many.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Though I'm sorry I couldn't solve the problem in a better way, I do hope this helps somebody with a similar issue.</p>

<p>
</p><p>You folks at Microsoft need better reading skills. You thanked him for sharing the resolution? What resolution? Reset everything lose all you work. Lots of extra effort. That is NOT resolution. Microsoft releasing good code would be resolution. Gigantic
 beta testing and calling it new releases that can't be rolled back is the opposite of good.&nbsp;</p>

            How is having to restore your computer a helpful solution? It may save the files but you still have to install ALL the programs that were on before ... Then of course your windows 10 will update again in future and crash... again. You can no longer boot
 in safe mode unless you're logged in (madness) .. You really need to get your act together Microsoft and test more .. lots of people are sitting watching spinning wheels on screens for 12 hours .. because of your OS and conflicting updates. The solution is
 for you to release a patch and a tool asap ..&nbsp;

<p><br />
Use UDF most of the time.</p>
<p>CDFS uses the ATAPI block driver for audio and video navigation and playback. It follows the ISO 9660 specification and supports long file names.</p>
<p>UDF uses the USB block driver or the ATAPI block driver for audio and video navigation and playback. It follows OTSA UDF revisions 1.02 through 2.50. These versions of UDF specifications replace CDFS for optical media file systems that support live file
 systems in addition to mastered media.</p>
<p>(UDF was made to somewhat replace CDFS... and work with it.)</p>

 just disgusting.</p>

            And even if they force us to use Edge instead of the reader app, then they should first make Edge interface similar to reader app. The only reason I shifted to reader app was dark background and easy access to previously opened files.

<p>I personally and at our office use the Reader.app daily. One of the very few apps that you actually got right and is a joy to use. Fast easy and efficient.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Trying to force us to edge which is slow and cumbersone and uses way to much system resources is a horrible attempt at gaining users. We will just go back and find a 3rd party pdf reader.

<p>I'm a teacher and dealing with PDF documents is what I almost exclusively do during office hours. I use variety of professional tools for creation, including Adobe Acrobat and LaTeX, and countless other options for inking, but Reader was my app of choice
 for viewing for 3 years.</p>
<p>
</p><p>It was one of those few apps Microsoft did right - fast and efficient. Retiring it and forcing people to use web browser instead is just beyond me.&nbsp; Just one more, in a chain of bad decisions, that Microsoft is recently making.&nbsp;</p>

 the Adobe Reader T</span><span>ouch app to see if compared to the Reader app. However, Adobe Reader only allows you to choose single page or continuous views. There isn’t a two-page view option. Also, they won’t let you have multiple

<p>I am appalled by this, edge it a terrible replacement!</p>
<p>Usage of PDF's is very different to web pages, mixing them up together is incredibly inconvenient.</p>
<p>
</p><p>By all means, decide to stop adding features to Reader if you can't be bothered, but don't stop it from operating. That's going back to the bad old days of Microsoft constantly bullying users.... I thought you were past that by now.</p>

<p>Hi Cheryl,<br />
</p>
<p>There are several modes that you can choose from when using a multi-monitor setup. Configuration is simple, as long as you follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Connect the monitor to your laptop using the appropriate cable (HDMI, DVI, or VGA, depending on the device).</li><li>Make sure the monitor is turned on, which is usually indicated by a glowing power button.</li><li>Press the <strong>Windows key and P</strong> at the same time on your keyboard.
</li><li>Choose <strong>Duplicate</strong> if you want your monitor to show what's being shown on your laptop screen.</li><li>Choose <strong>Extend</strong> if you want an additional monitor to work on while having an active laptop screen.
</li><li>Choose <strong>Second screen only</strong> if you want to use the monitor instead of your laptop screen.</li></ol>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know if you have any other concerns about using your computer.</p>

            How does one accidentally delete a .dll file?!
<div><br />
<div>Do you know which one it was?</div>
<div><br />
<div>For the time being, and in the event you do not have a program that can interfere with System Restore (like Norton or McAfee), follow these directions to attempt a System Restore in Safe Mode with Command Prompt (and choose the date immediately before
 your accidental deletion):</div>
<div><br />
<div><span>To start System Restore using the Command prompt, follow these steps:</span>
<ol>
<li>
Restart your computer, and then press and hold F8 during the initial startup to start your computer in safe mode with a Command prompt.</li><li>
Use the arrow keys to select the&nbsp;<strong>Safe mode with a Command prompt</strong>&nbsp;option.</li><li>
If you are prompted to select an operating system, use the arrow keys to select the appropriate operating system for your computer, and then press ENTER.</li><li>
Log on as an administrator or with an account that has administrator credentials.</li><li>
At the command prompt, type&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold">%systemroot%\system32\restore\rstrui.exe</span>, and then press ENTER.</li><li>
Follow the instructions that appear on the screen to restore your computer to a functional state.</li></ol>

<p>
</p><p>I would go to the above link and let the malware removal forum clean your pc, Read the pinned messages first.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, you might want to boot to safe mode and see if you can scan there with the MBAM and or avast</p>
<p>
</p><p>then you should run checkdisk with the /r parameter</p>
<p>
</p><p>if you do not have Recovery Console installed, then run from the start menu</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>go to start, run, type in cmd</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>in cmd type in&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; chkdsk c: /r&nbsp;&nbsp; and press enter</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>type Y for yes and press enter</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>type exit and press enter</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>restart pc, allow checkdisk to finish and run again</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>this is a lengthy process depending on the size of your harddrive, the percentages will fluctuate, this is normal, you can view report in the event viewer.</p>
<p>go to start&gt;run&gt; and type in eventvwr.msc, click on the applications directory, and in the right hand panel choose winlogon.</p>

            <p>Well what has basically happened is that you have deleted a system file. In my opinion, since you cant access anything get a .ISO of Windows XP/7/8/8.1. I prefer to use Windows 7. After that reboot your PC, and access the Boot option on start-up. Few more
 things. Make sure the .ISO is on CD/DVD or USB and choose the USB in the boot option using your arrow keys and hit Enter.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>1.select Custom installation and select the Drive which has Windows XP on it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.(remember everything will be wiped and you will have a good as new PC)</p>
<p>
</p><p>3.Now just select the partition Windows is on and over-write it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4.Wait until it's over and reboots for the last time.(It will say that before it happens)</p>
<p>
</p><p>5.Now when booting remove USB so Windows can be booted from Your main drive.</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; DO NOT LET IT BOOT FROM USB!!!</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>6:After that You should be as good as new and everything should be working Great.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>GLAD I can help, and I would love to have you respond back to me</p>

    <title>Problems with Xbox Live connection - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Problems with Xbox Live connection</h2>
                    
<p>Hello all,</p>
<p>I have some problems regarding Xbox Live on my Xbox 360. As soon as I want to play online with some &nbsp;friends I get kicked out of the Xbox Live party, and the game. I especially experience this while playing COD: AW, but also experienced this while playing
 COD: Ghosts. Sometimes I can play just fine, but when I get kicked out I cant seem to connect to Xbox Live anymore. When I try to the only error message I get is that 'there might be some networkconnection problems'.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Especially when in a party with one friend of my I keep getting kicked out. Sometimes I can just play nice, but as soon as this friend joins I'm done. Most of the problems I received where:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can't connect to Xbox Live party. </li><li>Can connect to Xbox Live party, but get kicked out within a few minutes, as well in game.
</li><li>Can't connect to Xbox Live after being kicked off. </li></ul>
<p>My NAT type is open, so says COD. I've tried several things to solve this, but it doesn't seem to be working:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gave my Xbox a static IP-adress and manually a subnetmask, gateway and DNS-servers. Next I forwarded the ports in my router's settings, with the static IP-adress from my Xbox.&nbsp;
</li><li>When enabling Upnp and putting the Xbox static IP-adress in to the DMZ I get a moderate NAT type.
</li><li>Enabled and disabled Upnp.&nbsp; </li><li>Tried wired connection. </li></ul>
<p>I basically tried everything I could find on the internet, but it doesn't seem to help me at all. Here is some extra information:</p>
<p><strong><span>What Country/State/Province do you live in?</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Netherlands, Limburg<br />
<strong><span>Modem brand &amp; model number:</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ubee evw 3200<br />
<strong><span>Router brand &amp; model number:</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span>Ubee evw 3200</span></strong><br />
<b><span>How many consoles do you have connected to this router?</span></b></p>
<p><span>Just one Xbox 360<b><br />
Wired or wireless (for each console):</b>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Wireless</span><br />
<strong><span>If Wireless, are you using a white or black external adapter, or an internal (Xbox 360S) adapter?
</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Internal Xbox 360s adapter</span></p>
<p><br />
<strong><span>Things you have tried:&nbsp;</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>Is UPnP Enabled? Yes/no/Unknown</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Yes</span><br />
<strong><span>Do you have a NAT error? If so, what is your NAT type?</span></strong></p>
<p><span>No NAT error, it says it’s open</span><strong><span>.</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>Any Error Codes you encounter:&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>None</span><br />
<strong><span>Who is your ISP(Internet Service Provider)?&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Ziggo</span><br />
<strong><span>After you run "Test Xbox LIVE connection" press “Y” for "More Info”. In the pop-up that appears, what are the following values, if shown? (If a value below does not appear for you, just leave it blank.)</span></strong><br />
<strong><span>W: </span></strong><span>0000 - 0021</span><span>
</span><br />
<strong><span>X: </span></strong><span>0000 – F001</span><br />

<p>Hello Oswaldiusz,</p>
<p>I am sorry about hearing the connection issue you are having. I can see that you have a Moderate NAT type. Also, Connection issues is normal with Advanced Warfare.</p>
<p>Unplug your router/modem for 30 seconds and then plug it back in. Your modem/router should be reset every once and a while for better performance.</p>
<p>What all is connected to your WiFi at the times you are playing? Having too many things connected to the WiFi at a time can activate EM interference (Electromagnetic Interference), such as a smartphone. You should put your phone into Airplane mode, for the
 exact reason why you must put it in that setting when on an Airplane. Your phone is ALWAYS communicating with random stuff. If your smartphone can disrupt an airplanes communication, it can disrupt your consoles communication. Also, Laptops or a computer,
 disconnect from the internet on them. Even wireless controllers can cause EM interference, so if you have a cord that you can plug into your remote to connect to your Xbox, go ahead and do so. Also, if your headset is wireless- that can also cause EM interference.</p>
<p><span>Lastly, If your NAT type is closed or moderate- Unplug your modem/router, while that is restarting; Hard restart your console.For Xbox360, just unplug the power brick. For the Xbox One all you have to do is hold down the power button for 10 seconds,
 after it has shut down plug your modem/router back in. After your modem/router has been fired up, turn back on your Xbox.</span></p>
<p>If you want any tips on how to reduce lag on Xbox Live video games, I created a thread for that! Check it out:

<p>At the time of playing there are mostly 2 laptops connected to the WiFi, a long with 2-3 smartphones. I dont think this is a big deal, especially since I have a good internet connection which should easily handle all of these connections. Before these problems
 occurred I also managed to play normally, with the same devices connected to the WiFi.
</p>
<p>Furthermore I have resetted my modem/router several times, a long with the Xbox being restarted. This didn't help either.
</p>
<p>Thanks for your answer but I want to play normally along with my devices connected to the same WiFi, which my internet should be easily capable of.</p>

            <p>Hello&nbsp; Sharief,</p>
<p>Thankyou for your reply unfortunately I cannot get passed&nbsp; the Change User Account settings before the User Control comes on and asks me for ASPNET MACHINE ACCOUNT password, I never set this thing up. if I had I would have a password, I am really annoyed
 and can't do anything to fix it, and no body can tell me how, as I can't get passed stage one, If I click on aspnet account all I get is a blank screen and asks for password, This is a new computer only 6 wks old and I want
 it seems to be quite rare with Windows 8,</p>
<p>I would rather sacrifice Printshop than have this on my computer I can do what I want and more with SERIF</p>
<p>Any help gratefully received, Thank-You</p>
<p>Margaret</p>

            <p>Still can't sort this problem and I don't think anyone else can either, I cannot do anything and can't get anyone to understand, whatever I try and do I get the user account control from asp.net wanting a password<span style="text-decoration-line: underline">....
 I do not have a password</span>. otherwise it would not be a problem,&nbsp; If I would try and restore computer I doubt that I could before that asp would come on again, wanting a password, and if I did manage to do something and it was still there I would not

<h2>            Will Microsof bring back the ability to search in a specific app&#63;</h2>
                    On of my favorite features on Windows 8 was the ability to search directly into a specific app.&nbsp; I do not always want to "Search Everywhere and Everything".&nbsp; In fact, most of the time you have an idea of the area that you want to search in.&nbsp; Also it would
 have the latest apps I've used at the top when I swiped from the right allowing a quick way to jump into an app if it was no longer open.&nbsp; I have a windows phone, Xbox, Surface RT, and Windows 8.1 based laptop and I would REALLY love this feature brought back.

            Hi Dale
<br />
<br />My name is Andre Da Costa; an Independent Consultant, Windows Insider MVP and Windows &amp; Devices for IT MVP.  I'm here to help you with your problem.
<br />
<br />Which product are you wishing to use the PowerBI Add In with?
<br />
<br />There is a direct download page at the following link:
<br /><a href="https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/</a>
<br />
<br />Are you downloading the add in an Office application.

<p>Hey Andre</p>
<p>thank you so much for responding back. The product the user would like to use power bi with is powerpoint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I will try this direct download page to see if it works for me. no I don't think we&nbsp; are downloading it from an office application. One of the clients the user works with sent her a link which didn't work.&nbsp; i googled the rest and didn't find any other links
 that worked. downloading it isn't the problem, the problem is trying to add the add in to powerpoint.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>Contacts list in Windows Live Mail is out of date - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Contacts list in Windows Live Mail is out of date</h2>
                    I noticed today that a contact who I frequently mail had apparently disappeared from my Contacts list in Windows Live Mail.&nbsp;
<div>On checking further, I see I am being presented with an old version of my contacts list - it contains names and addresses I had removed at least six months ago, and does not contain at least 20 contacts I have added over recent months.
<div>Oddly, when I look on my iPad, the contacts list is the correct, most recent version.</div>
<div>I am the only user of my PC and have not modified any settings or knowingly applied any updates in recent weeks.</div>
</div>
                </div>

            I've just solved my problem by a rather more drastic method, so can no longer try out your solution. While i should very much like to understand WHY and how the problem was caused, I've realised since we left DOS so far behind us that this is often no
 longer possible
<div>in case it is of help to anyone else, here's what I did:
<div>Having realised that Gmail still had the correct version of my Contacts, which was working via my iPad, I logged into gmail on the pc and exported the Contact file to the Downloads folder on the pc as a .cav file (no, I'm not a 70 year old computer genius,
 I looked it up on this forum!). I then opened windows Live Mail and imported the list (instructions from forum again).</div>
<div>However, I made an error which meant I then had a contacts list which contained both the old and the new data, i.e. Hundreds of duplicates. I solved this by deleting all the contacts (see forum) and then importing the .cav file into what was now an empty
 contacts list.</div>
<div>One thing to be careful with is to ensure in WLM that when you use the "import" facility you look at the list of fields it is proposing to import. Make sure the fields you need, like 'email address' are ticked or they will not be downloaded to your Contacts
 list.</div>
<div>I'm typing this on the iPad and the keyboard keeps freezing, so this granny is now off to another forum to try to solve that problem!</div>
<div>Thanks for your help!</div>

That wasn't a solution; it was diagnostics, which you san still carry out - it might be revealing for you. However, you now state that you're reading Gmail on your iPad. Was that the case when you wrote
<em>when I look on my iPad, the contacts list is the correct, most recent version</em>?<br />

            I agree that it might be interesting, despite the fact the Contacts list of windows Live Mail has now been modified to show the latest version. I will try and let you know the outcome.
<div><br />
<div>When the problem originally occurred, I was reading my email via windows Live Mail on my pc. It was only later, when I looked at my iPad (which is also set up to receive mail from both my gmail and other accounts) that I noticed the contacts were up to
 date and that somewhere in gmail there was indeed still a correct version of the contact list. Hence my decision to delete the list being offered on the pc in WLM and import the correct version from gmail.</div>

            I have now opened WLM and the right-hand button showed my email address. As you suggested, I signed out of wlm and the contacts list jumped back to what it was before the problem occurred, i.e. Contacts up to date and also showing the various groups/categories
 I had recently created and which had not been restored by my own solution of deletion- importation.
<div>I have now signed back in to WLM and the contacts list has reverted to the list I created, which is without the groups.&nbsp;</div>
<div>Can you suggest what I should do to retrieve the version showing the groups?</div>
<div>And I'd be fascinated if you could give me an explanation of why it all occurred in the first place! Thanks!</div>

            <p>You have now discovered the difference between being signed in and not being signed in in Windows Live Mail.
</p>
<ul>
<li>When you're signed in, you see the contacts list belonging to the account you sign in with.
<br />
This list remains synchronized with the one at contacts.live.com, which is also available to you from other devices like your iPad.</li><li>When you're not signed in, you see the default contacts list.<br />
This list is&nbsp;not synchronized at all.</li></ul>
<p>The same applies to calendars.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>If you want to be able to use the same contacts list in various places, and to keep them safely backed up, then always sign in in Windows Live Mail. Since you constructed your 'proper' list with its categories while you were not signed in, you're going to
 have to set up the categories again. There is no easy way of transferring contact data from the default set to another set.</p>

            Thank you very much - I shall now re-construct the groups and, more important to me at least, I have understood what caused the problem and so can hopefully avoid it in future!

<h2>            Abusive messages</h2>
                    
<p>I got an email from Xbox to return. And report a specific gamer tag for abusive behavior on Xbox live.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I got a message from ELEVEN BRAVO GS. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It read " where did you go you *** c*nt" .</p>
<p>Now this guy was in the black Ops lobby spewing racist hate and going off. I was not on my mic nor did I respond to his message. I didn't engage him what so ever. I left his lobby after 5 matches because he was just freaking out.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Will you look into this. This should absolutely not be on Xbox.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hey there please do not post users gamertags on the forums thanks.</p>
<p>If a user is using hate speech please report him / her using the in game report feature in the Xbox guide menu. Once you do that the enforcement team will be aware of the users account and determine if it's against the Xbox
<a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/Legal/CodeOfConduct" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">COC </a>/ <a href="http://www.xbox.com/en-US/Legal/LiveTOU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
TOU</a>&nbsp;i understand hate speech can be annoying but Microsoft / Xbox can't lock everyone's accounts who use it only the ones who get many reports on the same cause.</p>
