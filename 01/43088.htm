                    Is it possible to set 2 different wallpapers when using two monitors?&nbsp; I have it set to extend these displays in the option settings for display.

            Not by default, but there are some programs that can do it. &nbsp;MultiMon (search for it on the web) is one such program.
<div><br />
<div>Or you can create a wallpaper yourself. &nbsp;Create an image in Paint or your image editing program of choice that is the total width of both combined displays, and then apply that image as the wallpaper in 'tile' mode.</div>

<h2>            Mature, reliable player seeking a clan&#47;group. Experienced, Military.</h2>
                    
<p>About Me:</p>
<p>I'm 30 years old, ex-military and enjoy playing on a team that wants to win. I've joined a few clans since the game started, but I've rarely found enough people online to fill a 6-man party for Team Deathmatch or Domination. I'm usually pretty good at what
 I do and work well backing up other members of my team. I'm that guy that does what he's supposed to instead of running off alone and trying to get on top of the leaderboards. It's more satisfying to me if I help my side win.</p>
<p>I'd really like to get into a clan where I'm asked to play a lot. At the very least, I'd like to add dozens of people to my friends list so I can fill a party every evening (I'm U.S. Eastern time zone). While I'd like to find people closer to my own age
 to group up with, it really doesn't matter to me how old you are if you're a professional. I just don't want to group up with people who like to goof off instead of helping out or clearly aren't very good at the game.</p>
<p>There's no need to leave me a message, just add me as a friend on XBox Live. GT = The 0nly Doctor (0 in 0nly is a zero, not a letter).</p>

<p>[/quote]A fan? I'm happy you think that. I don't think a second of you lol. I post on the forums and I see your name, the nLnja and I'm like hey, it's that one guy... I added you briefly because for a minute (2 months ago?) you seemed "okay" on the forums.
 I've added a few people from just the forums. You said something stupid and I pointed it out. You removed me. Then you added me back and you flipped out over a game and muted me (when I easily out argued you, twice). You're a 30 year old bipolar man screaming
 on a video game. I doubt you have any fans of any sort related to anything. I wasn't attacking you here. Trust me. You were one of the funniest things/ biggest idiots on cod for me. I was just letting the op know you're a complete douchebag and you suck at
 the game. Nawhhhmm mean.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Wow, I remember you now. You sent me a f/r with a message saying you agreed with a lot of stuff I said on the forums and was looking forward to playing with me. I took you off my friends list because of how you acted (very immature). Then later on you sent
 me a f/r (<strong>again</strong>) apologizing. I accepted it but you got on my nerves&nbsp;so I removed you (<strong>yet&nbsp;again)</strong>. The whole time you were just trying to bother me with your immaturity (like you do on these forums when I post something).
 The <strong>third time you sent me a f/r </strong>I wised up and just blocked you. So stillmatic... if I'm such a douche bag then why send me a friend request 3x? Please don't try to lie and say you didn't.

    <title>Too Many Clicks - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> kthr33  say:</h3>
<h2>            Too Many Clicks</h2>
                    Windows 10, Dell desktop PC. Sometimes when I select to print, the small, square print window that comes up has a single 'General' tab at the top. The printer selections are listed 3 per column. Out of that big long list, there are only 2 printers I use
 almost exclusively, Microsoft Print to PDF, and our Ricoh printer. As it happens, each is at opposite ends of that long list and it seems as if every time I wish to print, I need the printer that doesn't show. That requires me to scroll to the other printer.
 Is it possible to edit/adjust the names of these printers so they appear next to each other and scrolling isn't required? Yes, I agree, it seems a bit wimpish to be whining about having to scroll over to a printer selection, but by the 100th scroll each day
 I get a bit weary. All suggestions, ideas, comments any wish to offer will be greatly appreciated. Thanks, K.

<br />Click on each printer
<br />Click Manage
<br />Click Printer properties
<br />Under the General tab, change the name there
<br />Click Apply then OK

            Thank You&nbsp;Andre for Directly for considering and responding to my post. What you suggested was what I was hoping would work. Normally I simply go ahead and try what I want to do, but in this instance, because I didn't put those names there, I was afraid
 simply changing the names would cause the device to not recognize the request and then I wouldn't be able to get back to a correctly working mode. Your suggestion gave me the courage to go ahead and try, and it worked as well as I hoped it would. Thanks, K.

<h2>            Home network cannot find devices on network</h2>
                    Hello recently had my network gateway modem replaced as it was faulty.&nbsp; Same Bigpond 7.2 Home network gateway modem.&nbsp; Once installed all 3 computers could access the internet, two via wifi and one via Lan.<br />
<br />
However I cannot see any devices on the network only the local computer.&nbsp; Both the wifi connected computers can also<br />
only see themselves on the network.<br />
<br />
I have tried accessing via \\computername but get error the network path was not found.<br />
All computers have network discovery file and file sharing on.<br />
<br />
I can map network devices and this displays all three computers.<br />
<br />
Can anyone help<br />
Thanks<br />

<p><span>Hi stovie93,<br />
<br />
</span><span>W</span><span>elcome to Microsoft Vista answers Forum!</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>I have few steps here that might fix the issue.</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<ol>
<li><span>Look &nbsp;wireless device listed in Network Connections in Device manager.<br />
<br />
If so, you may be able to allow Windows to "Repair this Connection"<br />
(you may need to "enable connection" first)<br />
<br />
You may be able to notice elements in the Wireless Network Connections - Properties that have become disabled (like Tcpip)</span>
</li></ol>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2.</span><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span><span>Re-checkmarking the item manually will cause your machine build a driver base, search and install the component again.</span></p>
<p>
<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;Y</span><span>ou can also consider Uninstalling your NIC and completely Re-Installing
 it. </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can go ahead and perform
<strong>clean boot </strong>and check for&nbsp;the application which is causing this issue using the following link:-</span></p>

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline"><span>Note:-</span></span></strong><strong><span>&nbsp;
</span></strong><span>After this please,
<strong>Reset the computer to start as usual</strong></span></p>
<p><span>After you have finished troubleshooting, follow these steps to reset the computer to start as usual:
</span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>Click <strong>Start</strong>, type
<strong>msconfig.exe</strong> in the<strong> Start Search</strong> box, and then press ENTER.</span>
</li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you are prompted for an administrator password or for confirmation, type your password, or click
<strong>Continue</strong>. </span></p>
<ol>
<li>
<span>On the <strong>General</strong> tab, click the
<strong>Normal Startup</strong> option, and then click <strong>OK</strong>. </span>
</li><li>
<span>When you are prompted to restart the computer, click
<strong>Restart</strong>.</span> </li></ol>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>You can now go ahead and uninstall the application which was causing this issue and check for the network devices.</span></p>

            No because typically the windows key is hard coded to the hardware of that laptop so you may be able to install but you wont be able to activate it.  Does your current computer have a OEM key?  What is the make model of your current laptop you may be able to acquire the oem key from the manufacturer.  <br /><br /><br />Hope this help,<br />Yomy Thomas<br /><br />If you have any follow up question feel free to reply as well

            Hi Yasser,
<br />
<br />Is your Windows 10 licence on that old laptop based on an OEM licence (came pre-installed on a PC) or Retail (purchased separately to a PC) 
<br />
<br />If it is a Retail licence, then it will have transfer rights to a new PC, if it is OEM it will not . ..

                    <p>Dear community,<br />
<br />
when I map a network drive via the "Add Network Location Wizard" within the MS Explorer, there is an issue with the drag&amp;drop of an attachment from an Outlook email to the mapped netwok file folder. I tried several attachments from different emails and different
 drives. </p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue appears within Windows 7 and 8.1. See attachment. </p>
<p>
</p><p>*The procedure is causing an explorer.exe crash within Windows 7.</p>

            <p>Hello Rema,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for writing to us in Microsoft Community.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please be informed that Windows 10 will install on any machine given the PC meets with the minimum system requirements, Windows releases drivers based on manufacturer's release addressing Windows 10 compatible device drivers.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Now, by default, Windows contains generic drivers for many different types of hardware connected to your computer.&nbsp;These drivers&nbsp;are stripped down and a bit older, but they’re written by your device manufacturer and not Microsoft themselves.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hence, in this case, it is up to the manufacturer on whether the devices are Windows 10 supportive or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope the above information helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you.</p>

            My Lenovo y510p upgraded to Windows 10, then it went downhill from there. No sound, &nbsp;no keypad other problems. &nbsp;Had to go back k to 8.1. This is why I won't ever buy another Lenovo. Good luck.&nbsp;

            I have a Lenovo IdeaPad Y510p which I upgraded from Windows 8.1 to 10.&nbsp; The two issues I seem to be having is driver support (who knew Lenovo wouldn't support a laptop purchased in 2013 with Windows 10 drivers??!!) and the lengthy boot time (no longer
 is it up and running in less than a minute; now it is closer to 3 to 4 minutes before I can open a progam or a web page).&nbsp; I saved for sometime to purchase the two laptops I purchased for my household based on my experience working with the Thinkpad series.&nbsp;
 Obviously Lenovo doesn't really care about the consumer division; I've had highter than normal issues with these two laptops and will not purchase Lenovo products in the future.<br />

            <p>Now could someone please tell Microsoft to stop trying to sleaze Windows 10 onto my computer?&nbsp; It is prechecked under windows updates, and I have to be careful not to let it install when I do updates by unchecking the box.&nbsp; Could you please make it an "opt
 in" choice?&nbsp;&nbsp; That, or develop the drivers yourself or get Lenovo to do their duty and support their laptops with drivers.&nbsp; For the record, I have old and feeble laptops that have upgraded perfectly, but this one will surely lose the ability to access my second
 video chip, which was one of the reasons for buying it.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you want Windows 10 on my computer, then guarantee that it will work, otherwise, make it "opt in" rather than "opt out."&nbsp;

<h2>            Speech In Party Chat Causing Thumbstick Input</h2>
                    
<p>Okay folks, this is a weird one and to be honest I don't really expect anyone to be able to solve this problem as I've already been through all kinds of attempted fixes with Official Xbox Phone Support.&nbsp; I'm creating this thread to describe my set-up, explain
 the issue, symptoms/elaboration/observations, testing and reproduction, the attempted fixes and to see what percentage of the community might also be experiencing the issue as I've seen it mentioned by four other people besides myself.</p>

<p><strong>My Set-up</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Xbox 360 Elite - Manufacture Date 2008/05/02 </li><li>120GB HDD </li><li>Official Xbox 360 Wired Controller </li><li>Official Xbox 360 Wired Headset </li><li>Wired Internet Connection </li><li>HDMI Connection to TV </li></ul>


<p><strong>The Issue</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When people speak while I'm in Party Chat it causes both left and right thumbsticks to register downward/right inputs as if they are tapped downward/right
</li></ul>


<p><strong>Symptoms/Elaboration/Observations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Has been happening for an undetermined length of time through several controller replacements
</li><li>First noticed while playing Minecraft, while controller was at rest saw "twitching" of game character
</li><li>"Twitching" is a step backwards/right and/or one to two degree turn to the right of game character/character dodging/rolling
</li><li>Also noticed while playing Borderlands 2, same type of "twitching" while controller is at rest
</li><li>While playing Diablo 3 game character will turn from facing north to south and/or roll downwards
</li><li>In Diablo 3 Pause menu, cursor will cycle through menu options </li><li>Wasn't until playing Diablo 3 that I made the connection between being in Party Chat and people speaking in chat causing the "twitching"
</li><li>Happens with members in Party Chat using all mic types although Third party mics seem to trigger it more often
</li><li>Third party mics seem to pickup and transmit more sound than Official Xbox mics, possible correlation
</li><li>Stops occurring while still in Party Chat if headset jack is disconnected from controller
</li><li>Have been unable to check if it continues to occur in regular Game Chat </li><li>Varying degree of sensitivity in each title to Party Chat speech </li><li>Sensitivity seems to relate to the thumbstick deadzone of the individual titles
</li><li>Borderlands 2 thumbstick deadzone is "large," least affected game, very subtle "twitching"
</li><li>Minecraft thumbstick deadzone is "medium," noticeable "twitching" </li><li>Diablo 3 thumbstick deadzone is extremely "small," obvious "twitching" </li></ul>


<p><strong>Testing and Reproduction</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Enter Party Chat </li><li>Minecraft, line up crosshairs on an object with a perpendicular angle, place controller at rest
</li><li>Borderlands 2, line up crosshairs on an object with a perpendicular angle, place controller at rest
</li><li>Ask Party Chat members to speak </li><li>Causes character to 'twitch" backwards visibly, also distinguishable by crosshairs no longer being lined up with orientation object
</li><li>Diablo 3, load game, character in game world, place controller at rest </li><li>Ask Party Chat members to speak, </li><li>Causes character to rotate from facing "north" to "south" and or Dodge/Roll downwards/right or "southeast"
</li><li>Disconnect headset jack while in Party Chat </li><li>Message Party Chat members to speak </li><li>Can hear Party Chat members speaking through audio system </li><li>No noticeable character movement or "twitching" occurs </li><li>Plug headset back in, "twitching" resumes </li></ul>


<p><strong>Attempted Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Deleting and re-downloading Profile </li><li>Cleared system cache three time </li><li>Deleted console updates </li><li>Deleted Marketplace cache </li><li>Adjusting Game Defaults in Profile section of Settings, both General and Action
</li></ul>
<p><strong><br />

<p>I suppose that could be a possibility. &nbsp;This has been ongoing though through three or four controller replacements making it unlikely that I'd receive that many defective controllers in a row over the time that this has been occurring, which I'm estimating
 to be about a year, maybe as long as two. &nbsp;One of the other people having this issue has gone through five controllers exchanging them as they thought they were defective and all five have produced this issue. &nbsp;While a "bad batch" is possible, it seems unlikely
 to affect me for so long as I'm certain my local retailer doesn't keep a year or twos worth of controllers in stock and newly manufactured "good batches" would replace the "bad" during that time. &nbsp;For the other individual, it may be possible to get five "bad
 batch" controllers in a row if they were all bought and exchanged in a relatively short span of time, but I believe the quality control standards would be adequate to prevent such poorly made runs of controllers from proliferating the supply such that there
 would be a 100% or a 1 in 1 chance of receiving a defective controller five times in a row.</p>

<p>Hey Knowitall, I have read through your post and see that you have tried a lot of testing. &nbsp;One thing that might be possible is using a wireless xbox360 headset. &nbsp;Your description sounds like it is something registering between the headset physically connected
 to the controller. &nbsp;Have you ever switched your headset or do you happen to have another headset that you could test the same situation with? &nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm using a Wired turtle beach headset, not many people have one, but they have a normal xbox headset. &nbsp;I'm playing DIablo 3 and i'm chatting with my friends and random people in Party &amp; Game chat, while suddenly my character starts to dodge/roll around
 aimlessly and i'm not touching the right thumb stick?. &nbsp;So far it's 5 people in my friends list and so far i counted 20 random people that i join their rooms and when they talk, my character starts to dodge/roll around.</p>
<p>I just want microsoft or blizzard to fix this problem, I just want to play the game without someones voice making my character rolling around, I gotta say it's very ANNOYING.</p>
<p>incase anyone thinks that's it's my controller....NOPE!.&nbsp; I have a brand new xbox controller on stand by and the problem didn't go away.</p>

<p>Hey there wolf, thanks for the reply. &nbsp;I wont be able to try a wireless headset, cannot afford to go and purchase one just for the purpose of testing/resolving this issue although it may "fix" the problem. &nbsp;I run everything I can that is Xbox related wired
 as I prefer that type of a connection to wireless, it also eliminates any battery or charging issues. &nbsp;I do not have another wired mic to try either, but I strongly suspect that the mic is not causing the issue as several other people are experiencing the
 same thing that I am and some are using entirely different types of wired, and possibly wireless, mics.</p>
<p>Thanks very much XBoxOMEGA for stopping by the thread and adding yourself to the list of people having this issue.&nbsp; You mentioned something that I as of yet have not been able to test for myself.&nbsp; I am always in Party Chat and have never been able to try
 just Game Chat itself, going to have to remember to try that next time I can get the group together.&nbsp; I see you mention you've had it happen in both types of chats in your post, does that mean you are you experiencing this when in Game Chat by itself while
 not in a Party Chat?</p>

<p>Hey there,</p>
<p>Well I have the same issue, here are &nbsp;some infos:</p>
<p><strong>Setup:</strong></p>
<p>Xbox bought at least 5 years ago ( no time to check sorry - premium pack with burnout and indiana lego)</p>
<p>Xbox official headset</p>
<p>Xbox official wireless controller ( with plug and play, sometime without the batteries)</p>
<p>I bought a new wired controller ( black) and noticed the same issue as described above when in a party chat and also
<p>My buddy spoke a bit louder in his mic and roll away demon hunter! Without my input of course. Same goes for the menu with the left stick.</p>
<p>The only difference between my 2 controllers: the dead zone, my old controller has a lot more and the sticks are "softer", the mic jack is a lot more "tight" on the new controller.</p>
<p>By the way I switched the new controller at the store, same issue!</p>
<p>I will not buy another one, but I feel like a just lost 35€ ( I am in Germany).</p>
<p>Has anyone tried on GTA 5?</p>
<p><strong>Ideas:</strong></p>
<p>Diablo 3 reacts much more on the stick input than other games.</p>
<p>If you play enough with the new controller you will add some dead zone - thus no more issue?</p>
<p>The chat interfere with the "signal stick output" of the controller?</p>
<p>New wireless controller, no issues with same setup?</p>
<p>Linked to the age of the console itself - only old models?</p>
<p>My buddy did not use the official headset - signal is slightly different?</p>
<p>I hope I could help a bit on this issue :)</p>

<p>I noticed it even in the Dashboard without any games running. &nbsp;You can test for it too if you want, simply enter a Party chat and leave the Xbox Guide open, leave the controller idle until the screen dims and the guide disappears, have people talk, the screen
 should brighten again and the guide should appear as if you had touched the controller. &nbsp;Should be able to confirm it's not game related using this test.</p>

    <title>Windows 10 keeps restarting with error - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> sara pconvery  say:</h3>
<h2>            Windows 10 keeps restarting with error DRIVER_UNLOADED_WITHOUT_CANCELLING_PENDING_ OPERATIONS</h2>
                    <p>I have an HP Envy 23 with Windows 10. It has been unplugged for a week. When I attempted to turn it on I got:</p>
<p>
</p><p>":( Looks like Windows is unable to start" [on blue screen] with options to Restart or Advanced Options</p>
<p>
</p><p>Windows StartUp help could not fix the problem</p>
<p>
</p><p>The error message is DRIVER_UNLOADED_WITHOUT_CANCELLING_PENDING_ OPERATIONS</p>
<p>failed to load mrxsmb.sys</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sometimes gets as far as the startup page with date and time before attempting to restart. I would notice a momentary flash of smaller white rectangle in the upper left part of the screen (looks like it could be a log file window).</p>
<p>
</p><p>It is possible that there was an update completed when I last turned off the machine but I do not really remember.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I tried disconnected all printers, scanners, drives and got same cycle of error.&nbsp; I am unable to check for updates or do a virus scan as I cannot get the machine to start. I had not noticed any issues with startup prior to this.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I do have the option to reset PC but would prefer not to this unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>All suggestions appreciated!!</p>

<br />
<br />If above doesn't work - A. Try to boot into safe mode
<br />
<br />Power ON your computer and as Windows / manufacturer's Logo appears, Power OFF - Repeat 3 times
<br />Now your computer will go into Advanced Recovery Environment 
<br />Advanced Options &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Startup Settings &gt; Restart 
<br />Press 4 or F4 to enable Safe Mode (5 or F5 to enable Safe Mode with Networking) 
<br />Log in once Windows starts in safe mode 
<br />See whether you able to login. If yes, come out of this and start normally.
<br />
<br />If you are not able to boot like above, You will need to boot through a Bootable USB drive. You will need to create this on another computer which is working - <a href="https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create-bootable-usb-flash-drive-install-windows-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/2376-create...</a>

<br />
<br />B. Another option when you are in Advanced Options in previous step is to choose (Note - You won't lose any files in this step)
<br />1. System Restore - This will restore your system to a point when things were working fine.
<br />OR
<br />2. Startup Repair - Startup Repair upgrade fixes all Windows errors and retains all files, applications and settings.
<br />
<br />C. Penultimate option could be Reset this PC. 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Reset this PC - Keep my files and Remove everything. Choose this carefully as most likely you would like to keep your files. 
<br />All apps will be removed and windows will be reinstalled.
<br />
<br />D. Last option could be to Go back to the previous Build, if it was an upgrade to 1809 - 
<br />In Step A &gt; Troubleshoot &gt; Advanced Options &gt; Go back to the previous Build

<br />This C:\windows\system32\config\systemprofile\desktop is unavailable error may occur due to corrupt or missing Windows files. 
<br />
<br />To troubleshoot the issue, you can follow these simple steps: 
<br />
<br />1. Open File Explorer and navigate to: C:\Windows\system32\config\systemprofile and check if it has the Desktop folder there. 
<br />2. If the Desktop folder does not exist, then create a new folder and rename it as Desktop or copy it from C:\users\Default\Desktop. 
<br />Note: By default, C:\Users\Default is hidden. To unhide click on the View tab and check the Hidden Items box. 
<br />
<br />After you have created the folder, it is required that you give full permission to the folder. You can follow these steps to give full permission: 
<br />
<br />1. Right click on the folder, select Properties then click on the Security tab. 
<br />2. Click on Edit. 
<br />3. On the Permissions for Desktop window, select Everyone and then click on Add. 
<br />4. In the Enter the object names to select dialog box, type Everyone and click on Check Names. 
<br />Click OK.

            Hi Jrsygrlntx, 
<br />
<br />Try this: 
<br />
<br />1. On the search bar, type powershell. 
<br />2. From the list, right-click on Windows PowerShell and select Run as administrator. 
<br />3. On the new window that will appear, type the following command: Get-appxpackage -all *shellexperience* -packagetype bundle |% {add-appxpackage -register -disabledevelopmentmode ($_.installlocation + “\appxmetadata\appxbundlemanifest.xml”)} 
<br />4. Reboot your computer and see if the Start menu will work again. 
<br />
<br />
<br />If this does not work you can reinstall by entering the following into the Admin Command Prompt 
<br />
<br />$manifest = (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.Windows.Cortana).InstallLocation + '\AppxManifest.xml' ; Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register $manifest 
<br />
<br />Press enter 
<br />
<br />Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers |Where-Object {$_.InstallLocation -like "*SystemApps*"} 
<br />
<br />Press Enter 
<br />
<br />Let me know

            If winhttp.dll is missing, some Microsoft&nbsp; Services (and other things) just will not start:<br />
<br />
BITS Service (Background Intelligent Transfer Service)<br />
Automatic Update Service&nbsp; (it will hang trying to start)<br />
<br />
You will see things like this in the Event Viewer System log:<br />
<br />
Service<br />
Could not start the Background Intelligent Transfer Service on Local Computer.<br />
Error: 126:&nbsp; THe specified module could not be found<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Error<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service Control Manager<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Event ID:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7023<br />
Description:<br />
The Background Intelligent Transfer Service service terminated with the following error:
<br />
The specified module could not be found. <br />
<br />
The Automatic Updates Service will hang and show "Starting" in the Service applet:<br />
<br />
Event Type:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Error<br />
Event Source:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Service Control Manager<br />
Event Category:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; None<br />
Description:<br />
The Automatic Updates service hung on starting.<br />
<br />
Some Adobe product will also not work, like the Adobe Dreamweaver Service Manager CS5ServiceManager (and perhaps other Adobe startup items) will not start and give error like this:<br />
<br />
CS5.5ServiceManager.exe - Unable to Locate Component<br />
This application has failed to start because WINHTTP.dll was not found.&nbsp; Re-installing the application may fix this problem.<br />
<br />
Running sfc /scannow will not replace the missing winhttp.dll file.&nbsp; I know because I tried it.&nbsp; That is just another Support Engineer
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild-goose_chase" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">wild goose chase</a>.<br />
<br />
I uploaded a copy of the XP Pro SP3 file you need to my SkyDrive (everybody has a SkyDrive for sharing files).<br />
<br />
You can download it and when you do, put a copy of the file in these two folders (assuming Windows is installed on your C drive):<br />
<br />
c:\windows\system32<br />
c:\windows\system32\dllcache&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (that is where XP keeps backup copies of important files).<br />
<br />
Here is the link to my SkyDrive and you can look for the file you need there:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://cid-6a7e789cab1d6f39.skydrive.live.com/redir.aspx?resid=6A7E789CAB1D6F39%21311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://cid-6a7e789cab1d6f39.skydrive.live.com/redir.aspx?resid=6A7E789CAB1D6F39!311</a><br />
<br />
When you see the files available for download, you may not see the file extension (.exe, .dll, .cpl, .sys, .zip, etc.), but when you download them they will have the correct extension.
<br />
<br />
When you download the file (especially if you use Internet Explorer), when you get a chance to save the file, your browser may not save the file with an extension (like .exe, .dll, .cpl, .sys, .zip, etc.) so you will have to manually add the proper extension
 to the file when you download the file before you save it.<br />
<br />
You can download the file with no extension and then rename the file to add the proper extension.&nbsp; You don't want to try to use a file called winhttp when the file name really needs to be called winhttp.dll (if the downloaded file has no extension you will
 have to change the name of the file to add the proper extension to get it to work.<br />
<br />
You then need to put the downloaded files in the correct folders on your system.<br />
<br />
Running sfc /scannow will not replace the missing winhttp.dll file, but it will be a frustrating waste of time and just another Support Engineer wild goose chase.&nbsp; Support Engineers are engaged by Microsoft so you would hope that somebody would know better.<br />
<br />
It is too bad the Support Engineer has not tried his own advice to "check how it works".<br />

<h2>            How to enter &#34;Esc&#34; in Intellipoint&#39;s keystroke-assignment menu&#63;</h2>
                    The Intellipoint program (v8) enables program-specific keystroke assignments for a Microsoft Intellimouse via Control Panel's Mouse module. I'm trying to enter the Esc key as such a keystroke assignment. But hitting the Esc key in the popup menu's Key
 Combination cell immediately triggers an "abort-the-Keystroke-Assignment-menu" action, instead of recording the keystroke. Trying alternates like entering the&nbsp;<span>ASCII-equivalent</span>&nbsp;<span>Alt-027 and Ctrl-[ in the cell fail. Anyone know of a special
 syntax or other technique to get this simple keystroke assignment programmed in? Can't believe the program is brought to such a seemingly short-sighted grinding halt by this simple request.
<b>Is "Esc" the only standard keystroke that cannot be programmed in as a program-specific keystroke assignment?</b> Thanks in advance for any informed tips.</span>

<p>Hi,
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I would suggest you to refer the following steps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>How to assign and use macros</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Macros are sequences of events (such as keystrokes, mouse clicks, and delays) that can be recorded and later played back to help perform repetitive tasks. They can also be
 used to replay sequences that are long or difficult to execute. You can assign a macro that is recorded in IntelliPoint to a key or to a mouse button.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>IntelliType Pro and IntelliPoint macros use an ".mhm" extension and are saved as individual files in your default Documents\Microsoft Hardware\Macros subfolder. Macros that
 are recorded in IntelliType Pro and IntelliPoint are interchangeable. You can run them or edit them from either program.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>CautionDo not save passwords or other sensitive information in macros.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Create a macro in IntelliPoint</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>
<span><span>a.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Start IntelliPoint.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>b.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>On the Buttons tab, make sure that the mouse that you are using is selected under Connected device.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>c.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>In the list under the button that you want to reassign, select Macro. The Macro Editor window will be displayed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>d.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click New. An empty macro will be created and added to the macro list.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>e.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>In the File Name box, type the name of the new macro.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>f.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click the Editor box, and then enter your macro. You can record events such as keystrokes, mouse clicks, and delays between actions. (You cannot record mouse movements or actions that are performed by
 macros that are assigned to reassignable keys.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>g.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click Save.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>h.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>In the Available Macros list, make sure that the new macro is selected.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<span><span>i.<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span>Click OK.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Play a macro</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>To play a macro, press the button to which the macro is assigned.</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Cancel a macro during playback</p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>To cancel the action of a macro during playback, again press the button to which the macro is assigned, or run another macro</p>
        </p>

            Great, that Macro solution is working. I misunderstood, the Macro does operate under program-specific settings as well. There is one crucial step missing from those macro instructions provided: you can't simply record hitting the Esc button as a macro
 in the Editor box, because the menu immediately interprets that as an abort-the-Macro Editor command, just like the Keystroke Assignment menu does. But clicking on the Insert Special... button provides an Esc-button option that gets recorded by special code.
 Finally! Thanks Anoop.

            <p>That's a good question.&nbsp; I don't think you can do it from the command line directly, because the process that is hosting the command itself would need to be elevated.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">Example, if I have <strong>cmd.exe</strong> running but not elevated mode,&nbsp; I don't think it can start an elevated session of
<strong>calc.exe</strong>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>You can set your shortcut (the shortcut that opens cmd.exe command prompt) to always run "with highest privileges" or "always run as admin" (depending on your version).&nbsp; Then anything you launch from it (including items launched from a batch file) will also
 have those high privileges.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In any case, creating an elevated process (of anything) will first show the UAC "do you wish to allow this program to run" dialog.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Of course, you can disable UAC.&nbsp; Then every process you run will run as your user account, and have full privileges.&nbsp; But that has the downside of weakening your security greatly. Even a bad website you visit could run code (which is running as admin now)
 and do anything without your knowledge or consent.&nbsp; Although in some environments, this might be acceptable risk and required for what you need to do.</p>
<p>
</p><p style="margin-left: 30px">I have no idea why, but my company has configured our computers to disable UAC.&nbsp; I'm one of a very few that have administrative rights to my own computer, but I have no UAC to mitigate that risk.&nbsp; Seems odd to me, but I'm not in
 charge.</p>

<h2>            My skype call is suffering poor voice quality after upgrade to a new version of Windows 10</h2>
                    <p>Hi, there,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Does anyone ever suffer the same problem with me which is poor quality of voice call particularly using skype-out to North America countries from China mainland . The situation began worse after a major upgrade to windows 10 embed version of skype. I am
 skype users for many years and get excellent voice service with the standalone version of skype until recently.&nbsp; The embed version of Skype also can't make a real group call to landline or mobile phone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The skype support staff in China local suggest me to change to a special version in China which I am not sure if there is any limitation on my account.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone can help to address this issue for me which is highly appreciated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.&nbsp;</p>

    <title>error 651 in windows 7 - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> ratty2103  say:</h3>
<h2>            error 651 in windows 7</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
I just purchased a new desktop and installed Windows 7 Profesional.<br />
I was able to connect to the internet via the router, after a lot of messing about and was able to register, activate and update my installation. However, today, when I booted the destop, it wouldn't connct to the internet, or see the othe computers or printer
 in my home network. Whenever I try to connect, I receive the following :-error 651&nbsp; and when I run Network Diagnostics, it returns with ""Local Area Connection" does'nt have a valid IP Configuration."<br />
I have swapped the cables between computers and the problem stays with the new box. My laptop wirelessy connects via the router and sees the other devices ok.<br />
Having checked on the intereet, I see that this is a common problem with Win 7 and have already tried the "raspppoe.sys " as suggested by "Shinmila H-Microsoft supprt on social.answers.microsoft.com. to no avail.<br />
Please advise, or Email a hotfix.<br />
Thanks for your attention in this matter.<br />
Callum

<p>Hi,<br />
&nbsp;<br />
Could you please answer these below questions?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
1. Did you follow all the steps which Shinmila H suggested you to do?<br />
&nbsp;<br />
2. Are you using Dial-up or Broadband connection?<br />
<br />
<strong>First I suggest you to reset tcp/ip on your computer, to do that you may visit the below link.</strong></p>
<p><strong>How to reset Internet Protocol (TCP/IP)<br />

<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299357" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/299357</a></p>
<p><strong>Change TCP/IP settings</strong></p>

<strong>&nbsp;<br />
I suggest you to Power cycling your Modem and Router might resolve the problem, here are the steps:</strong><br />
&nbsp;<br />
1.Save all your current work, close all open applications, then shut down your computer. Wait for a minute.
<br />
2.First, turn your Router off and wait for a couple of minutes. <br />
3.Turn off your modem. <br />
4.Disconnect all the Ethernet cables that are connected to the router and modem and the PC.
<br />
5.Reconnect them and ensure that there are no loose connections in between them. <br />
6.Now, switch on your PC and let it boot. <br />
7.Switch on the modem first and after it gets initialized, switch on the router. <br />
&nbsp;<br />
<strong>You can also try disabling Firewall/Security Software if any, and check if it helps:<br />
