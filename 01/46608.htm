    <title>Windows 10 - Login with Microsoft account - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Windows 10 - Login with Microsoft account</h2>
                    <p>I'm trying without success to covert a local account sign-on to a Microsoft account sign-on for the admin account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The reason I want to do this is so that my Windows administrator account sign-on is protected by the 2 factor authentication I've enabled on my Microsoft account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I followed the instructions here&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/help/17201/windows-10-sign-in-with-a-microsoft-account and added my M/S account so that it is now shown as both an email and app account under settings.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I've signed into the Store, Skype and OneDrive but my Windows sign-in still remains stubbornly a local account only.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm not sure what else I need to do to get this working.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any help gratefully appreciated!!</p>

<h2>            Unwanted playlists pulled from collection - How do I get rid of them&#63;</h2>
                    <p>Ever since I synched my Groove player in Win10 with my collection I've been getting&nbsp;all of these weird playlists in the playlist panel - hundreds of them. I've spent the time going through the entire list in Groove&nbsp;deleting them one at a time (took over
 an hour) and they came back again! I've gone into my music folders on a seek/destroy mission to remove these strange artifacts and they still appear in my Groove app. I use playlists all the time, but these crazy zombie ones are ruining the experience for
 me since I have to wade through them to get to the legit ones. I've attached a screengrab.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Any thoughts/help?</p>

<p>For me, these unusual playlists only show up on the Groove desktop app, not on the on-line version of Groove.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>I am also having a problem getting all of my music to show up on Onedrive.&nbsp; And not all of the songs on Onedrive show up when I select to show only streaming music.</p>

Thank you for that information! &nbsp;I have a ton of extra playlists. &nbsp;I'm glad I didn't take &nbsp;the time &nbsp;to try to delete them &nbsp;all!

            <p>Yay, I have this same problem and have deleted the playlist by selecting it then on the right hand side, where it displayed the list of songs, click on more and select delete.&nbsp; Not sure whether it comes back or not.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I think whenever you double click a song from explorer which is then defaulted to play in Groove, Groove automatically create a playlist.</p>

<p>I would simply like the ABILITY to modify a gathered playlist by removing such things as Christmas tunes with a single button at the beginning of the selection in the same manner as in iTunes.</p>
<p>I have over 4000 tunes in my library and it would be great just to remove those I do not wish to listen&nbsp;to without removing the whole list. Can someone help??? &gt;&gt;&gt;&nbsp; T Richard</p>

            <p>I had exactly the same problem (over 300 unwanted playlists)</p>
<p>What I did :&nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;- With windows explorer, I checked If I had any ".m3u" files (these are mp3 playlist files&nbsp;which are usually only a few KBytes each) in my music directories.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;- From Windows explorer, I deleted all those unwanted .m3u files</p>
<p>&nbsp;- Then I opened Parametres/Applications selected Groove Music and selected Advanced Parameters and selected "Renitliaze" (may be something exlse because I'm on a French version of windows "Réinitialiser" is wht I have.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope this helps :)</p>

<h2>            Laptop webcam DOESN&#39;T WORK&#59; hidden in Device Manager &#62; Imaging Devices&#59; Drivers up-to-date</h2>
                    <p>Hi,</p>
<p>My laptop is HP Pavilion 15-n010tx Notebook PC (ENERGY STAR), Windows 8 inbuilt.</p>
<p>My webcam worked fine until morning yesterday when I had a video call on facebook. It was selected<em>
<strong>HP</strong> <strong>Truevision HD </strong></em>on fb messenger.</p>
<p>In the evening, however, the selection showed another, <em>SPCA 2082PC webcam</em>. It didn't capture anything, although the webcam light was on.</p>
<p>I tried running in Cyberlink Youcam but there was the same problem.</p>
<p>In Device Manager &gt; Imaging Devices, the <strong><em>HP Truevision HD </em></strong>was hidden and asked for reconnecting to Enable (code 45) and&nbsp;<em>SPCA 2082PC webcam</em><em>
</em>was shown enabled instead. The drivers showed up to date. In Device Manager &gt; Sound, Video the Cyberlink driver is shown.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I disabled <em>SPCA 2082PC webcam</em><em>, </em>restarted, but the problem&nbsp;persisted.&nbsp;I tried restoring the system but there was no previous restore point found, hence failed.</p>
<p>I troubleshooted hardware, auto-recovered laptop. Still no change. </p>
<p>I upgraded Cyberlink, yet there was an only option for selection shown in its settings:
<em>SPCA 2082PC webcam</em>which doesn't work (drivers up-to-date). </p>
<p>There's nothing available in Device Manager to remove <strong><em>HP Truevision HD
</em></strong>from hidden devices and activate it. Also, how do I reconnect it since it shows 'reconnect device to enable (Code 45)'.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Kindly help me solve the problem.</p>

<p>Hi Moiz,</p>
<p>
</p><p>It sounds like a hardware issue. If you are using an external webcam, try to plug it on different port. Otherwise, if this was the built-in camera, you may have to contact your device manufacturer.</p>
<p>

    <title>Epson RX620 printer&#47;scanner problem - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> raygarside  say:</h3>
<h2>            Epson RX620 printer&#47;scanner problem</h2>
                    <p>Since installing Windows 10 my combined printer/scanner will not operate. </p>
<p>
</p><p>It is shown as a Device in Settings, but oddly in Control Panel it is shown twice: once as a printer [Epson Stylus Photo RX620 (M)] and again as a scanner [USB2.0 MFP(High Speed)]. They were never split like this before when double-clicking on the icon allowed
 me to access both print and scan functions.</p>
<p>
</p><p>According to Epson, Windows 10 contains drivers to operate my printer/scanner so I am unable to download a driver. This must be a problem created by the Windows 10 install removing my old driver and replacing it with something that does not work.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Can anyone offer some advice please?</p>

<h2>            Windows won&#96;t boot with nvidia drivers, just the generic one</h2>
                    <div style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">
Geforce 770gtx. Got a random bsod during gameplay (video memory scheduler error I think) and afterwards my pc wouldn't get to the desktop.Watching the dump file with blue screen viewer the files "dxgmm2.sys" and watchdog.sys are marked as red. It gets as far
 as the blue Windows window, then GPU stops, tries for a few seconds and&nbsp; then reboots. I can however boot into safe mode so I know my gpu isn't totally dead, and my display is working fine too.If I uninstall the gpu driver in safe mode with DDU I can boot
 into normal windows, but when I install a display driver again the install fails halfway through(usb unplug sound and the gpu stops working), I get a black screen as if no signal from gpu, then after reboot the same thing happens everytime i boot the windows,
 before i DDU the nvidia drivers and start with the generic ones. I've had the driver installed for a few weeks before so it's not a faulty driver.Computer also doesn't seem to know what type my monitor is, I point it to the monitor driver but it says the best
 driver (Generic non-PnP) is already installed.SFC gives no errors, chkds no error. Windows Startup repair, as usual, does nothing. Could it be some component of my GPU that's failed, and the driver can't access it, like a video memory component or something?And
 why does it boot fine in safe mode and install the driver in safe mode. This makes me think it might be a software problem.. I've unplugged all unnecessary peripherals and double checked all my bios settings too..Windows version is the latest, thought it was
 the creators update that was causing the issues, but i tried all sorts of windows versions, issue persists during the installion of the driver and after the driver halfway installs, gpu chrashes, have to do a DDU and then start the pc with generic drivers
 again and repeat.</div>

<div style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">
Things i tried so far are:</div>

-Tried installing the driver through device manager manually.</div>
<div style="color: rgba(40, 40, 40, 1)">
Also worth a note that at one point for one day i was able to install all sorts of drivers with no problems, but the games kept crashing a few seconds into the game and error used to pop up "Access to the device was resticted" and so on, the windows did not
 stop responding, but the game did and after awhile the same bsod happened and i could never duplicate this period of success. This period happened when i upgraded from windows 10 fall version to the current newest, which is 1709.</div>

<p>Hi Razoras,</p>
<p>
</p><p><span>In this case, since your operating system is unstable, we recommend that you perform an in-place upgrade using an ISO file to repair any broken system file while keeping your personal files, settings and installed applications. To do this, follow the
 steps provided by Andre Da Costa in this </span><a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/insider/wiki/insider_wintp-insider_install/how-to-perform-a-repair-upgrade-using-the-windows/35160fbe-9352-4e70-9887-f40096ec3085"><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">article</span></strong></a><strong><span>.
</span></strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>In addition, performing an in-place upgrade would be your best approach to resolve your concern and it will make your system work on its full functionality again.

<p>You should set your screen resolution to the monitor's native resolution, which is not 1600 x 1200 since it is a widescreen monitor. It is probably something like 1680 x 1050. If you don't know your monitor's native resolution, you can post back with its
 model number or Google it like "Samsung [some model number] native resolution".</p>
<p>Once you have set the resolution correctly, you can adjust the size of icons, text, etc.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/enable/training/windowsxp/appearance.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/enable/training/windowsxp/appearance.aspx</a></p>
<p>Running at the monitor's native resolution will give the most crisp contrast. You can also adjust Clear Type:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/tuner/step1.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/cleartype/tuner/step1.aspx</a></p>
<p>This assumes that your video card supports whatever the monitor's native resolution is. When you post back, also include the make/model of your video card. You can find this information by going to Control Panel&gt;System&gt;Hardware tab&gt;Device Manager. Then expand
 the Display category by clicking on the little cross. Write down what you see.</p>

<p>Hi, again</p>
<p>Yes I need more help. The Monitors name is "SAMSUNG SyncMaster 2233 SN".<br />
My video-cards name is ATI Radeon HD 4650.<br />
<br />
I found on the internet that the Native resolution is 1920 x 1080 ? (I think).</p>
<p>Trying to change the settings to that format is not possible, since inside the "Monitor Settings",</p>
<p>Max solution (taking the pointer to the very right end) is 1600 x 1200.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT:<br />
What make me very confused is that I have had a perfect solution for months, and yesterday suddenly&nbsp;<br />
the solution changed. I re-started and tried to change the setting on all different variants possible&nbsp;<br />
nothing happend. The suddenly after a re-start the old GOOD settings were back (strange), only to find out TODAY&nbsp;when I started the computer, the bad more "non-sharp" solution were back again (then I sent this cry for help mail).</p>
<p>Do you recommend me to download the Clear Typ? (is that a program to be downloaded?)<br />
<br />
need more "dummy-instructions" (I am almost on lowest knowledge-level here)<br />
Thanks a lot! so far!!!<br />

<p>According to the specs, your video card supports:</p>
<p>Supports 18-, 24-, and 30-bit digital displays at all resolutions up to 1920x1200 (single-link DVI) or 2560x1600 (dual-link DVI)<br />
Supports 18-, 24-, and 30-bit digital displays at all resolutions up to 1920x1200 (single-link DVI only)</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amd.com/us/products/desktop/graphics/ati-radeon-hd-4000/hd-4600/Pages/ati-radeon-hd-4600-specifications.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.amd.com/us/products/desktop/graphics/ati-radeon-hd-4000/hd-4600/Pages/ati-radeon-hd-4600-specifications.aspx</a></p>
<p>So your card can support your widescreen monitor at 1920x1080 which is indeed the native resolution of that monitor.</p>
<p>I suggest that you:</p>
<p>1. You should set your resolution to 1920 x 1080. Since you say you can't do that...</p>
<p>2. Update the video card drivers. You will get them from EITHER your computer mftr.'s website for your model machine (and if you tell me the make/model of your computer I can find these for you) OR if you have a generic-built computer you'll get the drivers
 from AMD's website. Tell me what type of computer you have and I can get you the right link. You will download the drivers and install them. If that fixes the issue, great. You probably installed video drivers from Windows Update which is never a Good Thing.</p>
<p>3. If updating the drivers does not allow you to use the 1920 x 1080 resolution, then your video card is probably failing. At this point, based on what you wrote about your knowledge level, you would be best served by taking the computer to a reputable local
 professional. Don't use a BigComputerStore/GeekSquad type of place.</p>

Since I tried to take the computer back to a saved repairment point and and then the log showed a<br />
window update process had just finsihed according to the log.</p>

<p>I assumed you had XP since you posted in an XP forum. Further questions unrelated to this particular issue should be posted in the correct Vista forum. But there is no point in changing that now.</p>
<p>I only needed Compaq-Presario<br />
COMPUTERMODEL: NM958AA-UUW CQ5043SC</p>
<p>and whether you have Vista 32 or 64-bit. I suspect you have 32-bit but you can check by looking at Control Panel&gt;System. Your drivers are here:</p>
<p><a href="http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareCategory?os=2093&amp;lc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;sw_lang=&amp;product=3928919#N638" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://h10025.www1.hp.com/ewfrf/wc/softwareCategory?os=2093&amp;lc=en&amp;cc=us&amp;dlc=en&amp;sw_lang=&amp;product=3928919#N638</a></p>
<p>If you have Vista 64, change that by using the drop-down arrow where you can select your operating system. Otherwise leave it to the "Microsoft Windows Vista" setting. Then click on "Driver - Graphics (1)" and download that driver to somewhere you will find
 it. After you have finished downloading the driver, go to its saved location and double-click the file you downloaded to install the correct drivers. Reboot when told to and you should be able to:</p>
<p>1. Start Orb&gt;Control Panel&gt;Appearance and Personalization. Click Personalization and then click Display Settings.<br />
2. Under Resolution, move the slider to the resolution you want and then click Apply.</p>

<p>after running that DRIVER PROGRAM I went to the ORB&gt;&gt;&gt;DISPLAY SETTNINGS,</p>
<p>I moved the slider all the way to the right but it stopped at 1600x1200.</p>
<p>I could not chose the option&nbsp;1920x1200.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Come to think of it, yesterday I tried to un-install a program I had called UNIBLUE POWERSUITE DRIVER SCANNER,</p>
<p>which failed. There were som problems with the un-installation (dunno if that mean anything).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I changed the slider on 1600x1200 and the sharpness got better. Strangely enough the sharpness got better</p>
<p>but not as good as it had been (it looks like it is some kind of "shadow" behind the letters on the icons on the desktop.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Grateful for more help, if possible.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>thanks,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you installed Uniblue, then you probably have more going on with your system than you know. I would get rid of Uniblue (uninstall from Programs &amp; Features) and do some regular maintenance. You need to install the drivers from HP's website and then leave
 the other drivers alone. You will only get drivers for your computer from HP and the First Law of Driver Updates is "if it ain't broke, don't fix it". Normally if everything is working you want to leave things as they are. The exception is that heavy-duty
 gamers will usually want to update their video and sound drivers to squeeze every last bit of performance out of the hardware to get the fastest frame rates. If you're not one of those people, you don't need to update your drivers if there are no problems
 you are trying to solve.</p>
<p>Frankly, based on your posts I think it would be wise to take your machine to a reputable local professional and have him/her give it a good going-over. Don't use whatever is the local Swedish equipment of BigComputerStore/GeekSquad. Otherwise, maybe there
 is some information here which might be useful:</p>

            <p>Hi</p>
<p>You advised Daniel to use the media creation method but he reported another failure to which you have not responded. Just to be clear I have experienced the self same error message countless times. I have worked with a Level 2 Global Tech who is also stumped.
</p>
<p>Just to illustrate my experience:</p>
<p>1) Signed up for Insider programme on a Advent Roma 3000 laptop (Pentium T4300, 4GB ram 500GB ram and upgraded from Windows 7 32 to Windows 10 64)</p>
<p>2) Decided as laptop was stable to add desktop</p>
<p>3) Experienced issues with Live Mail so tried the dreadful Mail app.</p>
<p>4) Downloaded and paid for Office 365</p>
<p>5) Had to rebuild a new profile</p>
<p>6) Could not remove email addresses from Mail (just simply did not react to keystrokes)</p>
<p>7) Answer tech logged on and removed Mail App</p>
<p>8) Edge ceased working, reverted to IE11</p>
<p>9) System became increasingly unstable</p>
<p>10) Downloaded the latest evaluation build thinking that would restore my desktop</p>
<p>11) installation commenced reached 100%/30% restarted and bricked</p>
<p>12) Desktop would not boot nor could I go back to previous build. I found out at this point that W10 had shut off restore and the back up was not working. Deep joy.</p>
<p>13) Installed W7 SP1 from my OEM disc. Spent the next 14 days struggling to get all 214 updates. W10 would not install reported missing or corrupt files (how if the&nbsp;OS has been downloaded can files be missing or corrupted)</p>
<p>14) Tried all the weird advise of the community website. Removed WiFi card (use LAN anyway). Removed USB expansion card. Removed&nbsp;USB mouse and keyboard, replaced with a wired board and mouse. Disconnected second hard drive. Tested remaining hard drive almost
 to destruction and same with memory. Reburned ISO at 2speed. Reburned ISO on laptop. Reformatted C drive. Replaced hard drive with new 500gb SATA drive</p>
<p>15)Reinstalled W7 SP1 from my OEM disc. Struggled for another 14 days to get all of the 224 updates.
</p>
<p>16) Replaced motherboard (Gigabyte GA-78 LMT USB 3 Rev4.01 with same model Rev 6.01)</p>
<p>17) Realised that BIOS set to Native IDE not SATA so re-installed W7 SP1 with BIOS set to SATA and spent another two weeks getting the 218 updates. Did a rain dance in the back garden, touched every piece of wood in the house and found and stroked a black
 cat. </p>
<p>18) Downloaded all of the chipset updates and drivers again from Gigabyte. Checked with AMD for drivers and patches.</p>
<p>19) Tried to upgrade and got the same bloody error message.</p>
<p>20) Tried with a DVD got to install and then failed at safe_image_stage.</p>
<p>21) Tried with USB and got exactly the same error.</p>
<p>22) Checked that my pc is compatible with W10 it is.</p>
<p>23) updated W7 drivers replacing where possible with W10 drivers.</p>
<p>24) Read everything possible about these errors. It appear to me that it is a conspiracy on&nbsp;behalf of AMD to thwart Microsoft's attempts to give away a new OS for free.
</p>
<p>25) Conclude that whilst my issues and failures are in a minority it is growing to be a sizeable minority.</p>
<p>26) witched to using my Linux machine as bored by the BSDs</p>
<p>27) began muttering <span>
The installation failed at the safe.....SAFE_OS…..APPLY_IMAGE” The error code was 0x8007025D-0X2000C in my sleep.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>So yes, I do know a bit about this. </p>
<p>
</p><p>I reckon I have spent nearly 36 hours on this (20 with a Global Tech logged on following my every move). If you do not believe me contact Saket Aditya quoting RX1330734621ID - Microsoft Escalation and he will run screaming for the nearest exit. So, just
 what does that error message mean? Why when my PC happily ran W10 for nearly 12 months (dear God why did I not come off the programme last July when&nbsp; the finished (hahahaha) version was released). My own theory is that there is an issue somewhere with my OEM
 disc and despite being able to select " I do not have a key" there is still some check which for some reason is throwing my system out. My own experience and research leads me to this. I even had an error message stating something like "Invalid operating system"
 this after all updates installed.</p>
<p>So I say again. And??????????????????????????????????????</p>

            I experienced this error multiple times while trying to upgrade a Win7 Ultimate install on an SSD. A Win7 Pro install on a hard drive in the same machine upgraded without issue.
<br />
<br />
The problem was due to SSD being incompatible with the Windows 10 upgrade system. The solution was to use Pen Drive Linux's dd utility to image the SSD install to a hard drive, upgrade the imaged install to Windows 10, and then image the upgraded install back
 to the SSD. <br />

 the machine there shouldn't be anything for it to prefetch!&nbsp; IMO ram usage should be bellow 200 meg because Win2003 SEVER uses less then 200 meg!&nbsp; XP used about 80 meg!&nbsp; Can someone explain why my fresh install uses 880 meg?&nbsp; Thanks!&nbsp;

            Well, I have built several Win7 and Vista machines and they always report about 800 meg used after a fresh install (in task manager:Performance) so I didn't think I really need to state the system specs but I think it would be good for me to state them
 for completeness sake.&nbsp; So, thanks for the reminder!&nbsp; XD<br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
<br />
All seems normal.</p>
<p>Close all programs :</p>
<p>CTRL + SHIFT + ESC or Right Click TaskBar - Task Manager - Performance tab - on left side<br />
check Physical Memory - Total - Cached and Free. Also Processes tab - check the memory
<br />
use of the programs listed (click the Memory column header so those using a lot of memory<br />
are shown - click twice).</p>
<p>Vista and Windows 7 use memory differently than previous Windows versions by caching ahead.<br />
Both will free up memory to applications as needed.&nbsp;Close all applications and check&nbsp;the Peformance<br />
tab - lower left - Physical Memory - check total and cached. The caching allows free memory to<br />
be used for system performance which is much better than it sitting idle doing nothing.<br />
<br />
Also some of your memory might be used for memory mapping for Video and other system needs.</p>
<p>Start - type in Search box -&gt; System Information&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; find at top and double click on it and check
<br />
the information there.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. </p>

            @SpiritX MS MVP, I guess you didn't read my post?
<br />
<br />
You said: "Vista and Windows 7 use memory differently than previous Windows versions by caching ahead."&nbsp; But how can it be caching ahead if it is a FRESH INSTALL?&nbsp; What could it be cashing?&nbsp; How would it know what to cash and what is it going to cash if I haven't
 installed any software yet?<br />
<br />
Also, even after I disabled the cash ahead service it still used about the same amount of memory.&nbsp;
<br />

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Yes I did read your post. It caches ahead from the minute you install Vista or Windows 7.<br />
If nothing else it caches the OS. And don't disable the Cache ahead service or even try<br />
to get it to use less memory. As I said, it will release memory when needed by a program.<br />
Also memory than is not used is wasted so caching ahead is good use of what would<br />
otherwise be unused memory.<br />
<br />
Vista and Windows 7 use memory entirely differently from previous Windows versions.<br />
<br />
Why Does Vista Use All My Memory?&nbsp; (Windows 7 is the same)<br />

            Cash the OS?&nbsp; Why would it just randomly cash parts of the OS that it has no idea I would ever use?&nbsp; That makes no sense at all.

            Hi,<br />
<br />
Windows tracks usage and there are parts of the OS that are used more frequently<br />
right from the start. Remember memory that is not being used is being wasted. There<br />
is nothing wrong with your system install and Windows and programs will run faster<br />
using the caching method. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps.

<br />
There are many things wrong with this.&nbsp; For one it makes the OS useless for a VM.&nbsp; Cashing only makes sense if you pre-loading programs that are known to be frequently used, otherwise you waist time and resources loading them.&nbsp; Loading into memory is not free.&nbsp;
 In the case of a fresh install the OS has no idea what to preload and would be waisting resources to load things at random and it would totally kill the OS on a VM which needs to use as little ram as possible.

<h2>            appcrash ddraw.dll faulty please help</h2>
                    
<p>hi. all the games i installed can't be started and all have similar error reports concerning ddraw.dll. i tried to check my ddraw version &amp; it keeps saying i have the latest version. i tried downloading previous versions like march 2009 &amp; august 2007 from
 microsoft site, as suggested in the blue screen error thread. but i can't fix&nbsp; my pc's problem. i tried chckdsk, sfc (even sfc doesn't work). please help. i'm posting a copy of the error report, this one pops up when i'm starting cooking dash (a game i used
 to play in my pc). also, would it help if i distinctly remember that this all started when i cleaned my disk with the cleanmgr and it asked me if i would like to permanently delete files from a "ghost" version? what is a "ghost" version anyways? i clicked
 yes &amp; all problems with ddraw appeared. i didn't backed my system before i did this fatal mistake. thanks so much in advance.</p>

            Hi demerolgirl,<br />
Try this.<br />
Download Direct X 10 (Latest release) and install it. Even if you already have it, reinstall it.<br />
Check your file system.<br />
<p><span><span>Please do the following.</span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>Type cmd in the search bar and press enter.</span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>On the command prompt type chkdsk and press enter.</span>
</span></p>
<p><span><span>If it finds any errors, type chkdsk /f to repair them.</span>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>After that finishes, put your windows installation disk in the drive and go back to the command prompt. Type sfc /scannow and then enter.</span>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span><span>Please let us know if this resolved the issue.<br />

<h2>            Windows Backup with wbAdmin cannot be contacted after reinstall</h2>
                    <div>
<div>
<div style="color: rgba(34, 34, 34, 1)">Prior to my fresh install of windows 10 pro I had been wbAdmin to backup my C drive to a NAS.<br />
wbAdmin START BACKUP -backupTarget:\\Bserver\nas1 -include:C: -allCritical -quiet<br />
<br />
After the reinstall I started getting the error:<br />
<br />
wbadmin 1.0 - Backup command-line tool<br />
(C) Copyright 2013 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.<br />
<br />
<br />
Note: The backed up data cannot be securely protected at this destination.<br />
Backups stored on a remote shared folder might be accessible by other<br />
people on the network. You should only save your backups to a location<br />
where you trust the other users who have access to the location or on a<br />
network that has additional security precautions in place.<br />
<br />
Retrieving volume information...<br />
This will back up (EFI System Partition),(C:),(\\?\Volume{5fd8aafb-61b1-462d-bfed-d633da5b505d}\) to \\Bserver\nas1.<br />
The Windows Backup engine could not be contacted. Retry the operation.<br />
The remote procedure call failed.<br />
<br />
To try to troubleshoot I went into the event viewer and I see:<br />
The Block Level Backup Engine Service service terminated unexpectedly. &nbsp;It has done this 2 time(s). &nbsp;The following corrective action will be taken in 300000 milliseconds: Restart the service.<br />
<br />
It seems this is the issue as it happens every time I try to backup. Not sure how to proceed from here. Any suggestions would be great, thanks.

            <p><span>Hello Mamta,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community Forum. </span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>I understand how frustrating it could be when things do not work as expected. Please do not worry I will try my best to resolve it.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>Before we start troubleshooting on the issue please provide us with the additional information by answering few questions mentioned below, this will help us to troubleshoot better.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1.&nbsp;Do you remember making any changes to the system prior to this issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp;What is the complete error message when you try to refresh?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would like to inform you that Windows 8 includes a recovery feature called Automatic Repair that attempts to automatically diagnose and fix common issues that may cause Windows 8. Automatic Repair scan various settings, configuration options, and system
 files for corrupt files and settings.<span>&nbsp; </span>If it detects anything, it will automatically attempt to fix them for you.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">1. To access Automatic Repair in the Windows Recovery Environment you need to go to the Windows 8 Start Screen and type<strong><span>Advanced</span></strong>. When the search results appear click on the
<strong><span>Settings</span></strong> category as shown below.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>2. Now click on the option labeled <strong>Advanced startup options</strong> and you will be brought to the General PC Settings screen. Scroll down to the bottom until you see an option labeled
<strong>Advanced startup</strong>. Click on the <strong>Restart now</strong> button and Windows 8 will restart your computer and go directly into the Advanced Startup options menu.</p>
<p>
</p><p>3. Now click on the <strong>Troubleshoot</strong> button and then the <strong>
Advanced options</strong> button. When the advanced options screen opens, click on the
<strong>Automatic Repair</strong> option. Your computer will now reboot and you will then be shown a screen where Windows states it is preparing Automatic Repair. When it is done, you will be shown a screen where you need to select an Administrator account
 that you wish to login with.</p>
<p>
</p><p>4. Please click on the account you wish to use. If your account has a password on it, you will be required to enter it and then click on the
<strong>Continue</strong> button to continue with the automatic repair. Automatic will now start and attempt to diagnose the problem with your computer.</p>
<p>
</p><p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)">5. The automatic repair process can take a quite a while, so please be patient while Automatic Repair attempts to find a repair startup problems in Windows 8. During this process your computer may reboot. This is perfectly normal
 and nothing to worry about. Once the automatic repair process has completed it will tell if you if it was able to repair anything. If it was not able to repair anything you will be shown a prompt asking if you wish to shutdown or use some other tools.</span></p>

<h2>            Does leaving the Xbox 360 on for more than 24 hours damage anything&#63;</h2>
                    <p>My little brother uses the Xbox as a DVD player sometimes, but he's very stubborn and doesn't want to turn it off when he's done or when he pauses a movie/show. He's rather lazy and he sits around for around 8 hours a day watching DVDs on the Xbox. The Xbox starts making a loud hum/rumble&nbsp;when he's been watching for a while, and when he needs to get off he pauses his movie or show, and turns off the TV. He leaves it on sometimes for over 24 hours straight. The disk still turns in there and the Xbox continues to make weird noises that worry me every time I&nbsp;walk by it, and&nbsp;it feels very hot.&nbsp;I try to turn it off every time that I see this, but it still happens much too often. Now getting to the actual question. I'm very afraid that my brother is not only going to hurt the Xbox, but also the disk which we borrow from the library. He doesn't care that you can resume exactly where you were. He just leaves it on. Please tell me that he's wrong and why he's wrong so I can h

            <p>it depends if your Xbox has a good cooler if it starts to over heat but the disc tray is not made to stay on for that long I recommend setting up rules with your brother</p><p>And your power brick/power saving inside can melt if it doesn't have a working cooler of even have one</p><p>So keep a eye on it</p>

    <title>Surface RT 32GB full storage and reinstall seems impossible - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> tvan k  say:</h3>
<h2>            Surface RT 32GB full storage and reinstall seems impossible</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I've got a client's Surface RT 32GB, of which the storage is completely full.&nbsp;<br />
There are no personal files on it. There are no programs installed on it.&nbsp;<br />
I work in IT and I've done everything I can think of to create space on this device, to no avail, it just fills up instantly. It hasn't been able to update in more than a year due to storage issues.<br />
<br />
I promised the client I'd take the tablet and reset it to the factory defaults or manually reinstall Windows, hoping this would create space.<br />
<br />
<strong>Things I've tried that haven't worked:&nbsp;</strong><br />
<em>(Note: I might get some of the names wrong, the OS is in a different language from English)</em><br />
<br />
- Through the settings menu, under the System Recovery tab, I've tried both the "Refresh this PC" option and the "Restore factory settings option.<br />
Both options say: "Insert medium, missing files"<br />
<br />
- Creating a Recovery drive from the device itself, then using the Recovery environment*, try booting that USB: doesn't work and just boots back into the Recovery environment<br />
<br />
<em>*Holding down the "Volume down" button while booting</em></p>
<p><br />
- In the aforementioned Recovery environment, tried refreshing the PC and later Restoring the PC to factory settings.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">-When prompted for a recovery key, clicked ignore and continued, I then insert the USB and it says it's not a valid one</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">-When prompted for a recovery key, clicked ignore and continued, then it says the drive is locked and I need the key</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">or</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">- When prompted for a recovery key, I entered the <strong>
correct </strong>recovery key, I then insert the USB and it says it's not a valid one</p>
<p style="margin-left: 30px">
</p><p><br />
What can I do about this? I'm looking for solutions on any scale, like a way to expand the storage, a way to format the PC or even just a way to make a recovery stick that works. I made the recovery stick from the tablet itself using the recommended Wizard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>Following <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-ie/surfacerecoveryimage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
this Microsoft Support article</a>&nbsp;I managed to download a recovery image, but step 3 seems to completely ignore this file and just create something from the OS itself. I did this on my W10 PC because as I said before: The surface tablet is completely full!
 The only way I imagine downloading a Recovery image to the Surface is to plug in a USB hub, two USB drives, then download the Image to drive 1 and create a recovery drive to drive 2. However, like I said, step 3 of this article seems to ignore this file entirely
 so I don't see how this would help.<br />
<br />
Thank you in advance.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The RT comes with a recovery partition on the drive. This may have been removed by the user. That's why you see insert media.</p>
<p>Using the recovery image&nbsp;on a&nbsp;USB drive you can reset of refresh the device. You do not have the needed drive space to refresh. A
<p>I have written a guide on preparing the USB recovery drive and using it.</p>

            Just dragging it on eh? That's new! I fully assumed it would have had to be made bootable.<br />
Either way, this worked and the tablet now has 75% free storage space, thanks a bunch!<br />

    <title>Xbox 1 and Network Tethering. - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> smileskybird  say:</h3>
<h2>            Xbox 1 and Network Tethering.</h2>
                    
<p>It would be useful if M made it if you could on Xbox 1 (and Xbox 360) allowed you to tether your smartphone or cell phone to your console. Xbox 1 does have USB ports. I can tether my Samsung S5 (4G enabled) to my HP Pavilion dv6 PC and get internet that
 way, or USB internet. You can get 4G ones. My ISP is Spark NZ who has 3G and 4G service but say they can't connect until Vodafone disconnects, and our place doesn't have broadband internet as we just finished moving into today, and the previous occupier's
 ISP Vodafone won't disconnect the previous occupier's service til Monday. Not because of the weekend but with the queue.&nbsp;The majority of USB supports 3G speeds which is like ADSL Broadband speeds, so it's not like it's dial-up. I just think it would be a really
 handy feature for when families or students move place and unable to get connected immediately. 3G speeds and ADSL is fast enough for Xbox 1 and Xbox 360 so are many USB mobile broadband internet sticks. PC's accept it and it would be great if Xbox could.
 Transferring power and Sky TV was painless, but telecommunications especially Internet access which is.... ESSENTIAL these days especially for my generation, it's like life support.</p>

<p>I don't know about the 360, but the Xbox One can connect to wireless networks, and should be able to to tether to your smartphone or mobile hotspot.

<p>And this my friend is why people are hating some of the Xbox live users . You know 4g networks are not ment for multiplayer games. YES YOU CAN CONNECT TO LIVE,but 4g networks have a huge latency issue which causes everyone playing the game with you to suffer.</p>

<p>It's better than having NO Xbox Live connection. SmartGlass Xbox 360 and SmartGlass Xbox 1 I have on my Samsung S5 and I have it tethered to my PC.
</p>
<p>I can pick up other neighbours wi-fi (and no don't even think about trying to connect to them). Internet at our new place will get sorted in the next few days. Yes I live in a NZ CITY so it is a pretty big deal when your house doesn't have home internet.
 Power and TV are sorted. Can play single player games and DVD's and Blu-ray and USB videos. In our suburb we have a mobile tower about 250m away where the shops are but the consoles wi-fi can't pick up mobile tower internet cuz (a) out of range (including
 wi-fi hot spots at our suburbs shopping centre aread, and (b) you cannot connect your consoles to a mobile phone tower meant for phones to get internet (unless they allow you tether your phone to a console so you can get internet that way).
</p>
<p>I'd just still think it would be a good idea for Xbox to accept tethering and USB broadband sticks like PC's can. Just wanted to discuss it here.

            OK. Now I have to lock the taskbar to maintain its height. I don't think I had to lock it before the Creators update. Or the update has reset this setting.

<p>Well, locking the taskbar only fixed the problem temporarily. My taskbar has just been reset to one row after a reboot.</p>

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><em>What other troubleshooting steps have you tried so far?</em></li></ul>
<p>What other troubleshooting steps should I try ?</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li><em>Have you tried using a different account and see if the same behavior will occur?</em></li></ul>
<p>I have tried with the Admin account and the problem doesn't appear there so far. One difference is that I'm not running Classic Shell in my Admin account contrary to my work account.</p>
<p>
</p><p>However, I disabled Classic Start Menu and this didn't change anything.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks in advance.</p>

            Never mind. This appears to be a problem with Classic Shell. As long as I do not activate the Classic Startup Menu, the problem doesn't appear.<br />
