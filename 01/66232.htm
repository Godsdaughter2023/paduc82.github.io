<h2>            Asus Vivotab RT 600T -Keyboard not charging</h2>
                    <p>Hi </p>
<p>
</p><p>I have recently both an Asus Vivotab RT 600T and keyboard docking station.</p>
<p>When I plug in the charger into the Keyboard dock ,it comes up with a message Battery 1 -plugged in ,not charging (which is the tablet battery ) and Battery 2- plugged in ,charging but this does not charge.</p>
<p>I have also noticed that the LED charging indicator light does not light up at all even if I try to charge the docking station alone without the tablet.</p>
<p>I have noticed that there are several people who have noticed this problem. I did try to remove the ACPI compliant battery method from device manager but the problem persists.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Has anyone found a permanent solution?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Appreciate all help and suggestions. Disappointed with Asus and Microsoft as the problem seems to be around from 2013!!!</p>
<p />

    <title>Latest Windows 10 &#39;Update&#39; Freezing at 98 Percent - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> giovannigee  say:</h3>
<h2>            Latest Windows 10 &#39;Update&#39; Freezing at 98 Percent</h2>
                    <p>So.. it seems like I am paying the price in trying to do the 'right thing' and let Windows update my system. After letting it do its thing overnight, I found it stuck at 98 percent the next morning. I ended up forcing a shut down and everything went downhill
 from there. Upon rebooting and logging in, I found I could no longer access the windows start menu and cortana. plus no internet connection and no Explorer.. pretty much a screwed up system. My desktop was lost as well, which I tried to restore from the Windows.old
 directory. Got my icons back on the next reboot, but they were continually blinking on and off like crazy and still nothing else worked. I used to have a few restore points on my laptop too, but mysteriously, when I tried checking, they were not to be found...</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thankfully, I have an old laptop lying around and so i downloaded the MediaCreationTool1803 to create a USB installer. Plugged it in and booted from it. I chose the 'keep apps' option because I'm REALLY not in the mood to reinstall all my programs again..
 you know, I shouldn't really have to do that, right? Anyhow, I started the update process again at about 1pm today and it is now just after 10pm. And it's been stuck at 98 percent AGAIN since about 3pm. That's only 7 hours of hang time Microsoft!&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>What a great update! I think it behaves more like a VIRUS than anything else, because it has rendered my laptop UNUSABLE! And it looks like I'll have to start from scratch again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>But I may try some of the tips offered here:</p>
<p>http://www.alphr.com/microsoft/1001411/how-to-fix-windows-update-in-windows-10-if-it-becomes-stuck-1</p>
<p>
</p><p>But right now, I'm too tired...</p>
<p>
</p><p>If I have any further findings, I will post an update. In the meantime, if you have any other bright ideas, I'm all ears!<br />

<h2>            Command prompt font messed up after Anniversary Update</h2>
                    <p><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">Hi, I have installed the Anniversary Update a couple days ago. Everything went fine and I faced no problem at all. However, my command prompt font was changed to SimSum-ExtB (the font which often found
 on Chinese product). I right-clicked on the title bar &gt; Properties and chose Consolas font but that seems to take no effect. Font stays unchanged, all I can do are change font size and select Bold font.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><a href="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/444c7dc5-fd60-4976-9878-da44608ee3b8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/444c7dc5-fd60-4976-9878-da44608ee3b8" /></a></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Changing to Courier font sometimes works, sometimes it displays error message like this before changing the font. But selecting Consolas font will not work at all.</span></p>

<p>
</p><p><span>Here are what I have done trying to solve this but no luck</span></p>
<ul>
<li>Go to Control Panel &gt; Appearance and Personalisation &gt; Fonts &gt; Font settings &gt; Restore default font settings</li><li><span>Open Registry Editor and deleted the entire </span><span><span style="color: rgba(36, 39, 41, 1)">HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Console
</span></span><span>then open the command prompt window again, the problem still persists. Only the window size and font size were changed to default settings.
</span><span>I right-clicked on the title bar &gt; Defaults &gt; Font tab &gt; The font is set to Consolas but it still use that<span>&nbsp;</span></span><span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">SimSum-ExtB font for displaying. I also opened PowerShell and it has the same issue.</span></li></ul>

<p><span>Has anyone experienced this? I hope I don't have to repair Windows. Thank you.</span></p>

<h2>            blank screen appears when i try to play Myst 10th Anniversary Collection game on Windows 8</h2>
                    <p>Original Title: Myst 10th Anniversary Collection on Windows 8</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was able to install Myst 10th Anniversary Collection on Windows 8, when I run it had to do windows compatibility and did display one for 640x768 to get sound and story line before the game, once it gets to game I get sound but blank screen, I do know how
 to move some what around in game so at times at different places will see animation picture like bird flying in a small box or in hidden area the fountain but only the water part other wise nothing else will show, can some one help cause I have all the Myst
 games and would like to be able to play them on Windows 8, they use to work on Windows XP but do not have that computer any more and finding patches are not around like before, Thank You.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your reply, let me give you info on my system, I have an Acer Aspire 5733-6838 laptop, it came with Windows 7 and it worked on version with no problem then I upgraded to Windows 8 and now when it first start it does the starting display and
 sounds telling about the game then after it is done it is blank screen with sound, I know were to click and can get a small picture of birds flying by click on the game to change directions, I know were the hidden thing is and click there and open the door
 (remember it is still blank screen) and can see the top half of the fountain at a distance, I click to get close and as I do it gets larger but only the fountain is showing the rest is blank, in other words anything that is animated will show but if not animating
 then will not show, I love the game, I have uninstalled and installed, did do the troubleshoot compatibility, this program runs on Windows XP and would not run on Windows Vista but like I said it did run on Windows 7, so when I selected Windows XP then it
 says I was running on Windows NT and needs to run on Windows 95, if I do not check for earlier version then it goes to Windows Vista and does the problems above, if I check program opens but does not display correctly&nbsp;and can check one of the two or both program
 starts up in small windows (640x480) pixel and wont switch to full screen, or the other check Program does not display properly when large scale font is selected, both or one or the other does the same problem and will not display game only the start of a
 new game by telling what game is to give you an idea what it is about before game it self starts, if it worked right then it would tell about the game then display the island and would circle around the island then when you click on it then you land at the
 dock by ship and I think it is sunken and to the left is a secret room that has the fountain and to the right is the birds flying, so when it goes to show the island is were the display goes blank, I hope this helps and so not video driver problem cause it
 worked on this same computer when I got it with windows 7 and only when upgraded to windows 8 it stopped working with display, sound is still there,
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>oh yes and I love windows 8 thanks you just when I upgraded I was told I could create a copy of the windows 8 upgrade but could not find were, I paid 15 dollars for the upgrade but want the disk for back up in case I have to redo the computer, we got 2 computers
 of the same type and both was upgraded so need disk for 1 if works on both or 2 disk if needed for each computer, I am willing to pay for the disk backup of windows 8 upgrade if I have too, please help with this one too, thank you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In short</p>
<p>Runs on Windows XP with no problems, Will not run on Windows Vista, Runs on Windows 7 (I think in compatibility mode or maybe not), Windows 8 only sound and birds flying in small window at corner, secret room part of fountain, top and bottom missing in center
 of screen, in other words only animation will display but nothing else.</p>

            <p>Thank you for your reply, let me give you info on my system, I have an Acer Aspire 5733-6838 laptop, it came with Windows 7 and it worked on version with no problem then I upgraded to Windows 8 and now when it first start it does the starting display and
 sounds telling about the game then after it is done it is blank screen with sound, I know were to click and can get a small picture of birds flying by click on the game to change directions, I know were the hidden thing is and click there and open the door
 (remember it is still blank screen) and can see the top half of the fountain at a distance, I click to get close and as I do it gets larger but only the fountain is showing the rest is blank, in other words anything that is animated will show but if not animating
 then will not show, I love the game, I have uninstalled and installed, did do the troubleshoot compatibility, this program runs on Windows XP and would not run on Windows Vista but like I said it did run on Windows 7, so when I selected Windows XP then it
 says I was running on Windows NT and needs to run on Windows 95, if I do not check for earlier version then it goes to Windows Vista and does the problems above, if I check program opens but does not display correctly&nbsp;and can check one of the two or both program
 starts up in small windows (640x480) pixel and wont switch to full screen, or the other check Program does not display properly when large scale font is selected, both or one or the other does the same problem and will not display game only the start of a
 new game by telling what game is to give you an idea what it is about before game it self starts, if it worked right then it would tell about the game then display the island and would circle around the island then when you click on it then you land at the
 dock by ship and I think it is sunken and to the left is a secret room that has the fountain and to the right is the birds flying, so when it goes to show the island is were the display goes blank, I hope this helps and so not video driver problem cause it
 worked on this same computer when I got it with windows 7 and only when upgraded to windows 8 it stopped working with display, sound is still there,
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>oh yes and I love windows 8 thanks you just when I upgraded I was told I could create a copy of the windows 8 upgrade but could not find were, I paid 15 dollars for the upgrade but want the disk for back up in case I have to redo the computer, we got 2 computers
 of the same type and both was upgraded so need disk for 1 if works on both or 2 disk if needed for each computer, I am willing to pay for the disk backup of windows 8 upgrade if I have too, please help with this one too, thank you.</p>

            <p>Hello,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I too am annoyed by this problem. This is an issue with almost all of the Myst games. This same issue happened to me with my computer. The solution of compatibility mode works sometimes for Riven (the sequel to Myst), however I have found that it does not
 work with Myst. I too have run it and seen a blank screen. Unfortunately, Myst was not designed for the modern PC. Rand Miller (the person who created the game) wants to make their games playable on the modern PC, however the company does not have enough money
 to fund the project. It is disappointing to me because it sounds like the company that made these games (which I love) is dying out. I have found that Myst 10th Anniversary Edition works on Windows&nbsp;XP and earlier. If you have a computer with Windows XP or
 earlier, I recommend using that computer to run Myst. There is&nbsp;a workaround if you really want to get the game on Windows 8. A free program called Virtual Box can run Windows XP virtually. You do need a copy of an operating system (Windows XP or earlier).
 Then you just install Myst onto the virtual machine running Windows XP. It is a ridiculous way to do it but there is just no way to play it on modern computers. If you feel like contacting the creators of Myst check out their website:
<a href="http://www.cyanworlds.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">www.cyanworlds.com</a> Other than that, it is a dead end. It disappoints us Myst fans too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hope this helps.</p>

            <p>Hertzer, thank you for the info, I was able to partition my disk and install Windows 7 and install Myst on it, found out when I did that now I get the game display but none of the animation parts, so I upgraded the quick time that came with myst&nbsp;then I got
 only the animation and not the game (animation on dock: birds flying, animation&nbsp;secret room on doc; fountain water) so now I think it has part to do with quick time, if I know how to install upgrade to Windows XP Pro then I will try Myst again on that drive
 and see with the drivers on Windows XP Pro Upgrade&nbsp;has cause I know the drivers I have for Windows 8 only go back to Windows 7 and do not know if it will work on Windows XP Pro Upgrade, I do know if you have the hard drive partition with nothing on one Ppartition
 you can install Windows XP Pro Upgrade but you need to have a sub directory and or a file that can be blank but I do not remember what that info is?</p>

<h2>            External hard drive not showing up</h2>
                    I bought an external hard drive a few months ago and moved all of my files to it because of the low disk space on my C drive (I have a Windows 10 HP Laptop). However, I unplugged it earlier and when I plugged it back in, it wasn't showing up in my File
 Explorer or my Disk Management. However, it's showing up on my Device Management under Disk drives, labeled as WD My Passport 25E2 USB Device. Is there anything I can do to fix this?

            Hi Tristan,
<br />
<br />Restart your PC a couple of times
<br />
<br />Then plug that drive into another US port on your PC
<br />
<br />Does Windows then recognise it?
<br />
<br />If not, plug it into another non-Windows 10 PC, is it recognised on that PC?

<h3> li jiayi  say:</h3>
<h2>            .Net framework won&#39;t work for 32bit programmes in Win7 64bit</h2>
                    <p>Hello,</p>
<p>
</p><p>I am having issues with programmes depending on .net framework. (Twitch Desktop &amp; others)</p>
<p>When launching the programme, an error appears directly : </p>
<p>&nbsp;- <em>"Application unable to start correctly 0xc0000135".</em></p>
<p>Some dependency walker job shows me that the mscoree.dll is not found for the sepecific exe.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Environment :</strong></p>
<p>Windows 7 64bit</p>
<p>.Net Framework 4.7 freshly installed</p>

<p>
</p><p><strong>What I did:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;- Uninstalled all .Net framework and reinstalled the 4.7 pack </p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- <span>didn't fix the issue</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;- Cmd (as admin) then "<span>sfc /scannow"</span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;- log says multiple times that some mscoree.dll version mismatch</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;- log says multiple times that some mscoree.dll source also corrupted</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp;- didn't fix the issue</span></p>
<p><strong>What I know :</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;- All programmes (2 for now) having the same issues are 32bit programmes based on .Net framework.</p>
<p>&nbsp;- There is a&nbsp;<span>mscoree.dll in system32, but none in&nbsp;</span>SysWOW64</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>What I am doing:</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;- .Net is corrupted and needs to be forcely reset. </p>
<p>&nbsp;- I lauched the following command before leaving home</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;-&nbsp;<span>DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth</span></p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;- https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/929833/use-the-system-file-checker-tool-to-repair-missing-or-corrupted-system</p>

<p>DISM didn't work.<br />
I also tried to repair the whole system with my installation DVD. Strangely it said "system recovery not compatible".</p>
<p>
</p><p>Just before thinking of reinstalling Windows, I tried the <strong>worst possible
</strong>solution:<br />
I downloaded a 32bit mscoree.dll for x64 Windows 7 and copied it to SysWOW64<br />
<strong>And it worked...</strong></p>

<h2>            HELP. WRONG PRODUCT bought online.</h2>
                    <p>Hi,<br />
I hope to find some help here.<br />
I have a big problem and I don't find the right link to let you know that I bought the wrong product.<br />
</p>
<p>Minutes ago I bought the wrong windows 10, and is not cheap here in Iceland,&nbsp; (and here in Iceland we don't have technical support in our country to call).<br />
I just notice because I have a second hand computer, that I was sure that it came with windows 10 PRO, but instead of that it has windows 10 HOME that is half price than the "pro" here. Really if I know that, I just buy the windows 10 HOME. (*in the specification
 of the computer says it is a Windows PRO).</p>
<p>In the computer it was saying that it has windows 10 PRO... until I bought and tried to run the installer program it says that it has wrong activation key *even says windows Pro key, in the windows Home product.<br />
<br />
I just wanted to have the activation key and why not buy the windows 10 again because surely I can't&nbsp; activate some functions without the product key that is needed, So I just wanted to make it right ... I didn't want some "pirate key" cloned or what ever,
 I just wanted make it right. <br />
It was not necessary to pay double price for it.<br />
<br />
I bought the wrong windows for this computer, and I can't activate this because I have the wrong windows that works with its proper product key.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I want to change product and a partial refund. I don]t know where to write or call.<br />
</p>
<p>I don't know where to write or call. I saw only the virtual agent that can' help me this time.<br />
HELP.&nbsp; HELP. HELP.<br />

            Answer these questions please?
<br />
<br />Which edition of Windows 10 did you buy, Home or Pro?
<br />
<br />Which edition of Windows 10 is currently installed on the computer, Home or Pro?
<br />
<br />If the computer is originally licensed for Windows 10 Home, but it has Pro installed, you will need to perform a clean install. 
<br />
<br />See steps to downgrade to Home below:
<br />
<br />If you want a refund:
<br />

<br />
<br />Downgrade to Windows 10 Home:
<br />
<br />When you upgraded from a previous version of Windows or receive a new computer preinstalled with Windows 10, what happened is the hardware (your PC) will get a digital entitlement, where a unique signature of the computer will be stored on Microsoft Activation Servers. The Windows 7 or Windows 8 genuine license you were previously running will be exchanged for a diagnostics key.
<br />
<br />Anytime you need to reinstall Windows 10 on that machine, just proceed to reinstall Windows 10. It will automatically reactivate. You will prompted to enter a product key a couple times through the installation, click I don't have a key and Do this later.
<br />
<br />There is no need to know or get a new key, but if you have issues with Digital Licensing or the Activation Troubleshooter, you can utilize an existing Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 product key you already own to reactivate if necessary. or use the reset function in Windows 10. 
<br />
<br />Go to a working computer, download, create a bootable copy, then perform a clean install.

<br />Review the following guide for instructions and details about configuring your BIOS or UEFI boot settings for DVD, CD, USB or SD Card.

<br />
<br />Once your computer is set to boot from the DVD, you should see this option. If you are installing from a retail Windows 10 USB thumb drive, you will be asked to select either 32 or 64 bit Windows 10. Learn more here <a href="https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows-10-32-bit-or-64-bit-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.groovypost.com/howto/choose-windows...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />The Windows logo will appear on screen, this might be here for a while, as long as you see the animating dots, everything should be ok.
<br />
<br />Select your Language, Time and Keyboard method then click Next.
<br />
<br />Click Install now
<br />
<br />Windows 10 setup will prompt you for a product key during installation a couple times. If you originally upgraded from Windows 7 or Windows 8/8.1 click the option 'I don't have a key' and 'Do this later' . If you have a Windows 10 product key, you can proceed to enter it.
<br />
<br />Setup will also prompt you to select the edition you have a license for - Home or Pro. Please make sure you choose the right edition. If you choose the wrong edition, your only option will be to perform a clean install again.
<br />
<br />The copy of Windows 10 you download and upgrade from will correspond with the edition of Windows you have installed, if it does not, this is why you might be experiencing problems activating:
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Starter, Home Basic, Home Premium, Windows 8.0 Core, Windows 8.1 Core should install Windows 10 Home 
<br />
<br />    Windows 7 Professional, Windows 7 Ultimate, Windows 8.0 Pro, Windows 8.1 Pro should install Windows 10 Pro
<br />
<br />Wait while setup prepares to copy files
<br />
<br />Accept the license terms then click Next
<br />
<br />Click Custom: Install Windows only (advanced) 
<br />
<br />NOTE: Sometimes Windows 10 setup can become confused if it see's a thumb drive. You might get a driver missing error or something to that effect. If you do, restart setup, but this time, when you arrive at the following screen, disconnect your thumb drive then go through Custom options. When setup is ready copy files, it will prompt you to reconnect the installation source (your USB). 
<br />
<br />Select the drive then click New
<br />
<br />NOTE: If you have multiple partitions listed, select each one (starting at the bottom), then click delete until there is only a single (one) unallocated drive displayed in the window.
<br />
<br />Select the unallocated drive listed, click New, click Apply then OK
<br />
<br />This will split the drive into multiple partitions, select the Primary partition then click Next.
<br />
<br />NOTE: The System Reserved partition is where recovery files are kept for diagnostics and repairing damaged Windows 10 files; or even reinstall Windows 10.
<br />
<br />Wait while Windows installs
<br />
<br />When this phase of setup is complete, Windows will automatically restart then reboot into setup again.
<br />
<br />Windows is detecting and installing your hardware. After this is complete, Windows will restart one last time.

<p>Thank you very much...&nbsp;<br />
Andre, Thank you...<br />
<br />
But the thing is that it was not necessary to buy an expensive upgrade. I know that I did buy windows in spite of the price (with a lot of effort, I´m not rich), because I thought it was necessary,&nbsp; really here is expensive. It cost me more than 280 dls. windows
 PRO and windows HOME cost 150 dls. </p>
<p>(this is the price online, because on the store is: 290 dls. the windows Home and 359 dls. the windows Pro)</p>
<p>
</p><p>I'm saying is something that I don't needed to pay DOBLE price, can you understand me?<br />
I 'm a house wife that just wanted make the things right for my computer.<br />

<div>Hi,</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>a. You referred to Windows Update in the subject line, are you trying to burn a Windows update? What kind of files are you trying to burn?<br />
b. Which tool are you using to burn CD?</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>I would need&nbsp;event viewer logs as well to troubleshoot this issue. Here is how:</div>
<div><br />
<strong>Type eventvwr.msc /s</strong> in the address bar.</div>
<div><br />
&nbsp; List any events that are listed as "Error" in the main window when you go to "Windows Logs" and "Application." There are often a lot of them. Send us whichever ones you see listed for the last couple days. (Please also do for the logs in "System"). When you
 do, provide us the name of the "Source" and whatever is listed in the description box below the list of logs when you click on one.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>For more information about event viewer refer to the artcles below:<br />
<strong>Open Event Viewer</strong><br />
<a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Event-Viewer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Open-Event-Viewer</a></div>

    <title>Virtual PC is a mess after dealing with corrupt user profile - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> pranderson  say:</h3>
<h2>            Virtual PC is a mess after dealing with corrupt user profile</h2>
                    
<p>See this thread for my original problem dealing with a corrupt user profile, it's related to the Virtual PC problem I am having now:</p>
<p><a href="http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7repair/thread/e1dc91af-d4b1-4727-9bec-429305c8bae9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.answers.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7repair/thread/e1dc91af-d4b1-4727-9bec-429305c8bae9</a></p>
<p>I succeeded in creating a new user profile and everything seemed to running fine...until today. Today, I tried to use Window Virtual PC and it would not load. It wanted to create the environment again, so I let it go through the steps, thinking that would
 fix any problems. Bad mistake...</p>
<p>Before the corrupt user profile I had two programs installed in XP mode and now none of them will work. I assume this is because Windows Xp mode cannot find the original path -- THAT USER PROFILE IS GONE NOW!</p>
<p>I'm thinking I should completely uninstall Virtual Machine and those programs I installed (Adobe Acrobat 5.0 and Adobe Illustrator 10). Under the Virtual PC applications it also lists my Epson Printer, which is shared from my laptop. However, I have no clue
 how to uninstall the programs. I see them listed in the Start menu under Windows XP Mode Applications, but I have no idea if they still exist on my computer.</p>
<p>Please help! I am not sure what to do next!&nbsp; Ask me questions, because I am not sure I can remember everything I've done since dealing with that corrupt user profile.</p>

<p>The corrupt user profile has been removed/deleted from my computer. It was causing too many headaches with programs trying to locate files in the wrong place, so I removed it completely. I removed the corrupt profile via right-clicking on Computer &gt;Properties
 &gt; Advanced Setting &gt;User Profiles. I followed instructions to do this from a MS knowledge base article.</p>
<p>I do have a back-up copy of the old user profile folder on an external drive. Here's a screen shot showing the back-up folder and my current folder with the .vhd file.&nbsp; What should I do now?</p>

            Why don't you backup the current file Windows XP Mode.vhd (modified 7/29/2010) if you want to save it, and then replace it with the file Windows XP Mode.vhd (modified 6/29/2010)?&nbsp; That might solve the problem for you.

<p>I was afraid you were going to suggest that...</p>
<p>It did not go well! In fact, I believe it just made things worse. I backed up the current .vhd file and then replaced it with the back-up one from 06/29. XP mode still would not work, it wanted that old profile. It tried to go through the motions, but I
 could tell by the way the laptop fans kicked into high gear that it was not going to open. It finally hung and instead of the typical blue XP desktop of XP mode, it turned into a black screen with a command prompt! I also got this error:<a href="http://www.patchpieces.com/misc_images/XPmode_loaderror.gif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.patchpieces.com/misc_images/XPmode_loaderror.gif</a>
 . That logon error looked VERY familiar!!!&nbsp; I finally got it to stop trying to load, shut it down. I think the problem is that the VM is very tied to the user account it's installed under. Even if I am the administrator and sole user on my laptop.</p>
<p>After that fiasco,&nbsp; I decided the time had come to UNinstall VM and XP mode from my laptop.&nbsp; I put the current file back in place and then I followed the instructions here...praying that it would actually uninstall! Turned out to be the easiest thing I've
 had to do since the corrupted user profile happened! <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee431673%28WS.10%29.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee431673%28WS.10%29.aspx</a> .</p>
<p>Maybe I'll try VM again someday, but for now, I'm going to go take some ibuprofen and try to actually get some work done!</p>

</blockquote>
<p>I don't think of it as lost, I just don't think their was any way to repair what was there. Too many unseen conflicts which I think was due to the corrupt profile issue I had several weeks ago. It was probably the best course of action.</p>
<p>The error message was in the XP mode window. That black screen is what loaded instead of the default XP desktop. The image is full size so you are seeing what I saw! When I had the user profile problem I got the same message from Windows 7, except that the
 temporary profile had already been loaded.</p>
<p>Now if someone would tell me how a user profile gets corrupted, I would love to know! It happened immediately following the reboot after a routine Windows Update. Now I wait with bated breath every time there's a Windows Update...</p>

<p>Hello pranderson,</p>
<p>In the future if you have questions dealing specifically with Windows XP mode and virtualization, there is a separate forum that you can post.<br />
<a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itprovirt/threads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itprovirt/threads</a></p>
<p>Many times User Profiles become corrupt when applications don't release handles to the registry when they are closed. This is not as big a problem as in previous Operating Systems as the User Profile Service is installed by default on Windows 7 systems and
 Windows Vista.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm not sure about problems you are seeing with Windows Update. If you can specifiy which update caused a problem, then Microsoft can try to find out what is causing the issue.</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

    <title>POKEMON needs to come to xbox - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> restlessdman  say:</h3>
<h2>            POKEMON needs to come to xbox</h2>
                    
<p>Now i know i'll prolly get some type of comments or make fun of but i dont care and im pretty sure that im the only one thats got the balls to post a thread like this cuz everyone cares about what everyone thinks online but to me i could care less. Now with
 that said and hopefully some of you ppl will not waste the time to post something stupid unless u agree or talk about the game. anyways i think Pokemon should come to Xbox, yes i know Nintendo owns all rights to Pokemon, but if we can get alot of people to
 talk about it maybe they'll say hmm if thats what they want, MAKE IT, they did with Metal gears, who was own by Kinomi or whatever and they said it will&nbsp;ONLY be on Playstation well guess what its on xbox&nbsp;too, &nbsp;so why not pokemon. now if they think about it,
 and i know most people on here will agree, that Majority of the people around the world plays Xbox, agree? ok now if we can think back in 2009 or 2010 when Red Dead Redemption game was like the muiltplayer all that fun stuffs, now image PokeWorld like that,
 i mean you go and explore the land capture and train, battle other people in the muiltplayer session world become the best pokemon trainer on the&nbsp; leaderboard. now if Nintendo can come to it sense, and agree to let xbox and rockstar make a game of pokemon
 not only Nintendo, Xbox, Rockstar would be rich but the people would be amuse by playing this kind of game and i know there is alot of people who are crazy about pokemon, and i will have to admit, yea pokemon was *** but after playin a couple of games at my
 friend's house cuz thats all he had, i kind of find it fun to play around with, and as my heart for xbox, my brain come up with this idea and i think&nbsp;its a good idea, good money, good game that people would play and prolly hit platium hits or game of the&nbsp;year
 since pokemon&nbsp;WAS so popular back in the day so i know i read alot of&nbsp;post on&nbsp;other website talkin&nbsp;about it, and&nbsp;they all said no nintendo&nbsp;owns all right, but never got an idea for it so i figure if i post my idea on here and get this post rolling maybe they'll
 see it and try to work it out. so tell me what you think guys and girls&nbsp;since girls are progressive popping up on xbox over the last few years cuz of cod lol &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Yes, lets discuss this. &nbsp;I want Pokemon. &nbsp;If enough people talk about it, it will happen. &nbsp;After we solve the Pokemon problem, let us discuss world peace. &nbsp;If you can get Pokemon on Xbox, world peace will be just as easy.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>Maybe MS should just make a rip-off. &nbsp;Instead of using Pokemon you can use Poke...men. &nbsp;There are many typed of Pokemen. &nbsp;Mexicans, Asians, Gingers, junkies, etc... &nbsp;</p>

 all my files are there. Help!

<h2>            Frequent App crashing, and BSOD&#39;s.</h2>
                    <p>Hello, I have this issue now for 3 days and I have been trying to troubleshoot, I even contacted microsoft chat support and had a remote session, but they couldn't fix it, I'm still waiting for another session from a higher level of support, but it seems
 that they already know about the issue, just unable to provide a direct solution for what is happening.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
I have a lot of error's and warning from Event Viewer.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<br />
=====This is just one of em:<br />
<br />
</p>
<div>The application-specific permission settings do not grant Local Activation permission for the COM Server application with CLSID&nbsp;</div>

====Then also this:<br />
<br />
The server {A463FCB9-6B1C-4E0D-A80B-A2CA7999E25D} did not register with DCOM within the required timeout.<br />
<br />

<br />

<p><br />
====And more examples:<br />

<br />
</p>

            Hi Jericho.  I'm Greg, an installation specialist and 9 year Windows MVP, here to help you.  
<br />
<br />1) Reset all Store apps using Option One,  or the specific appsb that are not working from Option Two here:  <a href="http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re-register-windows-8-10-a.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://www.tenforums.com/tutorials/3175-apps-re...</a>
<br />
<br />2) Go over this checklist to make sure the install is set up correctly, optimized for best performance, and any needed repairs get done:  <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-performance/windows-10-performance-and-install-integrity/75529fd4-fac7-4653-893a-dd8cd4b4db00">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a>
<br />
<br />Start with Step 4 to turn off Startup freeloaders which can conflict and cause issues, then Step 7 to check for infection the most thorough way, then step 10 to check for damaged System Files.  Then continue with the other steps to go over your install most thoroughly.  
<br />
<br />3)  Update your drivers from the PC or motherboard maker's Support Downloads web page, using the full model number, Serial Number or Dell Service Tag on sticker.  Compare the latest drivers available for download with the ones presently installed in Device Manager reached by right clicking the Start Menu.  Make sure you have the latest BIOS or UEFI firmware, Chipset, Display (Video), Sound, USB3, Bluetooth, Network and all other drivers, or else download and install the latest now.
<br />
<br />4) If this was caused by October Version 1809 update (which you can confirm at Settings &gt; System &gt; About) then you can roll back Version 1809 in Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Recovery and then hide it until it matures using the Hide Updates Tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />If this was caused by Windows Update(s) then you can check which were installed at Settings&gt;Update &amp; Security&gt;Windows Update under Installed Updates, then uninstall them from the link there, and hide with the Hide Updates tool downloaded from here:  <a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f22d5fdb-59cd-4275-8c95-1be17bf70b21/wushowhide.diagcab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://download.microsoft.com/download/f/2/2/f2...</a>
<br />
<br />You can also use System Restore to get before the problem began, then check for Updates with the Hide Update tool and hide them:  <a href="http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-to-fix-windows-10-problems-with-system-restore-11364008291943" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://home.bt.com/tech-gadgets/computing/how-t...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />5) If nothing else helps you can run a Repair Install by installing the Media Creation Tool and choosing from it to Upgrade Now.  This reinstalls Windows in about an hour while saving your files, apps and most settings, solves many problems while also bringing it up to the latest version 1809 which you need anyway and by the most stable method.   <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/media-creation-tool-install" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/m...</a>
<br />
<br />
<br />--------------------------------------------
<br />
<br />But remember that in Windows 10 everything depends upon the quality of the install, and Factory or Upgrade installs are inferior installs which most enthusiasts won't even run because they'd expect endless issues. Consider now or later doing the Clean Install in this link which compiles the best possible install that will stay that way as long as you stick with the tools and methods given: <a href="http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki/windows_10-windows_install/clean-reinstall-windows-10-upgradefactory-oem/1c426bdf-79b1-4d42-be93-17378d93e587">http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wiki...</a> 
<br />
<br />There is also an automated Fresh Start that reinstalls WIndows while shedding corrupting factory bloatware, saves your files, but doesn't clear the drive to get it cleanest:  <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-reinstall-windows-10-without-the-bloatware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">https://www.howtogeek.com/265054/how-to-easily-...</a>
<br />
<br />I hope this helps.  Feel free to ask back any questions and let us know how it goes.  I will keep working with you until it's resolved.

            Hi Jericho, to diagnose the underlying issue, I need to analyse your Mini-dump file(s):
<br />
<br />Open Windows File Explorer
<br />
<br />Navigate to C:\Windows\Minidump
<br />
<br />Zip up the contents of that folder
<br />
<br />If you have problems zipping those files, copy them out onto your Desktop and zip them from there
<br />
<br />Upload the zip file to the Cloud (OneDrive, DropBox . . . etc.)
<br />
<br />Then post a link here to the zip file, so we can take a look for you . . .

            other answer link tl;dr condensed:<br />
<br />
step one: <br />
- visit PC Mfg. support and drivers site<br />
- verify system has downgrade driver support for previous OS versions <br />
- - if drivers not available, tough beans return the system and get a different system, or suffer with winders 10<br />
- - if downgrade drivers available, proceed to step two<br />
<br />
step two:<br />
- download drivers<br />
- save on external USB disk <br />
- purchase new HDD / SSD<br />
- - this will be required for the warranty period because any RMA must include the OEM components and the OEM supplied OS<br />
- remove original HDD / SSD <br />
- install new blank HDD / SSD<br />
- boot the system and enter BIOS / UEFI<br />
- - disable secure boot (if enabled)<br />
- - change boot order to CD/DVD first<br />
- insert win 7 disc in CD/DVD drive<br />
- exit BIOS / UEFI saving changes<br />
- install win 7 <br />
- attach USB disk with the drivers and continue the install<br />
<br />
step three:<br />
- after install proceed with <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_7-update/windows-7-update-solution/f39a65fa-9d10-42e7-9bc0-7f5096b36d0c">

            <p>Instead of downgrading, I would also recommend dual booting as an option, if its just to run a select application not compatible with Windows 10.</p>

<h2>            USB-C 3 Thunderbolt port on Asus ZenBook Pro won&#39;t cooperate with devices</h2>
                    <p>Laptop:&nbsp;Asus ZenBook Pro ux501vw ds71t</p>
<p>Problem:</p>
<p>I need to connect a firewire audio interface to this computer. It did not come with firewire ports. It has three USB3.0 ports, HDMI port, mic/headphones jack, SD card reader, and Thunderbolt 3 via USB Type-C. I was advised that thunderbolt can be adapted
 to firewire. I bought the Apple adapters (no one else, it appears, makes these adapters). I bought the usb-c to thunderbolt 2, and connected the thunderbolt 2-to-firewire to that, and then ran the firewire audio interface into that.</p>
<p>At first, the USB-C port wasn't even recognized by Windows so I updated the firmware and activated the port. Once that was done I plugged in the first adapter and got an error message saying the device may be incompatible and may not work properly. In Device
 Manager the screen keeps on refreshing.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Anyone encounter then solve this problem?</p>

            <p>Hi Larry,</p>
<p>
</p><p>The issue usually occurs due to incompatibility and this is likewise of that in the error message.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>To fully understand and to be able to come up with an effective resolution, we would like to have a screenshot of the exact error message. Also, have you done any configurations/modifications prior to the issue?</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, try to connect the&nbsp;<strong>FireWire Audio Interface</strong> (the one in question) to other computers, or connect other FireWire Audio Interfaces to your
<strong>Asus ZenBook Pro</strong>. This will help us determine where the issue occurs.</p>
<p>

            <p>Hello John.</p>
<p>Thanks for the reply.</p>
<p>The error message only happened when I updated the firmware. The port was inactive at first and when it came online and when I plugged it "saw" the adapter that first time, that's when I got the error message and I haven't seen it since.</p>
<p>Now. Here's how I fixed the issue...</p>
<p>When I bought the ZenBook I was told by the salesman (Micro Center) that all of the drivers were up to date and that any firmware had been updated to current versions. When the Asus Tech Support rep had me to update the firmware I then realized that I might
 want to take a look at everything else since the version installed was from 2015. I looked at all of the drivers, etc. and compared them to the dates of the versions on the Asus site and every single one of them were the very first versions used on the system
 except for maybe three. I updated all of the drivers and firmware and still no audio. Then, because I run the bigger version of that interface in the main studio rack I wondered if, like the bigger one, I needed to connect the power adapter to it. When I connected
 it to the main DAW it got power from the firewire port so I thought that would be the case with the laptop. When I plugged it up in the wall it still did not fire up. I cycled power and tried again, still no audio.</p>
<p>I called Asus back. The guy told me to call Apple. I called Apple and the lady told me to call Microsoft. I called Microsoft and was told to call Asus. So, I put all their **** on conference call together and told them all to tell each other what they'd
 all been telling me, and to somehow amidst the argument get together to help me get full use of the $1,600 laptop that I had purchased for a very specific purpose. While they were going back and forth, I was sitting listening to them while at the same time
 plugging up and unplugging the adapter in the USB-C port. In and out. In and out...</p>
<p>For whatever reason, Asus put plastic wrap inside the port. Or Apple did. Not sure which. I had stopped pluggin in and removing the adapter because I noticed that it had gotten looser when putting it in and taking it out. Instinctively I looked into the
 port and there was a little piece of plastic hanging out. I got tweazers and pulled out the rest of it.</p>
<p>As soon as I plugged it in the M-Audio ProFire 610 fired right up.</p>
<p>I thanked the agents on the phone and hung up. I started to ask why anyone would put plastic inside this tiny port but I didn't really want to know.</p>
<p>So. It was partly the plastic and partly the fact that the I should have followed my Computer Science training (even if it is from the late 1990s) by being a responsible computer owner and updating the bios, drivers, and firmware and maybe even running Windows
 Update instead of trusting the salesman. He almost made me move on to another salesman. I was in the store no more than 10 minutes, 5 of which he spent trying to sell me the computer. I kept butting in saying, "I want this one. Go get it from the back so I
 can leave." but he kept telling me what the specs were and all that. I was like, dude... Didn't you hear what I said?! I already had researched and picked this computer because the resources profile told me I could run Avid Pro Tools &amp; Media Composer with
 no problems; that I could use vMix without a hitch. I knew why I was there.</p>
<p>I will be relying on this computer to conduct my first live remote IPTV broadcast in the morning. Three full HD Panasonic TV cameras as well as audio with the M-Audio. I'm going for it, BIG TIME! Six lossless audio sources, three HD video sources. I've tested
 it all out in the hot Texas sun and there wasn't one glitch, not one dropped frame. If this shoot is successful I will swear by the ZenBook, the ProFire interface, Windows 10, and vMix Pro.</p>

<h2>            Constant BSOD &#91;DRIVER_CORRUPTED_EXPOOL &#47; KERNEL_SECURITY_CHECK_FAILURE&#93;</h2>
                    <p>Greetings.<br />
<br />
I am having multiple instances of BSOD in the last months and mostly when the computer is on light duties like playing videos from YouTube or even simply browsing. Most of them are KERNEL_SECURITY_CHECK_FAILURE, though - DRIVER_CORRUPTED_EXPOOL appears but
 not that much. It started right when I installed Visual Studio and updated my BIOS - but even when I reverted my BIOS back to its old state the computer kept crashing. I also have a major problem with my gaming mouse (mouhid.sys appears a lot in the logs).</p>
<p><br />
I used BlueScreenViewer and it absolutely doesn't show me a driver (other than ntoskrnl.sys). The dumps can be seen&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/256r5f85vytv1hr/070617-28156-01.zip?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="07/06 BSOD">here</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/kqhhi5l76lu847k/070717-30890-01.zip?dl=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow" title="07/07 BSOD">here</a>.

OS Windows 10 Home<br />

<p>The one minidump file (DRIVER_CORRUPTED_EXPOOL) showed a possible conflict&nbsp;between the wsftprp64.sys and the klif.sys.</p>
<p>
</p><p>A Kaspersky process (avp.exe) was the process that crashed.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The wsftprp64.sys is a driver for G-Buster Browser Defense and the klif.sys is a Kaspersky driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I would suggest to update or, if necessary, uninstall the G-Buster Browser Defense software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If you have issues updating or uninstalling the G-Buster Browser Defense software&nbsp;or the&nbsp;crashes persist&nbsp;contact the issuer of this software which may be a&nbsp;Brazil&nbsp;bank.</p>
<p>
</p><p>There also appears to be Networx installed. The Networx driver, networx.sys, has been known to cause BSODs in certain setups so you may also want to update or uninstall the&nbsp;Networx software.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The other minidump file (KERNEL_SECURITY_CHECK_FAILURE)&nbsp;showed a potential issue with graphics so try uninstalling and reinstalling each graphics driver.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, uninstall any third party driver for the mouse.</p>

            <p>This may solve your problem: If you mean you can not play DVD video's'</p>
<p>Windows 8 does not natively support DVD video playback, you need to install a 3rd party player, such as:</p>

</strong>Drivers could be at fault however disk issues or antivirus/antispyware/security

products are&nbsp;just as likely to be the root cause as they can force a driver to <br />
corrupt or go out of bounds.&nbsp;The video driver or something affecting it would <br />
be very suspect.<br />

<p>This utility makes it easy to see which versions are loaded : Run DriverView&nbsp;-&nbsp;set
<br />
VIEW to Hide&nbsp; Microsoft drivers -&nbsp;update those without Dump in their names. <br />
(Also update the BIOS and low level chipset drivers.)<br />
<br />
DriverView - Free -&nbsp;utility displays the list of all device drivers currently loaded
<br />
on your system. For each driver in the list, additional useful information is <br />
displayed: load address of the driver,&nbsp;description, version, product name, <br />
company that created the driver, and more.<br />
<a href="http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span style="color: rgba(0, 114, 198, 1)">http://www.nirsoft.net/utils/driverview.html</span></a><br />
&nbsp;<br />
For Drivers check System Maker as fallbacks and Device Maker's which are the <br />
most&nbsp;current. Control Panel - Device Manager - Display Adapter - write down <br />
the make and&nbsp;complete model of your video adapter - double click - Driver's <br />
tab - write down the&nbsp;version info. Now click UPdate Driver (this may not do <br />
anything as MS is far behind&nbsp;certifying drivers) - then Right Click - Uninstall -
<br />
REBOOT this will refresh the driver&nbsp;stack.<br />
<br />
Repeat that for Network - Network Card (NIC), Wifi, Sound, Mouse and Keyboard<br />
if&nbsp;3rd party with their own software and drivers and any other major device drivers
<br />
you&nbsp;have.<br />
<br />
Now go to System Maker's site (Dell, HP, Toshiba as examples)&nbsp;(as rollback) and<br />
then&nbsp;Device Maker's site (Realtek, Intel, Nvidia, ATI as examples) and get their <br />
latest versions.&nbsp;(Look for BIOS, Chipset,&nbsp;and software updates at System Maker's <br />
site while there.)<br />
<br />
Download - SAVE - go to where you put them&nbsp;- Right Click - RUN AD ADMIN - <br />
REBOOT&nbsp;after each installation.<br />
<br />
Always check in Device Manager - Drivers tab to be sure the version you are <br />
installing&nbsp;actually shows up. This is because some drivers rollback before the <br />
latest is installed&nbsp;(sound drivers particularly do this) so install a driver - reboot
<br />
- check to be sure it is&nbsp;installed and repeat as needed.<br />
<br />
Repeat at Device Makers - BTW at&nbsp;Device&nbsp;Makers DO NOT RUN THEIR SCANNER - <br />
heck manually by model.<br />
<br />
Manually look at manufacturer's sites for drivers - and Device Maker's sites.<br />

<br />
Memory tests do not catch all errors such as mismatched memory (possible even <br />
for sticks&nbsp;that appear to be identical) and when faster memory is placed in system
<br />
behind slower memory.&nbsp;So it is best to also swap sticks in and out to check for <br />
those even if all memory tests fail to&nbsp;show a problem.<br />
<br />
To test RAM check here - let it run 4+ hours or so.&nbsp; <strong>&lt;-- best method<br />

Hope this helps. <br />

            <p>Hi,<br />
</p>
<p>That does not take as long as you think and is prudent for drivers that may be involved.<br />
For many you can just install the updated version if available. (And only for the drivers found using Driver View as indicated above.<br />

You will need to reinstall the original version of Windows that you had installed prior to upgrading to Windows 8.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If didn't have a qualifying version, you need the full version license:</p>
<span>
<p>There are no full retail versions of Windows 8. If you need a full version, you will need to purchase the Windows 8 Pro OEM from New Egg. This requires a custom clean install.</p>

<p><strong>Doing a Custom Install</strong></p>
<p>Using the custom install option allows you to reinstall your original copy of Windows while preserving your personal data by moving it to the Windows.old folder. Of course, you will need to reinstall your applications and hardware drivers. To begin, retrieve
 your installation disc for your copy of Windows and make sure you have the product key.</p>
<ul>
<li>Boot to the Windows 8 desktop.</li><li>Insert your Windows 7, Vista or XP disc</li><li>Click Install Now (Windows XP users, please restart from the installation or recovery disc).</li></ul>
<p>To learn how to change your BIOS options to boot from the DVD drive, see the following tutorial:<br />
<a href="http://notebooks.com/2011/05/05/how-to-load-bios-and-change-boot-configuration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">http://notebooks.com/2011/05/05/how-to-load-bios-and-change-boot-configuration/</a></p>
<p><strong>If you have an RTM disc</strong></p>
<p>If you have the original RTM disc for Windows 7 or Vista, you can download an updated disc with Windows 7 SP1 or Vista SP1 integrated. This should at least take some of the load off when it comes installing post SP1 updates or Service Pack 2 for Vista.</p>
<p><strong>Download the corresponding edition of Windows 7 you have a license for from the following link. You can identify the edition on the COA sticker attached to your machine, at the bottom or within the battery compartment (laptop) or top/side if its
 a desktop computer.</strong><br />

<p>Unfortunately, Windows XP users will need to get a hold of a genuine copy of Windows XP with SP3 disc. It should not be hard to get one, but will require that you look for one if you can’t find yours.</p>
<p><strong>If Windows came preinstalled on your computer.</strong></p>
<p>If Windows XP, Vista or Windows 7 came with your computer, this might be a bit tricky depending on the version of Windows you are running and the options you selected during the installation of the Windows 8 preview. I have noticed that installing later
 versions of Windows can sometimes render a recovery partition inoperable.</p>
<p>Some computers that come preinstalled with Windows often have what is called a recovery partition. This is used to reinstall the operating system in the event of a system crash. To access it, you will need to boot into it when you start your computer by
 pressing a function key. This can be either F1, F2, F9, F10, F11, F12 or even DEL or Tab key. Consult the owners manual that came with your PC for instructions about how to reinstall Windows.</p>
<p><strong>This is how the recovery partition is accessed for the most popular computer brands:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For Dell, press CTRL + F11 directly after powering up the unit.</li><li>For HP, press F11 directly after powering up the unit</li><li>For Toshiba, press and hold ’0′ BEFORE and during the power up</li><li>For Acer, press and hold ALT + F10 as soon as you see the logo.</li><li>For Samsung: Tap the F4 Key at the Samsung logo when you first power on.</li><li>For Asus, press F9 as soon as you see the Asus logo.</li><li>For Advent, restart your computer. Then Press F10 repeatedly until the message “Starting System Recovery” is displayed</li><li>Lenovo <a href="http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/document.do?lndocid=MIGR-4HWSE3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www-307.ibm.com/pc/support/site.wss/document.do?lndocid=MIGR-4HWSE3</a><br />
Lenovo notebooks include a feature called the Lenovo OneKey Recovery button, which is used to boot into the Recovery Environment and reinstall Windows.</li></ul>
<p>If your recovery partition happens to be damaged, then you will need to use the link to download the corresponding edition of Windows you have a license for and use the product on you COA sticker. Again, Windows XP users will need to borrow a disc or likely
 use the recovery discs that came with your system.</p>
<p><strong>Doing the Custom Install</strong></p>
<p>A custom install allows you to reinstall Windows without actually formatting the hard disk.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/image1.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f12%2fimage_thumb1.png%3fw%3d495%26amp%3bh%3d373" /></a></p>
<p>You can Start the installation from within Windows 8 preview. Click
<strong>Install Now. </strong></p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/image2.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f12%2fimage_thumb2.png%3fw%3d495%26amp%3bh%3d371" /></a></p>

<p>An important warning will appear on screen, click OK</p>

<p>Windows will now begin the installation process.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/image9.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f12%2fimage_thumb9.png%3fw%3d488%26amp%3bh%3d366" /></a></p>
<p>When installation is complete, setup your user account and password.</p>
<p><strong>Recovering your personal files</strong></p>
<p>Now the important part of doing this will be recovering your personal files. To do that, browse to the root of the drive where Windows is installed, normally C:\. There you will see a folder called Windows.old</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/image10.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f12%2fimage_thumb10.png%3fw%3d436%26amp%3bh%3d280" /></a></p>
<p>In this folder you will find your old User folder with all your personal folders for Documents, Pictures, Music, Videos etc. You can copy the contents from within each folder and paste them into your respective personal folders in Windows 7.</p>
<p><a href="http://techingiteasy.files.wordpress.com/2012/12/image11.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2ftechingiteasy.files.wordpress.com%2f2012%2f12%2fimage_thumb11.png%3fw%3d463%26amp%3bh%3d359" /></a></p>
<p>After you have copied over your data, you can delete the folder if you wish. This is just the basics though and you might have other data stored elsewhere that you need to recover from the Windows.old folder such as email or even your iTunes
 Library.</p>
