<span>Your question is more complex than what is typically answered in the Microsoft Answers forums. It is better suited for the Windows Server on TechNet forum</span><span><br />

<h2>            Status Code&#58; 4099-0000-0080-0300-8007-0570</h2>
                    
<p>I've been experiencing the error code posted in the topic (4099-0000-0080-0300-8007-0570) for several MONTHS now. It's been really frustrating because it's unlike the codes I normally see in the forums because it's only numbers, no letters. There's only
 one other instance I've found where someone posted the same code and another person mentioned having it.</p>
<p>http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_forums/xbox_support/xbox_360_support/f/9/p/1646766/4350065.aspx</p>
<p>My Xbox cannot receive any update from Xbox Live and can't even connect. I've tried literally every solution suggested on the support site for network connections (clearing the system cache, restoring to factory network settings, etc.) Nothing has worked
 for me and I can't figure out what is wrong.</p>
<p>Every time I try to connect to Live, it says an update is required in order to connect. I press ok and almost as soon as the update starts, it says the update failed and that I need to check my network connection and the error code appears. My network connection
 and my internet are not the problem because they work fine.</p>
<p>It was working fine back in November 2013. I don't know if the December update messed it up or what, but I know I can't solve it.</p>
<p>The worst part is that now my Kinect won't even work. It says and update is required in order to&nbsp;connect but every time I try&nbsp;to do so the above scenario I explained occurs. Now my whole family has to deal with over $400 of now useless games because of something
 I have no control over and don't know how to fix or have been given any support or explanation for.
</p>
<p>I'm not going to send it in for an $80+ repair for something I feel was caused by Microsoft and Xbox. I'm also not going to shell out $200+ for a new console. It works fine in every other aspect&nbsp;except for the fact I can't connect to Live. If anyone could
 help me figure out what is wrong with my Xbox or what I can do to fix it and solve whatever is wrong with it that would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Hey there&nbsp;macoloco81, this thread is bit old and the original poster hasn't come back in a while. If you'd like to receive assistance cratered specifically to you from our community, I would suggest creating a new thread detailing what you're experiencing.
 Thanks so much!</p>

<p>Hi all, just seeing if anyone knows how to fix this code. I have never played my xbox online and wanted to try last years FIFA13, when i put it, a system update message came up saying i needed to update my console in order to play the game. So I started
 the update, when half way through the update freezes and the Status code&nbsp;STATUS CODE:- 22FB-3CD6-B800-0402-C000-0001 appears. It tells me to contact www.xbox.com/support. I have looked up my code and cannot find anything. I have spoken to XBOX and a staff
 member named Eric has told me that it could be one of two things. I have either been banned from XBOX Live or i have tryed to modify my system and i am no longer aloud to play anymore. Firstly I have never attempted to join/play Xbox Live, and i wouldnt know
 where to start to even try and modify my console. Any ideas would be great.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Try this:</p>
<p>Your console had a problem during the update process. Carefully follow these steps:</p>
<p>Remove any disc from the console.</p>
<p>Leave the disc tray open.</p>
<p>With the disc tray open, remove the power cord from the back of the console.</p>
<p>Plug the power cord back into the console. Do not turn the console on yet.</p>
<p>Gently push the disc tray about half-way back into the console.</p>
<p>Push the power button on the console.</p>
<p>Important: Do not use the controller button or the disc tray eject button to turn on the console for this step.</p>
<p>The update should now continue. If the above steps do not work, the console might need to be repaired. This worked for me, I hope this helps you.</p>

    <title>copy newer file over older file - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> bernardwotton  say:</h3>
<h2>            copy newer file over older file</h2>
                    How do I copy a <strong>newer version </strong>of a file over an <em>older version
</em>of <strong><em>same </em></strong>file? It used to copy and replace automatically in Windows prior to Windows 10. Now I have to
<strong>delete the older file first</strong>, then copy the newer file to folder. Is there a fix or setting for this huge problem. (At first I didn't notice what was going on. I was updating my website files, but noticed that no changes were taking place when
 refreshing the browser to see the results of my editing the HTML files. Then I noticed when I copied a file from 1 folder window to the main folder window of my website files, the newer file was not being copied over the older file. Why? Basically the newer
 file was NOT being copied at all —unless I deleted the older version first.&nbsp; WHY ??

            <p>When you upload a file to your web server that hosts your website, that file automatically overwrites the file name by the same filename; that is the way it is set up to behave. I was duplicating the same thing between two opened folder windows. I'm using
 Dreamweaver, and notice that it was saving the file to a default folder, but not to the folder I wanted it saved in. So I opened both folders to copy from a default folder to another folder with same file names as the default folder. When I copied, say index.html
 from a default folder to the other folder, I was expecting that newer file to overwrite the older file by same name. It did not overwrite the older file. Nothing happened. I didn't realize that nothing was happening at first, and was getting frustrated as
 to why the web page was not being updated with the newest editing I had done to the file on my computer after uploading it by hand. I presently am using a new host which is free, but can't use Dreamweaver to upload files as on my main website, but have to
 open the host cPanel and upload from that, and upload only one file at a time, so it is time-wise slow in doing that process.I tried quite a few times trying to upload the correct file, but refreshing browser saw no changes in that file. Finally I narrowed
 it down to the two folders on my laptop hard drive. If I deleted the older index.html file, then copied the newer index.html file to that other folder, then uploaded that file, all was well and good. I saw the changes in the browser when I refreshed it. I
 have not been using Windows 10 too long, so I don't know about the correct answers to your 4 questions.</p>
<p><strong>1. Do you get any pop up message while replacing the old file?</strong> &nbsp;NO. I just recently, after contacting you folks, changed the default setting in the (Trash Can) Recycle Bin properties, and CHECKED "Display delete confirmation dialog". &nbsp;That
 has been bugging me ever since I started using Windows 10: no Confirmation when deleting a file, for I could very well accidentally delete a good file not knowing that I had deleted it, since no confirmation box ever popped up alerting me that I was deleting
 a file; so I have to be very careful and deliberate when deleting any files. Now the Confirmation box pops up when I'm about to delete a file, and I can decide what to do about that file. I went online and Googled "no confirmation when deleting file in Windows
 10" and found my answer, for which I'm very thankful.. And since then, I've been trying to reproduce the same items, and NO, no pop-up message of any kind when trying to copy newer file over the older file. Just plain nothing happens.<br />
<strong>2. Does this issue occur only with HTML file?</strong> I do not know. I usually only use other programs copy/paste facilities when doing this. I have no problem generally when just copying files from 1 folder to another folder, using 2 opened folder
 windows. But I'm not generally overwriting other files by the same filename. Windows 10 is acting differently in this respect, somehow.<br />
<strong>3. Did you tried copying in different location? </strong>No. Now, I am. Yes. The older file is 8 KB, the newer file is 9 KB. The newer file of 9KB is NOT overwriting the older file of 8 KB. I'm using my mouse to move the file, then press Ctrl Key to
 Copy file before I let go of mouse button. I've tried it quite a few times, and each time checked it in the browser. The 9 KB file has a much larger Title then the 8 KB file, is how I can tell if it is the same file, or a different one. Other words, it is
 NOT copying the newer file over the older file. Why? WHY?? I'm not trying this out with any other types of files, be too long trying to set up to experiment with. One file copied should overwrite, replace the other file with same name, right? Always has in
 the past, or else some dialog box comes up asking if I want to keep both files, and renames the older file, so nothing is lost —this may be how the MacBook Apple works, I forget. Anyways, Windows should be similar, or has been in the past. I do NOT want to
 MOVE the file, just copy it to a different folder, but it is not copying, not doing anything I guess. When I open each file in a browser, the file being copied is NOT in that differnet folder. Why? I have to delete the older file in the other folder FIRST,
 —THEN copy the newer file to the other folder. That is a hassle, and very error-prone in maybe deleting the good file, instead of the not-wanted file...<br />
<strong>4. Did you make any changes to the computer prior to the issue? </strong>
NO. I have no control over Windows Updates anymore; they are downloaded automatically, and installed, which I HATE very much, for example, the other night I was getting ready to go to bed, was very tired, and closed down Windows, and then it said something
 about, Do not turn off computer, for it was getting Windows ready to install updates. I perfer to install Windows updates on MY &nbsp;OWN &nbsp;TIME, when I have time, not when it's ready to go to Church, or go to work, etc. So I had to wait around until it did its
 thing, then close computer down, and unplug the whole system like I always do when not using laptop. No, I have not installed anything new lately, nor adjusted any settings recently, especially anything related to saving files. I would have to go online and
 research into that area. In fact, I did go online and tried to find anything concerning this problem I'm having, but found nothing that applied, so that is the reason I contacted you folks in the first place. I have been working with computers since 1985 thereabouts,
 Timex Sinclair, Commodore, Amiga, then IBM pc type which is what most people use today; I also have a MacBook Pro 17, that is not working as of now, so am back to using the PC. I'm not new to using PC, nor windows; my first Windows PC was Windows 3.1, skipped
 95, since 98 was already out, and have used them all since Win98 up to Win10.<br />

            <strong>1. Do you get any pop up message while replacing the old file?</strong> &nbsp;Well, well, I am now. I guess the pop-up message was HIDDEN behind all the other opened windows that I did not see it. And I guess when I closed the folder windows down, the
 pop-up box went away too, for I <strong>never saw</strong> them until just now. I had fewer windows opened right now, and was moving windows around when I saw the "Replace or Skip Files" pop-up box with three options: Replace the file in the destination<br />
Skip this file<br />
Compare info for both files<br />
If that box was opened just before I contacted you folks the first time, I don't know. Those kinds of dialog boxes are supposed to pop-up
<strong>in front of</strong> opened windows, instead of staying <em><strong>hidden</strong></em>. Now that box is popping-up in front of folder window. So I guess the problem is fixed. Is it fixed because the Delete Confimation box is turned on also? Or is
 it that I just noticed the pop-up when I moved some windows around? Why is it now popping-up in front of the folder windows, like it is suppose to do? That is how Windows in the past acted. Thank goodness it is still working like that. From now on, I will
 be on the lookout for those kinds of message boxes. Is there a setting to make them always pop-up in front of other opened windows? Thanks.<br />

 the file in the destination" folder. When I closed the two folder window, the pop-up message box also closed, so at that time, I never saw the message, so as to be able to do something that I wanted done. It was only at a later date when I moved some windows
 around some that I SAW the&nbsp;pop-up message asking me what to do. I'm on the lookout now for those messages, and keep a small gap between the windows so if it does not come to the front, I can click on it, then respond to it correctly. Any ways, thanks for the
 forum where I could vent my frustrations at &nbsp;trying to copy/paste files... Bernard.

<h2>            Gamer pic wont update</h2>
                    I seem to be having the same problem as others. I updated my gamer pic (&amp; personal pic) ages ago, seems forever, and it still hasn't updated on my friends profiles or leader boards. My better half, he has a profile on the same console, has the same problem.
 I've searched for an answer but all I can find is “it takes time”, how much time are we talking about! Please help as this is really bugging me. Also, I like to use my gamer pic as my windows live profile picture. Is there a better way I can get a copy other
 than zooming in, screen print, copying into paint and messing about in picture editor?

<p>There appears to be a lot of finger-problems lately!</p>
<p>1. Hold down Ctrl and Alt and press one of the four arrow keys (up, down, left or right) to correct it.</p>
<p>2. Alternatively, you may have a Rotation setting in the display properties of the graphics card.</p>
<p>3. Or try restoring the system to an earlier date.</p>

<div>The ability to rotate the screen image is a feature of your video </div>

<div>orientation. Almost certainly you accidentally pressed Ctrl-Alt, and</div>
<div>some arrow key. </div>

<div>Rotate it back using those keys. </div>

<p>Go to control panel display properties and if you can find screen rotation to 180 degree set it to 0 (zero) degree</p>

    <title>Scratched redeem code - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> minorcrawdad802  say:</h3>
<h2>            Scratched redeem code</h2>
                    I would like to know if there is a way to find out what letters and numbers are used in making the redeem codes. My son scratched through over half of the code and customer support said they cannot help. The system is brand new and came with 4 games, 2
 of which had to be downloaded, of which 1 he scratched! I find it hard to believe that they cannot help in this situation, even with barcodes and verification of whom they are talking to.

<p>Same situation for me. The scratching mechanism is really terrible, difficult to scratch with a coin or a nail.</p>
<p>From my point of view , the cost for Microsoft to resolve this kind of issue (to provide a code for a service not used) is much less than all the revenue that we will not generate for them moving to other platforms that do not have such a horrible ways to
 provide the codes.</p>
<p>I hope that they resolve in the future for the sake of future customers.</p>

<p>That's because they cannot check the code unless it is entered </p>

<p>All codes are unique nor can they be read until activated that's why you cannot just tell someone the code</p>
<p>43this is with all scratch cards its a safety mechinicism</p>
<p>Your only other option will be to use a kinect or qr scanner like kinect or windows phone</p>

<p>I'm at the point where I'm filing a class action suit against microsoft and there bull over these cards that get easily scratched off by kids. There is no warnig instructing parents to not allow the kids to scratch off the serial numbers because they are
 so delicate kids can easily erase the numbers making the card void. Please don't throw your cards away because you will need them to join this suit and provide proof that Microsoft is ripping off not only adults but unsuspecting kids.</p>

<p>There are a few countries where landlines and cellphones are the same. The United States is one of those. That is why your can call both landlines and cellphones in the US. With Skype all calls travel via the internet so distance is meaningless.</p>

            <span>Hi Cohen,</span><span>&nbsp; </span>
<p>
</p><p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Community.</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s see how I can help you today.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span>Based in your information, I would like to inform you that PowerShell command is a scripting language which
</span><span><span>let you manage the computers from the command line. Windows PowerShell
</span><em><span>providers</span></em><span> let you access data stores, such as the registry and certificate store, as easily as you access the file system. In addition, Windows PowerShell has a rich expression parser and a fully developed scripting language.
 Where as </span></span><span>Command Prompt helps you type and run MS‑DOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System) commands and other computer commands. By typing commands, you can perform tasks on your PC without using a mouse or touch. Command Prompt is typically
 only used by advanced users. </span></span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span><span><span>Hope this information is helpful for you. If you need further assistance on windows let us know, we will be glad to help you.

            <p><span>Hi,</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>Please be inform that Windows PowerShell is usually used by professionals and expert, whereas Command prompt is for limited users.
</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>PowerShell is actually very different from the Command Prompt. It uses different commands, known as cmdlets in PowerShell. Many system administration tasks — from managing the registry to WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) — are exposed via PowerShell
 cmdlets, while they aren’t accessible from the Command Prompt. It isn’t just a shell you use. It’s a powerful scripting environment that can be used to create complex scripts for managing Windows systems much more easily than you could with the Command Prompt.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>The Command Prompt is essentially just a legacy environment carried forward in Windows — an environment that copies all of the various DOS commands you would find on a DOS system. It is painfully limited, can’t access many Windows system administration
 features, is more difficult to compose complex scripts with, and so on. PowerShell is a new environment for Windows system administrators that allows them to use a more modern command-line environment to manage Windows.</span></p>

            <p>thank u for the reply Billion, i really appreciate that :-)</p>
<p>but again...u gave an info that i already know :-)</p>
<p>im a Network SysAdmin and Linux guy in years, i already know that :-)</p>
<p>u missing the point behind my questions, so let me refine my questions again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1. when the devs have created the PowerShell for the 1st time, they based it on Command Prompt?</p>
<p>they actually took the Command Prompt idea, and made him a drastic changes?</p>
<p>or they have created the Powershell with no any connection to Command Prompt?</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>2.&nbsp;<span style="color: rgba(51, 51, 51, 1)">why do we need two separate shells on Windows system? if PowerShell can do the same things that the Command Prompt can do, and more, then why does Microsoft didn't kills the Command Prompt for good?</span></p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>PS: my questions r not a technical questions about PowerShell as a tool and what he can do, my question r more at the developing side.<br />
what the devs did, when they created the PowerShell for the 1st time?&nbsp;from where they took the base, from Command Prompt?<br />

<p>Hey Shizu,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting on the forums today! I'd be happy to help.</p>
<p>
</p><p>First I would like to clarify what device is this on? Xbox One or Windows 10? It'll help to know so we can see what steps to try.</p>
<p>
</p><p>When downloading does it stop close to completion or does it just stop at 100% hence the infinite download? What does it say on the download screen?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Let us know so we can further help you.</p>

<p>Hello Shizu</p>
<p>
</p><p>Sorry to here about the issue with downloading game. When it started at 0% again, could it&nbsp;have been the update for the game? If it was still the game installation, try powering off the PC totally like a hard shut down. When you turn back on sign out and
 back into the Xbox App once you sign in try to install game again.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Hope this helps, let us know.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thanks</p>

    <title>Rise of the Tomb Raider achievement unlocking issue - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> mikemannuh  say:</h3>
<h2>            Rise of the Tomb Raider achievement unlocking issue</h2>
                    
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I have had an achievement for Rise of the Tomb Raider (Xbox One) stuck on 'Done! Unlocking' since January 13th. The achievement name is "Challenging" (<span>Complete any Challenge Tomb)</span>. I am positive I have met the requirements
 for this achievement as I DID unlock the "Tomb Raider" achievement (<span>Complete all Challenge Tombs in one playthrough). Obviously waiting 72 hours did not help and also redownloading my profile did nothing. When I redownload my profile it remembers this
 achievement is stuck on 'Done! Unlocking'.</span></p>
<p><span>This has happened before with other achievements, mostly during times when Xbox Live is having issues. It happened before with an achievement in Wolfenstein: The New Order. However, this one ended up unlocking by itself a few
 days later. Yesterday it happened again during Xbox Live issues with the "Batting 500" achievement in Diablo III: Ulitmate Evil edition. I am still waiting for this one to unlock.<br />
<br />
I requested a chat and was directed here for my problem.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance for looking into it.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>I'm having the same issue with a different achievement/game. I've only been waiting a month for it to finish unlocking, but I feel your pain. I've taken all the steps in the stickied thread and from what I gather there's literally nothing I can do except
 wait and hope it somehow unlocks. I've unlocked thirty achievements in the same game since then... now it's the only one keeping me from %100 completion.</p>

<p>@MikeMannuh: 13th January?! @Lucacentric28: One month?! That is brutal. I've only been waiting a few days for my final achievement in the new Hitman game (first episode) to unlock and that is upsetting me enough. There do seem to be a lot of people suffering
 with this at the moment.</p>
<p>Having said that, mine is not in the "Done! Unlocking" status; I've had that before and, as you said, it eventually unlocked. Mine just says, "100% completed" but remains locked.</p>
<p>Out of interest, are either of you in the preview program? As I mentioned, there are a lot of people talking about achievements not unlocking at the moment and so far everyone I've seen affected by this issue seem to be part of the preview program.</p>
<p>Also I've done the remove, power-cycle, restore thing which caused additional problems. That procedure removes your game save data so it needs to be re-synced. However, the Xbox Live servers currently seem to be having trouble with data delivery which means
 that syncing games is taking forever. You've probably seen the countless number of threads talking about syncing issues at the moment. It would be good to have an announcement on that too. My advice to anyone suffering with achievements not unlocking is NOT
 to follow the recommended steps of removing profile, etc., until the syncing issues are sorted. It took me nearly 3 hours yesterday to sync Fallout 4 with repeated fails. It'd get to, say 54%, then: "We were unable to sync your data with the cloud" (or something
 like that). I'd retry and it would go back to 0% then get to a different point before failing, over and over again.</p>

<p>Same here. I only have three achievements left to 100% and they will not unlock. It used to say 100% on the side bar achievements but after redownloading profile each of the three achievements are stuck at 100% and locked. After spending over one hundred
 hours in this game, to add extra achievements that won't pop is horrible. Please let us know what to do or let us know it's being patched. I'm in the preview program too.</p>

<p>So I was promised by a MS representative in our chat that, once I made a post here, I would be contacted by someone from the official MS 'Achievement Team', either here or by email, within 24 hours.
</p>
<p>It's been about a week now and so far I have not been contacted at all, nor has the problem been fixed. The RotTR achievement as well as the DIII:UE achievement are still stuck on 'Done! Unlocking'. I would like to receive some assistance with this, as promised.</p>

<p>Hey all,</p>
<p>Yeah this is a known issue that the support team are hard at work trying to fix.</p>
<p>There is a thread which I'll link below, which has some suggestions on how you might be able to fix it (in case you haven't already seen it)</p>
<p><a href="http://forums.xbox.com/xbox_support/xbox_one_support/f/4270/t/1958241.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">forums.xbox.com/.../1958241.aspx</a></p>
<p>If that doesn't work, then make sure to fill out the survey at the bottom of that thread, as that info is sent to the support team working on the issue :)</p>
<p>I've had them unlock a month after earning them in game, they just randomly unlocked while I was playing a completely different game. Its annoying, but they will eventually unlock :)</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

<p>Again, as I replied in another thread:</p>
<p>Honestly, for a problem that has been persistent since launch, I don't think you can hide behind the excuse of being hard at work to try and fix it. Microsoft has no problem taking money for our Xbox Live subscriptions every month, yet engaging users for
 these particular problems is something active forum users are supposed to do? And by providing solutions that hardly ever work, or are even detrimental to fixing the problem? And if the non-solutions don't work well... basically you just have to wait and hope
 somehow some little bird or some leprechaun fixes the problem for you somewhere in the future. This is absolutely unacceptable.

<p>So, what eventually worked for me was, after finishing all the DLC, was to go into offline mode, remove my samegame and reserved disc space for the game, start a new game, play up until the first challenge tomb, complete it, exit game, go online... and voila...
 it unlocked.</p>

            Windows XP can't join a homegroup.&nbsp; You need to use traditional networking.&nbsp; How you go about that differs between XP Home and XP Pro (and, of course, there are those here who would say that you shouldn't connect a Windows XP to your other computers at
 all, because XP is vulnerable to malware attack that could then infect your other machines).

</p><p>You have some older drivers, which might be becasue of older devices.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Have you update any components on the system since you got it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>I don't see where the dump file points to anything specific but I do show some older drivers you might check to see if any updates are available.&nbsp; Since you last Bios Update was in 2012, the may be the original Vista or Win 7 drivers since the system is
 not approved for Win 10.&nbsp; My comments about what the drivers are for may not be completely accurate but that is what I found.</p>

<h2>            Error 0x810000F2 when tried to restore backup file from external drive</h2>
                    
<p>Original title: Unable to restore backup from an external hard drive using backup/restore program (0x810000F2)</p>
<p>I had to send my Dell&nbsp;in for repair.&nbsp; Fortunately, I made a backup using the backup/restore program and saved to a usb external hard drive in Windows 7.&nbsp; To my horror, my hard drive had been reformated and Vista was reinstalled-this was the original OS of
 the computer.&nbsp; I was able to upgrade back to Windows 7 but I cannot get the backup to restore.&nbsp; I receive the following message:&nbsp; Windows was not able to load the selected backup for the following reason:&nbsp; A valid backup does not exist at the specified location.
 Choose a different location. (0x810000F2) Verify this location is valid and try again, or consider choosing a different backup.</p>
<p>I did make sure that my computer had the same name as&nbsp;the file name.&nbsp; This did not help.&nbsp; I tried putting the file on my desktop thinking this may been seen but with no luck.&nbsp; The files are there, zipped, they just won't restore.&nbsp; Could it be a problem with
 the file extension?&nbsp; This whole situation has been very frustrating.&nbsp; I appreciate any help with this problem.</p>

            Thank you for the suggestions.&nbsp; After checking permissions and changing as needed, I still cannot get the backup to restore.&nbsp; There must be a problem with the files themselves.&nbsp; I did think to save documents, photos, videos and other files separately from
 the backup.&nbsp; I have successfully copied these back to the computer.&nbsp; It's too bad the restore didn't work.&nbsp; It would have saved a lot of time.
