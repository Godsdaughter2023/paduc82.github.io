<h2>            No Restore Points</h2>
                    I&nbsp;want to&nbsp;try restoring window 8.1 to an earlier date., yet when I go to "restore system files and settings" it says "no restore points have been created on your computer's system drive".&nbsp; I thought windows automatically created restore points when it
 made system updates via "windows Update".&nbsp; This is on a Dell Pro 8 tablet.

<p><span><font><font color="#000000">This issue normally occurs when you have third party software or antivirus program scheduled to clean restore points or optimize PC for better performance.

<p><span><font><font color="#000000">I would first suggest you to check if the “show more restore points” option is selected in the system restore options. If this option is not selected, it will show only the recent restore point created. Refer these steps:</font></font></span></p>

<p><span><font><font color="#000000">If the above step didn’t show the restore points, then I would suggest you to check the disk space allotted to restore points. If very less space is allotted to store restore points, then it will automatically delete the

<p>Hi Damian,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Reset process may not always be simple, and error loops can be a big problem. However, there are several solutions available that we can try. You might want to consider using the Registry Editor as mentioned by J0seph Red on this
<a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/error-message-the-computer-restarted-unexpectedly/b770f14d-e345-e011-90b6-1cc1de79d2e2">
thread</a>.</p>
<p>
</p><p>If the issue persists, we recommend that you contact our <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/surface/en-us/support/contact-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
Answer Desk</a> for Surface. Let us know if you have any additional concerns.</p>
<p>

            <!-- MessageHistoryPanel.cshtml loaded via ajax -->
            
            
<p>After 2 days of trying its solved.</p>
<p>
</p><p>1st - I cannot contact the Answer Desk - Your web only allows a Call Me number originating in Canada or United States. I am in the UK. I tried and tried on Microsoft sites to get to a surface support contact I could call and failed (and I was willing to
 pay)</p>
<p>
</p><p>2nd your instructions for getting a boot image to work over USB for Surface 3 are not correct.</p>
<p>
</p><p>To make it work my USB boot disk had to be called BOOTME not RECOVERY (which is the default name after its created as a recovery disk) source:&nbsp;https://www.eightforums.com/installation-setup/55025-surface-pro-3-will-not-boot-usb-6.html&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>AND</p>
<p>
</p><p>UEFI needed to be set to secure boot DISABLED</p>
<p>
</p><p>Then and only then does the Vol - and Power On (releasing after Surface Splash screen) result in a boot from USB</p>

<h2>            display driver nvlddmkm stopped responding and has successfully recovered</h2>
                    So, roughly about a week ago I checked the nVidia website to see if there was any new drivers avaliable for my card (XFX GeForce 9600 GSO ) and there was. Installiation was simple then a restart. Upon rebooting I thought I'd play Call of Duty 4 and after
 5 - 10 minutes of playing my screen goes black and this appears with a little caution sign in the noticfication area "<span>display driver nvlddmkm stopped responding and
 has successfully recovered"&nbsp;</span>
<div><span><span><br />
</span></span></div>
<div><span>The pc will either blue screen with a nvlddmkm.sys error or it will go blank and nothing will work</span></div>
<div><span>forcing me to turn it off by the power button. I had never encountered this</span><span><span>problem
 before installing the latest drivers. </span></span></div>

<div><span><span>After looking for a few fix's on google I couldn't find</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>anything solid. So I opened up Device Manager and clicked on Display Adapters</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>and rolled back the driver.</span></span></div>

<div><span><span>Still no luck. Most games I played this error still appeared. I have tried all drivers from the nVidia website</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>that suit my card. Also the drivers on the</span></span><span><span>cd
 included witht the card and they don't seem to be working either.</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>I have installed the drivers with Windows Live OneCare deactivated, UAC turned off and nothing running</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>in the background as recommended by nVidia. Still nothing works. I have Sims 3, Call of Duty 4,</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>Call of duty: World at War, Halo 2 for Vista and H.A.W.X installed. The only</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>game I havn't had the error on is H.A.W.X.</span></span></div>
<div><span><span><br />
</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>I am running Windows Vista Home Premium genuine with all the latest updates from Windows Update.</span></span></div>
<div><span><span><br />
</span></span></div>
<div><span><span>Any ideas ? This is driving me through the wall . . .</span></span></div>

            Hello PaulFordge,<br />
<br />
Hello go to the temperature settings in the nivida control panel, here is an <a href="http://ocia.net/aimages/127_2_full.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
image</a> .,<br />
<br />
What is your idle temp? If you can load a game in windowed mode and have the temperature gauge so you can see while the window is active what is the temperature under load?<br />
<br />
Thanks,<br />
<br />

</span></span></span><span>Re-install the Printer driver with the latest version from the manufacturer’s website.</span></p>
<p><span><span>d)<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span>Reattach the printer.

<h2>            Online status automatically on &#34;online&#34; - not remembering last status</h2>
                    <p>Hi!</p>
<p>When I start Skype the online status is automatically set on "online" and it does not remember the previous status before closing Skype. The previous versions worked like this and it is annoying to change the status on each startup and login as I prefer
 the status "invisible". I could not find a place in the preferences to change this behaviour.</p>
<p>I use Skype for Linux Beta 5.3.0.1. But this also happened on my Android device.</p>
<p>Hopefully there is a solution for this.</p>
<p>Thanks!<br />

<p>I also experience this problem with Skype for Linux Beta 5.3.0.1.</p>
<p>
I used DB Browser for SQLite as explained in a post on the Web (search for "How do you make your self invisible by default on Skype?") but that did not fix the problem with Skype for Linux Beta 5.3.0.1, so I assume it is an outstanding bug. The only thing we
 can do is wait for Microsoft to fix it.<br />

</p><p>Skype deleted the previous forum shortly after retiring Mac version 2.8 and replacing it with an inferior space wasting version, Mac users were so incensed that they sought out the forum to complain and request changes to the user interface in massive numbers.
 &nbsp;In preference to listening to the users, the forum was deleted losing years of collective wisdom of experienced Skype users. &nbsp;It very much looks as though Microsoft deleted the last forum so they can ignore the repeatedly asked feature requests from Skype
 users, and proceed with the skeleton development version of Skype for Linux 5.3 that will almost certainly mean that many Linux users such as my self will have no viable version of Skype for Linux computers</p>

<p>I suspect that they are two distinct problems. The problem reported by user NCC-1701-A in that other thread you referenced seems to me to be a protocol problem as he stated, or possibly some form of deadly embrace (a.k.a. deadlock). On the other hand the
 problem reported in this thread seems to me to be because Skype for Linux Beta 5.3.0.1 does not save (locally or remotely) the Skype availability status when you sign out of Skype. In the old Skype for Linux 4.3.0.37, the availability status was stored in
 the file ~/.Skype/&lt;your Skype account name&gt;/main.db and you could even change it using an SQLite database application for Linux such as sqlitebrowser (SQLite Database Browser). There was a Skype database table with a field called set_availability containing
 a number corresponding to the user's status:</p>
<p>6 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Invisible<br />
5 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Do not disturb<br />
3 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Away<br />
2 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Online<br />
1 &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Offline<br />
<br />
However, the Electron-based Skype for Linux Beta 5.3.0.1 no longer uses ~/.Skype/&lt;your Skype account name&gt;/main.db and so the old way of altering/fixing one's status before signing in to Skype no longer works. Incidentally, if you look in the file main.db of
 the earlier incarnation of Skype for Linux, it contained all the user's personal information in non-encrypted form. That was also the case in the Windows version of Skype, although I expect Microsoft has changed that too by now.</p>
<p>
Skype for Linux Beta 5.3.0.1 and the earlier Alpha releases are essentially Skype for Web (try Skype for Web and you'll see it looks and works the same as Skype for Linux Beta 5.3.0.1). This is because Skype for Linux Beta 5.3.0.1 has been produced using Electron,
 an open-source software framework that enables desktop GUI applications to be developed from the components of Web applications.</p>

<p>Interestingly, today I installed the Skype for Windows application on a desktop PC running Windows 10 Home, and signed in to Skype on that PC. I then changed my availability status to Invisible and signed out of Skype. I have just now signed in to Skype
 for Linux Beta 5.3.0.1 on my laptop, my Skype availability status is shown as Invisible. So it appears that the Skype for Windows application writes the user's availability status to one or more remote Microsoft Skype servers, whereas the Skype for Linux Beta
 5.3.0.1 application does not, although the Skype for Linux Beta 5.3.0.1 application reads the user's availability status from the remote Microsoft Skype server(s).</p>

</p><p>Running both stable v4.3 (still showing status of my contacts though calls not connecting to Android now) and the skeleton Skype for Linux toy 5.3, where they display different status display for accounts, one example went offline about 90 minutes ago, or
 rather put the phone down, v 4.3 updated status a little while later to the orange away status, whereas skeleton Skype for Linux toy v 5.3 continues to display online, even though the phone has not been touched for a long time.</p>

            A couple of days later I repeated my experiment of signing in to Skype for Windows, changing my availability status to Invisible, signing out and later signing in to Skype for Linux Beta 5.3.0.1. However, this time Skype for Linux Beta 5.3.0.1 showed my
 availability status as Online. So the behaviour of Skype for Linux Beta 5.3.0.1 is not even consistent. Microsoft really needs to fix this, as it is a basic function and needs to be reliable. It could even be the result of more than one problem in Skype; for
 example missing code in the Skype for Linux Beta 5.3.0.1 and also a lack of proper synchronisation between servers after Microsoft's migration of Skype from a peer-to-peer model to a so-called 'cloud' service using Microsoft servers.

<div>Hi AdrienneSolomon,</div>
<div>
<p>
</p><p>There could be a number of factors as to why you are experiencing issues with connecting the Amazon Kindle to your Windows 10 computer. This could be caused by an outdated driver, loose USB port, or an issue with the device&nbsp; being connected.</p>

            <p>What exactly does, or does not happen ? Any error messages ?</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I've never actually used DOS BOX directly to install a game, but have several games from Good Old Games,</p>
<p>that installed with DOS BOX and they all work on Win10.</p>
<p>- Before the 1511 Win10 update my DOS based games did require the Compatibility setting
</p>
<p>&nbsp;'<em>Disable Display Scaling with high DPI settings'</em>, or they would not fit the screen properly,
</p>
<p>but this has not been a problem since the 1511 update.</p>
<p>
</p><p>- I only have a handful of DOS based games and just found they will not run (<em>'This app cannot run on your PC'</em> )</p>
<p>if using the games main&nbsp; .exe&nbsp; (when one can be found) .</p>
<p>One of the games (Rayman Forever) has a shortcut in the install folder that I previously had thought was an .exe.</p>
<p>These shortcuts have a long file path that links through DOS BOX.</p>
<p><em>E:\Others\Rayman Forever\DOSBOX\DOSBox.exe" -conf "..\dosboxRayman.conf" -conf "..\dosboxRayman_single.conf" -noconsole -c exit</em></p>
<p>
</p><p>Other games (ProPinball - Timeshock ) have an&nbsp; .exe in the install folder, but I get the error above if I use them.</p>
<p>Only the desktop shortcut from when the game installed (which I have no idea how to replace&nbsp; if I lost the current one without re-download/installing the game... or finally learning how to use DOS BOX), will open the game.</p>

<h2>            No choice to install game</h2>
                    
<p>So I've been looking forward to onigiri for a little while. Its just that I'm into mmos and when I heard this was coming to Xbox one and that it was free I knew I had to have it. I even did the thing to where you change your language to Japanese so that
 way I could install the Japanese version, though I couldn't get very far into it because I don't know Japanese. But just today I heard that it was released recently an as soon as I got home I went to go install it. Problem is that I couldn't find it in the
 market place. So after going to one of my friends profiles who I knew had it and comparing games, I clicked on onigiri and it took me to its place in the marketplace. I thought if I did this maybe I could trick the system into finding it and then I could install
 it. But now there's not even a choice to install it, even though I know it is able to be done in my region. Any solutions?</p>

            I had this error too, and what solved it for me was using the "repair" option on the iCloud uninstaller, let it do its thing, and then have a go at the uninstall ("remove" option). Hope this helps some people.&nbsp;

<h3> raeam  say:</h3>
<h2>            Flickering Cortana Home Screen</h2>
                    Hi, just a minor issue with Cortana. I just got this new laptop and there is a button in the bottom left corner of the task bar that brings up Cortana. Pretty normal, yeah? But when I open Cortana, the home page is constantly flickering, almost like the
 text keeps jumping up and down. The text is of a notice to use the Cortana skill for productivity on your Alexa device. The text and image that goes along with it constantly bounce up and down on the screen. I have opened it several times and only once has
 it remained still. Additionally, I cannot find a way to get rid of this message, as I do not have an Alexa device, so I am not in need of the skill. Any way to fix this?

            <p>Hi JacobXG,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a program and not exactly malware (though some malware products categorize it as such because it is so dangerous).&nbsp; Try Revo:
<a href="http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">
http://www.revouninstaller.com/revo_uninstaller_free_download.html</a>&nbsp;(the free version is fine) in Advanced mode and it will probably be listed as uTorrent or somthing similar (not by filename though if that's the program's name, it may well be listed that
 way).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If all you want to do is remove that specific file and not the program (for some reason), and cannot seem to do it and have confirmed it isn't a permissions issue (right click on the file, click on properties, click on security, and make sure you have full
 rights and use advanced to do so in the special permissions section as well and make yourself the owner and then try again), try&nbsp;<span>using one of the following free products to delete the file.&nbsp; Unlocker at:
</span><span><a href="http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/System-Miscellaneous/Unlocker.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.softpedia.com/get/System/System-Miscellaneous/Unlocker.shtml</span></a></span><span>
<span>&nbsp;</span>or File Assassin </span><span><a href="http://www.malwarebytes.org/fileassassin.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><span>http://www.malwarebytes.org/fileassassin.php</span></a></span><span>&nbsp; These programs often work when normal Windows delete function fails
 to operate properly.<br />
<br />
I hope this helps.<br />
<br />
Good luck!</span></p>

<h2>            Windows 7 Upgrade possible or not</h2>
                    <p>I want to move on from XP to Windows 7. I have a Dell W7 Ultimate 64 bit&nbsp;DVD. I plan to install first on a small HD&nbsp;. then use this&nbsp;to install on / over my XP if possible and NOT lose&nbsp;anything. The small HD then being my backup. &nbsp;The &nbsp;&nbsp;install runs and loads
 Windows Files but then asks me for Driver Media /CD.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have no Drivers --and there are none on the W7 Installation DVD.&nbsp; Where can I get the&nbsp;Drivers necessary to achieve System install?</p>
<p>Also&nbsp; at the beginning of the install process , it tells me an upgrade is possible&nbsp; but elsewhere I read only a clean install of W7 is possible--which is correct?</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; Appreciate advice&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MACK</p>

            <p>The drivers should be supplied by the manufacturer of the PC itself, in this case possible Dell
<em>( if they made the PC ) </em>- IF they support W7 for this PC. You may be able to obtain some
<em>( i.e. for the graphics card etc ) </em>from the manufacture of the hardware itself, this can work sometimes, depends on the set up of the PC<em> ( desktop or laptop etc )</em> and the particular hardware device.</p>

<p><em>Perhaps you could copy your data ( photos, documents, email, bookmarks etc ) to the small HD, assuming it all fits, then wipe the main HD and install W7 to that, then copy your data back? Or similar. Just make sure you copy everything you want to keep.

            <p>Hi George, Thanks for the superfast reply----All 3 machines different Makers.&nbsp; Fujitsu Siemens and HP Desktops&nbsp; Toshiba Laptop. No problem installing a Dell system on any of them.</p>
<p>All W7 capable ( ran W7 checker) said some Drivers compatible--not so sure --existing XP only 32bit. Thinking of getting new Graphics Card anyway--existing HP uses Nvidea Ge Force 7300 LE.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Maybe I can find all the Drivers and save them to CD--take time though&nbsp;-- me being inexperienced with such things. Can't use Windows update to find the 64 bit drivers using 32 bit system--just tells me "not required for this OS"!</p>
<p>&nbsp;Have got Setup running so we'll see what happens next</p>
<p>&nbsp;MACK</p>

            <p>How well Windows 7 will run on an older PC depends on two things.. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>#1.. Driver support.. Incredibly important. Without full driver support for ALL devices, your computer will perform poorly. You should check with the computer manufacturer before trying to upgrade. If there is not FULL Windows 7 driver support, do NOT upgrade..
 &nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>#2.. Specifications.. RAM for 64-bit should be 4gb or more, and for 32-bit, it should be as close to 4gb as you can get. It is important to load up with RAM in order to make up for the shortfall in performance of other devices in the computer..

            <p><strong>Can I upgrade to Windows 7 from Windows XP?</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://keckrq.bay.livefilestore.com/y1pKB01SXGtvjFzoIT21x-jywF5P8DrPcqIhitH4luMPOwCs_peaTWayKl0sHmaJTUF4qA5xlo444HkqSL8oWwQog?PARTNER=WRITER" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow"><img src="https://filestore.community.support.microsoft.com/api/images/ext?url=http%3a%2f%2fbyfiles.storage.msn.com%2fy1pQZ-6Q0C0zWDFhOIMeHelN7ebwExmYCDngztxEpxJkwctOib4r3zUOaRbrtrArpjKaA2lE4SRgrY%3fPARTNER%3dWRITER" /></a></p>
<p>I checked and the answer is no, <em>see the screenshot above</em>. Good news though, Windows XP users will definitely qualify for upgrade pricing. The reason why Microsoft has decided not to support a Windows XP upgrade path to Windows 7 stems from the complexity
 involved. The Windows Team wants the best possible experience, because of the significant changes that have occurred since Vista, there are just too many variables involved that can potentially make the upgrade experience an unsatisfactory one. So, a clean
 install is the recommended and only way to get Windows 7 installed on your system for Windows XP users. Don’t worry yet, I know you have files and settings you don’t want to lose, I am going to take a look at getting those over.</p>
<p><strong>Will my current hardware work with Windows 7?</strong></p>
<p>That depends on what you have. Windows 7′s official requirements call for the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 GHz 32 or 64 bit PC</li><li>1 GB of RAM (2 GBs for 64 bit systems)</li><li>16 GBs of free hard disk space (20 GBs for 64 bit)</li><li>DirectX 9 compliant video card with 128 MBs of video RAM</li><li>Internet Connection for access to additional services and activation of appropriate software</li></ul>
<p>If you are in the above line up, you should be good to go. Some persons will be able to get away with some unofficial hardware configurations. I for instance have been running Windows 7 on 512 MBs of RAM. But I have a customized setup not requiring all the
 features of the OS. So your mileage will vary. Many have described Windows 7 as a significant release of the OS that actually improves the performance of your PC.</p>
<p><strong>Will my applications work with Windows 7?</strong></p>
<p>Now this is a tough one. Windows is known as the operating system that tries its very best to make it easy to run your old applications on the latest version. But there is always the possibility of compatibility issues. Windows 7 in particular just like
 Windows Vista will likely have problems with applications that also had problems in that version. Please note though, this does necessarily apply to all applications, there have been successful reports of applications that did not work in Vista, now working
 just fine in Windows 7. To help users evaluate their current setup, Microsoft recently provided the
<strong><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-7/upgrade-advisor.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">Windows Upgrade Advisor</a></strong> which analyzes and checks your system for potential software and hardware conflicts. Its a great starting point for Windows XP users who want
 to move to Windows 7. With over 1.2 billion Windows PC configurations though, there will certainly be hiccups.</p>
<p>Before you even pop the Windows 7 disk into your disk drive, you can do a few things. Like check the manufacturer of your devices for updated drivers or information about Windows 7 support. For applications you can do the same by checking the developers
 web site for updates or new versions.</p>
<p><strong>What to do if its not compatible?</strong></p>
<p>You have a few options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wait until a new version or update is released.</li><li>Acquire another brand that works with Windows 7.</li><li>Don’t bother with the upgrade at all.</li></ol>
<p>Number 2 and 3 in particular might be tough decisions to make considering that the application or device is already working just fine in Windows XP. But users must understand that upgrading to Windows 7 is not just upgrading for upgrades sake. The operating
 system is easier to use, more reliable and definitely more secure. The day will come when you won’t receive updates for Windows XP anymore and that current device will most likely become unsupported when a problem does arise. This is not a scare tactic, its
 just how the hardware and software industry works. There is always a new version in the works to replace the old one. This is all theoretical though, so don’t worry.</p>
<p>For potential customers of Windows 7 Professional, Enterprise and Ultimate, Microsoft is providing a feature called Windows Virtual XP, which enhances the application compatibility experience in Windows 7. This is great especially for business customers
 who might still be running legacy applications on Windows XP. Another great thing about Virtual XP is, you can run your legacy applications side by side within Windows 7 without having to interact with the Windows XP operating side of things. It’s a powerful
 utility for users and businesses who want to maintain compatibility while transitioning to the latest. To learn more about Windows Virtual XP, check out my experiences with it

<p>In the screenshot from earlier, the Compatibility Report suggest that we use the Windows Easy Transfer utility. And that is what we will now do. Lucky for us, Windows 7 already comes with the Migration Tools on the disk. To find it, just navigate to
<em>x:supportmigwiz, </em>‘x:’ represents the name of your disk drive. In this folder, you will see a collection of files, the important one you need to look for and double click is ‘<strong>migsetup</strong>‘. This will launch the setup program for Windows
 Easy Transfer software that will be installed on your Windows XP computer.</p>

<p><strong><em>Using an External storage device is faster and convenient</em></strong></p>
<p>Our choice specifically this time will be <em>‘An external hard disk or USB flash drive.
</em>Its particularly best when moving large amounts of data from Windows XP to Windows 7 since there is no upgrade path and the restoration will be much smoother.</p>

<p><strong><em>A successful backup of your files and settings!</em></strong></p>
<p>So we have backed up everything. The next step now involves installing Windows 7. One thing Windows XP users must note, your applications will not survive a clean install and will require reinstallation. So please make sure you have those program disks available
 when you are ready to do so.</p>
<p>You have two options, you can launch Windows 7 setup in Windows XP or you can boot from the Windows 7 disk. If you plan on booting from your disk, ensure that your BIOS is set to boot from its optical drive. If you decide to launch setup from within Windows
 XP, you must select ‘<strong>Custom</strong> <strong>(advanced)</strong>‘ option. What does this entail?</p>

<p>Windows 7 has definitely made it clear about moving to it from Windows XP and the pre-requisites necessary. Its a clean install, applications will not be available and you should of course backup before attempting the migration. Since we have done all of
 these necessary things, we will go ahead and start the installation. The installation is typical of a clean install, if you don’t know what that is like, please refer to my experience

 hit enter.</p>

<p><strong><em>…and there you have it, a successful migration from Windows XP to Windows 7</em></strong></p>
<p>Windows XP users should note that applications that once came bundled with Windows XP are not included in the OS such as Email and video editing software. You can download third party equivalents or
<a href="http://download.live.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow">download and install Windows Live Essentials</a> which includes updated successors to these programs. There are commercial solutions available from Company’s such as LapLink that promise to provide a way to easy migrate personal
 files, settings, applications and drivers to Windows 7 if you really must avoid the clean installation process. You can learn more about that

here</a></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Windows XP users can take confidence in the migration experience that Windows 7 provides. Yes, there are some requirements that are involved and appropriate planning of course can help to overcome some of the hurdles. The experiences promised at the end
 is definitely worth it!</p>

<p>External hard disk – these can come in very handy. If you have lots of data stored on your Windows XP PC, you will need a good amount of storage to back it up. External hard disk these days are very affordable and you can pick up a 500 GB below US $80.</p>
<p>Have those program disks nearby – After completing the migration, you will need to reinstall all your necessary programs. Common apps include office productivity suites, finance software and any other favorite applications you often use in Windows XP.</p>
<p>Check for updates – after completing the installation, check for updates for the operating system, computer and your applications. This will improve stability, security, performance and compatibility.</p>
<p>Have security software installed. There are many free antivirus solutions out there, your existing one for XP is most likely not compatible with Windows 7. Antivirus programs tend to work specifically with the operating system version. You can find a list

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to&nbsp; W7 Upgrade Adviser&nbsp; my 2Gb Ram is sufficient requirement. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; W 7 has installed ok.&nbsp; first hitch though is my Internet Software--German AVM Fritzbox 7141 is not 64 bit compatible--and won't install!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WUA&nbsp; didn't recognise it so gave no info on it.</p>
<p>Might have to upgrade that too. </p>

<p>It is more useful for pinpointing software (not drivers) which will not play ball. For everything else, it is best to go to the computer/device manufacturer websites..

            <p>There is nothing to install for the avm Fritzbox 7141. What you are most likely experiencing is no driver support for the network card in your computer, which is why I stated that driver support was so important.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p>Find out which device manufacturer is responsible for the network adapter and then go to the device manufacturer for drivers. If there are none, connect via wireless to your router. If your computer is a desktop type, you can get an Ethernet &nbsp;NIC for which
 there is Windows 7 driver support or maybe a wireless NIC instead. If your machine is a laptop, connect wirelessly..&nbsp;<font color="#0092ff"><font color="#333333">&nbsp;</font>&nbsp;</font></p>

<p>I looked at the manual for your router and it looked to be a standard router. While the software may not be OS compatible, the router is, and if set up manually should not require any additional software..

    <title>XBOX One Controller Analog Stick Deadzone - Microsoft Community</title>
<h3> jjmineo  say:</h3>
<h2>            XBOX One Controller Analog Stick Deadzone</h2>
                    
<p>I know this issue is very wide spread and after doing much research on this matter, the only response by Microsoft staff is to get your controller replaced. I am hoping for some kind of fix as I have spent tons of $$ and time on this and am about to give
 up completely...</p>
<p>Let me explain my issue - I primarily play FPS games, particularly Destiny and the "dead zone" in the sticks is unbearable. For instance, I can make a circle about the size of a small watch battery, before anything happens on screen. This makes accuracy
 almost impossible!! The controllers used are 2 stock and 2 Scuf, all of which act the same way. They are all new and updated with latest firmware, new Microsoft charge and play kits, etc, etc...</p>
<p>There are many users out there with this issue and there HAS to be a solution! There is also many people with the opposite issue where the sticks are drifting and there is 0 dead zone.</p>
<p>Does anyone have a permanent fix for this???</p>

<h2>            No sound through laptop speaker. But able to hear sound through headphone.</h2>
                    Hi,<br />
<br />
<br />
I was using headphone to talk on gtalk. After the call, I am not able to hear the sound through laptop speaker now. But I am able to hear the sound using headphone through headphone jack of my laptop.<br />
<br />
I have already re-installed the sigmatel audio driver from dell site. But the issue is still present.<br />
I think the reason is - In SigmaTel Audio Control Panel, the middle headphone icon is always in green tick mark (Jack is OK) under Front Panel of &nbsp;Jack SetUp although there is no headphone connected to laptop.<br />
<br />
I have dell xps M1330 laptop.<br />
<br />
Please help me to resolve this issue.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance...

<p><span>Hi dillip_141, &nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Welcome to Microsoft Answers Community site. I would suggest you to try out these options:
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Option 1:</strong> I would suggest you to restore the defaults of the speakers and check if that can resolve this issue.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Control Panel/sound/speakers/properties/advanced/restore defaults.
</span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Option 2:</strong> Click here to

<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Option 4:</strong> I would also suggest contacting the Laptop manufacturer for additional support and verify if they have any updates on this issue
 and if they can help to fix the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Let me know if that works. Good luck!</span></p>

<h2>            Windows Update Dell ST2220L Monitor</h2>
                    <p>Hello MSers,</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My sled is configured to receive all Win Updates automatically, and install them. For the past 9 months, Windows seems to think my Dell HDMI monitor needs an update. The installation always fails. I checked with Dell, there are no updates
 recommended for the monitor. I went into Device Manager, and ran "Update Driver". The dialog box that came up said the most appropriate driver for this device is installed. So, why does Win Update keep sending me this?

<p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>The Windows Update may be thinking that current monitor driver that you have is outdated. To isolate your concern, kindly show us a screenshot of the exact error message? so we can investigate.</p>
<p>
</p><p>We are looking forward to your response.</p>

<p>As stated, a search using my Service Tag number on Dell's driver update utility yields only a few Intel chipset updates, nothing about the monitor. I have been using this site since I bought the PC, and have a running subscription to receive any updates
 or notices concerning the rig. In Win 7's Device Manager, under Driver Details:&nbsp; Driver Provider: Dell, Inc&nbsp; Date: 2/24/2011 Version: 1.0.0.0&nbsp; Digital Signer: MWHCP.</p>

            Hey,&nbsp; Obviously WU is trying to update a driver using the very same driver. From the data above, the release dates of the exisitng and recommended driver are identical. I also get a BSOD about once a month, which I have yet to be able to diagnose. At this
 point, I will not do anything major such as reformat. These are minor issues, and not worth reinstalling everything. I do have a Toshiba Canvio external HDD, so after a clean OS reinstall perhaps the rest won't be as tedious as it used to be, but still I think
 not. Once it breaks, I'll know for sure what is causing the Stop errors. As far as the WU problem, hopefully one day WU will fix it. Thanks for the assistance.&nbsp;&nbsp; USOP31

<h2>            Allowing programs to run in AVG</h2>
                    <p>I realise that this isn't an AVG forum but I was wondering whether anyone could help me with a problem I have.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm trying to install Teamviewer on a friend's PC so that I can log in remotely and help them with problems. However when I try to install the program I get a message that says AVG Internet Security is blocking the install and the program needs to be added
 to the safe programs. However I can't find that option anywhere in AVG program or in the AVG Help and website suuport pages.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe I'm looking in the wrong places but I would appreciate it if anyone could point me in the right direction?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many thanks</p>
<p>Tony&nbsp;</p>

<h2>            Windows 10 version 1709 update problems</h2>
                    <p>Found a few problems with this update, one of which is not yet resolved.</p>
<p>First, can't use Flash Cookie Cleaner 2.0 anymore. It is unacceptable. Dropped back to an older version.</p>
<p>Second, pdf pages on the web don't work in IE11 after update. Get "access violation...read of address 0000006C." Can't find a solution to this. Edge will work but the pages viewed are blurred in Edge. Can't edit what you can't see. So I use Firefox now.</p>
<p>Still have "one size fits all" fonts and icons. The&nbsp; custom scaling adjustment is&nbsp;inadequate for a widescreen monitor similar to AOC E22220Swdn. I mentioned this in a thread six months ago. Had to use an external program called&nbsp;Font Size Changer by WinTools.
 Still using it in combination with custom scaling.</p>
<p>Lastly, my HP Stream laptop with only 32 Gb on SSD had to be denuded of apps in order to meet the 10 Gb requirement of free space.&nbsp;A clean external&nbsp;64 Gb SD card wasn't any help.
</p>
<p>When the notice came to free up space on both "drives," I initially tried 7 or 8 Gb free space on SSD and hoped that the external SD card would be chosen&nbsp; to cover the rest as the diagram implied. No such luck. Each time I passed this point it failed to
 complete the upgrade. I would consider this area a MS trap. Or mousetrap.&nbsp;Then I denuded the apps on built in&nbsp;32 Gb SSD&nbsp;as mentioned earlier. I got it to about 19 Gb occupied space&nbsp;with the rest free space. The update completed.&nbsp;The external SD was useless
 in&nbsp;this process.</p>
<p>Nothing like spending more than six hours upgrading each home computer, much longer for the HP Stream laptop. Gentle Ben had to take extra Lisinophril to cope with this unruly update. When the next update arrives I may clutch my heart like Redd Foxx and
 say "I'm coming Elizabeth, this is the big one."</p>

 together. If there is some specific feature in the update you want, then thats an exception, but these feature updates are becoming more difficult to install on older devices; and it sometimes makes you wonder if the inconvenience is worth the hassle just
 to keep doing the same thing.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>I do not this new 1709 version but my computer keeps updating it and I keep having to turn back to version 1703. Does anyone know how to keep this version 1709 from updating or stop it when it starts? It really pisses me off there's not even a cancel option!

<p>Version 1709 doesn't work with my 28" AOC display if it's connected on the HDMI interface: the monitor displays "No Signal" and the machine just sits there. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
</p><p>I found that version 1709 does work with the same monitor on a DVI interface, so if that's an option for you, it's worth trying.</p>

<p>Wow! I am not the only one who is finding the Windows 10, version 1709 to be a royal pain in the... (add your own words). I have been keeping a file of all my woes that I have encountered, for each and every update, so what is one more to add to the pile.
 I have been a faithful Microsoft user since the Windows 1995 version, but this "new and improved" version seems to have more bugs in it, and causes more headaches (or heartaches) than necessary.</p>
<p>
</p><p>I agree, that it would be great to be able to stop the "latest and greatest" Feature Update from happening, but as has been mentioned by Orion23WF, they have a mind all their own, and cannot be forced to stop.</p>
<p>
</p><p>My PC: Asus Desktop M32BF</p>
<p>Original Edition (when purchased): Windows 8.1 Home</p>
<p>Current Edition: Windows 10 Home, version 1709</p>
<p>Monitor: Samsung Syncmaster S23B350H (no touch display)</p>
<p>Monitor Connection: HDMI</p>
<p>Processor: AMD A8-6500 APU 3.50 GHz (x64 bit)</p>
<p>Video Processor: AMD Radeon HD 8570D</p>
<p>RAM: 6.00 GB</p>
<p>Windows C: 42 GB Free of 149 GB</p>
<p>Data D: 656 GB Free of 762 GB</p>
<p>Expansion E: 95.5 GB Free of 465 GB</p>
<p>
</p><p>Ever since the upgrade to Windows 10 Creator version, I have had nothing but issues, whether with its compatibility of older programs (that were perfectly fine with Windows 8.1); the Mail app; one day the printer works, then mysteriously not; etc. I don't
 like the idea of having to look forward to my monitor not working, just because the update doesn't like it. If Microsoft wants to buy me a new PC every time they upgrade their Windows, then have at it. Otherwise, they should rethink their game plan, and decide
 to support those of us who have been users for such a long time, by not continuously making our lives difficult.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The biggest gripe that I have, is that it seems that Microsoft has left it up to the user community to resolve any issues, rather than actually
<strong>fixing</strong> the issues from their end. Even though I never took any official university level training to fix computers or certification in programming, over time its as if we all have become our own technical support person as a matter of necessity,
 rather than goal in life.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Case in point: On November 27, 2017, my Windows 10, version 1709 Feature Update failed to install, with the Error code: 0x8024001e, and the Windows Defender update KB2267602 (Definition: 1.257.1055.0) Error code: 0x80248007. After searching online, I found
 that by running the Windows Update Troubleshooter, it should have "fixed" the errors; restarted PC; Retry Update(s)... new Defender update (Definition: 1.257.1109.0) appeared, along with Microsoft Office 2007 update KB4011604, downloading stuck at 46%. I ran
 the troubleshooter again, and downloading stuck at 5% after 90 minutes, so I shut down PC to try again later.</p>
<p>
</p><p>On November 29, 2017, downloading made it up to 16% after 2 hours, but I have a life, so shut down PC.&nbsp; On November 30, 2017, downloading made it up to 37% after 2.5 hours; confirmed my Ethernet downloading was trying 1.6 GB of data at 100 Mbps; shut down
 PC. Tried again later in day, but downloading stuck at 37% after 1.5 hours, then had same Error code for Defender, but new one for Windows 10, v 1709 Error code: 0x80244018, which led me to your post.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Maybe <strong>we</strong> should collectively charge Microsoft for attempting to fix
<strong>their</strong> bugs, in a system that <strong>they</strong> designed? Then maybe, if all pray together, they will fix their updates, before just sending them out with the hope that it might work, someday. I miss Windows XP, it may have been old, but
 it was solid and it worked.</p>

<p>That was a very honest reply with real issues worth airing. </p>
<p>I had to update three Windows computers at home. The last one I updated was a Windows 10 Pro HP-PAVILION 17-E110DX-17.3 laptop, 8 GB RAM, AMD A8, 750 GB&nbsp; hard drive storage, most of it free. It failed to update 3X, then on the fourth try it updated. The
 download speed of my Roadrunner Internet connection is 20 Mbps. All of this took over 8 hours with one break for my sleep. There was no choice to prevent updating under the new rules of play, and there is no good reason or error code to explain such failures.
 Very dissatisfied to say the least. The stress and frustration is extraordinary. I will be explaining this to my doctor, who is not affiliated with Microsoft, on December 19th if I live that long.

<p>Regarding my earlier post on November 30, 2017 at 4:23 pm CST, I have a correction to make:
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Upon further investigation, my Windows 10 Home version is 1703 (OS Build: 15063.726), and not the version 1709 as previously indicated.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, the Defender definition kept changing, each time it attempted to download and install, which was very annoying. The definitions and the date/time for each change were as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>November 28, 2017 at 7:00 pm CST... Definition 1.257.1055.0</li><li>November 28, 2017 at 8:00 pm CST... Definition 1.257.1109.0</li><li>December 1, 2017 at 5:45 pm CST...... Definition 1.257.1264.0</li><li>December 3, 2017 at 5:30 pm CST...... Definition 1.257.1327.0</li></ol>
<p>The error code for whenever it failed to install properly was: 0x80248007 (KB2267602)</p>
<p>
</p><p>On December 3, 2017, I had to disable my Ethernet connection to stop the Defender update from downloading at 87%; turned "off" Defender; then adjusted my Network Connection to be "metered" (even though in reality it is not); and re-enabled my Ethernet. While
 I was writing down my notes, the Windows Update Status now said: "Your device is up to date, last checked: Today, 5:28 pm". I also confirmed that in the Update History: "Feature Updates (2)... Feature Update to Windows 10, version 1709 failed to install on
 2017-11-30 (twice)."</p>
<p>
</p><p>Since I already use Kaspersky Internet Security for both my firewall and anti-virus protection, as well as System Mechanic to use as secondary protection and monitoring, both the Windows Firewall and Defender are useless to me. Maybe now my PC won't continue
 to needlessly attempt to update itself, which bogs down the Wi-Fi for my Mom's iPad. At least, that is what I hope happens, since she is not as tech-savvy as I have become, and gets easily frustrated when her Facebook won't load properly.</p>

<p>Okay, as of December 13, 2017, I finally figured out how to stop Windows 10, version 1709 from downloading and installing in the background, and constantly getting stuck in the process. The steps are rather time consuming, and are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to C:\Windows\SoftwareDistribution\Download, then "delete" all the files. I just ended up sending them to my Recycle Bin and Incinerator, but not actually deleted anything. This step basically seemed to trick Windows Update into thinking that it had
 to start from scratch.</li><li>Click Search window (Cortana) and type "Services" to access the Services App.</li><li>Open the Services panel, scroll down and highlight "Delivery Optimization"</li><li>Right-click it; select Properties; and change "Startup type" to "Manual"</li><li>Reboot PC</li><li>Repeat step 3, but now scroll down and highlight "Windows Update"</li><li>Repeat step 4 and 5 (make sure to click on the "Apply" button before clicking the "OK" button)</li><li>Go to Windows Update, and it should list the updates available, along with the size of space required, including the "Feature Update - Windows 10, version 1709". Do not click on the Download button, as this step just confirms that the update was stopped.</li><li>Go to the URL: http://sihmar.com/disable-or-block-windows-10-drivers-updates/</li><li>Download the Microsoft WUShowHide Tool (FREE link on webpage)</li><li>Run the file downloaded, and execute it via Administrator Rights (I just kept clicking OK)</li><li>Click the Next button to star
<p>
</p><p>Yes, it worked for me, so that now I no longer have to live in fear of the troubles everyone else seems to be having with that pesky update. I also followed some steps that were listed on the URL: http://sihmar.com/fix-windows-10-version-1709-failed-to-install-download-stuck-blue-screen/,
 which had more in-depth information, that didn't really apply to my situation, but should also prove helpful to others.</p>
<p>
</p><p>The crazy part of all this, is that the tool in step 9, was first posted online as of February 15, 2016, long before the Windows 10, version 1709 existed. It never ceases to amaze me how an obscure free tool that Microsoft provided over 1 year ago, can still
 be applicable to the present.</p>
<p>
</p><p>In the meantime, I am happy with my Windows 10, version 1703, since according to Microsoft's own Windows 10 History webpage (URL:&nbsp;https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4018124/windows-10-update-history), version 1703 will still be supported via Cumulative
 Updates. Maybe they will fix all the issues with version 1709, and re-release it later? I can wait until whenever that happens.</p>

<p><strong>Internet access lost - after installing the Windows 10 Fall&nbsp;Update (1709).</strong></p>
<p>
</p><p>Had an automatic update to version 1709. Again, everything works, except the access to Internet! The device manger says drivers are working, etc. Trouble shooting says there is problem with adapter!</p>
<p>
</p><p>The problem couldn't be resolved despite many attempts at trouble shooting, net work reset, driver re-install, etc.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>Hope Microsoft gives solution to this. We need a tool that can be used after the install to get back Internet access. We cannot access the net after the update. Therefore, we must have a tool to reconfigure the networking after an update. We should be able
 to download it prior to update and use it to rectify the loss of Internet access problem.</p>
<p>
</p><p>
</p><p>Pleas offer a real solution. Don't say silly things like check out the basics.
</p>
<p>
</p><p>H/W configuration:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>System: Dell Vostro 3350 running Windows 10 Pro (Version 1607; build 14393.1944) with 8GB RAM.
</li><li>Network (LAN) - Realtek PCIe GBE Family Controller<br />
Wi-Fi: Dell Wireless 1702 802.11b/g/n</li><li>Device manager - shows all adapters are working properly and has the latest updates.
</li><li>Trouble shooting says - problem with Ethernet and Wi-Fi drivers/adapters.</li></ul>
<p>The install&nbsp;went through smoothly and everything looked good. However, the Internet access was lost.</p>

            <p>Hi,</p>
<p>
</p><p>Thank you for posting in Microsoft Community, we appreciate your interest in Windows 10.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Please do let us know which was the PowerShell command you have tried as troubleshooting step.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Try the below steps and check if it helps.</p>
<p>
</p><p><strong>Step 1: </strong>I recommend you to try the below PowerShell command if not yet tried:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Open the <strong>Task manager</strong>.<span>&nbsp; </span>
Here’s a tip:<span>&nbsp; </span>Press <strong>CTRL+Shift+ESC</strong>. </span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click <strong>File &gt; Run New Task</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Make sure you have a check mark beside “<strong>Create this task with administrative privileges</strong>”.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Type <strong>CMD</strong>.</span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Type the following 4 commands at the CMD prompt: </span>
</p>
</li></ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><strong>sfc /scannow</strong></span></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong><span>dism /online /cleanup-image /restorehealth</span></strong></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><strong><span>powershell</span></strong></p>
</li><li>
<p style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span><strong>Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers |Where-Object {$_.InstallLocation -like "*SystemApps*"} | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register "$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml"}
</strong></span></p>
</li></ul>
<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>Close the <strong>CMD</strong> window.</span><span>&nbsp; </span>
<p><span>Check to see if the issue is resolved. If not, restart the PC.</span></p>
<p>
</p><p><span>If the issue still persists, </span></p>
<p><span><strong>Step 2: </strong>I suggest you to create new Microsoft account and check if it helps.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>You may convert the Microsoft account to a Local account and create new&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;account using the newly created local and check if you are then able to access the Windows 10 features.</span></span><span>&nbsp;
</span></p>
<p><strong><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Method 1: To convert the account, you can do the following:</span></span></strong></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Sign in to your Microsoft account on Windows 10.</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Start&nbsp;</strong>and then&nbsp;<strong>PC settings</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Click&nbsp;<strong>Users and accounts&nbsp;</strong>and under&nbsp;<strong>Your Profile&nbsp;</strong>click&nbsp;<strong>Disconnect&nbsp;</strong>on the right of the screen.</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Enter your Microsoft account's password, and click on&nbsp;<strong>Next</strong>.</span></span></li><li><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1)"><span>Type in a Username, Password, and Password Hint that you want set for your Local account and click
<strong>Next</strong>.&nbsp;Click on&nbsp;<strong>Sign out and Finish</strong>&nbsp;button.</span></span></li></ol>

    <title>Stuck at Ctrl&#43;Alt&#43;Delete screen after Windows 10 anniversary - Microsoft Community</title>

<h2>            Stuck at Ctrl&#43;Alt&#43;Delete screen after Windows 10 anniversary update</h2>
                    <p>I've installed windows 10 anniversary on a Surface book and everything went smoothly. I've decided to installed it on my second laptop, a Lenovo X201i. When the screen Press Ctrl+Alt+Delete appears, and I push those three buttons, the screen turns blue and
 I have the dots running in circle in the middle of the screen. I can't login. I tried to push any button without any success. After a while, I'm back to the "Press Ctrl+Alt+Delete" screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How do I get out of it?</p>
<p>
</p><p>Also, during the installation, I was stuck in a black screen with the dots circle at the bottom. It was caused by my USD mouse. I unplugged all devices and the installation went smoothly. So nothing is plugged into my laptop, so I don't suspect any drivers
 issue causing this login problem.</p>

            <p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
<p>
</p><p>Actually I was quite stubborn :) and tried many reboot, once with nothing plugged in (power cable, usb, etc.), I let it rest for a few hours switched off, took out the battery, typing on the keyboard multiple combination or the password on the lock screen...</p>
<p>And after I don't know how many trial, Windows managed to get past the locked screen and present me with the login screen. From then, the installation went up and now I can use it normally. I still can't figure out what was the blocking issue.</p>
